Therefore we are in trouble,” declared Sandra Díaz, who co-chaired the completion of a global assessment of bioersity published this week.There is a dual threat to life on Earth: species loss and climate change. The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Bioersity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) ranked the main factors causing species loss: changes in land and sea use exploitation of organisms climate change pollution and invasive alien species.These are “eroding the foundations of our economies, livelihoods, food security, health and quality of life worldwide”, and climate breakdown could soon become the main driver.Nature is being destroyed at such a rate that a million species are at risk. On the day the IPBES report made headlines, Dr Allan Mee of the Golden Eagle Trust checked for sightings of the Ring Ouzel in the MacGillycuddy’s Reeks in Co Kerry, one of just two of its remaining habitats in Ireland. “No birds located. Sad but likely witnessing local extinction of the species, once found in 28 Irish counties,” he tweeted. Pádraic Fogarty of the Irish Wildlife Trust replied: “This is mass extinction unfolding before our eyes.”How is the potentially lethal cocktail of bioersity loss and climate disruption going to impact on coming generations in contrasting parts of the globe? Equally, what does it mean for an animal that dominates the Irish landscape (the cow), and the majestic lion, not critically endangered yet rapidly disappearing?The baby born in IrelandConscious of what the next generation is facing, Australian Jim Scheer helped set up the FridaysForFuture climate action movement in Ireland, which is driven by young people. As for the babies of today, “their freedom is limited”, he believes. As a child, “the most I had to worry about was, ‘is there air in the tyres of my bike?’” he says.They are facing a whole different world of realities, a place where the First World problem of “where will I go on my holidays?” may be replaced by “where is my next meal coming from?”The issues weigh heavily on the current generation of young people, he believes, which is why “coming together to grieve” – a feature of recent protests – matters, and is part of telling the truth. There is much frustration too at the inaction of elders.“Uncertain” is the future of that child, says climate activist Dr Lorna Gold. Hope is emerging through the climate movement but, looking at the timelines required for transformational shift, there is “more and more uncertainty”.Children growing up in Ireland will be relatively protected, by location, wealth and assets they will have access to, “but even in the best-case scenario, it will be a diminished world.”This will be due to loss of species and a more complicated world, disrupted by climate and associated conflict, where Dr Gold fears the freedom to explore and travel in relative peace is undermined. It’s a place of learning from the internet rather than real life. The pluses will be better local connectedness with “their own earth” and nearby food production.That Irish child will never hear the corncrake or the curlew, says climatologist Prof John Sweeney, and, as they grow, they will be confronted with hard choices on lifestyle and mobility. The fossil fuel-driven car will be forced out by regulation, he says, but different ways of getting off the island, for example, will be needed if aviation does not overcome its emissions issues.By mid-century, most will live in green cities with an almost total absence of the private car. The transport revolution will be in urban areas but slower to come to the countryside until battery technology improves, Sweeney notes.A near zero-carbon world will mean less air pollution. Clean energy in their home and workplace will mainly come from offshore wind.A downside will be more extreme weather events attributable to climate change more intense storms and rainfall, increased flooding with sea level rises – and yet water shortages in summer.The child born today in Ireland – and the adult they become – will cope far better than their counterpart elsewhere.The developing world babyA baby born today in a developing country, on the other hand, will be at the frontline of climate disruption, says Christian Aid Ireland policy and advocacy adviser Jennifer Higgins. They will have to contend with stronger cyclones, warmer days and nights, more unpredictable rains and longer heatwaves.“Here in Ireland we will have the resources and ability to adapt and deal with these unprecedented weather events, but in many parts of the world, going to Tesco to stock up on sliced pan won’t be a possibility.”They will be the ones who will suffer the worst consequences of our inaction on climate change. “Sustained periods of unseasonably heavy rain can have a damaging impact on agriculture, causing the loss of topsoil and serious nutrient leaching,” says Higgins.In Ireland, save for the odd hosepipe ban, water is always on tap for domestic, industrial and agricultural use. “But in the developing world, where most people depend on agriculture to earn a living or just stay alive, it’s a scarce and precious resource.”Those living in coastal regions will suffer a loss of coral reefs, which half a billion people rely on for fish. For those born among indigenous communities in tropical rainforests, not only will they lose their homeland – already being eroded by increasing industrialisation – but there will be loss of habitat that acts as the lungs of the earth and regulates rainfall.Children will be most susceptible to the increasing diseases that a changing climate will leave in its wake, she adds. Their education may be disrupted when schools are used as shelters when disaster hits their communities.If temperatures increase in already hot areas, it will diminish scarce resources to sustain life and will force many to become refugees.But this may “dwarf numbers caused by conflict or political and economic necessity. When their land becomes uninhabitable because of drought, flood or sea-level rise, they will have to seek a safer place to live,” Higgins predicts.It may be a world where techniques such as conservation agriculture transform crop production and smartphone technology helps drive rural economies backed by deployment of cheap solar PV. But extreme weather events will continue to threaten food production, as seen with recent cyclones in southern Africa.Gold fears a business-as-usual approach means such circumstances can become an intractable problem very quickly, and says solutions are beyond most communities on cost grounds. Therefore the child is facing increased malnutrition, chronic hunger, dependency on external aid, and political instability – an existence marked by inequality and injustice.The IPBES report starkly outlines how indigenous peoples and the poorest are most reliant on land and sea for survival. The combination of land grabs by multinationals facilitated by corrupt governments, extreme climate events and bioersity loss add up to a very bleak future for their offspring, Gold concludes.The future of the cow Humans are not the only beings whose lives will change. The IPBES report emphasises that the effects will be felt first among animals and other living things.In Ireland, there are currently more cattle than people, and they are the most common large animal. For many, the cow (for beef and milk) is the bellwether of Irish agriculture and rural life. For others, it’s the problem because of associated carbon emissions.Teagasc’s head of communications, Eric Donald, says cattle numbers are currently a matter for inidual farmers. With no quotas, no policy instruments are in place. In future we are likely to have fewer beef and more dairy cattle.On emissions, Donald says there is wide acceptance of the need to implement mitigation measures – a process is already in train.Having a grass-based system to feed those cattle will be critical to sustainable farms from an environmental, economic and social perspective, Donald adds. Ireland will need to find export markets for 80 to 90 per cent of its product. Meat consumption may decrease on an inidual basis and there may be a shift to plant-based diets, but increased population growth will mean “demand won’t drop significantly”.But cattle will have to compete for space due to a more erse range of crops, land being used for bioenergy and afforestation (increasingly native woodlands and not just on marginal land) that will act as important carbon sinks, and hedgerows ensuring better bioersity and pollinator capacity.To question beef consumption may currently be an Irish “no-no”, but the reality is the consumers of tomorrow will be confronted by a wide range of new plant and synthetic proteins that will taste surprisingly good and be cheaper, which is likely to mean less red meat is consumed – in line with health guidelines.Eric Donald defends the pursuit of higher genetic quality as a means of increasing efficiency and lowering emissions, especially “because lifetime productivity is better”. With extending grazing seasons, it’s the key measure in improving farm sustainability guidelines. It also complements changes in fertiliser use and slurry management.But John Sweeney says the Irish cow is “reaching limits in terms of genetics”. Like pedigree dogs, they are less able to cope with change and stress compared with native species.Unquestionably, there will be fewer of them, he believes, “if we want to maintain bioersity for future generations”.Expansion in the cattle population has coincided with deterioration in water quality, with widespread glyphosate contamination (one study has found 20 per cent of Irish adults have traces of the herbicide in their urine), nitrates pollution and an emerging ammonia problem.“Continued expansion of the national herd is not compatible with this report. That’s where the crux comes.”The future of the lionJennifer Higgins joins in a lament for so many endangered mammals.Of all species threatened, IWT campaign officer Pádraic Fogarty is shocked by the latest indicators for hippos, giraffes and lions. In particular, “it would be an absolutely travesty if lions were to go extinct . . . The magnificent animal has permeated our culture and imagination, from children’s stories to the pillars on Trafalgar Square.”But maps don’t lie. In 1950 there were 400,000 lions in the wild. Today there are 23,000-39,000 lions in all of Africa, which is “extremely low” in global terms, when once they lived in Ancient Greece and North Africa, and became extinct in Greece only around 100BC.Outside of southern Africa, numbers of lions in 23 unfenced reserves in 11 countries are estimated to have dropped by 62 per cent between 1993 and 2014. Asia is home to a small subpopulation in the Indian state of Gujarat, where numbers are growing, but it’s just a pin on the globe.“There is no data to say that lions are about to disappear, but their populations are shrinking fast,” he explains. The species is classified as vulnerable but the slide into the “endangered” and then “critically endangered” categories looms, while “threatened with extinction” is applied to its current status.For Fogarty, the same pressures apply to other mammals, but the lion’s wellbeing is further undermined by gametrophy hunting and false western-world notions that it is somehow good for population numbers. All told, we are facing a scenario where lions will “shrink to a few corners of the planet”.What to doThis is not going to be sorted by putting bird tables in back gardens. The Ipbes report shows nature-based solutions can help bring “transformative change”, but there is a greater systemic problem.In the past 50 years, the human population has doubled, the global economy has grown nearly four-fold, and global trade has grown tenfold, together driving up the demands for energy, food and materials.Thinking that endless economic growth is possible and not valuing the essential services provided by nature is a delusion leading to catastrophe, Sweeney believes.“Until we get away from euros and cents and GDP, we will be in a cul-de-sac . . . Unless we rethink how we value the services provided by the natural world and include them explicitly in a wellbeing measure, we delude ourselves that a sustainable future is possible.”That was the core message in a submission this week to EU leaders meeting on the future of Europe by the European Environmental Bureau (EEB) and more than 200 academics, including John Sweeney, policy experts and civil society groups.There is an onus too on iniduals to act, according to EEB vice president Attracta Uí Bhroin. “It’s not enough for us to sit on the sofa and watch David Attenborough’s latest breathtaking and terrifying documentary and shake our heads. Every politician coming near your front door needs to know environmental sustainability is your priority, and must be Europe’s priority.”Fogarty hopes people now see the connections between climate breakdown and mass extinction, that they are two sides of the same coin. “We have all of the solutions to hand, but what we’ve been lacking is any sense of urgency to get on with it.”He senses momentum moving in the right direction, though the lack of a response from the Taoiseach or any Government minister “makes me feel that they are still hoping it’s an issue that will go away. We can’t really afford this level of disengagement when we need to be getting on with things.”Scheer is brutally frank about future voters born today. “I don’t think people get a choice of what games they play.”They will have to be focused on survival. “It feels as we have handed them a shitstorm.”As for the current generation, too many are stuck in business-as-usual mode. There is a need to raise consciousness quickly. “Ignorance is not a choice” given the IPBES report. “It’s not an opinion, it’s scientific. It’s happening.”Kevin O\u0027Sullivan is Environment and Science Editor and former Editor of The "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3905165.1558898443!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"fresh plea for border poll as survey shows 65 back united ireland","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tCampaigners for a united Ireland have called on the Government to prepare the ground for a Border poll in the coming years in the wake of the new survey Campaigners for a united Ireland have called on the Government to prepare the ground for a Border poll in the coming years in the wake of a new survey showing strong support for the idea.An RTÉTG4 exit poll conducted on Friday showed 65 per cent of all voters were in favour of a united Ireland, with 19 per cent against, and 15 per cent refusing to answer. When undecided voters were excluded, the proposal enjoyed 77 per cent support.“We need to address the fears of the loss of identity and of land among unionist farmers. If that’s not addressed comprehensively that will be utilised by politicians for their own ends.”He said Brexit, coupled with demographic trends that could leave unionists in a voting minority by the end of the decade, increased the likelihood of a united Ireland in the next 10 to 15 years. Failing to address issues of identity and representation before such a poll could lead to a damaging, even violent, fallout.“Policy neglect seldom goes unpunished. The current policy neglect of the Government is reckless…they’re not giving a vision of what the future would look like, a new vision of a united Ireland.” DemandMeanwhile, the Irish Language Commissioner said the Department of Education was failing to meet the demand for Irish language schooling as indicated by responses to another question in the exit poll.The survey showed that 34 per cent of those polled made first mention of the provision of Gaelscoileanna as important to the use, promotion and protection of the Irish language. Just over half of those polled made a reference to it.“This issue was formally investigated by my office in 2017, and is a matter of grave concern that the department has not adequately advanced measures to ensure that the needs of parents are met in the future.” The exit poll found that 60 per cent of those surveyed rated the importance of the Irish language as seven or higher on a scale where 10 means “extremely important”.Irish language TVAfter the provision of Gaelscoileanna, the provision of Irish language TV was cited as the second most popular choice for protecting and promoting the language by exit poll respondents. Some 14 per cent identified it first. The poll, Mr Ó Domhnaill said, “shows the importance of the visibility of Irish, which makes the almost complete eradication of Irish language programming from the TV schedules of RTÉ quite concerning”."},{"url":null,"title":"d%C3%BAn laoghaire rathdown county council remarkable success for green party","story":" The big story in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown - as with elsewhere across the State - was the remarkable success of the Green Party whose candidates either toped the poll or were elected on the first count in all five of the Local Electoral Areas (LEA) where they put a candidate forward. So emphatic was the breakthrough that the party may well be ruing not putting more candidates into the field in those LEAs. The party easily topped the poll in Dundrum, Blackrock and Dún Laoghaire, with all three of their candidates in those LEAs elected on the first count and all with substantial surpluses to spare. Daniel Dunne was the first the party member home safe and he was quickly followed by Séafra Ó’Faoláin in Blackrock and by Ossian Smyth in Dun Laoghaire. Una Power from Kiliney-Shankill joined her Green colleagues shortly later as did Deirdre Ni Fhlionn in Glencullen-Sandyford. As she watched the results coming in the Green Party’s deputy leader Catherine Martin said the party’s breakthrough in the Local Elections was “beyond our wildest expectations” although she did ad that her extensive canvassing in the weeks leading up to the vote had convinced her the party would do well.She said that she had repeatedly heard people on the doorsteps saying the climate crisis and the need for action was becoming the single most important deciding factor in how they were planning to vote and she added that she was looking forward to a meeting of all the new Green Party councillors next week.It was a bad day at the office for left wing parties with both Solidarity People Before Profit and Sinn Féin suffering losses. Richard Boyd Barrett blamed a poor turnout in traditionally strong PBB areas and suggested that a disappointing election for left-wing parties was down to demoralised voters. Fianna Fáil councillor and former cabinet minister Mary Hanafin has said the Government will have little choice but to call a general election this year, rather than weaken its positions by allowing a series of potentially damaging by-elections take place before going to the country next year. “It has to be this year,” she told The . “The Government does not have time on its hands because of the by-elections and why would its wait for those to happen with all the potential they will have for a protest vote that would weaken its position.”Ms Hanafin, who was elected on the first count in the Blackrock Local Election Area of Dún Laoghaire Rathdown said the significant things about the local elections in her area was the “complete wipeout of Sinn Fein” and the loss of one of the People Before Profit seats.Fine Gael held its own with one of the more notable success coming from Bangladeshi-born MBA graduate Kazi Ahmed who campaigned for six hours a day while fasting for Ramadan before being elected as a councillor for Gleccullen-Sandyford on his first time of asking.(First preference votes: candidates elected in bold)Full results and in depth analysis of the local elections"},{"url":null,"title":"dublin city council chu sets the pace with green party making gains in all areas","story":"A relative unknown, Hazel Chu became the first councillor elected in Dublin city and the first Green elected nationally in what will be a bumper day for the party, and the best local election result in its history.Party leader Eamon Ryan said he was “thrilled” by Chu’s success in her election at the first count in the five-seater Pembroke ward with 4,069 votes - almost double the quota. He predicted the party would secure eight or even nine seats in the city of the 10 candidates the Greens ran for the city’s 11 wards.Asked if the party should have run more candidates in the city, Mr Ryan said it certainly could have run a second in Pembroke. “We could have run two here and we would have won two here.”With the possibility that the Greens could be the largest party on the council Mr Ryan said their strategy for the coming term would be “about more than just iding up mayors and chairs” and would see the party pushing for real environmental measures to be taken at council level.Chu born in Ireland, to parents from Hong Kong, is the partner of sitting Green city councillor Patrick Costello. She said it was “a bit overwhelming but great privilege” to be elected.Two Green candidates who were celebrating in the RDS were Michael Pidgeon and Hazel Chu, both of whom are poll toppers.Hazel Chu topped the poll in the Pembroke area with more than 2,000 votes above the quota, told The : “Politics was never part of what we do. Both my parents were kitchen workers, they washed dishes. It wasn’t until I met my partner Patrick Costello who is, hopefully, a councillor in Kimmage Rathmines because he is topping the poll, that I decided to get involved in the Greens. I decided you know what, I’ll put my name forward.”Mr Pidgeon said at one stage he expected to have to fight for the last seat instead of topping the poll. “I am a little bit in shock. I’m really humbled. We thought we would be scrapping away for the last seat here. There hasn’t been a Green councillor here for 25 years,” he said. “There is a part of me that’s aware that we worked really hard on the campaign. This isn’t a personal vote, it’s not even really a party vote. It’s a vote about the issues the Government are not tackling. From what I can tell, looking at the areas where we got the votes, they were coming in from areas including areas that wouldn’t have been traditionally Green at all.”French-born Sophie Nicoullaud was elected for the Green Party in the Ballyfermot-Drimnagh Dublin City Council ward, as yet another first time candidate brought in on a surge of popularity for the party.Sitting Sinn Féin councillor Daithí Doolan topped the poll in the ward, and was followed by Solidarity-People Before Profit candidate Hazel de Nortúin on the eight count. A strong number of transfers for Ms Nicoullaud, who moved to Ireland in 2006, saw her take the third seat in the ninth and final count.Independent councillor Vincent Jackson retained his seat, finishing behind Ms Nicoullaud. It was initially announced that Michael Jackson had been elected to the council, a mistake quickly corrected by the returning office team. Fianna Fáil’s Daithí de Róiste took the last seat in the ward, beating the Labour Party candidate Michael O’Sullivan by 178 votes.The Greens knocked another one out of the park with Claire Bryne, one of their three sitting councillors, topping the poll in the South East Inner City. Byrne was a comfortable winner with 1,961 first preferences ahead of the 1,144 quota in this five seater.Sinn Fein’s Chris Andrews, once a Fianna Fáil councillor, but now a full council term in Sinn Féin, took a seat after the fourth count.

It’s real and households are talking about with their children.”Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil have done well in this constituency despite predictions and both increased their numbers from six to seven seats, and enough councillors in both the Dublin Fingal and Dublin West Dáil constituencies to help in the general election.Labour has also done well and gained an extra two seats to take six, with four in Dublin Fingal and two in Dublin West.Robert O’Donoghue, who returned to the campaign after open heart surgery, topped the poll in Rush-Lusk. He said that the party had worked hard and the electorate recognised it.But their gains have cost Independents who have plunged from 11 to five. Sinn Féin had six seats last time around, but has three now.Solidarity People Before Profit had three but is down to one, a new candidate in Mulhuddart, John Burtchaell.So they are attempting to wrest that seven-vote advantage held by Sinn Féin who need that Swords seat to retain one councillor in the Dublin Fingal Dáil constituency.An initial recheck of the two candidates’ approximately 850 votes has since gone into a candidate-by-candidate recheck in alphabetical order.Sinn Féin’s Paul Donnelly topped the poll in the Ongar area, was elected on the first count and exceeded the quota. A new party councillor and first-time candidate Breda Hanaphy, who decided to run as her children were grown up, secured a seat in Blanchardstown-Mulhuddart. And Treacy Natalie also retained her seat in Castleknock.

It would take a lot to move me out of it. You know if we have freedom of worship and freedom of choice in life.”She said she was sure “there are enough people of sense and sensibility who do not want to be fighting with their neighbours or their friends to want to have it properly united”.Addressing the Stormont impasse, she said it was “abominable” for MLAs to be taking salaries when they were not doing their full role.She believes politicians need to “lay aside a lot of the baggage they are carrying”.“People are crying out for help and they are failing them,” she said. “I would say cut out the petty nonsense.”On a difficult relationship with the Free Presbyterian Church her husband founded and was later ostracised from, Mrs Paisley said she forgives them as a Christian but finds it “difficult to deal with”: “Ian was grieved and I think maybe it shortened his life.” "},{"url":null,"title":"kerry county council three healy raes elected on first counts","story":"Three members of the Healy-Rae family were elected to Kerry County Council on the first counts in their respective electoral areas.Johnny Healy-Rae, the eldest son of TD Danny Healy-Rae, was one of three candidates elected on the first count in the Kenmare district.

Photograph: Brian LawlessPATaoiseach Leo Varadkar has said he cannot rule out an early general election but said he was not going to call one in the next couple of days or weeks. Speaking on RTÉ’s Six One News from the RDS count centre he said: “If this was about maximising the prospect for my party Fine Gael, we would have gone to the country a year ago in the aftermath of the referendum when we were on 35 per cent in the polls. “I have never put the party first when it comes to these issues: putting the country first, there are issues that we need to deal with,” he added. “ Brexit, getting the broadband contract through, putting together a budget and of course there are by-elections. All those four factors and others are at play but I don’t intend to be calling into Áras an Úachtaráin in the next couple of days,” Mr Varadkar said. However asked if he was ruling out an early general election, Mr Varadkar added: “I can’t rule it out. First of all it is not necessarily my decision. Others could pull the plug on the government.“If I am the one to seek a dissolution, I have to bear in mind other factors. Not ruling but not a prospect in the next couple of days or weeks.”Later, Mr Varadkar told reporters that Dáil arithmetic may dictate the timing of a general election.“This is all about making sure that we have a functioning Government, so as long as the Government can function and function well, we can get our job done and get our agenda through, well then there is no need for an election but if that becomes a problem well then that changes things.“I have been asked questions about when the Dáil is going to be dissolved for nearly two years now. At some point, someone is going to have to start believing me. “My focus is on delivery, getting the job done, keeping the economy strong and making sure people have jobs to go, more delivery on housing and healthcare and implementing our climate action plan, that is our focus.”“I have never seen the local elections as the time to make a decision about whether you want to have a general election — you never use local elections as a barometer for a general election – I’m around long enough to know people vote differently at locals, they definitely vote differently in European.Mr Martin admitted that Fianna Fáil’s continued support for the minority Fine Gael administration had proved problematic on the doorstep with many voters urging the party to withdraw from confidence and supply deal but he believed they had done the right thing by continuing to honour it.“It is challenging out there on the doorstep for us with the confidence and supply agreement – a lot of people are fed up with the government, they are fed up with the housing situation and the health system, they know they have done nothing on climate change and that has been challenging for us.On Micheál Martin’s promise to underwrite the Government for one more budget, Mr Varadkar said:”I can only take him at his word and he has said that he will continue to honour the confidence and supply arrangement until Brexit is resolved but we also need to bear in mind the possibility that Brexit may not be resolved for a very long time. The next deadline is October 31st, who knows if there will be another one?”Under the confidence and supply deal Fianna Fáil agrees to support the minority Fine Gael-led Government by supporting them or abstaining in Dáil votes. This allows the Government to get the annual budget through the Dáil and stay in power. Meanwhile Fianna Fáil councillor and former cabinet minister Mary Hanafin has said the Government will have little choice but to call a general election this year rather than weaken its positions by allowing a series of potentially damaging by-elections to take place before going to the country next year. “It has to be this year,” she told The . “The Government does not have time on its hands because of four by-elections that will have to take place and why would its wait for those to happen with all the potential they will have for a protest vote that would weaken its position terribly.”Ms Hanfin was elected on the first count in the Blackrock LEA of Dun Laoghaire Rathdown.

Photograph:  EPAThibault VandermerschMarine Le Pen’s populist nationalist Rassemblement National won the EU parliamentary elections in France with 23.3 per cent of the vote, according to exit polls published by IpsosSopra Steria on Sunday night.President Emmanuel Macron’s La République En Marche (LREM) came in second, with an estimated 22.1 per cent. Though expected, the results were a severe blow to Mr Macron’s ambition of seizing the leadership of Europe and modernising the French economy.“The French placed the list of the Rassemblement National in the lead,” Ms Le Pen said to cheers by RN faithful. “I see it as the victory of the people who have this evening retaken power, with pride and dignity.”Ms Le Pen said Mr Macron “must assume the consequences since he put his personal credit in the balance by making this a referendum on his policies and his person. He has no choice but to dissolve the National Assembly and chose a more democratic electoral system that would be more representative of opinion”.It will be difficult for Mr Macron to move ahead with planned reforms of France’s unemployment insurance and pension systems in coming months. TransformationMs Le Pen and Mr Philippe both spoke of the transformation of French politics that began with the presidential election two years ago. The conservative Les Républicains and the Socialists, who ruled France for half a century after the second World War, both came in at well under 10 per cent on Sunday night.“The decline of the old parties and the bi-polarisation between the RN and LREM confirms that the new ision between nationalists and globalists that now dominates our political life is a lasting phenomenon,” Ms Le Pen said. She listed deserters from left and right who have joined RN, and invited “all patriots” to support the party in next year’s municipal elections, and in regional and departmental elections in 2021.Mr Philippe said he could not be indifferent to the rise of the far right, “which election after election becomes more deeply rooted in the French political landscape, to the point of becoming one of the main political forces...It is not enough to speak of anger, rejection or crisis. The extreme right is consolidating its position, and many of our compatriots have the impression it is time to turn inward and adopt extreme solutions.”The ecologist party EELV made a breakthrough, coming in third at an estimated 13.1 per cent of the vote, ahead of the Socialists and the far-left France Unbowed. ThresholdMany predicted that the Socialists would not even reach the 5 per cent threshold required to send an MEP to the European Parliament. The former ruling party allied itself with Place Publique, led by the essayist Raphael Glucksmann. He was obviously pleased that the alliance won an estimated 6.7 per cent of the vote, equal to the score of France Unbowed.It was a huge comedown for Jean-Luc Mélenchon, the leader of France Unbowed, who won 19.6 per cent in the first round of the presidential election in 2017.Mr Macron had attempted to play his “green card” by convening an “ecological defence council” last week and promising to abandon plans for an open-air gold mine in French Guyana, a long-standing demand of the EELV."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3904827.1558880562!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"maureen dowd crazy is as crazy does","story":"US president Donald Trump has called US house of representatives speaker Nancy Pelosi crazy and a mess after Pelosi claimed Trump stormed out of a meeting in the White House.

I think about how cool it will be to see Idris Elba resume his role as a world-weary London homicide detective in Luther. I think about what a harrowing tale Patrick Radden Keefe has woven in Say Nothing: a True Story of Murder and Memory in Northern Ireland.But once I’m completely awake, a gravitational pull takes hold and I am once more bedevilled by our preposterous president.I flip on the TV and gird for the endless stream of vitriol coming from the White House, bracing for another day of overflowing, overlapping, overwrought news stories about President Donald Trump. I’m sapped before I rise.As mayor Pete Buttigieg said on his Fox town hall about the national Trump preoccupation, “It is the nature of grotesque things that you can’t look away.”My head hurts, puzzling over whether Trump is just a big blowhard who’s flailing around, or a sinister genius laying traps to get himself impeached to animate the base ahead of the election.A minute ago, we were fixated on the half of the Mueller report that vividly details how Trump tried to shut down and hinder the Mueller investigation. But now the president has triggered the media’s shock collar, so everyone is fixated on how he gave William Barr vast new powers to use the intelligence agencies to investigate the investigators.Daily onslaughtJust as Trump once wore out contractors, bankers, lawyers and businesspeople in New York with his combative, insulting and wayward ways, now he’s wearing out the political crowd, as he tries to beat everybody here into submission with his daily, even hourly, onslaught of outrage piled upon outrage.Journalists must not become inured to Trump’s outlandish, transgressive behaviour. Mitch McConnell, Barr and almost everyone else in the GOP have made themselves numb to his abhorrent actions because of self-interest.But for those who are concerned about the scarring of the American psyche, it’s exhausting to find the vocabulary to keep explaining, over and over, how beyond the pale and out of the norm the 45th president is.How do you ratchet up from “remarkable,” “extraordinary,” “unprecedented”?What words can you use about someone who considers pardoning war criminals on Memorial Day? Who wants to make it simpler for adoption agencies to bar same-sex couples? Who circumvents Congress to complete arms deals to benefit the same Saudis who are clearly culpable in the case of the dismembered Washington Post columnist?Buttigieg and Nancy Pelosi have both mastered the art of puncturing Trump – far better than his Republican primary debate rivals did.“I don’t have a problem standing up to somebody who was working on season seven of Celebrity Apprentice when I was packing my bags for Afghanistan,” Buttigieg told the Post’s Robert Costa, saying he took a dim view of Trump’s bone-spurs excuse to get out of serving in Vietnam.Pelosi winds Trump up when she drips condescension worthy of a Jane Austen grande dame, saying she will pray for the president or pleading for someone to stage an intervention with the poor soul.After Pelosi remarked that the president was engaged in a cover-up, Trump dynamited his own meeting with “Crazy Nancy,” as he called her. His ‘I’m not crazy, you’re crazy’ rebuttal to Pelosi echoed his ‘I’m not a puppet, you’re a puppet’ line to Hillary Clinton during the debate.Trump tweeted a video of Pelosi that was manipulated to make her look as if she were slurring her words.“Well, I don’t know about the videos,” the president told reporters as he left on his trip to Japan.Destructive“He does outrageous, nasty, destructive things, knowing full well he’s crossing a line, and then he pretends he didn’t,” said Trump biographer Tim O’Brien. “He has spent five decades going to gossip columnists, radio shows, TV interviews and newspapers to stick a knife into almost anybody who crosses his path that he doesn’t like and he revels in it. There is something amazing in the Energiser Bunny aspect of his nastiness and his ignorance. He doesn’t care what people think about how mean or dumb he is. He just keeps going.”O’Brien said Pelosi “hit on something that is core to his con. His whole life is about the cover-up. He has covered up his academic record, his health reports, his dalliances with women, his finances, his family history. Even while he was saying he was the most transparent president in history, his treasury secretary was across town telling Congress, ‘I’m not giving you the president’s tax returns.’“One of the biggest motivating factors in Trump’s life – other than food, greed, sex and revenge – is mythmaking. Deep down, he knows he’s a pathological liar and he’s not the person he says he is. But any time anyone pierces that veil, it sends him into a rage.”It’s wearing, not letting this petulant man wear us all out. – New York Times"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/05/17/TELEMMGLPICT000147339863_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"judges given new expenses policy telegraph discovers judiciary","story":"The Ministry of Justice approved expenses including shampoo and crockery.  Lord Chief Justice, Lord Ian Burnett, pictured, claimed for multiple journeys to and from his homeMinistry of JusticeThe judiciary are to be given a new expenses policy after The Daily  found that Britain\u0027s most senior judges have claimed for crockery, shampoo and a taxi to transport ceremonial robes on taxpayer-funded expenses.Expenses data released under the Freedom of Information Act shows how some of the most high-profile members of the judiciary in England and Wales have had claims for everyday items as well first-class trains approved, even though they receive a salary of at least £180,000.At present, judges are encouraged to follow the expenses policy for Ministry of Justice (MOJ) civil servants, and the judiciary has also set out specific guidance relating to travel, accommodation and relocation....To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletMinistry of JusticeEuropean elections 2019 results live: Tories and Labour braced for losses as Brexit Party prepares for victoryEuropean elections 2019 results: Brexit Party expected to win most UK seats as official exit polls released across EuropeComment: To win back the public, we must show that we can deliver on our pledgesComment: For far too long tech companies have left children unhappy and exposed them to harm Comment: Our old friend Project Fear is back to smear Boris in this electionMichael Gove insists he can be trusted as PM as he is accused of stabbing Boris Johnson in the backLouvre intervenes in Leonardo Da Vinci row as author claims Paris gallery has said it will not refer to Salvator Mundi as being by the artistFrance\u0026#39s Le Pen declares victory over Macron in high-stakes European duelComment: The leadership race has turned into a clash of personalities when it should be about ideasComment: The next Chancellor should take the fight to Brussels with a radical, pro-growth agenda Comment: Do you want to escape to a remote and wild place?

By 2000 this figure dropped to almost 28,000.The country has now seen no new infections since 2013 and is the first nation in WHO Africa region to be declared malaria-free in more than 40 years – only  Mauritius, which achieved the goal in 1973, has also eliminated the disease in the region. “Algeria is where the malaria parasite was first discovered in humans almost a century and a half ago, and that was a significant milestone in responding to the disease,” said Dr Matshidiso Moeti WHO regional director for Africa.“Now Algeria has shown the rest of Africa that malaria can be beaten through country leadership, bold action, sound investment and science. The rest of the continent can learn from this experience,” she said. War on malaria | On the brink of a breakthrough?Algeria\u0027s success has been due to a combination of free malaria diagnosis and treatment and a well-trained health workforce. Similar factors have helped Argentina eradicate the parasitic disease – the second country in South America to do so following Paraguay last year. “Argentina reported the last indigenous case in 2010 and has demonstrated the commitment, the capacity within its health, laboratory and surveillance systems, and the necessary financing to prevent the re-establishment of malaria within the country”, said Dr Carissa F. Etienne, director of the WHO Pan American Health Organization.“I am sure that Argentina will serve as an inspiration and as an example for other countries of the Americas to achieve the elimination of malaria in the coming years,” she added. India and Rwanda have made huge progress in tackling malariaAccording to the 2018 World Malaria Report, China is also close to eradicating the disease and Rwanda, Ethiopia and Pakistan have reduced infection levels. The countries are a highlights in an otherwise gloomy global picture. The countries with the highest disease burden are all moving backwards, including Nigeria, DRC, Mozambique and Uganda.“The news that Algeria and Argentina have been declared malaria free is a remarkable achievement for both countries,” said Dr Abdourahmane Diallo, CEO of the RBM Partnership to End Malaria.“As well as saving precious lives and strengthening health systems, malaria-free status provides external economic benefits for these countries enabling them to free up resources to address other health and development priorities and improve worker productivity and school attendance.“Other countries now have two more nations that serve as examples of how elimination can be achieved,” Dr Diallo added.Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security European elections 2019 results: Brexit Party expected to win most UK seats as official exit polls released across EuropeComment: For far too long tech companies have left children unhappy and exposed them to harm Comment: Our old friend Project Fear is back to smear Boris in this electionEuropean elections 2019 results live: Tories and Labour braced for losses as Brexit Party prepares for victoryMichael Gove insists he can be trusted as PM as he is accused of stabbing Boris Johnson in the backLouvre intervenes in Leonardo Da Vinci row as author claims Paris gallery has said it will not refer to Salvator Mundi as being by the artistFrance\u0026#39s Le Pen declares victory over Macron in high-stakes European duelComment: The leadership race has turned into a clash of personalities when it should be about ideasComment: The next Chancellor should take the fight to Brussels with a radical, pro-growth agenda Comment: Do you want to escape to a remote and wild place?

The Socialist Party of former president François Hollande was on seven per cent.Another surprise was turnout, around 54 per cent according to estimates, which was far higher than the 35 per cent of 2014.Speaking after the initial results were announced, Ms Le Pen said: “I see this as a victory for the people, who with pride and dignity have taken back power.”She said Mr Macron’s defeat was “political and personal”.The president, she claimed, had no other choice but to dissolve parliament - a highly unlikely prospect.But Mr Macron\u0027s office defended the result, saying it was an honourable score and proof that the presidential majority is holding firm.We have never seen a party in power with a score in European elections this high compared to presidential elections, the Elysee said.While the result was a blow for Mr Macron, it was not quite the humiliation that final polls before the vote had suggested. One survey on Friday had put the RN on 25 percent, up 1.5 points in a week, with LREM and its allies stable on 22.5 percent.Government insiders had suggested that a loss of three to four points could force him to enact a major cabinet reshuffle or even change his prime minister. That now looks unlikely.But two years into his five-year term, defeat could hamper his domestic pro-business reforms and taint his bid to be the self-styled champion of greater EU integration.Last week, he warned that the bloc was facing an “existential threat” from nationalists bent on unpicking the European project.While the far-Right succeeded in coming first, its list led by 23-year-old Jordan Bardella was on course to win less of the vote than in  2014 when the National Front - the party’s name then - came top with 25 percent.Comment: To win back the public, we must show that we can deliver on our pledgesEuropean elections 2019 results: Brexit Party expected to win most UK seats as official exit polls released across EuropeComment: For far too long tech companies have left children unhappy and exposed them to harm Comment: Our old friend Project Fear is back to smear Boris in this electionEuropean elections 2019 results live: Tories and Labour braced for losses as Brexit Party prepares for victoryMichael Gove insists he can be trusted as PM as he is accused of stabbing Boris Johnson in the backLouvre intervenes in Leonardo Da Vinci row as author claims Paris gallery has said it will not refer to Salvator Mundi as being by the artistComment: The next Chancellor should take the fight to Brussels with a radical, pro-growth agenda Comment: The leadership race has turned into a clash of personalities when it should be about ideasComment: Do you want to escape to a remote and wild place?

As a lifelong resident of Amderma, a hardscrabble former mining and military town perched on the edge of the Arctic Ocean 1,200 miles northeast of Moscow, Mr Prikazchikov has seen more than a hundred polar bears first-hand. He took a quick video on his phone, yelled out the window so the bear would keep moving and put the kettle on for tea.“It\u0027s par for the course,” he said. “They were always here. They are the masters here, so we don\u0027t conflict with them, and they don\u0027t show aggression toward us.”The “tsar of the Arctic” has indeed always been part of life in Amderma. It features in the folktales of indigenous Nenets reindeer herders, and old photographs show Soviet soldiers feeding condensed milk to polar bears well within reach of their razor-sharp two-inch claws. Some residents even admitted to having poached the animals in the hungry 1990s, when a hide was said to fetch $10,000.But as global warming melts the polar sea ice, these marine hunters are increasingly being forced onto land. The risk is rising of conflict with the humans, who are also arriving in greater numbers as Russia develops oil and gas deposits and expands its military capabilities in the Arctic. In response, coastal towns have started to organise “polar bear patrols” to scare off intruders with snowmobiles and flares. A polar bear looks into a window in Amderma Almost every resident of Amderma has seen a polar bear, even the youngest, and many are surprisingly blasé about the predators\u0027 presence. Anastasia Popovich, now 15, was walking home with friends in May 2016 when they ran into a bear cub they initially mistook for a huge white dog.“The white thing turned, and we understood that it wasn\u0027t a dog,” she remembered. “We saw the cub turn toward us and we froze in horror.”The girls tried to hide in a nearby abandoned building but couldn\u0027t open the door, so they ran to the guard booth at a vehicle depot. Her father, a member of the local polar bear patrol, had had an even closer call when he came face to face with a bear coming out of his fishing hut once the year before that. Luckily, the creature immediately ran from his shouts.“It was terrifying just because it was such a surprise. I just yelled,” Yury Popovich said. “If he didn\u0027t like me he could have hit me with a paw or grabbed me.”Amderma polar bear patrol member Yury Popovich dries his catch from a recent fishing expeditionEight polar bears have come into Amderma already this year, compared to five all last year, according to Eduard Davletshin, the head of the patrol. He grew up in a house on the seashore frequented by bears and would sometimes had to stay home from school because one was lurking outside. But he said there have been more bears in Amderma in the past decade.“They used to go on the ice to hunt seals,” he said. “Now there\u0027s no ice, they have no choice. They go along the shore, and the town is in the way.”Although it is the world\u0027s largest land predator, the polar bear actually prefers to spend its time on sea ice and is classified as the “sea bear,” or “Ursus maritimus”. Called the “white bear” in Russian, it blends in almost seamlessly as it sneaks up to breathing holes to snatch harp or spotted seals, as shown in David Attenborough\u0027s Our Planet series last month.Bears often swim more than 100 miles to reach ice packs and can spend almost all of their lives at sea. That is changing, however, with global warming.A curious polar bear visits the Amderma meteorological stationIn February, the restricted-access military town of Belushya Guba across the Kara Strait from Amderma declared a state of emergency following an “invasion” of 52 polar bears. CCTV cameras caught one polar bear walking the hallway to a young family\u0027s flat. “The emotions are indescribable, adrenaline, terror and the question \u0027what to do,\u0027” postal worker Nadezhda Kireyeva told The  at the time.Experts blamed the invasion on the lack of sea ice and an open rubbish dump where groups of bears were seen foraging.The predators departed when sea ice finally formed off the coast in late February. But that can hardly be counted on for the future. Meteorologist Andrei Mikushin examines a snowmobile seat that was recently bitten up by a hungry polar bearThis year, Arctic sea ice hit a new record low for April, and a study predicted that the Arctic Ocean would become ice-free in the summer within the next 20 years.In Amderma, the “fast ice” that is firmly attached to the coast has been forming later and not growing as thick, according to meteorologist Nelli Shuvalova, who has been measuring the ice here twice a day since 1981. This year, the maximum extent of the fast ice was 10 kilometres—some years it has stretched to the horizon 26 kilometres away—and its maximum thickness was 60 centimetres. “That\u0027s really small,” Ms Shuvalova said. “The ice is thin for bears.”“We have a catastrophic situation with the fast ice,” polar bear expert Ilya Mordvintsev said while visiting Amderma last week. “When the ice comes south in the winter, so do the bears. When it recedes the majority don\u0027t make it back onto the ice.”These stragglers tend to head north along the coast in search of ice—which means towns like Amderma are now essentially located on a polar bear highway.Amderma was home to as many as 20,000 people before a fighter jet regiment moved away in 1993. Today it has just 300 residents, though its town hall hopes to boost its fortunes by attracting back Russian troops, as well as scientists and tourists.Stranded polar bears often head north looking for ice, a route that leads them through AmdermaEither way, those townspeople still here are mostly determined to stay, and 25 children attend the town school—which is located next to a windswept beach frequented by bears. Whenever one comes into the town, the school calls parents to take their children home early. Other Arctic settlements are growing quickly. Belushya Guba, with a population of 2,000, is developing a new military facilities, airstrip and port, and there are plans to mine lead and zinc nearby. Vladimir Putin cut the ribbon on the Sabetta gas plant on the northern coast in 2017. Moscow has also revamped several Arctic bases in recent years. Two schoolchildren laugh on near the Amderma administration buildingAll that increases the risk of human-bear run-ins, which can turn violent if the animal is ill or hungry—or is provoked by boorish behaviour. An oil and gas worker was killed by a polar bear on Franz Josef Land in 2016, and a meteorologist was killed there in 2011. While polar bears can weigh upward of 1,300 pounds and run 25 miles per hour or faster, they aren\u0027t typically aggressive toward humans and can usually be scared off by loud noises and moving vehicles. “To avoid instances of harm to people and shooting of polar bears as problematic animals, it\u0027s better to take action creating these bear patrols that could avoid such conflict situations,” Mr Mordvintsev said. Amderma decided to move its rubbish dump after the \u0026#39polar bear invasion\u0026#39 in nearby Belushya Guba in FebruaryAmderma hunters started a polar bear patrol in 2017 with flares, rubber bullets and flashbangs from the regional government and a quad cycle from WWF. Due to fuel problems, they more often ride their own snowmobiles. Similar groups have been started in the nearby towns of Ust-Kara and Varnek. Other measures include a CCTV system installed last year at a weather station on a nearby island, which clued in scientists to stay inside behind barred windows while a polar bear nosed around outside in February.During their visit last week, WWF and regional officials promised the Amderma patrol radios, fuel and satellite phones to upload photographs of bears. They also played top 40 dance hits to test the loudspeaker warning system, which residents have complained is too quiet and unreliable.Polar bear patrol leader Eduard Davletshin drinks tea in his kitchen overlooking the Arctic coastAt a meeting in the hall of the Soviet-built “palace of culture,” Mr Mordvintsev and WWF employees advised locals not to run from any polar bear they might see but rather back away slowly, so as not to trigger its predatory instinct.If they don\u0027t have something to bang on, they should make a “sh” sound to mimic bears\u0027 own warning vocalisations.In reality, residents said they\u0027re more afraid of Arctic foxes, which can be aggressive and infected with rabies. They often like to photograph polar bears that come—and some have even taken selfies with the creatures.Meteorologist Lyudmila Maksimova takes a selfie with a polar bearThe meeting finished with a short debate about whether scientists should try to save the polar bear at all. “The polar bear is the top of the food chain and a symbol of the Arctic,” Mr Mordvintsev said. “If there was no polar bear, what would we do here? If there was no polar bear here, would you be at peace?”The audience began murmuring before one woman came up with an answer: “It would be boring!” Please review our commenting policyComment: To win back the public, we must show that we can deliver on our pledgesEuropean elections 2019 results: Brexit Party expected to win most UK seats as official exit polls released across EuropeComment: For far too long tech companies have left children unhappy and exposed them to harm Comment: Our old friend Project Fear is back to smear Boris in this electionEuropean elections 2019 results live: Tories and Labour braced for losses as Brexit Party prepares for victoryMichael Gove insists he can be trusted as PM as he is accused of stabbing Boris Johnson in the backLouvre intervenes in Leonardo Da Vinci row as author claims Paris gallery has said it will not refer to Salvator Mundi as being by the artistFrance\u0026#39s Le Pen declares victory over Macron in high-stakes European duelComment: The leadership race has turned into a clash of personalities when it should be about ideasComment: The next Chancellor should take the fight to Brussels with a radical, pro-growth agenda Comment: Do you want to escape to a remote and wild place?

And for the record, I’ve been reassured that it is all very possible.” Ms Longfield says it is right, as proposed under a new “game-changing” statutory code, that social media sites such as Facebook and Instagram should be required to block under-13s or face punitive fines.Duty of Care | Time for the government to actUnder the age-appropriate code, which is due to become law this year, the companies will have to introduce effective age checks, or treat all their users like children.Those that fail to do so risk fines of up to 4 per cent of global turnover, equivalent to £1.5 billion for Facebook. “For too long, the balance of power between children and the platforms they use has been firmly fixed in favour of the latter.This code could be the first step in redressing the balance,” said Ms Longfield. “Of course, it would be surprising if there was not a flurry of pushback from the tech companies, as so often happens when industry is asked to change its ways. “We will be told it would take a very long time, that it will negate the experience of the activity or that it simply can’t be done.”Duty of care puffShe said one company had told her that current age verification technology was appropriate for them because they needed users to get online “seamlessly”. “But why should it be? If it’s a choice between children having to wait a small amount of time to get on to a site, and continuing to allow them on sites they shouldn’t be on, then to me the answer is obvious,” she added.Ms Longfield backed The Daily ’s campaign for a statutory duty of care, which is to be introduced by the Government.She said the companies should start introducing the changes now, rather than waiting for the Government’s planned legislation.She is incredulous at their claims that they don’t have the technology to do it and that they are obfuscating by claiming they want people to be able to go seamlessly online without checks.“Instead of trying to hold up the inevitable, it would be wise to get ahead of the curve,” she said.  Duty of Care CampaignEuropean elections 2019 results live: Tories and Labour braced for losses as Brexit Party prepares for victoryEuropean elections 2019 results: Brexit Party expected to win most UK seats as official exit polls released across EuropeComment: To win back the public, we must show that we can deliver on our pledgesComment: For far too long tech companies have left children unhappy and exposed them to harm Comment: Our old friend Project Fear is back to smear Boris in this electionMichael Gove insists he can be trusted as PM as he is accused of stabbing Boris Johnson in the backLouvre intervenes in Leonardo Da Vinci row as author claims Paris gallery has said it will not refer to Salvator Mundi as being by the artistFrance\u0026#39s Le Pen declares victory over Macron in high-stakes European duelComment: The leadership race has turned into a clash of personalities when it should be about ideasComment: The next Chancellor should take the fight to Brussels with a radical, pro-growth agenda Comment: Do you want to escape to a remote and wild place?

So quick, in fact, that she had left her mobile phone and water battle behind in her car.Speaking to the New York Times on Saturday, 24 hours after she was spotted by a search helicopter hired by her frantic parents, she said from her hospital bed: “I wanted to give up. ”But the only option I had was life or death. ”I heard this voice that said, ‘If you want to live, keep going.”After several days, tracking in an area inahabited by wild boars, she fell twenty feet into a deep ravine and fractured her leg. Weak and injured, she began to crawl instead of walk. ”I was getting so skinny that I was really starting to doubt if I could survive.”  Julia Eller, her relieved mother, told local news outlets that wild berries and even a few moths were all that sustained her. She tried to catch some crawfish but was ”not very successful.”Eller smiles surrounded by her rescuers Mrs Eller added: ”She lost quite a bit of weight, as you can imagine, being lost for that amount of time. “But she was able to survive it. She had the right skills and did the right things to buy time so that we had a chance to find her.”One night, Miss Eller took shelter in a boar’s den.  She covered herself in leaves and mud to stay warm. On the 17th day of her disappearance, she was spotted by an elated rescuer 4 miles away from the original search area.The local fire crew went in to retrieve her. She was sunburnt and malnourished. ”I looked up and they were right on top of me,” said Miss Eller of the moment she saw the helicopter. “I was like, ‘Oh my God,’ and I just broke down and started bawling.”European elections 2019 results: Brexit Party expected to win most UK seats as official exit polls released across EuropeComment: For far too long tech companies have left children unhappy and exposed them to harm Comment: Our old friend Project Fear is back to smear Boris in this electionEuropean elections 2019 results live: Tories and Labour braced for losses as Brexit Party prepares for victoryMichael Gove insists he can be trusted as PM as he is accused of stabbing Boris Johnson in the backLouvre intervenes in Leonardo Da Vinci row as author claims Paris gallery has said it will not refer to Salvator Mundi as being by the artistFrance\u0026#39s Le Pen declares victory over Macron in high-stakes European duelComment: The next Chancellor should take the fight to Brussels with a radical, pro-growth agenda Comment: The leadership race has turned into a clash of personalities when it should be about ideasComment: Do you want to escape to a remote and wild place?

It was one its lead character would have approved of: as with many of the soundtracks on this list, High Fidelity’s success lies in a balance between old-school gems by the Velvet Underground, The Kinks and Elvis Costello to Noughties newcomers like Stereolab and Royal Trux.This may seem like sacrilege given that the first Dirty Dancing soundtrack is indisputably the more iconic of the two. And yes, the sequel (essentially a remake set in Cuba during the 1950s), starring Romola Garai and future Rogue One star Diego Luna, suffered from a plot loaded with clichés and lack of chemistry between its two lead actors. But the soundtrack – featuring the Grammy-nominated Latin fusion band Yerba Buena, Colombian rock band Aterciopelados, and the Cuban hip hop group Orishasis – is what draws me back to this guilty pleasure of a film. Dirty Dancing 2 didn’t really deserve such a soundtrack, but it adds some actual heat to a film that, asides from the superb dance routines, leaves you cold.Martin Scorsese had strict rules for the soundtrack to his film Goodfellas: each song had to have been around during the time in which the scene was set, and the tracks had to make some kind of comment on the scene or character in question “in an oblique way”. A staggering 48 songs are heard during the film, including classics by Dean Martin, Fred Astaire and The Drifters, Sid Vicious, The Who and The Rolling Stones. One of the most unforgettable moments is when Bobby Darin’s “Beyond the Sea” plays as the Wise Guys cook dinner, which was “always a big thing” in prison.When it comes to soundtracking your movie, it helps if the director is a massive music nerd. Of course, music was always going to play a huge part in a film about a boy in a band and his video game quest to win the girl of his dreams. But Edgar Wright, a former music video director, found a way to seamlessly integrate his soundtrack into Scott Pilgrim vs the World’s narrative. Beck, who wrote the music for Scott Pilgrim’s garage band Sex Bob-omb, was a perfect match for their chaotic, DIY approach, while Metric’s song “Black Sheep” was used for a performance by ex-girlfriend Envy Adams’s (Brie Larson) band The Clash at Demonhead.Drive wouldn’t have worked as well as it did without the soundtrack. Steven Soderbergh\u0027s go-to composer Cliff Martinez assembled the songs for Nicolas Winding Refn’s ambitious indie project, showing an understanding that the most effective soundtracks are often the ones that transport you into the movie without you realising. By using a set of mostly female vocalists, all of whom sing over dry electronic beats, Martinez achieved a sonic portrayal of Drive’s startling juxtaposition between beauty and violence.It’s the biggest movie soundtrack of all time and the 15th best-selling album in the US. Whitney Houston breathed new life into songs by Dolly Parton (“I Will Always Love You”) and Chaka Khan (“I’m Every Woman”). Five of the songs performed by Houston were hits: I Will Always Love You, I\u0027m Every Woman, I Have Nothing, Run to You (both Oscar-nominated), and Queen of the NightYes, it was the Fab Four\u0027s worst film, but the soundtrack is packed with some of their best songs: “I am the Walrus”, She Loves You and “Hello, Goodbye”. Where A Hard Day’s Night, Yellow Submarine and Help were undoubtedly more influential on popular culture, Magical Mystery Tour is the most fun to listen to – regardless of how much effort is required to watch.Few films offer as comprehensive a look at hip-hop stars during the heights of their creative powers – even though the movie itself was a clumsily written crime drama. Belly’s soundtrack captured the East Coast rap scene as it stepped towards a grittier sound and underwent one of the most important transitions for any genre in music history – with contributions from the likes of D’Angelo, members of the Wu-Tang Clan, Nas and Jay-Z.At the time, it felt like Richard Kelly’s dark and gloomy film starring a young Jake Gyllenhaal was one of the few to truly capture what it meant to be a confused, alienated teenager. With composer Michael Andrews, Kelly picked some the best songs from an era that dealt in existential angst via upbeat synth-pop: Echo and the Bunnymen, Duran Duran, Tears for Fears, The Pet Shop Boys and more. By choosing to close the film on Michael Andrews’ cover of Tears for Fears’ “Mad World”, Kelly underpins both the self-absorbed attitude of teenagers convinced that only the artists singing these songs truly understood them, and the nostalgia felt by their parents who were there in the moment.Midnight Cowboy – the first X-rated film to win the Oscar for Best Picture – took original material and pre-existing songs to complement the theme of a naïve cowboywannabe sex worker trying to survive in a big city, and the juxtaposition between Jon Voight’s character Joe Buck and dying con artist “Ratso” (Dustin Hoffman). Fred Neil\u0027s song “Everybody\u0027s Talkin\u0027”, which underscores the first act, won the Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Vocal Performance, Male (for Harry Nilsson).Trent Reznor’s work on David Lynch’s 1997 neo-noir movie is loaded with stark electronics and instrumentals by Angelo Badalamenti. In between, you have Smashing Pumpkins, Nine Inch Nails and, of course, This Mortal Coil’s “Song to the Siren” – a track that caught Lynch’s attention and inspired him to co-write two albums for Twin Peaks chanteuse Julee Cruise.1240 29. The Last Days of Disco (1998)Whit Stillman’s 1998 indie-classic starred then-virtual unknowns Kate Beckinsale and Chloë Sevigny as friends and roommates in early-Eighties New York. Add that to a wall-to-wall disco soundtrack and you’ve got an intoxicating film, set 20 years after the genre’s heyday, with classic dancefloor anthems from Chic, Diana Ross, and Sister Sledge belted out one after the other.  In the summer of 1992, the soundtrack to a film that flopped at the box office offered the masses the gateway they needed into the Seattle grunge scene. Cameron Crowe wanted the Singles soundtrack to be “more like a simple mixtape of Seattle’s finest”, and ended up with a veritable who’s-who of every important band from that moment in music history: Pearl Jam, Alice in Chains, Smashing Pumpkins, Soundgarden and Mudhoney… everyone apart from Nirvana. Regardless, almost three decades after the film’s release, the soundtrack serves as a landmark for one of the most pivotal moments in music history.Adapting literary classics to modern-day high-school scenarios was the big thing in the Nineties. Cruel Intentions came from Pierre Choderlos de Laclos’s 18th-century work, Les Liaisons Dangereuses, and starred Sarah Michelle Gellar and Ryan Phillippe as Kathryn and Sebastian: two spoilt, bored rich kids toying with the naïve and virtuous Annette (Reese Witherspoon). John Ottman was originally enlisted to compose the score, but producers decided that wouldn’t sit well with the teenage demographic it was going for and instead plumped for a soundtrack of Placebo, Blur, Skunk Anansie, Aimee Mann and Counting Crows. This mix of credible and corny mirrors a typical experience we go through as adolescents, discovering iniduality via the music we listen to and trying to leave the theatrics behind. The cult status of both the featured music and the film itself suggests we can never let the drama go completely.Flashdance, the first collaboration between producers Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer, is important because it actually changed how some of the most popular films of the Eighties were shot. For each song featured in the film there is a scene presented in the same way as a music video, like the use of “Maniac” as Alex (Jennifer Beals) trains for her dance audition, or the lead song of the film “What a Feeling”, which plays during the opening montage of the steel mill. The latter, written by Italian composer Giorgio Moroder, Keith Forsey and Irene Cara (who performed the track), became the singer’s first and only number one hit. It also won the Academy Award for Best Original Song, a Golden Globe, and a Grammy for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance. Michael Sembello’s “Maniac”, meanwhile, went on to become one of the highest-grossing songs ever written for a film.While Half Nelson isn’t as highly regarded as Lars and the Real Girl or Drive,  it’s the one that helped Ryan Gosling break away from his status as the heartthrob from The Notebook. It also has a phenomenal soundtrack steered by Broken Social Scene, whose brilliant collection of B-sides proved indispensable for this film about a drug-addicted middle-school teacher struggling to deal with the aftermath of a breakup. In between those tracks you’ve got gritty hip hop that shows Dan\u0027s crossover into the world of his pupil, the stoic Drey (Shareeka Epps) – from New York collective Dujeous, to Rhymefest.1740 24. Lost in Translation (2003)Sofia Coppola has a history of needle drops that encapsulate certain moods that can’t be expressed through dialogue, particularly if it involves a medley of shoegaze from Air and My Bloody Valentine, and the full-throttle debauchery of Peaches on “Fuck the Pain Away”. The soundtrack was so influential that several critics suggested it had something to do with the rebirth of shoegaze in the mid-Noughties. Either way, there a few better songs to close a film than Jesus and Mary Chain’s “Just Like Honey”, that plays just after the kiss goodbye between Bob (Bill Murray) and Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) and that indecipherable whisper.Former Massive Attack producer Nellee Hooper is the brainchild behind one of the greatest film soundtracks of all time. Working with composers Craig Armstrong and Marius de Vries, he beta-tested many of the tracks that ended up on the album by playing them at 5am to afterparty guests at his house in London. Others took direct inspiration from Shakespeare’s original text, with Justin Warfield of One Inch Punch and Art Alexakis of Everclear both allowed to watch early edits of scenes from the film to inspire them. Like the soundtracks for Kill Bill, Trainspotting and Marie Antoinette, it’s the vast eclecticism of the songs featured in Romeo + Juliet that make you remember each one, and the scene where each is used, for years after first seeing the film.As well as making a star of reggae singer Jimmy Cliff, both the film and soundtrack for The Harder They Come exposed mainstream audiences to the emerging Kingston recording industry, helping bring the genre to the US and beyond. Only the title track was an original recorded by Cliff for the movie the rest were singles released in Jamaica between 1967 and 1972, including Cliff’s superb “You Can Get it if You Really Want”, plus songs from seminal artists like Toots and the Maytals and Desmond Dekker.A veritable masterpiece: The Beach soundtrack is what gives this film starring a fresh-faced Leonardo DiCaprio its vitality, capturing the essence of the trance music heard during Thai beach parties during the Nineties. It was supervised by Pete Tong, who said the songs, including Moby’s “Porcelain” and Dario G’s “Voices”, are what make the film “watchable time and time again”. The way the music progresses mirrors the grit and darkness that begin to emerge out of paradise.2140 20. Pretty in Pink (1986)John Hughes virtually pioneered the formula for teen movies soundtracked by angsty British post-punk rock. Echo \u0026amp the Bunnymen, The Smiths, Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark and New Order all appeared on what is essentially Hughes’s checklist of what cool kids were – or should have been – listening to in the Eighties.    Curated and co-executive produced by Kendrick Lamar, the Black Panther soundtrack brought on a select group of extraordinary talent that would understand the themes in the film, from Anderson .Paak to Earl Sweatshirt. Leading this group is Lamar himself, undoubtedly the best choice of artist for a film that explores responsibility, black power, family dynamics and loyalty. Where Jay-Z failed to step aside on the Great Gatsby soundtrack and let other artists do their thing, Lamar is more interested in highlighting the skills of his fellow artists, like South African singer Babes Wodumo, or Jorja Smith. It’s true that the Black Panther album pales in comparison to some of Lamar’s solo work, but it’s rare to see a soundtrack that so deeply considers the subject matter it has been presented with, and the responsibility of continuing the story through music.2340 18. Dazed and Confused (1993)Dazed and Confused was relatable even if you didn’t happen to spend your teenage years riding shotgun in a 1975 Chevy El Camino. This is largely due to director Richard Linklater highlighting an era of raucous butt-rock anthems and stoner jams, from Alice Cooper’s “School’s Out” to Ted Nugent’s “Stranglehold”.In a year that was saturated with serious historical and period dramas, from a remake of Jane Eyre to The Queen, Marie Antoinette stood out for its highly stylised and fun approach to a well-known figure. Director Sofia Coppola took a similar approach with the music as James Gunn did for s of the Galaxy, mixing new wave and post-punk – including The Strokes, New Order, Adam and the Ants and The Cure – with period music by Baroque composers Vivaldi and Couperin. By doing so, Coppola gave her audience something to relate to, and a soundtrack that suited Marie Antoinette’s rebellious teenage spirit. The best example of this is in the shopping scene – set to the song “I Want Candy” by Bow Wow Wow – that famously included a pair of purple Converse: one of the most defining fashion items of Nineties teen culture. It is a brilliant yet subtle alignment of modern Western consumerism and the outrageous decadence at Versailles during the 18th century.One of the most eclectic compilations to grace cinema-goers’ ears in recent years: the Call Me By Your Name soundtrack wins for those three songs by Sufjan Stevens alone. The American singer-songwriter remixed his 2010 track “Futile Devices” and also wrote two new songs specifically for the film: “Visions of Gideon” and “Mystery of Love”, the latter of which was nominated for the Best Original Song Oscar. Director Luca Guadagnino worked with film editor Walter Fasano and music supervisor Robin Urdang, all understanding that music would play a “vital role”. He wanted the music to give the film a “precise identity” that would act as a “voice” in the movie, he told Billboard. “That’s when I thought of Sufjan Stevens.” Other tracks, like the buoyant “Love My Way” by The Psychedelic Furs, captured the wistful, heady nature of hot, endless summers in Italy during the Eighties.Of course, any biopic about the rise and fall of gangsta rap collective NWA had to have a killer soundtrack – especially if its former members were involved in its production. Even so, the meticulous care with which the soundtrack for Straight Outta Compton was assembled is impressive, and provides backdrop for an origin story about some of the most influential and important records – and artists – of the Eighties and Nineties.2740 14. 500 Days of Summer (2009)This offbeat romantic comedy has developed cult status over the years and stood out at the time for its original take on the “boy meets girl” genre. Music is what first drew characters Summer (Zoe Deschanel) and Tom (Joseph Gordon Levitt) together (they start talking after Summer overhears The Smiths playing on Tom’s MP3 player). Each song mirrors the various highs and lows the characters go through, helped by director Marc Webb’s background making music videos for indie pop artists. Regina Spektor’s song “Hero” is the perfect backdrop for the scene where Tom realises his hopes of getting back with Summer are futile the track closes on the lyric “no one’s got it all”, as if to point out that not everyone gets the fairytale ending they hope for.A veritable smorgasbord for any self-respecting music nerd: Baby Driver took movie soundtracks to a whole other plane. The Fault in Our Stars actor Ansel Elgort stars as “Baby”, a skilled getaway driver who relies on a steady stream of music in order to counteract the effects of tinnitus.There are vintage cuts from The Beach Boys, Beck and Barry White, and Seventies rock gems by Queen and Golden Earring. Yet it was the slightly more unassuming song “Bellbottoms” from the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion album Orange that initially inspired the film. A then 21-year-old Edgar Wright was sitting in his bedroom, “completely broke”, when he began to visualise a car chase set to the songs on that album.George Lucas managed to amplify the already-nostalgic mood on his “summer of ‘62” film by choosing songs from the mid-to-late Fifties as the lead tracks on the American Graffiti soundtrack. Songs from Buddy Holly and Chuck Berry to The Beach Boys are all presented by legendary disc jockey Wolfman Jack.3040 11. 10 Things I Hate About YouIf Pretty in Pink captured teenage angst in the Eighties, 10 Things I Hate About You achieved it for the decade that followed. Unlike many films of the Nineties, which attempted to capitalise on the major rock stars of the day, 10 Things managed to select what is essentially a list of one-hit wonders, from Letters to Cleo and Semisonic to Save Ferris. When you watch the film today, it only serves to fuel that feeling of nostalgia and add to its ever-growing cult status.3140 10. Do the Right Thing (1989)Spike Lee’s Brooklyn-based masterpiece is set to a breathtaking jazz score conducted and composed by his father, Bill Lee. It’s also punctuated by summer jams and blissful ballads, or the urgent demands of Public Enemy’s “Fight the Power”, which is played from Radio Raheem’s boombox a number of times through the film.Until Eden, there was no film about club culture that took the scene seriously. French filmmaker Mia Hansen-Love’s character Paul (Felix de Givry) is based on the experiences of her brother Sven – a relatively popular DJ who had to look on as his peers, including Daft Punk, achieved global fame by pioneering the early EDM scene. Its soundtrack offers a comprehensive look at the house, jungle and garage music that was the lifeblood of Paris youth culture in the Nineties, but is also carefully chosen to match the situation of the film’s characters. Daft Punk’s “Veridis Quo” signals a mood-change at a celebratory dinner, while “Happy Song” by Charles Dockins conveys Paul’s euphoria as his hero Tony Humphries works the decks in a New York club.  This was one of the first films to be defined by its music Mike Nichols also helped pioneer the practice of curating pre-existing songs that would appeal to a pop radio audience. Simon \u0026amp Garfunkel’s music was the perfect fit when it came to music that would show Dustin Hoffman’s character’s intensifying feelings of isolation, particular whenever “The Sounds of Silence” was used.This was one of the first films to also be defined by its music Mike Nichols also helped pioneer the practice of curating pre-existing songs that would appeal to a pop radio audience. Simon \u0026amp Garfunkel’s music was the perfect fit when it came to music that would show Dustin Hoffman’s character’s intensifying feelings of isolation, particular whenever “The Sounds of Silence” was used.Curtis Mayfield’s third studio album was released as the soundtrack to the Blaxploitation film of the same name. It was groundbreaking for its themes of poverty and drug abuse which made the record stand out among the less socially aware music of its time. It would go on to influence everyone from TV score composers to soul singers in the decades that followed.3540 6. s of the Galaxy (2014)The soundtrack for Danny Boyle’s adaptation of Irvine Welsh’s novel was so popular it promoted a release of a second soundtrack a year later, in 1997. After two decades, it still holds up as one of the greatest and most lovingly curated collections of songs in music history. The use of “Lust for Life” in the opening scene triggered something of a career renaissance for Iggy Pop (one that many would argue didn’t do him many favours). There’s a romanticised overdose set to Lou Reed’s “Perfect Day”, and Heaven 17 soundtrack a club scene with “Temptation”. A particularly disgusting toilet scene is set to Brian Eno’s “Deep Blue Day” and French composer Georges Bizet’s “Carmen Suite No.2”.Quentin Tarantino didn’t commission a traditional film score for what is arguably his most adored film, 1994’s Pulp Fiction. Instead, he mixed American surf music and classic rock and roll, including the late Dick Dale’s “Misirlou” in the iconic opening scene. The track was suggested to Tarantino by musician Boyd Rice, via their mutual friend Allison Anders. The soundtrack had such an impact – reaching number 21 on the Billboard 200 and selling more than two million units by 1996 – that it was credited with “reinvigorating” surf rock and sparking a trend by advertisers to use it in their commercials, “to help sell everything from burritos to toothpaste”. Chuck Berry’s song “You Never Can Tell”, also known as “C’est la Vie”, also enjoyed a resurgence in popularity thanks to its use in the famous dance scene with Mia Wallace (Uma Thurman) and Vincent Vega (John Travolta). Neither Cameron Crowe nor his music coordinator Danny Bramson wanted to pander to the charts for this story based on the director’s years as a teenage rock journalist. If anything, they avoided tracks that seemed like potential radio favourites, choosing lesser-known songs like “Sparks” from The Who’s album Tommy as the theme for Crowe’s alter-ego William Miller. The music is essentially a whole other character – a narrator who offers running commentary on the scenarios the others find themselves in. And there are few scenes more uplifting than the one in Almost Famous where, having retrieved guitarist Russell Hammond (Billy Crudup) from a drugs and alcohol-fuelled party, the fictional band Stillwater and their crew take up a rowdy singalong to Elton John’s “Tiny Dancer”.Prince\u0027s acting debut took place in a film that also produced one of his greatest works. The concept for the plot, about a talented but tortured frontman of a band in Minneapolis, was developed by Prince during his 1999 tour. Purple Rain was one of the 10 highest-grossing films of 1984 and shows Prince as his best and most outrageous self. Yet the songs also provided a window through the Purple One\u0027s enigmatic facade, to reveal the soul beneath.The Wu-Tang Clan’s RZA worked with director Quentin Tarantino on the collection of music that would accompany Uma Thurman’s character The Bride on her bloody quest for revenge. What is particularly brilliant is the alternation between non-diegetic sound and the silence that precedes and lasts during some of the most tense action sequences. When it comes to the most crucial battle between O-Ren Ishii and The Bride at the end of the film, they first chose the disco flamenco intro from Santa Esmeralda\u0027s Latin arrangement of “Don’t Let Me Be Misunderstood”. At the gory conclusion, where O-Ren falls, RZA and Tarantino used Meiko Kaji’s “The Flower of Carnage”. The song was first used in the 1973 martial arts film Lady Snowblood, in which Kaji starred. She sings: “I’m a woman who walks at the brink of life and death Who emptied my tears many moons ago” and then: “I’ve immersed my body in the river of vengeance.” It\u0027s as though the song was written with The Bride in mind.Before Garden State and 500 Days of Summer, the team behind the adaptation of Nick Hornby’s novel compiled 15 tracks like a mixtape. It was one its lead character would have approved of: as with many of the soundtracks on this list, High Fidelity’s success lies in a balance between old-school gems by the Velvet Underground, The Kinks and Elvis Costello to Noughties newcomers like Stereolab and Royal Trux.This may seem like sacrilege given that the first Dirty Dancing soundtrack is indisputably the more iconic of the two. And yes, the sequel (essentially a remake set in Cuba during the 1950s), starring Romola Garai and future Rogue One star Diego Luna, suffered from a plot loaded with clichés and lack of chemistry between its two lead actors. But the soundtrack – featuring the Grammy-nominated Latin fusion band Yerba Buena, Colombian rock band Aterciopelados, and the Cuban hip hop group Orishasis – is what draws me back to this guilty pleasure of a film. Dirty Dancing 2 didn’t really deserve such a soundtrack, but it adds some actual heat to a film that, asides from the superb dance routines, leaves you cold.Martin Scorsese had strict rules for the soundtrack to his film Goodfellas: each song had to have been around during the time in which the scene was set, and the tracks had to make some kind of comment on the scene or character in question “in an oblique way”. A staggering 48 songs are heard during the film, including classics by Dean Martin, Fred Astaire and The Drifters, Sid Vicious, The Who and The Rolling Stones. One of the most unforgettable moments is when Bobby Darin’s “Beyond the Sea” plays as the Wise Guys cook dinner, which was “always a big thing” in prison.When it comes to soundtracking your movie, it helps if the director is a massive music nerd. Of course, music was always going to play a huge part in a film about a boy in a band and his video game quest to win the girl of his dreams. But Edgar Wright, a former music video director, found a way to seamlessly integrate his soundtrack into Scott Pilgrim vs the World’s narrative. Beck, who wrote the music for Scott Pilgrim’s garage band Sex Bob-omb, was a perfect match for their chaotic, DIY approach, while Metric’s song “Black Sheep” was used for a performance by ex-girlfriend Envy Adams’s (Brie Larson) band The Clash at Demonhead.Drive wouldn’t have worked as well as it did without the soundtrack. Steven Soderbergh\u0027s go-to composer Cliff Martinez assembled the songs for Nicolas Winding Refn’s ambitious indie project, showing an understanding that the most effective soundtracks are often the ones that transport you into the movie without you realising. By using a set of mostly female vocalists, all of whom sing over dry electronic beats, Martinez achieved a sonic portrayal of Drive’s startling juxtaposition between beauty and violence.It’s the biggest movie soundtrack of all time and the 15th best-selling album in the US. Whitney Houston breathed new life into songs by Dolly Parton (“I Will Always Love You”) and Chaka Khan (“I’m Every Woman”). Five of the songs performed by Houston were hits: I Will Always Love You, I\u0027m Every Woman, I Have Nothing, Run to You (both Oscar-nominated), and Queen of the NightYes, it was the Fab Four\u0027s worst film, but the soundtrack is packed with some of their best songs: “I am the Walrus”, She Loves You and “Hello, Goodbye”. Where A Hard Day’s Night, Yellow Submarine and Help were undoubtedly more influential on popular culture, Magical Mystery Tour is the most fun to listen to – regardless of how much effort is required to watch.Few films offer as comprehensive a look at hip-hop stars during the heights of their creative powers – even though the movie itself was a clumsily written crime drama. Belly’s soundtrack captured the East Coast rap scene as it stepped towards a grittier sound and underwent one of the most important transitions for any genre in music history – with contributions from the likes of D’Angelo, members of the Wu-Tang Clan, Nas and Jay-Z.At the time, it felt like Richard Kelly’s dark and gloomy film starring a young Jake Gyllenhaal was one of the few to truly capture what it meant to be a confused, alienated teenager. With composer Michael Andrews, Kelly picked some the best songs from an era that dealt in existential angst via upbeat synth-pop: Echo and the Bunnymen, Duran Duran, Tears for Fears, The Pet Shop Boys and more. By choosing to close the film on Michael Andrews’ cover of Tears for Fears’ “Mad World”, Kelly underpins both the self-absorbed attitude of teenagers convinced that only the artists singing these songs truly understood them, and the nostalgia felt by their parents who were there in the moment.Midnight Cowboy – the first X-rated film to win the Oscar for Best Picture – took original material and pre-existing songs to complement the theme of a naïve cowboywannabe sex worker trying to survive in a big city, and the juxtaposition between Jon Voight’s character Joe Buck and dying con artist “Ratso” (Dustin Hoffman). Fred Neil\u0027s song “Everybody\u0027s Talkin\u0027”, which underscores the first act, won the Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Vocal Performance, Male (for Harry Nilsson).Trent Reznor’s work on David Lynch’s 1997 neo-noir movie is loaded with stark electronics and instrumentals by Angelo Badalamenti. In between, you have Smashing Pumpkins, Nine Inch Nails and, of course, This Mortal Coil’s “Song to the Siren” – a track that caught Lynch’s attention and inspired him to co-write two albums for Twin Peaks chanteuse Julee Cruise.1240 29. The Last Days of Disco (1998)Whit Stillman’s 1998 indie-classic starred then-virtual unknowns Kate Beckinsale and Chloë Sevigny as friends and roommates in early-Eighties New York. Add that to a wall-to-wall disco soundtrack and you’ve got an intoxicating film, set 20 years after the genre’s heyday, with classic dancefloor anthems from Chic, Diana Ross, and Sister Sledge belted out one after the other.  In the summer of 1992, the soundtrack to a film that flopped at the box office offered the masses the gateway they needed into the Seattle grunge scene. Cameron Crowe wanted the Singles soundtrack to be “more like a simple mixtape of Seattle’s finest”, and ended up with a veritable who’s-who of every important band from that moment in music history: Pearl Jam, Alice in Chains, Smashing Pumpkins, Soundgarden and Mudhoney… everyone apart from Nirvana. Regardless, almost three decades after the film’s release, the soundtrack serves as a landmark for one of the most pivotal moments in music history.Adapting literary classics to modern-day high-school scenarios was the big thing in the Nineties. Cruel Intentions came from Pierre Choderlos de Laclos’s 18th-century work, Les Liaisons Dangereuses, and starred Sarah Michelle Gellar and Ryan Phillippe as Kathryn and Sebastian: two spoilt, bored rich kids toying with the naïve and virtuous Annette (Reese Witherspoon). John Ottman was originally enlisted to compose the score, but producers decided that wouldn’t sit well with the teenage demographic it was going for and instead plumped for a soundtrack of Placebo, Blur, Skunk Anansie, Aimee Mann and Counting Crows. This mix of credible and corny mirrors a typical experience we go through as adolescents, discovering iniduality via the music we listen to and trying to leave the theatrics behind. The cult status of both the featured music and the film itself suggests we can never let the drama go completely.Flashdance, the first collaboration between producers Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer, is important because it actually changed how some of the most popular films of the Eighties were shot. For each song featured in the film there is a scene presented in the same way as a music video, like the use of “Maniac” as Alex (Jennifer Beals) trains for her dance audition, or the lead song of the film “What a Feeling”, which plays during the opening montage of the steel mill. The latter, written by Italian composer Giorgio Moroder, Keith Forsey and Irene Cara (who performed the track), became the singer’s first and only number one hit. It also won the Academy Award for Best Original Song, a Golden Globe, and a Grammy for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance. Michael Sembello’s “Maniac”, meanwhile, went on to become one of the highest-grossing songs ever written for a film.While Half Nelson isn’t as highly regarded as Lars and the Real Girl or Drive,  it’s the one that helped Ryan Gosling break away from his status as the heartthrob from The Notebook. It also has a phenomenal soundtrack steered by Broken Social Scene, whose brilliant collection of B-sides proved indispensable for this film about a drug-addicted middle-school teacher struggling to deal with the aftermath of a breakup. In between those tracks you’ve got gritty hip hop that shows Dan\u0027s crossover into the world of his pupil, the stoic Drey (Shareeka Epps) – from New York collective Dujeous, to Rhymefest.1740 24. Lost in Translation (2003)Sofia Coppola has a history of needle drops that encapsulate certain moods that can’t be expressed through dialogue, particularly if it involves a medley of shoegaze from Air and My Bloody Valentine, and the full-throttle debauchery of Peaches on “Fuck the Pain Away”. The soundtrack was so influential that several critics suggested it had something to do with the rebirth of shoegaze in the mid-Noughties. Either way, there a few better songs to close a film than Jesus and Mary Chain’s “Just Like Honey”, that plays just after the kiss goodbye between Bob (Bill Murray) and Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) and that indecipherable whisper.Former Massive Attack producer Nellee Hooper is the brainchild behind one of the greatest film soundtracks of all time. Working with composers Craig Armstrong and Marius de Vries, he beta-tested many of the tracks that ended up on the album by playing them at 5am to afterparty guests at his house in London. Others took direct inspiration from Shakespeare’s original text, with Justin Warfield of One Inch Punch and Art Alexakis of Everclear both allowed to watch early edits of scenes from the film to inspire them. Like the soundtracks for Kill Bill, Trainspotting and Marie Antoinette, it’s the vast eclecticism of the songs featured in Romeo + Juliet that make you remember each one, and the scene where each is used, for years after first seeing the film.As well as making a star of reggae singer Jimmy Cliff, both the film and soundtrack for The Harder They Come exposed mainstream audiences to the emerging Kingston recording industry, helping bring the genre to the US and beyond. Only the title track was an original recorded by Cliff for the movie the rest were singles released in Jamaica between 1967 and 1972, including Cliff’s superb “You Can Get it if You Really Want”, plus songs from seminal artists like Toots and the Maytals and Desmond Dekker.A veritable masterpiece: The Beach soundtrack is what gives this film starring a fresh-faced Leonardo DiCaprio its vitality, capturing the essence of the trance music heard during Thai beach parties during the Nineties. It was supervised by Pete Tong, who said the songs, including Moby’s “Porcelain” and Dario G’s “Voices”, are what make the film “watchable time and time again”. The way the music progresses mirrors the grit and darkness that begin to emerge out of paradise.2140 20. Pretty in Pink (1986)John Hughes virtually pioneered the formula for teen movies soundtracked by angsty British post-punk rock. Echo \u0026amp the Bunnymen, The Smiths, Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark and New Order all appeared on what is essentially Hughes’s checklist of what cool kids were – or should have been – listening to in the Eighties.    Curated and co-executive produced by Kendrick Lamar, the Black Panther soundtrack brought on a select group of extraordinary talent that would understand the themes in the film, from Anderson .Paak to Earl Sweatshirt. Leading this group is Lamar himself, undoubtedly the best choice of artist for a film that explores responsibility, black power, family dynamics and loyalty. Where Jay-Z failed to step aside on the Great Gatsby soundtrack and let other artists do their thing, Lamar is more interested in highlighting the skills of his fellow artists, like South African singer Babes Wodumo, or Jorja Smith. It’s true that the Black Panther album pales in comparison to some of Lamar’s solo work, but it’s rare to see a soundtrack that so deeply considers the subject matter it has been presented with, and the responsibility of continuing the story through music.2340 18. Dazed and Confused (1993)Dazed and Confused was relatable even if you didn’t happen to spend your teenage years riding shotgun in a 1975 Chevy El Camino. This is largely due to director Richard Linklater highlighting an era of raucous butt-rock anthems and stoner jams, from Alice Cooper’s “School’s Out” to Ted Nugent’s “Stranglehold”.In a year that was saturated with serious historical and period dramas, from a remake of Jane Eyre to The Queen, Marie Antoinette stood out for its highly stylised and fun approach to a well-known figure. Director Sofia Coppola took a similar approach with the music as James Gunn did for s of the Galaxy, mixing new wave and post-punk – including The Strokes, New Order, Adam and the Ants and The Cure – with period music by Baroque composers Vivaldi and Couperin. By doing so, Coppola gave her audience something to relate to, and a soundtrack that suited Marie Antoinette’s rebellious teenage spirit. The best example of this is in the shopping scene – set to the song “I Want Candy” by Bow Wow Wow – that famously included a pair of purple Converse: one of the most defining fashion items of Nineties teen culture. It is a brilliant yet subtle alignment of modern Western consumerism and the outrageous decadence at Versailles during the 18th century.One of the most eclectic compilations to grace cinema-goers’ ears in recent years: the Call Me By Your Name soundtrack wins for those three songs by Sufjan Stevens alone. The American singer-songwriter remixed his 2010 track “Futile Devices” and also wrote two new songs specifically for the film: “Visions of Gideon” and “Mystery of Love”, the latter of which was nominated for the Best Original Song Oscar. Director Luca Guadagnino worked with film editor Walter Fasano and music supervisor Robin Urdang, all understanding that music would play a “vital role”. He wanted the music to give the film a “precise identity” that would act as a “voice” in the movie, he told Billboard. “That’s when I thought of Sufjan Stevens.” Other tracks, like the buoyant “Love My Way” by The Psychedelic Furs, captured the wistful, heady nature of hot, endless summers in Italy during the Eighties.Of course, any biopic about the rise and fall of gangsta rap collective NWA had to have a killer soundtrack – especially if its former members were involved in its production. Even so, the meticulous care with which the soundtrack for Straight Outta Compton was assembled is impressive, and provides backdrop for an origin story about some of the most influential and important records – and artists – of the Eighties and Nineties.2740 14. 500 Days of Summer (2009)This offbeat romantic comedy has developed cult status over the years and stood out at the time for its original take on the “boy meets girl” genre. Music is what first drew characters Summer (Zoe Deschanel) and Tom (Joseph Gordon Levitt) together (they start talking after Summer overhears The Smiths playing on Tom’s MP3 player). Each song mirrors the various highs and lows the characters go through, helped by director Marc Webb’s background making music videos for indie pop artists. Regina Spektor’s song “Hero” is the perfect backdrop for the scene where Tom realises his hopes of getting back with Summer are futile the track closes on the lyric “no one’s got it all”, as if to point out that not everyone gets the fairytale ending they hope for.A veritable smorgasbord for any self-respecting music nerd: Baby Driver took movie soundtracks to a whole other plane. The Fault in Our Stars actor Ansel Elgort stars as “Baby”, a skilled getaway driver who relies on a steady stream of music in order to counteract the effects of tinnitus.There are vintage cuts from The Beach Boys, Beck and Barry White, and Seventies rock gems by Queen and Golden Earring. Yet it was the slightly more unassuming song “Bellbottoms” from the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion album Orange that initially inspired the film. A then 21-year-old Edgar Wright was sitting in his bedroom, “completely broke”, when he began to visualise a car chase set to the songs on that album.George Lucas managed to amplify the already-nostalgic mood on his “summer of ‘62” film by choosing songs from the mid-to-late Fifties as the lead tracks on the American Graffiti soundtrack. Songs from Buddy Holly and Chuck Berry to The Beach Boys are all presented by legendary disc jockey Wolfman Jack.3040 11. 10 Things I Hate About YouIf Pretty in Pink captured teenage angst in the Eighties, 10 Things I Hate About You achieved it for the decade that followed. Unlike many films of the Nineties, which attempted to capitalise on the major rock stars of the day, 10 Things managed to select what is essentially a list of one-hit wonders, from Letters to Cleo and Semisonic to Save Ferris. When you watch the film today, it only serves to fuel that feeling of nostalgia and add to its ever-growing cult status.3140 10. Do the Right Thing (1989)Spike Lee’s Brooklyn-based masterpiece is set to a breathtaking jazz score conducted and composed by his father, Bill Lee. It’s also punctuated by summer jams and blissful ballads, or the urgent demands of Public Enemy’s “Fight the Power”, which is played from Radio Raheem’s boombox a number of times through the film.Until Eden, there was no film about club culture that took the scene seriously. French filmmaker Mia Hansen-Love’s character Paul (Felix de Givry) is based on the experiences of her brother Sven – a relatively popular DJ who had to look on as his peers, including Daft Punk, achieved global fame by pioneering the early EDM scene. Its soundtrack offers a comprehensive look at the house, jungle and garage music that was the lifeblood of Paris youth culture in the Nineties, but is also carefully chosen to match the situation of the film’s characters. Daft Punk’s “Veridis Quo” signals a mood-change at a celebratory dinner, while “Happy Song” by Charles Dockins conveys Paul’s euphoria as his hero Tony Humphries works the decks in a New York club.  This was one of the first films to be defined by its music Mike Nichols also helped pioneer the practice of curating pre-existing songs that would appeal to a pop radio audience. Simon \u0026amp Garfunkel’s music was the perfect fit when it came to music that would show Dustin Hoffman’s character’s intensifying feelings of isolation, particular whenever “The Sounds of Silence” was used.This was one of the first films to also be defined by its music Mike Nichols also helped pioneer the practice of curating pre-existing songs that would appeal to a pop radio audience. Simon \u0026amp Garfunkel’s music was the perfect fit when it came to music that would show Dustin Hoffman’s character’s intensifying feelings of isolation, particular whenever “The Sounds of Silence” was used.Curtis Mayfield’s third studio album was released as the soundtrack to the Blaxploitation film of the same name. It was groundbreaking for its themes of poverty and drug abuse which made the record stand out among the less socially aware music of its time. It would go on to influence everyone from TV score composers to soul singers in the decades that followed.3540 6. s of the Galaxy (2014)The soundtrack for Danny Boyle’s adaptation of Irvine Welsh’s novel was so popular it promoted a release of a second soundtrack a year later, in 1997. After two decades, it still holds up as one of the greatest and most lovingly curated collections of songs in music history. The use of “Lust for Life” in the opening scene triggered something of a career renaissance for Iggy Pop (one that many would argue didn’t do him many favours). There’s a romanticised overdose set to Lou Reed’s “Perfect Day”, and Heaven 17 soundtrack a club scene with “Temptation”. A particularly disgusting toilet scene is set to Brian Eno’s “Deep Blue Day” and French composer Georges Bizet’s “Carmen Suite No.2”.Quentin Tarantino didn’t commission a traditional film score for what is arguably his most adored film, 1994’s Pulp Fiction. Instead, he mixed American surf music and classic rock and roll, including the late Dick Dale’s “Misirlou” in the iconic opening scene. The track was suggested to Tarantino by musician Boyd Rice, via their mutual friend Allison Anders. The soundtrack had such an impact – reaching number 21 on the Billboard 200 and selling more than two million units by 1996 – that it was credited with “reinvigorating” surf rock and sparking a trend by advertisers to use it in their commercials, “to help sell everything from burritos to toothpaste”. Chuck Berry’s song “You Never Can Tell”, also known as “C’est la Vie”, also enjoyed a resurgence in popularity thanks to its use in the famous dance scene with Mia Wallace (Uma Thurman) and Vincent Vega (John Travolta). Neither Cameron Crowe nor his music coordinator Danny Bramson wanted to pander to the charts for this story based on the director’s years as a teenage rock journalist. If anything, they avoided tracks that seemed like potential radio favourites, choosing lesser-known songs like “Sparks” from The Who’s album Tommy as the theme for Crowe’s alter-ego William Miller. The music is essentially a whole other character – a narrator who offers running commentary on the scenarios the others find themselves in. And there are few scenes more uplifting than the one in Almost Famous where, having retrieved guitarist Russell Hammond (Billy Crudup) from a drugs and alcohol-fuelled party, the fictional band Stillwater and their crew take up a rowdy singalong to Elton John’s “Tiny Dancer”.Prince\u0027s acting debut took place in a film that also produced one of his greatest works. The concept for the plot, about a talented but tortured frontman of a band in Minneapolis, was developed by Prince during his 1999 tour. Purple Rain was one of the 10 highest-grossing films of 1984 and shows Prince as his best and most outrageous self. Yet the songs also provided a window through the Purple One\u0027s enigmatic facade, to reveal the soul beneath.The Wu-Tang Clan’s RZA worked with director Quentin Tarantino on the collection of music that would accompany Uma Thurman’s character The Bride on her bloody quest for revenge. What is particularly brilliant is the alternation between non-diegetic sound and the silence that precedes and lasts during some of the most tense action sequences. When it comes to the most crucial battle between O-Ren Ishii and The Bride at the end of the film, they first chose the disco flamenco intro from Santa Esmeralda\u0027s Latin arrangement of “Don’t Let Me Be Misunderstood”. At the gory conclusion, where O-Ren falls, RZA and Tarantino used Meiko Kaji’s “The Flower of Carnage”. The song was first used in the 1973 martial arts film Lady Snowblood, in which Kaji starred. She sings: “I’m a woman who walks at the brink of life and death Who emptied my tears many moons ago” and then: “I’ve immersed my body in the river of vengeance.” It\u0027s as though the song was written with The Bride in mind.Moby says he asked him if he wanted to collaborate on new music together, to which André allegedly responded: “Moby, you know I like you, but just too many people are hating on you right now.”The book also contains anecdotes about The Strokes, Bon Jovi and other artists Moby worked with or met across the years.\u0026nbspKate Nash claims the music industry has \u0027killed a lot of people\u0027Director Mati Diop becomes first black woman to win award at CannesNatalie Portman denies dating Moby after \u0027creepy\u0027 claim in new bookAmong the more controversial anecdotes was one where he claimed to have dated Natalie Portman 20 years ago, to whom he has since apologised.Portman, who would have been 18 at the time Moby claimed they dated, while he would have been in his mid-thirties, said she was “surprised” at his version of events and denied dating him – instead referring to his behaviour as “inappropriate” and “creepy”.While Moby initially doubled down on his claim, he has now apologised and said that many of the criticisms about his memoir are “very valid”.He said he should have behaved “more responsibly and respectfully” towards Portman when they met, and also approached her about including his version of events in the book before it was published.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Scunthorpe was built around steel, not the other way round.”Closing the steelworks would take out a huge amount of wages from the economy. The average steel worker makes £36,000, well above average for the region and the UK as a whole. It would double the local unemployment rate in the region, even before any jobs are inevitably lost in the supply chain.But the impact goes beyond that.\u0026nbspHundreds of local businesses rely on steel indirectly.“My brother has a car garage across the road from the steelworks,” says Ms Childs, who is now a representative for the GMB union.“Most of his customers\u0026nbspwork for British Steel or its contractors. Where is his income going to come from?“There are loads of businesses that are there purposely because of British Steel, like the cafe where the workers can go for a cheeky butty on their break.”Scunthorpe MP Nic Dakin is determined to find a resolution that allows workers to keep their jobs. Closure would cause strategic damage to the UK, he said.“This is not just about the core of 4,500 workers that would lose their jobs and not just about those in and around Scunthorpe.“In the blast furnaces at Scunthorpe we are talking about a national strategic asset. To lose that would damage the supply of steel to key industries like defence.“The steel industry is the foundation of manufacturing in this country and vitally important for our economy.”After the UK’s last steelworks closure at\u0026nbspRedcar in 2015, the UK now has just two active blast furnaces – Scunthorpe and Port Talbot in South Wales. They provide some of the highest quality steel in the world.“Once you lose that capability you can’t make your own steel. Are we serious about being a modern, independent nation?” asks Dakin.Such concerns are particularly pertinent at a time of growing nationalism in trade policy with Donald Trump pushing up US tariff barriers and China responding in kind.\u0026nbsp“We would have to import from overseas, where production might be less carbon friendly, the impact on the environment and air quality is higher“You can be held to ransom if you need to import to build important national assets: your railways, ships, planes and whatever else.Ms Childs agrees that the UK will be left in a vulnerable position. “If the Tories abandon manufacturing in the UK, as they seem to be doing, China will one day finish flooding the market with cheap steel and realise that there’s no competition left.”Another thing that\u0026nbspirks is that despite pledges to support steel as part of its industrial strategy, the government undermined it in one important way.When EU steel tariffs were proposed after China began dumping steel onto markets, pushing down prices,\u0026nbspBritain led efforts not to introduce tariffs that would have protected British steel.“It’s fine for the government to talk about an industrial strategy, but what does that actually mean?”Anna Soubry came to visit when steel was facing its last crisis in 2015.“I couldn’t tell you one tangible thing that they did after that.”While many people might want to blame Brexit for the closure, the government must look at its own record, says Ms Childs.“Once the Brexit shambles is over there will still be the same problems and issues that were there before.”British businesses pay twice as much for energy as their French counterparts while business rates are five to 10\u0026nbsptimes as high as on the continent.The experience of Redcar, points to what could befall Scunthorpe if the British Steel plant were allowed to close. Average weekly wages have gone from being some of the highest in the region to amongst the lowest since the steelworks shut.“Redcar knows only too well the cost of a closed steelworks and the impact it has on families, on communities, and on the local economy,” says MP Anna Turley.“Former steelworkers still contact my office needing support.”\u0026nbspBritish Steel’s Scunthorpe site – which is as big as a town in itself – also poses big, and expensive, problems for the environment.Steelworks can leave behind a toxic legacy which presents dangers to the public. Following a plant closure in Corby, Northamptonshire, 19 children were born with deformed feet and hands after their mothers inhaled toxic particles while pregnant during the Eighties\u0026nbspand Nineties.In Redcar, many more millions need to be spent to make the site safe and ready to become productive again.“It’s costing millions every month, and has been for three and a half years, just to keep the site safe,” says Anna Turley.\u0026nbsp“That is before any real clean up work has begun.“The cost of closure is astronomical, especially in comparison to much smaller sums needed to protect the assets, keep them running, and give the business and workforce a future.”The cost of environmental clean-up in Scunthorpe would be “at least” in the hundreds of millions of pounds and would take years, says local MP Nic Dakin – a huge bill that would be footed by taxpayers.“While its operating and it’s safe it’s all an asset but once it stops operating there are some dangerous things there,” he says.Some critics have said that market forces must be allowed to run their course and that the industry is in terminal decline -\u0026nbsp186,000 were employed in UK steel in 1981 compared to just 32,000 last year. Yorkshire and the Humber has already been the worst hit region with 40,000 jobs gone.But there this simplistic story of decline is misleading. Despite little support from the government, the average steel worker has become roughly five times more productive than they were in 1970 a significantly bigger improvement than in the economy as a whole.Given the UK’s current dire level of productivity growth, jettisoning some of the country’s most skilled workers would raise some serious questions.Now that the company has gone into liquidation there are three main options: find a buyer, nationalise or close it down.\u0026nbspThe public broadly supports nationalisation, with 48 per cent of people believing British Steel should be taken back into public ownership compared to just 18 per cent thinking the opposite, according to a new YouGov poll.It reveals that, even among Tory voters, 41 per cent think British Steel should be nationalised compared to 30 per cent who don’t.Nationalisation is the last thing that would have helped British SteelThis leaves a tricky decision for business secretary Greg Clark. Nationalisation of key assets such as the energy and rail networks has been a high-profile element of Labour’s policy platform -\u0026nbsp and one that some Tories have ridiculed.\u0026nbspTo take the British Steel into public ownership could easily be seen as a capitulation or at least an admission that Labour has a point. But to do otherwise could appear heartless. It would also be criticised as\u0026nbspa failure of the government’s industrial strategy, part of which was supposed to be a sector deal to support the steel industry.Clark has said that there are interested private-sector parties but Ms Childs is wary that an “unscrupulous” owner may enter the fray.“We don’t want a buyer that wants to take certain bits of the steel works and discard the rest or charge extortionate rates of interest.\u0026nbsp“We want someone who will take the whole thing and make steel in Scunthorpe for the foreseeable future.”“One thing is for sure” she says. “Through the financial crisis, the 2015 steel crisis and this current crisis, the men and women that work at that plant have always turned up, worked hard and delivered the best steel they can.\u0026nbsp“They will never stop doing that. Unless the gates close for good.”\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He warned investors not to be complacent about the prospect.“Despite mounting public impatience over the process, many top officials and lawmakers remain fearful of the economic damage from a no-deal exit,” said Mr Turner.“Lingering uncertainty would likely cause firms to delay investment, and keep sterling under downward pressure.”“A UK decision to remain an EU member would likely cause a swift rebound in sterling, which we believe is undervalued relative to its purchasing power parity level of around USD 1.58.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It was a strong stance against the unregulated, so-called wild-west world of cryptocurrency, and some feared it was an attempt to silence the nascent space. But secretly, the social network was actually planning its own version of the virtual currency.Less than a year after the ban was\u0026nbsplifted, details about what this cryptocurrency might look like have emerged. GlobalCoin, as it is reportedly called, may be about to upend the entire payments industry.The social network, which is used by more than two\u0026nbspbillion people around the world, has sought advice from the Bank of England and US Treasury about how the virtual currency could integrate with existing payment systems.Created with Sketch.Facebook birthday: 15 defining moments for the social network Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.On 4 Feb, 2004, 19-year-old Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg launched a website called \u0027TheFacebook\u0027 from his dorm.

This new small team is exploring different applications.How would GlobalCoin work?It is understood that the value of GlobalCoin will be pegged to a handful of established currencies, like the US dollar and euro, in order to avoid the price volatility issues that continue to plague bitcoin.It remains unclear whether Facebook\u0027s cryptocurrency will be decentralised like bitcoin. Industry experts have questioned whether the social network would launch a digital currency that was out of its control, despite advocates considering decentralisation a key tenet\u0026nbspof cryptocurrency.Bitcoin now accepted at Starbucks and dozens of other shopsMark Zuckerberg doesn\u0027t have an idea how to implement it where Facebook doesn\u0027t own it, Phil Chen, who masterminded the HTC Exodus blockchain smartphone, said in March.Cryptocurrencies are open, decentralised, censorship resistant and borderless – this is completely antithetical to the current business model of big technology companies, whose walled gardens mean they essentially own their customers.Facebook is also currently planning a merger of its other social media platforms, which include Instagram and WhatsApp, meaning GlobalCoin could be transferred between\u0026nbspa variety of apps. Both the merger and the cryptocurrency launch are expected to take place at some point in 2020.Rival messaging apps are also working on their own cryptocurrencies, with Telegram expected to launch its so-called GRAM cryptocurrency later this year.Competing with ChinaOne explanation to why Facebook feels the need to have its own currency lies in a country where Facebook and its various apps aren\u0027t even allowed: China.In order to compete on a global scale with the social networks and messaging apps spreading out of China, its own form of currency could give Facebook the upper hand.Corporate lawyer and fintech expert\u0026nbspTim Bird, who has worked closely with Facebook in the past, said he believed\u0026nbspGlobalCoin\u0026nbspwould give Facebook a new hold over advertising revenues thanks to the massive amounts of data it could generate.Ever since I spent a day working in Facebook HQ in Menlo Park, California, three years ago, it has been evident that they feel the need to challenge China, Bird told\u0026nbspThe Independent.To do this, Facebook needs a currency or payment platform of its own.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

On 19 August, a temporary license granted to Huawei by the US government will expire.Users will also lose\u0026nbspthe ability to install future versions of the Android operating system.“Huawei will continue to provide security updates and after sales services to all existing Huawei and Honor smartphone and tablet products covering those have been sold or still in stock globally,” a Huawei spokesperson told\u0026nbspThe Independent.“We will continue to build a\u0026nbspsafe and sustainable software ecosystem, in order to provide the best experience for all users globally.”But this will not be the case for future versions of Huawei smartphones, which will lose access to popular Google apps like Maps and YouTube.The suspension will also mean owners of new Huawei phones will not be able to download any apps using the Google Play store.Huawei\u0026nbspsays it has been preparing for this eventuality by building its own technology that is not reliant on US tech giants.Chief executive Richard Yu said in an interview last year that it has a backup plan should it ever be cut off from the likes of Google and Microsoft.Google issues message to Huawei phone owners“We have prepared our own operating system,” he told German publication\u0026nbspDie Welt. “Should it ever happen that we can no longer use these systems, we would be prepared.That’s our plan B but of course we prefer to work with the ecosystems of Google and Microsoft.”After the Trump administration placed Huawei on its “entity list” last week, Huawei executive Ren\u0026nbspZhengfei\u0026nbspreiterated this in comments to Japanese media.“We have already been preparing for this,” he said.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

David Barnett reports\u0026nbspClick to followThe IndependentJoy Division: (left to right) Ian Curtis, Bernard Sumner, Stephen Morris and Peter HookIt’s a big year for fans of Joy Division and New Order. This summer marks 40 years since the former’s debut album Unknown Pleasures, their only LP released before the suicide of lead singer Ian Curtis, aged 23, in May 1980. The surviving members – bassist Hook, guitarist Bernard “Barney” Sumner and drummer Stephen Morris – transformed themselves into New Order that year, joined by Gillian Gilbert on keyboards, with Sumner taking over vocals. It’s 30 years since the band released Technique. It was their their fifth album, but the one that propelled them to the top of the charts and into proper stardom, influenced by the Balearic sound of house music.Everybody, it seems, has a Joy Division or New Order story to tell, as evidenced by the books released this year. Jon Savage’s This Searing Light, the Sun and Everything Else is an “oral history” of Joy Division, published by Faber in April. Drummer Stephen Morris has his memoirs, Record Play Pause, out this month. Dave Haslam, one-time DJ at Manchester’s Hacienda club, the focal point of the so-called Madchester scene of the late 1980s and early 1990s, mentions his love of both bands in his recent autobiography, Sonic Youth Slept On My Floor.“Hooky”, you might be unsurprised to hear, doesn’t have a lot of truck with any of them. We meet in a Costa in Alderley Edge, a leafy little town in Cheshire, only 20 miles away, geographically, from Salford, where Hooky and Bernard Sumner grew up, but half a world away in other respects.He’s lived here for 20 years, and as we find a quiet corner of the coffee shop, I mention in passing that I took my 14-year-old daughter to listen to Haslam reading from his book a few weeks ago. “Well, when she grows up she’ll never forgive you,” he says.Created with Sketch.Caught on film: Joy Division on tour in 1979 Show all 13Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Hooky perhaps has a reputation for abrasiveness, for speaking his mind, for not taking any crap. He and New Order parted ways in 2007 and don’t appear to be on good terms. I mention that Haslam had spoken fondly of him, which he finds hard to believe. Has he read Haslam’s book?“I haven’t read many good Manchester books,” he says. “I think my favourite is Bez’s. I’ve got Mark E Smith’s on my shelf but not got round to it yet.”Peter Hook to perform Joy Division albums in full at UK showsJoy Division’s Bernard Sumner’s memoir recalls the death of bandmateHooky himself wrote Unknown Pleasures: Inside Joy Division, published in 2012, and he says he did so as a direct response to the author and journalist Mick Middles’ 1996 book, From Joy Division to New Order. “That Middles book was a crock of f**king shit but he inspired me to write my own,” he says. “I suppose I’m in the unenviable position of being too close to the whole thing.”I wave Jon Savage’s book at him and he shakes his head. “That is particularly annoying that one, it’s Joy Division in their own words but a lot of it’s just lifted from when we did the Joy Division documentary. Those interviews were from the Control interview, Faber bought them lock stock and barrel without our permission, without even a f**king charity donation. He had access to the whole transcripts. Didn’t make sense to me, especially from Jon Savage who you’ve known for 40 f**king years. We weren’t party to how it was done in any way shape or form so it’s just another annoyance.”Does a lot of stuff annoy Peter Hook generally? He shrugs. “It’s not that bad after a while. You just get used to it. You get to that bit where nothing surprises you. I mean, I’ve had a few fracas with Jon because he sided with them lot and excluded me which I felt was really unfair, especially when I used to tow his f**king car back so our kid could fix it. So yeah… people have short memories.”There’s a chapter in Dave Haslam’s book where he details being commissioned by NME to interview New Order, a band of which he describes himself as “a devotee, bewitched by them”. Haslam interviewed the band in 1986 at their recording studio in Cheetham Hill afterwards, Hooky gave him a lift back into Manchester city centre. Haslam had taped the interview but something went wrong his tape was blank. In a panic, he sat down in a cafe and tried to write down everything again from memory, commenting:\u0026nbsp“No one knew how I’d crafted the quotes by New Order.”Tales grow in the telling. Legends get embellished. Stories take on a life of their own. “Yeah,” concedes Hooky. In 2010 he wrote a book called The Hacienda: How Not to Run a Club, and says he initially wanted to do it on interviews with the principal characters. “What I found which was really weird, when I started talking to a few people I very quickly realised that everybody had a different memory of the single occasion, so I thought f**k this, I’m going to have to do it on my own. And you find even though you think something is true you can be contradicted by people.”As an example, Hooky cites his auctioning off earlier this year of all his old Joy Division and New Order memorabilia, to raise money for the Epilepsy Society (Ian Curtis suffered from it) and Calm, the charity aimed at tackling suicide, especially among men. He put a bell tree percussion device in the lots, saying it had been used on the Joy Division track Atmosphere. Drummer Stephen Morris, who would have used it, disputed the fact.Hooky says, “I think you’d have to be deaf not to realise that a bell tree made the sound and it wasn’t a tambourine stuck on a pair of scissors. But that is an example of how people can remember completely different things. Normally it doesn’t lead to that level of aggro but it is quite shocking really because there is no truth, the only truth really is your truth. You’re not gonna lie. I’m sure Stephen Morris thinks it was but, y’know, in my opinion he’s wrong, and you have to go with your own truth otherwise you’d never get through life. It is interesting the way you can have completely different ideas.”V97 with Monaco (PA)There’s a sense when talking to Peter Hook that his often cutting remarks about the people he’s shared some of the last 40-odd years with are, in a way, a defensive tactic, that there’s been so many wars of words since New Order split that he’s getting his jabs in first. At one point I ask him what would happen if Bernard Sumner walked into the Costa we were sitting in, and he laughs uproariously and says, “You’d need your camera, mate!”But it’s obvious he loves the music. He’s rarely been without a band or project since he started while New Order were still going he worked with another Factory band, Ad Infinitum. When New Order had their first break-up in 1993, he started two new bands, Revenge and Monaco. New Order reformed for almost a decade from 1998, during which time Hooky began to develop his DJing career, which now sees him about to embark on a tour with Hacienda Classical, kicking off on 8 June at Scarborough’s Open Air Theatre.Classical accompaniment to pop and dance music is something of a thing right now, but this is the fifth year of the Hacienda Classical concept, which combines the live orchestral music of the Manchester Camerata with DJs recreating the sounds of the nightclub’s heyday. If you think that sounds a bit weird, then you wouldn’t be on your own.Camerata Orchestra performing Hacienda Classical (Rex)The idea had been pioneered by DJ Todd Terry in the States, and British DJ Pete Tong had started doing it over here. “Pete Tong was doing it more as a concert, songs finishing and starting. Graeme’s idea was to do it as a DJ mix, just the same as it would be in a club, so once you started you didn’t stop,” says Hooky.That caused some problems with some venues because they wanted an intermission in which to make up the takings on the bar. “But we felt it was more intrinsic to the spirit of the Hacienda to be complete it starts and it finishes, you’re f**ked and you go home and you recover. It was that depth of feeling that you wanted from what we were doing.”The orchestra plays live and the sound is mixed by the DJ in to the classic Hacienda club tracks, with live vocalists. Hooky gets a bit of fire in his eyes that’s impossible to fake just for PR purposes as he waxes lyrical over the gigs. “A lot of these songs you’ve grown up with and they’ve marked many, many special occasions in your life… death, kids, meeting the missus, losing the missus … it’s very charged, it’s very physical, and people f**king love it. And it gives all us old people the excuse to live our youth again, get a babysitter, have the kids tucked up at home, and fearing what you’re going to feel like the next morning.”Hooky started DJing in 2004, doing it full time in 2007 when New Order split for the second time. He says, “I started doing it out of necessity because I had no money at that point, as New Order we’d not worked for a bit. I mainly do dance music and I get in a lot of trouble because everybody expects you to play the f**king Stone Roses and the Happy Mondays ad infinitum.Madchester’ hub\u0026nbsp(Rex)“The other fantastic thing is most DJs are sober and they’re always on time, which is f**king fantastic. If I’m on at 9 o’clock I know the DJ before me will finish at 8.59.59. You play with groups and they’re always f**king late, nobody arguing about who goes on last and all that crap. It’s very courteous. The rivalry comes with you wanting to play a better set.”So he’s looking forward to hitting the road with the Hacienda Classical Tour, which takes in the Royal Albert Hall and the Isle of Wight Festival among its dates. But Hooky has a special soft spot for the tour opener, Scarborough.“Scarborough is a great place,” he enthuses. “I DJ’d in that old place on the pier the last time I was there. They were nuts. And I never realised how beautiful Scarborough was. Scarborough actually reminded me insanely of Palma, Majorca. I couldn’t believe how beautiful it was. All that European money, innit? And they won’t be getting that any more.”Ah, here it is. We look at each other cautiously over our coffee cups. Ageing rock stars and Brexit. You never know how that one’s going to pan out, do you? Morrissey calling the referendum result “magnificent” and Johnny Rotten in a “make America great again” T-shirt.“Look,” says Hooky, who lives in Majorca for half the year and has ambitions to do that full-time. “I’m a traveller. I go all round the world all the time and I do think it’s important in this day and age for us all to stick together, and not to be fragmented. I think that’s the worst thing that could happen to anybody and I think it exacerbates differences and things like immigration and racism.“I just think it’s the wrong way of pursuing a modern life. It’s old-fashioned, and honestly if you found someone who still thought it was a good idea then they’re a f**king idiot because it’s been proved that our government can’t handle it, which is an embarrassment. I was sat there last week doing a Euro news interview and the guy’s going, ‘What’s happening with Brexit?’ and I haven’t a f**king clue but there’s one thing I do know that if I was doing my job as shit as them I’d be stood on me own in a concert hall. There’d be no audience, right, and that’s what makes me laugh about it. Our government is selfish, it’s only interested in power, personal power, personal politics, and the country is just an absolute f**king embarrassment.”He pauses, then shakes his head and adds, “David Cameron should be torn apart by an angry mob. Theresa May had\u0026nbspthe balls to try to stay in office and say I’ll see it out, not like that shithouse.”Though DJing with the Hacienda Classical tour will dominate this summer, Hooky does of course still keep his bass arm working, primarily with Peter Hook and The Light. That started in 2010, around the 30th anniversaryof Ian Curtis’s death, the same year he opened a new nightclub, The Factory, in the old\u0026nbspoffices of Factory Records\u0026nbspin Manchester. The Light performs Joy Division and New Order tracks, as they were meant to be heard, faithfully following the order of the songs on the albums.“I literally only booked one gig, which was at The Factory, and it was supposed to be a one-off celebration and we ended up doing two nights and we started getting loads of interest,” he recalls. “We hadn’t booked anything until we played, it all came out as a result of that and it was wonderful. I’d not played Joy Division songs for 30 years ... to actually start playing them was absolutely fantastic because we hardly ever did them as New Order.”According to Hooky, New Order “buried Joy Division along with Ian”, and they would only very occasionally revisit the old stuff, such as when manager Rob Gretton asked them to play Love Will Tear Us Apart “because it’s f**king so-and-so’s birthday”. He says, “I think we played in our whole career of New Order about three Joy Division songs.”That changed in 2006 when New Order played the first Manchester Versus Cancer gig, an initiative set up by Andy Rourke of The Smiths. They played a full set of Joy Division tunes. “It was absolutely fantastic, it was delightful, absolutely delightful to do,” says Hooky. “But I don’t think Barney liked doing it and I understand that. He wanted to do his own lyrics, he wanted to do his own songs, which makes perfect sense. But it was a frustration, because you’re sort of given something back for a moment and then it’s snatched off you again.But Hooky had developed a taste for performing the Joy Division songs he hadn’t played for 30 years, and The Light was born. In May 2020 The Light will perform the two Joy Division albums, Unknown Pleasures and Closer, in full, at the Manchester Apollo and the Brixton Academy. Again, they will be benefiting the Epilepsy Society and Calm. It will be 40 years, almost to the day, since Ian Curtis died.Without taking anything away from any of the musicians Hooky has worked with (his own son Jack has played with Monaco and The Light), I wonder if it wouldn’t just be simpler – and more satisfying for fans – to get the old band back together again to play these classic songs?We’re just a bunch of old men who are arguing, and we seem happy to keep doing that. But I do feel more and more that... well, life’s just too short, isn’t it?Hooky thinks for a long moment before musing, “With any group you’re always going to get a problem if the members of the group don’t get on. Look at The Smiths the only two that make most money out of it are Morrissey and Marr. It’s a great shame.”I wonder out loud what The Smiths would be like if they were still together as a band today. Hooky looks at me. “Well, what would New Order be like if they were going today?”And could that be a thing?“What happened at the end of New Order was that Bernard and I had completely different ideas about the group, the music, the attitude to business, and they were that far apart,” he says holding his hands wide. “And the only thing in the middle was Stephen. I had the opinion that Steve agreed with me and then found out afterwards that he seemed to agree with Bernard so I’m looking forward to his book for an explanation of that.“Then they reformed behind my back, and licensed the assets to themselves. Which is not exactly the most honourable thing to do but...” He shrugs. “It’s survival.”There was a long-running court case over Hook’s claim of lost royalties after the band’s “restructuring”, which was settled out of court in 2017. Bernard Sumner, Stephen Morris and Gillian Gilbert continue under the name New Order.Three decades since Technique, 40 years since Unknown Pleasures. Next year will be the 40th anniversary\u0026nbspof Ian Curtis’s death. Is there any change of a reconciliation on the horizon at all? Over the course of the interview, Hooky seems to have mellowed away from his initial defensive-offensive tactic of getting his attacks in first, albeit done with wry humour as they were. Now he seems almost reflective.“You asked me earlier what would happen if Barney walked in here,” he says. “We’re just a bunch of old men who are arguing, and we seem happy to keep doing that. But I do feel more and more that... well, life’s just too short, isn’t it?”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Together they must decide whether they can make room for the thing that “sparks joy” for both of them: their friendship.Created with Sketch.Hidden gems: The best Netflix originals you might have missed Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.120 Money Heist (TV series, one season, 2017–)Known as La Casa de Papel (House of Paper) in its native Spanish, Money Heist is Netflix’s most streamed non-English language show. The bank heist is a tired dramatic trope these days, but don’t let that, or the show’s bland English-language title, put you off – creator Álex Pina has made something special. The heist here, led by a mysterious man known only as The Professor, involves breaking into the Royal Mint of Spain and printing off €2.4 billion. There are even more twists in the show’s 15 episodes than there are hostages. 220 American Vandal (TV series, two seasons, 2017–2018)Part satire of true crime documentaries such as Making a Murderer, part carefully observed portrayal of teenage life, American Vandal was criminally underappreciated during its two season run. It’s been cancelled now, but that doesn’t mean you can’t catch up with it, and then write Netflix a strongly worded email.320 One Day at a Time (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)In stark contrast to the off-beat, low-key comedy that currently rules TV – the kind that provokes a wry smirk rather than a hearty laugh – One Day at a Time is a big, bright sitcom filmed in front of an interminably enthusiastic studio audience. You wouldn’t have thought that the story of a Cuban-American army veteran  nurse  single mother – who suffers from PTSD and depression – would fit into this format, but it does so beautifully, tackling issues of sexuality, racism and sexism in the process.  Based on writer  director Tamara Jenkins’s own fertility struggles, Private Life stars Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti (both giving brilliant performances) as a spiky, loving middle-aged couple desperate to have a baby. They even rope their enthusiastic but irresponsible niece Sadie (Kayli Carter) into the mix, much to the horror of Sadie’s mother (Molly Shannon, turning a potentially repellent character into one worthy of empathy). It’s subtle, restrained and beautifully realised.520 Big Mouth (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Crude, rude, and rife with surprise emissions and bodily functions, animated sitcom Big Mouth is also a sensitive, nuanced deep e into the various horrors of teenagehood. When 12-year-old Andrew Glouberman (John Mulaney) is visited by the hormone monster (Nick Kroll, who voices many of the show’s best characters), he finds his life irreversibly – and seemingly disastrously – changed. Unlike many other puberty-centred comedies, Big Mouth makes as much time for its confused female protagonists as its male ones Maya Rudolph is a delight as the female hormone monster, and look out for Kristen Wiig’s wonderful turn as a talking vagina.  620 Easy (TV series, two seasons, 2016–)Joe Swanberg’s style of defiantly undramatic mumblecore isn’t for everyone, but if you enjoyed his earlier films, Drinking Buddies and Happy Christmas, you’ll find plenty to admire in this anthology comedy-drama series. Big-name stars such as Orlando Bloom and Aubrey Plaza crop up, but Jane Adams – who you might remember from Todd Solondz’s chronically depressing 1998 film Happiness – is the show’s heart, and Marc Maron is its jaded soul.Community’s Gillian Jacobs is brilliant as the prickly, magnetic recovering addict Mickey, who forms an unlikely – and arguably deeply unwise – relationship with her nerdy neighbour Gus (Paul Rust). Despite Gus’s pathological need to be the nice guy, we’re never quite sure who or what we’re rooting for – which is what makes Love such complex, compelling viewing.  In 2016, comedian Patton Oswalt’s wife, the true crime writer Michelle McNamara, died suddenly in her sleep. That subject matter doesn’t exactly scream “stand-up special”, but out of his devastating loss, Oswalt managed to craft something funny and profound. Over the course of an hour, he processes his grief onstage, managing to find humour in the struggle to raise his grieving six-year-old daughter alone.920 Santa Clarita Diet (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Granted, this horror-comedy – which stars Drew Barrymore as a neurotic real estate agent who suddenly develops a taste for human flesh – is really silly, and really, really disgusting. But it’s also strangely charming, and funny. Timothy Olyphant is excellent as Sheila’s frazzled husband Joel, and the pair’s idiosyncratic but respectful relationship with their smart teenage daughter Abby (Liv Hewson) isn’t quite like anything else on TV right now.1020 Dark Tourist (TV series, one season, 2018–)New Zealand journalist David Farrier is an unlikely TV presenter in the same way that Louis Theroux is – in just about every scenario in which he finds himself, he’s a little bit awkward. But as with Theroux, Farrier’s weakness is actually his strength, allowing him to endear himself to the many unusual people he meets on his journey through the world’s most questionable tourist destinations. Farrier’s stops include the site of the Fukushima nuclear disaster, the road where JFK was assassinated, and the Milwaukee suburbs where serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer murdered his victims.1120 Sacred Games (TV series, one season, 2018–)Based on Vikram Chandra’s epic 2006 novel, Netflix’s first Indian original series is a slowly unfolding gem. The first season of Sacred Games – which follows a troubled police officer (Saif Ali Khan) who has 25 days to save his city thanks to a tip-off from a presumed dead gangster – only covered one quarter of Chandra’s 1,000-page novel. As the show itself declared when it announced the forthcoming second season, “the worst is yet to come”.When the trailer for Dumplin’ first landed, it seemed all the ingredients were in place for a film that was at worst tone-deaf, and at best vaguely patronising. Thank heavens, then, that the trailer did Dumplin’ such a disservice. Starring Danielle Macdonald (who broke out in the excellent 2017 film Patti Cake$) as Willowdean, a self-described “fat girl” who enters a local pageant to annoy her former beauty queen mother (Jennifer Aniston), Dumplin’ is as funny, warm and sensitive as its protagonist – and with a killer Dolly Parton-laden soundtrack to boot.1320 Dark (TV series, one season, 2017–)This sci-fi thriller – which features disappearing children, a mysterious local power plant, and scenes set in the Eighties – has, for obvious reasons, drawn comparisons to Stranger Things. But Dark is even more beguiling and (true to its name) less family-friendly than Stranger Things.1420 The Death and Life of Marsha P Johnson (Film, 2017)Though it’s been somewhat tarnished by claims that director David France appropriated the work and research of trans film-maker Reina Gossett, this documentary is nonetheless a loving, respectful tribute to gay rights activist Marsha P Johnson. One of the key figures in the Stonewall uprising (though her involvement was almost entirely eradicated in 2015’s critically hated Stonewall), Johnson modelled for Andy Warhol, performed onstage with drag group Hot Peaches, helped found the Gay Liberation Front, and then died under suspicious circumstances in 1992.1520 On My Block (TV series, one season, 2018–)This coming-of-age series might not have found as many eyeballs as it deserved last year, but those it did find were glued to the screen. In fact, it was the most-binged show of 2018 – meaning that it had the highest watch-time-per-viewing session of any Netflix original. Created by Awkward’s Lauren Iungerich, On My Block follows a group of Los Angeles teens as they navigate both the drama of high school and the danger of inner-city life.Two beleaguered assistants (Zoey Deutch and Glen Powell) conspire to get their over-demanding bosses (Taye Diggs and Lucy Liu) together in order to get their lives back in this winning romantic comedy. Set It Up is responsible not only for coining the term “over-dicking” (it’s much more innocent than it sounds), but for rejuvenating a tired genre.Martin Freeman stars as the father struggling to protect his young daughter from a zombie epidemic spreading across Australia. So far, so overdone. But this drama thriller, directed by Ben Howling and Yolanda Ramke and based on their 2013 short of the same name, throws a handful of unpredictable ners in the works.    1920 Godless (TV series, one season, 2017–)With shades of John Ford\u0027s The Searchers, this languorous western was critically acclaimed but swiftly forgotten after it landed on Netflix in 2016. Set in 1884, it\u0027s about Frank Griffin (Jeff Daniels) and his notoriously ruthless gang of outlaws’ pursuit of their injured former ally Roy Goode (Jack O’Connell), who is hiding out in a small town populated solely by women after a mining accident killed off all its men. A gun-toting Michelle Dockery, clearly relishing the change of scenery after years of Downton Abbey, and a taciturn Jack O’Connell, are on brilliant form.2020 Atypical (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)This coming-of-age series about a teenage boy with autism was sweet and well-intentioned from the start, but its first season was criticised for a handful of inaccuracies, and for its lack of autistic actors. Rather than drowning in a sea of defensiveness – as too many shows tend to do – it listened, and brought in autistic actors and writers for its excellent second season.120 Money Heist (TV series, one season, 2017–)Known as La Casa de Papel (House of Paper) in its native Spanish, Money Heist is Netflix’s most streamed non-English language show. The bank heist is a tired dramatic trope these days, but don’t let that, or the show’s bland English-language title, put you off – creator Álex Pina has made something special.

Netlfix later withdrew its films from the festival after organisers\u0026nbspruled\u0026nbspthat\u0026nbspall entries needed French theatrical distribution.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Cannes 2019: What the critics are saying Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Jim Jarmusch\u0027s The Dead Don\u0027t Die opened Cannes Film Festival to mixed reviews. The Independent\u0027s Geoffrey Macnab wrote that the cast – including Bill Murray, Adam Driver and Steve Buscemi – gave strangely listless and deadpan performances. The two-star review continued: Tilda Swinton brings some comic vim to her role as a samurai-like undertaker with a broad Scottish accent while Caleb Landry Jones and Danny Glover are good value as they take a stand against the undead in the local convenience store, but neither the satire nor the slapstick here are as sharp as you would like them to be.Dexter Fletcher’s Elton John biopic Rocketman had its world premiere at Cannes. While The  awarded the film with five stars, most other publications were more muted. The Independent\u0027s Geoffrey Macnab called the film a rousing and emotional affair with an operatic sweep. However, he added: At times, Rocketman risks turning into a chronicle of woe. Much of the film focuses on the years when Elton was abusing alcohol and drugs. He was miserable in his own life and took out his unhappiness on those closest to him. This doesn’t make him very good company. It can become tiresome to hear him say yet again how much he hates himself. However, Fletcher films even the darkest scenes in a very flamboyant fashion and manages to leaven matters with some ironic humour.Ken Loach, two-time winner of the Palme d\u0027Or, returned to the festival with Sorry We Missed You. Late in his career, Loach retains the ability to make heart-wrenching and very topical dramas that expose the grimmer aspects of contemporary British society, wrote Geoffrey Macnab in a five-star review for The Independent. Scripted by his regular collaborator Paul Laverty, this is another of Loach’s films about decent people trying to do the best for themselves but being defeated by a system in which \u0027everything is out of whack.\u0027 Other publications were equally positive about the film.420 Pain and GloryGeoffrey Macnab described Pedro Almodóvar\u0027s Pain and Glory as the kind of indulgent and self-absorbed film that only a director with such a glittering career behind him would be allowed to get away with. The four-star review continued: It’s about a filmmaker looking back on his past, mulling over his life and relationships. Imagine a Spanish version of a Bergman or Woody Allen film about love and loss and you will come close to its essence. It’s a wonderfully evocative affair with a subtle, soulful performance from Antonio Banderas.520 Once Upon a Time in HollywoodProbably the biggest film of the festival, Quentin Tarantino\u0027s Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood, was met with almost unanimous praise. Quite simply, I just defy anyone with red blood in their veins not to respond to the crazy bravura of Tarantino’s film-making, not to be bounced around the auditorium at the moment-by-moment enjoyment that this movie delivers – and conversely, of course, to shudder at the horror and cruelty and its hallucinatory aftermath, wrote Peter Bradshaw in , awarding the film full marks. Variety was slightly more damning, with Owen Gleiberman writing: By the end, Tarantino has done something that’s quintessentially Tarantino, but that no longer feels even vaguely revolutionary. He has reduced the story he’s telling to pulp.Willem Dafoe and Robert Pattinson star in Robert Eggers\u0027s follow-up to The Witch. Titled The Lighthouse, the two-header won over critics, with both The  and  awarding the film five stars. The film is shot in inky black and white, on grainy 35mm film, and presented in a series of rigorously composed square frames, wrote Kevin Maher in The Times. It has the feel of a newly discovered artefact from FW Murnau (Nosferatu) and is certainly one of the most beautiful-looking movies at the festival. If it has a palpable flaw, it’s that the style sometimes overwhelms. More head than heart. The final image is so breathtaking, however, that you can forgive even this.Bong Joon-ho was last at Cannes with the Netflix film Okja. His return with Parasite was met with critical acclaim. Peter Bradshaw of  described the film as a luxuriously watchable and satirical suspense drama. He added: It runs as purringly smooth as the Mercedes driven by the lead character, played by Korean star Song Kang-ho. Parasite is a bizarre black comedy about social status, aspiration, materialism and the patriarchal family unit, and people who accept the idea of having (or leasing) a servant class.Director Ladj Ly\u0027s debut turned heads at Cannes. Nicholas Barber of the BBC wrote that the racially charged urban drama about the hostility between police and civilians is impressive but lost momentum in the middle. However, Barber concluded: Just when you think that the story is drifting towards an obvious ending, there is an explosion of savage action which, although highly implausible, is so shocking, exciting and politically fascinating that it blasts the film into a different level.920 Portrait of a Lady on FireFew films received praise equal to Portrait of a Lady on Fire. The film website IndieWire awarded French filmmaker Céline Sciamma\u0027s film an A grade. Critic David Ehrlich wrote: “Portrait of a Lady on Fire is a profoundly tender story about the process of self-discovery and becoming... The film is paced at the speed of a world that’s lit by candlelight, the sex is sensual without being provocative, and the third act will frustrate anyone hoping for a more radical takedown of heteronormative structures.Russian talent Kantemir Balagov may be just 27 years old, but the director has already won over critics from across the world. The first sounds, over the black of the opening titles, are of tiny, gasping breaths catching in a throat, wrote Variety\u0027s Jessica Kiang of Balagov\u0027s second feature film. It could be a death rattle or an asthma attack or the last throes of a strangulation, but it is undoubtedly a human in distress. And it’s a very close analogy for how Beanpole, the slow, ferocious, and extraordinary film from Balagov, can make you feel. You quite often have to remind yourself to breathe.French-Senegalese director Mati Diop was the first black female director to ever compete for the Palme d’Or. Her film, Atlantics, won positive reviews, with Screenrant\u0027s Allan Hunter writing: Constantly intriguing, Atlantics successfully blends its disparate elements of love story, ghost story and female empowerment into a distinctive, involving drama.Danielle Lessovitz\u0027s Port Authority went down well with audiences. The Hollywood Reporter described the film as a boy-meets-trans girl romance about identity and belonging around the New York underground ballroom scene. Their critic David Rooney wrote of the film: There\u0027s a disarming gentleness to Port Authority, echoed in composer Matthew Herbert\u0027s subtle score, that makes this story of love, family and self-discovery quite satisfying.Diao Yinan\u0027s first film since Black Coal, which won the Golden Bear at Berlin Film Festical in 2014, received mixed reviews. Peter Bradshaw wrote in the  that The Wild Goose Lake is a movie showcasing similar flourishes of brilliance, violent impacts and setpiece bravura – but also some of the same slightly stolid, opaque style that made me a little agnostic about that 2014 hit. One fan was Tarantino himself who is reported to have cried at the film\u0027s premiere.Another directing debut, this one from French actor and screenwriter Maryam Touzani. The Hollywood Reporter\u0027s Deborah Young described Adam as a bright addition to Cannes\u0027 Un Certain Regard section. She added: With great delicacy, Touzani shows how Moroccan society censures a woman who gives birth outside marriage — not a terribly original theme, but here it is made heartrending by the superb performances of Lubna Azabal and Nisrin Erradi in the lead roles.Michael Angelo Covino\u0027s debut The Climb, described as depicting a bromance by numerous outlets, was met by rave reviews. The Climb is a fantastic film about frenemies, bringing craft and intelligence to what easily could have been a hackneyed, boring bit of cringe comedy, wrote Jason Gorber for SlashFilm. Instead there’s genuine heart at the connection between these two, foolish and friendly and flawed in equal measure. With bravura cinematic flourishes that never get in the way of the character moments, this remarkable film clambers its way into your heart as you find yourself rooting even for these decidedly awkward iniduals.Corneliu Porumboiu\u0027s noir suspense thriller The Whistlers was compared to Neil Jordan’s Mona Lisa and Orson Welles’ The Lady from Shanghai by \u0027s Peter Bradshaw. Porumboiu gives us a knotty, twisty, nifty plot that’s quite involved but hangs together well, and there’s an amusing juxtaposition of gloomy, rainy Bucharest and the sunny terrain of La Gomera, he continued. We also get a neat and unexpected coda. An elegant and stylishly crafted piece of entertainment.1720 Joan of Arc (Jeanne)Bruno Dumont\u0027s sequel to Jeannette: The Childhood of Joan of Arc, simply titled Joan of Arc, received equally as negative reviews as its 2017 predecessor. Enthusiasts of the prolific Dumont will surely get something out of this latest effort — as perhaps will Joan of Arc movie adaptation completists, wrote Jordan Mintzer in The Hollywood Reporter. But beyond that niche, many will find watching the 137-minute movie akin to being burnt at the stake.The Dardenne brothers\u0027 latest effort, a taut study of a devout 13-year-old Muslim, marked a rare misfire for the directing duo. On the aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes, the film sits – following the festival screening – as their lowest rated work yet. Charles Bramesco of Little White Lies wrote: The Dardennes have often settled on not-knowing in their work, only here, that acceptance of uncertainty plays like a concession that they\u0027re in over their heads.Despite starring Isabelle Huppert, Ira Sachs\u0027 Frankie has ided critics like no other film at the festival. Whereas  awarded the film a squalid one star, The Hollywood Reporter called Huppert magnetic in the starring role. IndieWire concluded: It\u0027s like an elegant bracelet that\u0027s modest enough to go unnoticed, but nevertheless reveals a quietly exquisite beauty to those who are willing to lean in and look closer (even if they have to squint).Terrence Malick made his return to Cannes with A Hidden Life. While critics have been harsh on the director\u0027s more recent works, he\u0027s impressed many with his latest effort. It may not have the stellar Hollywood casts of his last couple of films, but it has the driving sense of purpose, wrote Nicholas Barber for the BBC. It even has a proper screenplay, instead of hours of sleepy improvisation. The fact that it is gorgeous to look at is a bonus.Jim Jarmusch\u0027s The Dead Don\u0027t Die opened Cannes Film Festival to mixed reviews. The Independent\u0027s Geoffrey Macnab wrote that the cast – including Bill Murray, Adam Driver and Steve Buscemi – gave strangely listless and deadpan performances. The two-star review continued: Tilda Swinton brings some comic vim to her role as a samurai-like undertaker with a broad Scottish accent while Caleb Landry Jones and Danny Glover are good value as they take a stand against the undead in the local convenience store, but neither the satire nor the slapstick here are as sharp as you would like them to be.Dexter Fletcher’s Elton John biopic Rocketman had its world premiere at Cannes. While The  awarded the film with five stars, most other publications were more muted. The Independent\u0027s Geoffrey Macnab called the film a rousing and emotional affair with an operatic sweep. However, he added: At times, Rocketman risks turning into a chronicle of woe. Much of the film focuses on the years when Elton was abusing alcohol and drugs. He was miserable in his own life and took out his unhappiness on those closest to him. This doesn’t make him very good company. It can become tiresome to hear him say yet again how much he hates himself. However, Fletcher films even the darkest scenes in a very flamboyant fashion and manages to leaven matters with some ironic humour.Ken Loach, two-time winner of the Palme d\u0027Or, returned to the festival with Sorry We Missed You. Late in his career, Loach retains the ability to make heart-wrenching and very topical dramas that expose the grimmer aspects of contemporary British society, wrote Geoffrey Macnab in a five-star review for The Independent. Scripted by his regular collaborator Paul Laverty, this is another of Loach’s films about decent people trying to do the best for themselves but being defeated by a system in which \u0027everything is out of whack.\u0027 Other publications were equally positive about the film.420 Pain and GloryGeoffrey Macnab described Pedro Almodóvar\u0027s Pain and Glory as the kind of indulgent and self-absorbed film that only a director with such a glittering career behind him would be allowed to get away with. The four-star review continued: It’s about a filmmaker looking back on his past, mulling over his life and relationships. Imagine a Spanish version of a Bergman or Woody Allen film about love and loss and you will come close to its essence. It’s a wonderfully evocative affair with a subtle, soulful performance from Antonio Banderas.520 Once Upon a Time in HollywoodProbably the biggest film of the festival, Quentin Tarantino\u0027s Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood, was met with almost unanimous praise. Quite simply, I just defy anyone with red blood in their veins not to respond to the crazy bravura of Tarantino’s film-making, not to be bounced around the auditorium at the moment-by-moment enjoyment that this movie delivers – and conversely, of course, to shudder at the horror and cruelty and its hallucinatory aftermath, wrote Peter Bradshaw in , awarding the film full marks. Variety was slightly more damning, with Owen Gleiberman writing: By the end, Tarantino has done something that’s quintessentially Tarantino, but that no longer feels even vaguely revolutionary. He has reduced the story he’s telling to pulp.Willem Dafoe and Robert Pattinson star in Robert Eggers\u0027s follow-up to The Witch. Titled The Lighthouse, the two-header won over critics, with both The  and  awarding the film five stars. The film is shot in inky black and white, on grainy 35mm film, and presented in a series of rigorously composed square frames, wrote Kevin Maher in The Times. It has the feel of a newly discovered artefact from FW Murnau (Nosferatu) and is certainly one of the most beautiful-looking movies at the festival. If it has a palpable flaw, it’s that the style sometimes overwhelms. More head than heart. The final image is so breathtaking, however, that you can forgive even this.Bong Joon-ho was last at Cannes with the Netflix film Okja. His return with Parasite was met with critical acclaim. Peter Bradshaw of  described the film as a luxuriously watchable and satirical suspense drama. He added: It runs as purringly smooth as the Mercedes driven by the lead character, played by Korean star Song Kang-ho. Parasite is a bizarre black comedy about social status, aspiration, materialism and the patriarchal family unit, and people who accept the idea of having (or leasing) a servant class.Director Ladj Ly\u0027s debut turned heads at Cannes. Nicholas Barber of the BBC wrote that the racially charged urban drama about the hostility between police and civilians is impressive but lost momentum in the middle. However, Barber concluded: Just when you think that the story is drifting towards an obvious ending, there is an explosion of savage action which, although highly implausible, is so shocking, exciting and politically fascinating that it blasts the film into a different level.920 Portrait of a Lady on FireFew films received praise equal to Portrait of a Lady on Fire. The film website IndieWire awarded French filmmaker Céline Sciamma\u0027s film an A grade. Critic David Ehrlich wrote: “Portrait of a Lady on Fire is a profoundly tender story about the process of self-discovery and becoming... The film is paced at the speed of a world that’s lit by candlelight, the sex is sensual without being provocative, and the third act will frustrate anyone hoping for a more radical takedown of heteronormative structures.Russian talent Kantemir Balagov may be just 27 years old, but the director has already won over critics from across the world. The first sounds, over the black of the opening titles, are of tiny, gasping breaths catching in a throat, wrote Variety\u0027s Jessica Kiang of Balagov\u0027s second feature film. It could be a death rattle or an asthma attack or the last throes of a strangulation, but it is undoubtedly a human in distress. And it’s a very close analogy for how Beanpole, the slow, ferocious, and extraordinary film from Balagov, can make you feel. You quite often have to remind yourself to breathe.French-Senegalese director Mati Diop was the first black female director to ever compete for the Palme d’Or. Her film, Atlantics, won positive reviews, with Screenrant\u0027s Allan Hunter writing: Constantly intriguing, Atlantics successfully blends its disparate elements of love story, ghost story and female empowerment into a distinctive, involving drama.Danielle Lessovitz\u0027s Port Authority went down well with audiences. The Hollywood Reporter described the film as a boy-meets-trans girl romance about identity and belonging around the New York underground ballroom scene. Their critic David Rooney wrote of the film: There\u0027s a disarming gentleness to Port Authority, echoed in composer Matthew Herbert\u0027s subtle score, that makes this story of love, family and self-discovery quite satisfying.Diao Yinan\u0027s first film since Black Coal, which won the Golden Bear at Berlin Film Festical in 2014, received mixed reviews. Peter Bradshaw wrote in the  that The Wild Goose Lake is a movie showcasing similar flourishes of brilliance, violent impacts and setpiece bravura – but also some of the same slightly stolid, opaque style that made me a little agnostic about that 2014 hit. One fan was Tarantino himself who is reported to have cried at the film\u0027s premiere.Another directing debut, this one from French actor and screenwriter Maryam Touzani. The Hollywood Reporter\u0027s Deborah Young described Adam as a bright addition to Cannes\u0027 Un Certain Regard section. She added: With great delicacy, Touzani shows how Moroccan society censures a woman who gives birth outside marriage — not a terribly original theme, but here it is made heartrending by the superb performances of Lubna Azabal and Nisrin Erradi in the lead roles.Michael Angelo Covino\u0027s debut The Climb, described as depicting a bromance by numerous outlets, was met by rave reviews. The Climb is a fantastic film about frenemies, bringing craft and intelligence to what easily could have been a hackneyed, boring bit of cringe comedy, wrote Jason Gorber for SlashFilm. Instead there’s genuine heart at the connection between these two, foolish and friendly and flawed in equal measure. With bravura cinematic flourishes that never get in the way of the character moments, this remarkable film clambers its way into your heart as you find yourself rooting even for these decidedly awkward iniduals.Corneliu Porumboiu\u0027s noir suspense thriller The Whistlers was compared to Neil Jordan’s Mona Lisa and Orson Welles’ The Lady from Shanghai by \u0027s Peter Bradshaw.

Dean Turner, UK economist as UBS Wealth Management, forecast that the pound could crash to as low as 1.15 against the dollar and close to parity against the euro in the event of a no-deal Brexit. He warned investors not to be complacent about the prospect.“Despite mounting public impatience over the process, many top officials and lawmakers remain fearful of the economic damage from a no-deal exit,” said Mr Turner.“Lingering uncertainty would likely cause firms to delay investment, and keep sterling under downward pressure.”“A UK decision to remain an EU member would likely cause a swift rebound in sterling, which we believe is undervalued relative to its purchasing power parity level of around USD 1.58.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Has argued that a no-deal exit would reflect the result of the 2016 referendum. The\u0026nbspformer mayor of London\u0026nbspwas once seen as the “Heineken candidate” capable of reaching voters other Tories could not. But his star has waned among Tory\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspleft unimpressed by his two years as foreign secretary.\u0026nbspHis popularity among Tory activists would give him a strong chance of winning if he made the final shortlist, but he might be blocked by a determined “stop Boris” campaign already being planned by his critics. If successful, the move would anger many Tory activists.Leadsom’s\u0026nbspleadership hopes have been revived (Getty)Resigned from the cabinet on the eve of the European elections, saying she no longer believed the government’s approach would deliver the Brexit referendum result the people voted for.She showed her inexperience in the 2016 leadership election, withdrawing to leave May as the last candidate standing after making comments appearing to suggest\u0026nbspshe would make a better leader because she had children.Javid is one of the frontrunners to replace Theresa May (Jack TaylorGetty)Backed Remain in 2016 referendum despite his Eurosceptic instincts. Now a keen Brexiteer, and prepared to keep a no-deal exit on the table. Has consistently challenged\u0026nbspMay in cabinet meetings.Ambitious and has a brilliant backstory as the son of Pakistani bus driver who came to the UK with £1 in his pocket. But appears to be suffering from the curse of being one of the frontrunners in the Tory race. His stock has fallen recently after what some MPs see as unforced errors such as his handling of\u0026nbspmigrants crossing the English channel and his decision to strip Isis schoolgirl Shamima Begum of her UK citizenship.Remainer who briefly supported a Final Say referendum on the Brexit deal after the 2016 vote. Now rejects the idea, and is seen as a born-again Brexiteer who also wants to keep a no-deal departure on the table.His pitch would be as the candidate who could unite the Tories’ warring factions. Tory members might judge him too much of a Remainer. Critics worry that his long stint as\u0026nbsphealth secretary\u0026nbspcould return to haunt him at a general election. Could benefit from a slide in Javid’s fortunes, but will not want to overtake him to become\u0026nbspthe frontrunner.Along with Johnson, headed the victorious Vote Leave campaign in the 2016 referendum. Even his critics admit he is one of the few successful departmental ministers since his surprise return to May’s cabinet in 2017, a year after she sacked him.Has been a loyal and articulate promoter of the withdrawal agreement. Critics see this as in part an attempt to shed his reputation as an assassin who turned on\u0026nbspJohnson\u0026nbspto run for the leadership in 2016.Gove’s\u0026nbsprefusal to join other Brexiteers in resigning from the cabinet might count against him among\u0026nbspEurosceptics. However, many of them are now coming round to his strategy of getting the deal “over the line” to save Brexit.Eurosceptic former chief of staff to David Davis, and followed his path by becoming and then resigning as Brexit secretary, complaining he was kept out of the loop by May and her civil service negotiator Olly Robbins. Displayed a grip on the detail while in the job, and impressed May allies in the 2016 referendum when he campaigned for Leave.\u0026nbspBut did not impress Brussels officials.A fresh face, although his relative lack of cabinet experience could count against him. But a\u0026nbspdark horse to watch in a leadership race. Has a big decision to make: will he back May’s deal if Johnson\u0026nbspdoes, or decide to have clean hands and oppose it to the end, and potentially be on the losing side?A new entrant in the leadership race and, at 40, could be the youngest candidate. A rare breed in the May government as a survivor of David Cameron’s regime: before becoming an MP in 2010, he was chief of staff to George Osborne. Impressed as culture secretary, as one of the few UK politicians to understand the digital era and power of the internet giants. Has also shown grip in a testing job since his promotion to health and social care secretary.Smooth media performer who does not lack ambition. Described by some MPs as “a better version of Jeremy Hunt”, he is Remainer-turned-Leaver who could unite his fractious party. Has gone into bat for May’s deal when others kept their head down. Could be part of a “stop Boris” drive in which Johnson’s rivals try to share out MPs’ votes to keep him off the shortlist. Seen by some Tories as the leader after next.The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This partisan thing completely passes me by and, when I look across Europe, they seem to do pretty well with coalitions.“I don’t know what the format will be, but will we be singing from the same hymn sheet?

Of course we are, because everybody’s different. But do we all agree that the long goal is something centrist together?

Here’s everything you need to know about them.What is the vote for?The European Parliament is one of the EU’s institutions, and it’s democratically elected by all 28 member states. Because the UK hasn’t left yet, it will also elect MEPs – 73 of the total 751.\u0026nbspBecause of its large population UK elects the third most MEPs after any country, with Germany (96) and France (74) electing the most.What do the elections decide?They’ll decide the composition of the European Parliament, which has to pass EU laws and scrutinises the activities of the EU. The Parliament also plays a role in choosing the next European Commission president – the EU’s executive. They’ll replace the current president, Jean-Claude Juncker, after a negotiations between the parliament and member state governments.Created with Sketch.Opposing protesters flock to parliament on would be date of Brexit Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Pro-Brexit leave the European Union supporters attend a rally in Parliament Square after the final leg of the March to Leave in LondonThe protest march which started on March 16 in Sunderland, north east England, finished on what was the original date for Brexit to happen before the recent extensionA Brexit supporter sips a can of Stella in protests outside of the Houses of ParliamentDedicated anti-Brexit campaigner Steve Bray and likewise pro-Brexit campaigner Joseph Afrane go head to head near the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit marching band in Parliament SquareRemain supporters wave EU flags from a bus in Parliament SquareA Brexit supporter protests outside of the Houses of ParliamentBrexit supporters protest outside of the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit flag is waved in Parliament SquareThe March to Leave nears the Houses of ParliamentBrexit supporters carry the coffin of democracyBrexit supporters take part in the March to Leave protest in LondonA Brexit supporter holds a sign outside the Houses of ParliamentA man holds satirical paintings of politiciansAn pro-Brexit float on the March to Leave march in LondonFar-right activist Tommy Robinson addresses protesters outside the Houses of ParliamentA Brexit supporter outside the Houses of ParliamentA Tommy Robinson supporter arrives at the Houses of Parliament A jogger gestures rudely at a Brexit supporter outside of the Houses of ParliamentA Brexit supporter outside the Houses of ParliamentPro-Brexit leave the European Union supporters attend a rally in Parliament Square after the final leg of the March to Leave in LondonThe protest march which started on March 16 in Sunderland, north east England, finished on what was the original date for Brexit to happen before the recent extensionA Brexit supporter sips a can of Stella in protests outside of the Houses of ParliamentDedicated anti-Brexit campaigner Steve Bray and likewise pro-Brexit campaigner Joseph Afrane go head to head near the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit marching band in Parliament SquareRemain supporters wave EU flags from a bus in Parliament SquareA Brexit supporter protests outside of the Houses of ParliamentBrexit supporters protest outside of the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit flag is waved in Parliament SquareThe March to Leave nears the Houses of ParliamentBrexit supporters carry the coffin of democracyBrexit supporters take part in the March to Leave protest in LondonA Brexit supporter holds a sign outside the Houses of ParliamentA man holds satirical paintings of politiciansAn pro-Brexit float on the March to Leave march in LondonFar-right activist Tommy Robinson addresses protesters outside the Houses of ParliamentA Brexit supporter outside the Houses of ParliamentA Tommy Robinson supporter arrives at the Houses of Parliament A jogger gestures rudely at a Brexit supporter outside of the Houses of ParliamentA Brexit supporter outside the Houses of ParliamentThis also means the result will be roughly proportional to the votes cast, so every vote potentially counts towards the final result. Smaller parties will get representation too, unlike at Westminster.\u0026nbspEach UK party is also affiliated with a wider European group – so Labour sit in the socialist group, the Liberal Democrats sit in a pan-European liberal alliance, etc.Will this affect Brexit?The results won’t directly affect Brexit – MEPs don’t really have actual input into the Brexit process. Indirectly, some voters may choose to use the elections to send a message to other parties about their Brexit policies, if they are so inclined.Who is going to win?The polls show the Brexit Party, Nigel Farage’s outfit, well ahead of the other parties, with the vast majority of surveys showing Labour in a clear second place and others behind.When this all happening?The UK voted on Thursday – though other countries vote on slightly different days, as different states prefer to have their elections on specific days of the week.The results will be sealed until polls close in the last member states, at 10pm UK time on the Sunday evening, when final counting will start. The results are expected shortly after that throughout the night, though some member states might take longer.\u0026nbspNorthern Ireland and the Scottish isles also do not count on a Sunday, so their results will come on Monday, when the full picture will start to emerge.How do I vote?You should have already registered to vote by now. If you have, you should be sent a polling card with instructions of where to go on Thursday to cast your ballot.\u0026nbspThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Cool them downRemove their clothes, to help lower their body temperature.If the room theyre in is hot, open a window or door to get a flow of fresh air through the room.Step . Wait and watchWhen the seizure is over, help your baby rest on their side with their head tilted slight back to ensure their airways are open.If their symptoms continue or its your childs first fit, call a doctor and get medical advice.In the modern world, most homes will now be cluttered with chargers for ious devices - from smartphones to fitness trackers.But as most parents will know, young children will be tempted to put anything in their mouths, including electrical items that might still be plugged in.Always unplug the cable and store it away somewhere safe.With stores now charging for plastic bags, many of us will find were actually clinging on to more of them in our homes so we can re-use.But bags pose a serious suffocation hazardplayed with.Be sure to keep yours out of reach and sight of youngsters.If theyre not breathing move on to step two.Step . Tell someone to dial If youre on your own carry out rescue breaths, and chest compressions described below for one minute, then dial .Step . Give five rescue breathsTilt your babys head back, seal your mouth over their mouth and nose and blow steadily.Repeat five times.Step . Give  chest compressionsPush firmly in the middle of your babys chest with two fingers and then release.Maintain a regular rate of around two compressions per second.Repeat  times.Step . Give two rescue breathsThen continue with cycles of  chest compressions and two rescue breaths until help arrives.More drugs are being prescribed than ever before and according to the NHS, medicines are the cause of over  per cent of hospital admissions for poisoning in under-fives.Where possible, only buy or request medicines which come in child-resistant packaging and never empty them into easy to open and unlabelled containers.Remember, child-resistant does not mean packaging is entirely child-proof, so always keep all medicines out of reach of children.More people are making the switch to e-cigarettes, which reduces the risk of burns for children.But it comes with a new worry.E-Liquid refills contain large quantities of concentrated nicotine which is highly toxic when ingested, inhaled or touched.Never let your child near your vaping products or leave them lying around and for peace of mind, choose a vaping brand whose packaging has child-resistant features.Another potential hazard for young children involves blind cords, with official statistics revealing suffocation or strangulation was the cause of death for half of all under-ones who die.And for those aged one to four that drops slightly, but only to  per cent.There have been multiple cases where a toddler or small child has got themselves entangled in the cord, leading to death.The Government’s safety leaflet instructs parents to keep blind cords away from cots and even nappy changing units.Hit them firmly on their back between the shoulder blades up to five times.If back blows dont dislodge the object, move on to step two.Step . Give up to five chest thrustsTurn your baby over so they are facing upwards and place two fingers in the middle of their chest just below the nipples.Push sharply downwards up to five times.Step . Call the object does not dislodgeContinue with cycles of back blows and chest thrusts until the blockage clears or help arrives."},{"url":null,"title":"brexit party victory election kicking tories labour deserve","story":"The Conservatives have failed catastrophically on Brexit. We should have left the EU on March . We’re still in.Labour have angered Leavers AND Remainers with their lies and trickery.So we entirely understand Leave-backing Sun readers casting a protest vote for Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party. It is hard to justy anything . This election should not even be taking place.We have one caveat: Tory MEP Dan Hannan would be a loss. The Westminster chaos is not his doing.The stalwart Leave campaigner is the brightest and best-informed MEP we have. The Brexit vote might have been lost without him.But Hannan may too be swept away by the tide. The polls already had Farage miles ahead even before Theresa May’s final, suicidal capitulation over the ­second referendum and customs union.A majority of MPs, most notably the “people’s vote” brigade, have spent three years trashing our democracy. A huge Brexit Party victory ought to scare the living daylights out of them.That can only be a good thing.THOSE who predicted Theresa May would be a poor Prime Minister have regrettably been vindicated.In fairness, her task has been harder than any predecessor’s since Winston Churchill. It became all but impossible after she blew her majority in .Even so, Mrs May and her woeful Cabinet of mainly third-rate friends have failed on Brexit and the social justice mission she initially championed.Andrea Leadsom cannot bear to be a part of it any longer.All PMs want a “legacy”. It can be the only reason Mrs May has clung on so long.And though she will leave office with none to speak of, she can at least retain her dignity in defeat.Even that is ebbing way.PUBLIC money should not be spent ­shoring up British Steel.Its collapse is devastating for thousands of workers — and the first move must be to try to secure a buyer to make the business viable. That’s a tall order.The second is to probe why private firm Greybull, which bought it for £, presides over so many corporate disasters.But under EU rules the Government cannot pour state aid directly into a failing business. Nor should it.It should spend millions instead retraining those workers and funding tax breaks to lure new firms to Scunthorpe.Admittedly, that would require a coherent industrial strategy Britain lacks.But the Tories must not abandon this community whose livelihoods are at risk.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

If not, whichever party has the most votes then gets the seat instead.The original vote count of the largest party in each round is ided by one plus the total number of seats they have already been allocated, until all the seats for the region have been handed out.Although the method is considered to be one of the most constant and representative forms of voting, the results do not exactly reflect the votes, as this would lead to parties winning fractions of seats.EU voters go to the polls every five years to elect Members of the European Parliament .Each country has a specic number of seats based on their population size.The smallest is Malta and they have six seats, whereas the largest is Germany with .There are  MEPs in total and the UK has .Candidates can stand independently or with a party.They will represent a region of their country, and the number of MEPs for each region depends on population.The government confirmed the country would be taking part in the EU elections in early May after May administration was forced to push back the date it was leaving the bloc because MPs could not get a majority for her withdrawal agreement.As the UK was still in the EU at the time of the elections it is forced to take part even though the majority of voters said they wanted to leave in the referendum vote.The UK went to the polls to elect MEPs on May , .The vote is said to have cost around £million to hold.If a Brexit deal is agreed before the election date or soon after then the UK’s MEPS will not take their seats.Butthat doesn’t happen then the newly elected MEPs will take their place in the European Parliament – which sits in Brussels and Strasbourg - in early July.European Council President Donald Tusk has said that MEPs could sit for “months or even longer”the negotiations drag on.At this stage, how long the UK MEPs will continue to sit is anyones guess.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Treachery amid the herbaceous borders.Boris Johnson and David Davis resigned at the stitch-up because vicar’s daughter May had behaved atrociously.Same this week. She held a long meeting with Cabinet ministers to agreeon one course of action.Off sauntered Mrs May to make a speech proposing a markedly dferent course of action — a concession on a second EU referendum.You can’t blame Andrea Leadsom for quitting in fury.  When a PM goes rogue like that, anger is legitimate. Actually, it becomes necessary.Theresa May, a former bank worker and local councillor, entered the Commons in .Her Maidenhead seat had such a hefty “True Blue” majority that she felt she never needed to fear the voters.From the outset it was obvious that this slender, slightly bloodless backbencher would prosper. Not that she made brilliant speeches. Good heavens no. But she had that sheen of apparent competence that today’s managers have made their own.Youthful Theresa spoke the bland bureaucratic lingo and she did so with safely modulated rhythms. She never led, never resisted. She had Establishment printed all over her.She did politics the way the Tunnock’s factory makes tea-cakes. Everything was tidily wrapped. The outer coating was tempting. It was only when you bit into it that you realised how insubstantial she was.As Tory chairman in  she made a conference speech telling activists they were regarded as “the nasty party”.This created a sensation, London commentators saying she was right to shake shires Tories out of their delusions.But the volunteers, driven more by a sense of honour than clever-clever strategy, felt insulted. May had scored an own goal and weakened her political base. It was a mistake she would repeat as PM.She never suspected that speech would cause such a stink. Instead of revelling in her new-found prominence, she retreated to obscurity.Some politicians are always on the hunt for headlines. Not May. Anti-populism was more her thing. She became known as “Submarine May”, seldom surfacing, seldom making radio contact with high command, just prowling the deep.In the long years of Tory opposition she was shadow secretary of state for education, transport, local government, environment, culture and pensions and shadow leader of the Commons. “Shadow” was indeed the word.She was at best a penumbral figure. In none of these briefs did she do anything radical.Tory leaders kept her because she did not make gaffes, was sleaze-free her marriage to stockbroker Philip, one year her junior, was enviably strong and because every front bench needs a few bores.The occasional dullard makes the bright ones feel better about themselves.Her low-key approach was fine as a mere frontbencher, even as Home Secretary.She waded dutully through her red boxes. Once or twice she showed a sliver of political ankle. With the encouragement of Fleet Street, she blocked the extradition to the US of computer hacker Gary McKinnon.It surprised her boss, David Cameron, as much as anyone.May had kept the matter tightly to herself, chewing on it alone. She took on the Police Federation, whose leaders at that time probably deserved squashing a bit.Her longevity at the Home Office started to become part of her appeal. May was a stayer in a tricky job. So said everyone. Maybe she started to believe she was indestructible.Was she clever  Not startlingly so. But she was dogged.She was never caught out by a question of detail. In the ‘chillaxed’ Cameron government, that made her unusual.Not an easy colleague, though. She feuded with George Osborne and Michael Gove. A more silken operator would have smoothed down such squabbles.Come the EU referendum of , the submarine went into a deep e.May had been thought to be a closet Eurosceptic and the Camerons were relieved when she came out in support of Remain. That was about the last they saw of her.Mind you, given her uselessness at campaigning — which became so painfully apparent in  — they were lucky.If she had fronted any Remain rallies, the Leave vote might have gone even higher.Some accused her of cowardice in hiding from the fray but it meant that when Cameron quit, and leadership contenders contrived to blow their chances, May was acceptable as Brexit Britain’s new PM.“Brexit means Brexit and we’re going to make a success of it,” she claimed.  Her time at No  has, at times, been hard to watch.Worst moment was probably that  conference speech when her voice failed. What a farce that was.Her descent has been dizzyingly fast. In February , the Tories won the Copeland by-election. That was the high-water mark.Days later she went walking in Snowdonia and called a snap election. She went into the campaign  points ahead in the polls. And she blew it.Was it cockiness  Her lack of elan  Her turgid “strong and stable” slogan Okay, we Brits like an underdog but the Tories and Labour had promised to honour the Leave result and we naively believed them. Whatever the reason, May lost.From that moment her power shrivelled. She did have some merits. Her physical stamina, particularly for a diabetic, has been remarkable. Downing Street under her was much freer of shysters and crooks than it was in the Blair and Cameron years.She did not send loads of cronies to the Lords. She was polite, unlike phone-chucker Brown. She was uninterested in the shallow, celebrity world and continued to attend church most Sundays, even when political hassles were at their worst.There was seriousness about her, certainly. Yet that lack of vanity and modern vibes, on one level so honourable, became a handicap. Politics is salesmanship. If you can create an aura of excitement, it helps you to sell policies.May just bored the smalls off us. And she surrounded herself with inadequates. Some of her ministers were rank D-listers. The civil servants seized power and the electorate’s will went ignored.Cabinet Secretary Sir Mark Sedwill may have thought he was helping her but in his sly attempt to bypass Brexit he has killed his mistress.For a woman so often hailed as stubborn, she proved a terrible pushover in the dealings with Brussels.And the “Bloody dficult woman”, as Ken Clarke called her, was equally feeble in standing up to Remainer ministers like Philip Hammond and Greg Clark.Was she incompetent  Or did shewant the softest of EU exits all along  Certainly looks that way.She might have got away with it had Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party not leapt out of nowhere. That has put that fear of bejaysus up Tory and Labour MPs.Mrs May might never had felt much need to heed the electorate but MPs in marginal seats are more alert to public sentiment.And public sentiment is now molten against May. Her premiership was only about Brexit. No other policy had a look-in.Her inability to deliver that central mission makes the verdict brutal but unavoidable: This stonewall warrior, secretive, robotic, dithery in an age that demands wit and clarity, was, as a PM, the most monumental dud.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Her loss of the Tory majority robbed her of her authority, boxed her in on Brexit and discredited her domestic policy agenda.The failure of that campaign carries an important lesson for the Tories — they need a happy warrior.May looked deeply uncomfortable on the campaign trail, with the result that the more the public saw of her, the less they liked.This Tory need for a good campaigner is heightened by the fact that their next leader will have to fight on two fronts, against both Jeremy Corbyn and Nigel Farage.On Brexit, May’s biggest problem was not knowing what she wanted. She triggered Article , the two-year process for leaving the EU that we had to request a humiliating delay to, without a clear idea of the kind of relationship she wanted — and how to get it.This meant that the UK wasted valuable negotiating time and ceded the initiative to the EU in the talks.The Tories need a leader with a plan. Whoever succeeds May will have to know what they want to get out of the EU and how they plan to get it. Given Brussels’ intransigence in these talks, they are also going to need Plans B, C and D.One of May’s other failings was that she didn’t understand one of the key purposes of preparations for No Deal.It wasn’t because you actually wanted — or thought you would end up with — No Deal. It was meant to secure a better deal.The leadership contest, overseen by party chairman Brandon Lewis, will take around six weeks.Any Tory MP can enter the race, and the list of contenders is then whittled down by the parliamentary party.MPs vote in multiple rounds, eliminating one candidate each time until just two are left.The partys , activists then choose behind the final shortlist of two, with the winner declared leader and Prime Minister.When Mrs May became leader, she didnt have to submit to a vote of members because Andrea Leadsom pulled out of the race.So the last time activists have had a say on the leadership was , when David Cameron defeated David Davis.If the UK had been more visibly prepared to walk away, then the EU would have been more constructive in the negotiations.The new Prime Minister must spend the summer examining the state of our no-deal preparations.Absurdly, the Brexit delay has not been used as a chance to improve the UK’s no-deal planning but rather as an excuse to soft pedal. That must change.May’s other great failure has been failing to build a team or create a sense of collective endeavour.Both the disastrous  manesto and her Brexit plan were executed with far too little Cabinet involvement.She sent civil servants to do the very political job of negotiating. The result was a deal that was, unsurprisingly, politically tone deaf.May’s successor must appoint a Cabinet of all the Tory talents — and let them do their jobs.And we need a Brexit Secretary who actually negotiates with Brussels.The Tories have no perfect candidate for No . No one fully fulfils all of these requirements.But a Prime Minister who could deliver Brexit would give the Tories a fighting chance.THE way to think about the Tory leadership contest is that it is like a tournament with two sides of the draw, with each side sending one candidate into the final membership round.One side of the draw is for full-on Brexiteers.Here Boris Johnson, Dominic Raab, Andrea Leadsom, Steve Baker and Esther McVey will duke it out.The other side of the draw features the Cabinet candidates: Jeremy Hunt, Sajid Javid, Michael Gove, Matt Hancock and Rory Stewart.Whoever comes out of the Brexit side of the draw will go into the final round as the strong favourite, given how Tory members just want the UK to get out of the EU.I understand that Boris Johnson has edged ahead of Dominic Raab on this side of the contest.But he will, in the words of one key MP, need to be “materially ahead” of Raab on the first round.Why  Because Raab is more likely to pick up support as more hardline Brexiteer candidates such asRaab’s pitch will be that the Conservative Party is toastit cannot deliver Brexit – and that he is the man to do that.He will argue that other candidates might be better known than him, but Boris’s celebrity won’t save the Toriesthey cannot get Brexit done.But one of Boris’s advantages over Raab is that he has more reach into the rest of the party.His campaign is beginning to pick up support from former Remainer ministers, who see the former London Mayor as the Tories’ best chance of seeing off the twin threats of Corbyn and Farage.At the same time, some on the left of the party have decided that stopping Raab – who they see as a down-the-line right-winger – is now their priority, rather than blocking Boris.ON the Cabinet side of the contest, the question is whether Michael Gove can overhaul Jeremy Hunt.The Foreign Secretary currently has more MPs backing him than anyone  in the Cabinet.But his campaign has had a bumpy few weeks, and some of his supporters are beginning to peel away.This, perhaps, explains why Hunt felt the need to confirm that he was standing just hours after Theresa May announced her resignation yesterday.Part of Hunt’s problem with MPs is that it is very hard to see him beating Boris Johnson or Dominic Raab when it comes to the party members.Their experience with Theresa May has made the membership very wary of former Remainers.GEORGE Osborne has finally had his revenge on Theresa May.He sent a text to a slew of Cabinet leadership hopefuls saying that a big prize awaited the minister who went and told May that the Withdrawal Agreement Bill had to be pulled.Several recipients of this text were amused when Sajid Javid, who was one of Osborne’s junior ministers at the Treasury, then went to demand that May shelve the second referendum part of the bill.SOME members of the  parliamentary intake are considering running for the leadership.They should hold their horses – the new leader will need more than four years of parliamentary experience.But whoever becomes the new PM needs to freshen up the Cabinet, to bring in this new talent.After nine years in government, there are too many administrators in Cabinet and not enough doers.It needs an injection of energy and fresh ideas.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It will be ungenerous not to remember too her unshakeable dedication to her country and remarkable perseverance against what became insurmountable odds.She is a good person. She did her best.But she is a poor Prime Minister and the author of her own downfall. She appointed a Cabinet of loyal friends largely devoid of talent.She credulously swallowed bad advice from a staunchly europhile and dysal civil service.She lacked vital traits for a leader: core beliefs, confidence, decisiveness, mental agility, communication skills and a willingness to trust and delegate.These failings, and a suicidal manesto, were exposed at the  election. Stripped of her majority, she foolishly tried to pretend “nothing has changed” and made promises she couldn’t keep.She negotiated a Brexit deal which was bad enough even before Monday’s final, fatal compromises.Mrs May described what she sees as her legacy. It is thin gruel. The economy is doing fine, the job market booming. But she did next to nothing for Sun readers, for the “just about managings”.Brexit is undone, like her “social justice” agenda. Our democracy is in disarray, Britain ided, her party at historic poll lows. She leaves her successor an even more colossal task than her own.Whoever that is must, above all, stop Corbyn’s thuggish extremists winning power.That can only be done by delivering Brexit — yes, with No Dealneed be — and somehow seeing off the Brexit Party whose surge could let Corbyn in.Winning the battle of ideas against the Marxist Left will be far simpler. Who is best placed to do it It must be a Brexiteer ready to appoint a younger, fresher, far more talented top team.

Andyou are paid less than someone  because they are better than you then that is OK. But that is apparently not the case here.“Despite being awarded the same job, on the same day, after the same board, during the same recruitment process, BBC News asked me to accept a considerably lower salary than my male counterpart. A lot less,” Karen told colleagues by email.“I’ve been assured our roles and responsibilities are the same. I’ve also been told my appointment was ‘very well deserved’. It’s just that I’m worth £, less.“Over the past four months I have asked BBC News to think again. And they’ve inched their offer up . . . now the gap is nearer to £,. But for me it has never been about the actual salary. It has been about equal pay.”She also said she had turned down the job on principle after discussing the matter with her young daughters, which led her to conclude that she must “stand up for what is right”.And, to my mind, that is the real nub of this story.Her two daughters, aged seven and , said this to her: “You always tell us to stand up for what is right. If it means less pocket money or not going on holiday, we don’t mind.What matters to us is that when we grow up, we want to be paid the same as a man for the same job.”How poignant — and how powerful. Sometimes you have to see things through the eyes of children to realise there is only one course of action.It makes me think of that phrase: Strong women — may we know them, may we be them, and may we raise them.Well, Karen is certainly raising them. And her brave decision means that her children won’t be as subservient as the women of our generation.To an extent, women have always just accepted the status quo when it comes to men being paid more. But that’s changingStill, what Karen did by refusing the job and sending that email is brave. Most people don’t like to rock the boat, which sometimes means we accept things that should be unacceptable.And women, especially mothers, are often so grateful to have a job that they don’t question it. That’s especially the case for single working mums, as Karen is.Most single working mums simply can’t afford not to work, so they put up and shut up. But that expectation that women should accept less than they are worth makes my blood boil.Can you imagine, by the way,it had emerged that men were routinely being paid less than women  Would we ever hear the end of it Not until equality came. So maybe we all need to think like men for a bit.By rocking the boat, Karen is taking one for the team. She will be no doubt be seen as a troublemaker by some potential employers. But it’s not until people make stands like this that change happens.Despite the furore, the gender pay gap is still everywhere, and it’s not until people say, “No more” that things will change. The bottom line is that women need to start feeling a bit more entitled.We need to know our worth and not be afraid to ask for it. Because the sad truth is that people will pay you less than you are worththey can get away with it. So let’s not be muggins enough to accept it, eh HAVE you been following the story of chef Gary Usher, who was asked by a homeless man called Derickhe had any jobs in his restaurant He offered Derick a job as a kitchen porter. And then tweeted about it because he was happy to have done a good deed.His tweet then went viral. And then suddenly people started accusing him of exploiting homeless people to publicise his restaurant.But given the fact that Usher has declined every single one of the many invitations he has had to go on TV to talk about this story that is so patently untrue.And also, regardless of whether he publicised it or not, there is no doubt that he did a good thing.Still, he has been roundly vilied for what was evidently a kind-hearted gesture.Social media has made us into a nation of cynics and critics. The saying “no good deed goes unpunished” seems very true on this occasion.LOTS of teenagers will no doubt be envious to hear about Benjy Fish, the -year-old from Middlesex who has dropped out of school after being encouraged by his mother – to become a professional gamer.Benjy, who has so far earned £, playing Fortnite, is ranked among the best in the world.And he has guaranteed himself another £, by qualying for this year’s Fortnite World Cup, which boasts a prize pool of £million.He’ll be competing at the event in New York this July, which may sound like the dream for some, and I wish him all the best.But has any parent ever uttered the words: “I hope my son quits school at  to become a professional gamer”  I seriously doubt it.NO doubt the critics will line up to bemoan the fact that Davina McCall is dating again after her orce from Matthew Robertson.She is seeing her long-term friend and hairdresser, Michael Douglas, who she has known for more than  years.All I can think about is just how daunting it must be to put yourself “out there” and start dating again after  years of marriage and three kids.Add to that the burden of being famous, which makes it hard to join Tinder .But we should all wish Davina well – good for her for giving herself another chance at happiness and finding love again. She turned  in October and has got a whole new chapter of her le to live. Why should that be alone Divorcees out there should take heart. You are entitled to happiness. You might just want to go and have a bit of fun by putting yourself out there without waiting for Mr Perfect.Or the love of your le might already be under your nose, like Davina’s hairdresser.What could be better than getting together with an old friend, because he knows the real her. But also, possibly best of all, no more bad hair days.I HAVE no idea what is being shown at the Cannes Film Festival­ – these days it’s much more about the red-carpet dresses than the actual movies.And wow, were there some dresses this year.Alessandra Ambrosio, , and Sharon Stone, , dazzled in little red numbers.The most amazing thing is that there is  years between them. What is Sharon Stone’s secret  She never ages.SO sad reading about Jasmine Bush, the -year old schoolgirl who threw herself in front of a train on the day she was due to receive the grades for her GCSEs in .She had been suffering with ious mental health issues, including anxiety, and had been on medication to help control the symptoms.But she had also been smoking marijuana to relieve anxiety symptoms. Except it clearly had the opposite effect. This story is every parent’s nightmare.Smoking weed is seen as innocent and has been normalised by the fact that “everyone does it”. But it is illegal for a reason.Marijuana is known to make people paranoid and, far from curing anxiety, it exacerbates it.

Since March , the day the UK should have left the EU, there has been a growing sense of political crisis.Brexit wasn’t happening and the government’s impressive achievements were being lost in the fog. If government was telling people about the growing economy, unemployment falling to its lowest since  or the UK attracting more inward investment in the last year than any other country in the world – no-one was listening.Theresa May was rightly committed to building a majority in parliament for something that would at least complete the first stage of Brexit and allow a new leader to negotiate the future relationship without constant battles in parliament getting in the way.But when she started offering concessions to Jeremy Corbyn’s far left outfitt, the mood in the Tory party darkened.As Chairman of the Parliamentary Conservative Party - the “ Committee” - I had to balance two very strong demands from my colleagues.Firstly, with the failure to exit the EU and the loss of so many brilliant councillors in local elections at the beginning of May, a majority of Conservative MPs had decided that a change of leader was essential.Secondly, most of my colleagues also took the view that Theresa should be allowed the space to leave the stage with dignity.However disappointed or angry people are that we are stuck in a logjam, they know that Mrs May has given it her all. Her dogged determination and absolute commitment to the service of our country have been obvious to everyone.It was sad and painful to be there at the moment that she said she would resign as leader of the party and no one could fail to be moved by her parting words outside No. The ConservativeParty knew that change was needed but I am glad that the process has begun with decency and respect.Some people inside and outside parliament have talked about me being a candidate for leader. As Chairman of the  Committee I would have been in charge of the election process so I stood down with immediate effect so that everything can be seen to be above board.I can now consider my position unconstrained. Whoever stands – and whoever wins, the task is a big one. It is nothing less than restoring the broken trust in British politics.We have to leave the EU as we promised we would and then get back to a radical agenda to let people take back control of their lives. Politicians need to talk less about social mobility and do more to make sure that everyone in our great country can make the most of their talents.The crucial starting point must be to reunite the Conservative Party: faced with the most extreme socialist threat that would destroy business, jobs and savings we owe it not to ourselves but to every decent hardworking citizen.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Polls put the new outfit - which has no manesto or non-Brexit policies - on more than %. Thataposd be a final blow for Theresa May as she prepares to resign on June . So what should you look out for on results night and what does it all mean  Hereaposs a full geeksapos guide.    Follow the results LIVE Weaposre running a live blog on the night and a UK results in full service. Youaposll be able to follow the UK results as they come in from pm using the interactive tool below. Whoaposs voting and what for   The UK is electing  MEPs to sit in the European Parliament -  from Britain and three from Northern Ireland . Those MEPs will only sit in the Parliament until Brexit happens, currently scheduled for October  at the latest. All registered voters in the UK can vote. In this election you donapost vote for inidual candidates. Instead you vote for a party. You can see the key aims from the manestosfrom Labour, the Tories and Lib Dems. Meanwhile weaposve got a full list of candidates and a comparison of the key manestos on Brexit. And there are polls putting the Tories in as low as fth place.  Seats are split between  large regions of the UK. In each region, votes are counted for each party and then seats are allocated to those parties along a mathematical formula. Parties themselves decide which candidates get to scoop up their seats through a numbered list system. The formula iding seats up is called the aposDaposHondtapos system. In each region, the party with the most votes gets the first seat. Then that partyaposs total vote figure is ided by two - and the party with the most votes in the second roundgets the second seat. The process is repeated via a formula until all seats have been dished out. As it goes on,a party wins a second seat in its region, its vote total is then ided by three. If it wins a third seat, its vote total is then ided by four. And so on. If youaposre into this sort of thing thereaposs a full explainer _EN.pdf\" rel\"nofollow\"here. Where are the votes counted  Results are counted by hundreds of inidual councils, but not all those figures will actually be released. The only guaranteed published results will come at a single final declaration for each region. These declarations collate all the council-level results for each region into one final result, and proclaim who has got what seats. What time are the results in the UK  Apart from one small part of Scotland , all the results are expected between pm on Sunday  May and about .am on the Bank Holiday Monday. The delay in counting is due to EU rules that say no country should declare its results while another nation is still voting. This prevents, for example, a far-right surge in one country encouraging similar turnout in another country.  National estimates are expected to come in from the early evening on Sunday  May. The first projection for the European Parliament as a whole is expected shortly after pm UK time. Updated projections for the European Parliament are expected in the early hours of Monday  May. How can I follow the results  For our sins weaposll be covering it with a live blog and full breakdown of the results at mirror politics. Is there an exit poll  No The reason is these are very expensive for the BBC and Sky to run. We should have the results shortly after pm on Sunday anyway. Region by region guide NOTE: All declaration times are very rough estimates ONLY. Regional counts can only be declared once every council in the region has declared. That meansone council has a recount or a problem it will hold up the entire region. Our timeswere gleaned by talking to councils. The Press Association has also issued estimated times which weaposve stated too. East Midlands    ESTIMATED DECLARATION TIME: Unknown . PA: .pm. NUMBER OF MEPs:  CURRENT SEATS: Con  Lab  UKIP  Brexit Party  WHAT TO WATCH FOR: Annunziata Rees-Mogg - sister of Tory Brexiteer Jacob - is top of the list for the Brexit Party in this UKIP-dominated region. So be shockedthe ex-Tory doesnapost swoop in and take a seat. Conservative woes could well be exposed as the party defends a fragile % of the vote last time. Both incumbents, Emma McClarkin and Rupert Matthews, are standing again. Butthe polls are any guide, theyaposre not likely to keep their seats. And in , Labour were only one point behind the Tories on %. A reversal of their fortunes would hand a Tory seat to Labour. COUNT DECLARED BY: Kettering Borough Council East of England    ESTIMATED DECLARATION TIME: Midnight. PA: .pm. NUMBER OF MEPs:  CURRENT SEATS: Con  SDP  Brexit Party  UKIP  Lab  WHAT TO WATCH FOR: If a Tory wipeout is in the offing it will be on show here, where incumbent John Flack - second on the list - could even be vulnerable on a disastrous night. The newly-formed Brexit Party will hope to shore up its power base with the election of chairman Richard Tice and long-time Nigel Farage ally Michael Heaver, who founded the right-wing aposWestmonsterapos website. Itaposs a running start for the Brexiteers - UKIP won a whopping % of the vote here in , way ahead of the Tories on % and Labour on %. COUNT DECLARED BY: Chelmsford City Council London    ESTIMATED DECLARATION TIME: Midnight. PA: am. NUMBER OF MEPs:  CURRENT SEATS: Lab  Con  Green  UKIP  WHAT TO WATCH FOR: UKIP leader Gerard Batten will be fighting to keep his seat as support flushes away amid his backing for far-right extremist Tommy Robinson. Former BBC presenter Gavin Esler could be one of the few victories for newly-formed Remain party Change UK. And the Brexit Party will be having a decent nightsmoked salmon tycoon Lance Forman - second on the regional list - wins a seat. The result will be important to Labouraposs factional battles too. Ultra-close Jeremy Corbyn ally Katy Clark is third on the list while Laura Parker of left-wing group Momentum, which has recently flexed its muscle and its own thoughts, is fourth. Votes were pretty well-spread in  so a lot could change. Labour had %, Tories had %, UKIP won %, Greens won % and Lib Dems won % at the last election. COUNT DECLARED BY: Lewisham Council North East    ESTIMATED DECLARATION TIME: pm. PA: .pm. NUMBER OF MEPs:  CURRENT SEATS: Lab  Independent WHAT TO WATCH FOR: Recent elections have shown Labour votes ebbing away in the north of England in favour of pro-Brexit parties. So Labour officials will be watching closely to seethey can keep their hold on this stronghold, with incumbents Jude Kirton-Darling and Paul Brannen both standing again and ex-UKIPper Jonathan Arnott standing down. And it may be tougher than it looks. The supposed dominance of Labour hides the fact that the party only won % of the vote in the region in  - with UKIPaposs % snapping at its heels. A reversal of that isnapost impossible. The Tories were on % last time with Lib Dems and Greens barely scraping % each. COUNT DECLARED BY: Sunderland City Council North West    ESTIMATED DECLARATION TIME: Unknown . PA: .am. NUMBER OF MEPs:  CURRENT SEATS: Lab  Independent Con  WHAT TO WATCH FOR: Far-right extremist Tommy Robinsonis standing as an independent. He needs huge inidual support to win - weaposre talking hundreds of thousands of votes. Sohe does win it will be a vast blow to anti-fascist campaigns in the UK. Elsewhere  A little like the West Midlands, the North West looks set to be a test of the three-way battle between Labouraposs carefully-nuanced Brexit position, the Toriesapos internal wranglings and the blunt instrument of UKIPand the Brexit Party . Labour incumbents Theresa Grfin, Julie Ward and Wajid Khan are all standing again. Itaposs not plain sailing for the Brexit Party - its number one candidate Claire Fox defended Republican violence just days after the IRA Warrington bombing in . But UKIP had % of the vote last time - not far behind Labouraposs % - and the Tories had %. Thereaposs a lot to play for. COUNT DECLARED BY: Manchester City Council Scotland    ESTIMATED DECLARATION TIME: .am MondayNUMBER OF MEPs:  CURRENT SEATS: SNP  Lab  Con  Brexit Party  WHAT TO WATCH FOR: The last EU election was held before the extra SNP surge in the wake of the independence referendum the Labour collapse, and the Tory boost that followed. Expect a dramatic re-shaping of the ground once the Brexit Party is thrown in as well. Labouraposs Catherine Stihler is not standing again incumbent David Martin is joined by new candidate Jayne Baxter and Labour looks the most vulnerable here. Last time the party was in second place with % of the vote. Thataposs a very tough ask this time.

NUMBER OF MEPs:  CURRENT SEATS: Con  Brexit Party  Lab  Lib Dem  Green  UKIP  Ind WHAT TO WATCH FOR: As the biggest region with the most MEPs, the South East is worth watching closely to seeanti-Brexit tactical voting is having any effect - and how the seats are split. Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage would need the earth to cave in on itself not to keep his seat of two decades and his giant, accumulating EU pension. Tory Brexiteer Daniel Hannan is also guaranteed to stay unless there is a Conservative wipeout. Slightly more vulnerable are the parties that got fewer votes in . The Tories and UKIP got over % each in this region, while Labour had just %, the Greens had % and Lib Dems had %. COUNT DECLARED BY: Southampton City Council South West    ESTIMATED DECLARATION TIME: pm. PA: pm. NUMBER OF MEPs:  CURRENT SEATS: Con  Lab  Green  Lib Dem  Brexit Party  WHAT TO WATCH FOR: This seat has the biggest aposcharactersapos in the contest. Ex-Tory grandee Ann Widdecombe is almost certain to win a seat for the Brexit Party despite her antiquated views on LGBT rights and other issues. Rachel Johnson, sister of Tory Boris, will be vying to pick up a seat for pro-Remain outfit Change UK. If Labour pick up one extra MEP, arch-Remainer Andrew Adonis will win the seat. UKIP is putting up rape joke furore candidate Carl Benjamin, but heaposs second on the list so given UKIPaposs poll ratings heaposs unlikely to win. Ashley Fox, the Conservative leader in the European Parliament, should keep his seat unless thereaposs a Tory disaster. And lastly Green MEP Molly Scott Cato will be hoping to retain her seat given a recent Green boost in the polls. This is Brexiteer country - % of votes went to Tories or UKIP in  - but itaposs also an unpredictable area with a solid Green and Liberal base. A lot could happen. COUNT DECLARED BY: Christchurch and Poole Council Wales    ESTIMATED DECLARATION TIME: Midnight. PA: Midnight. NUMBER OF MEPs:  CURRENT SEATS: Lab  Con  Plaid Cymru  Brexit Party  WHAT TO WATCH FOR: Seats are split evenly here in a country that is a complex mix of traditional Labour votes, frustrated Brexiteers, Tories and the nationalist Plaid Cymru. Plaidaposs Jill Evans and the Brexit Partyaposs Nathan Gill are both incumbents standing again but Labour and the Tories have new candidates - Jackie Jones and Dan Boucher respectively. Labour won the most votes in , a solid ,, but the Tories only won , so look more vulnerable. That said, the Green and Lib Dem opposition in  was pretty meagre at less than % of the vote each. COUNT DECLARED BY: Pembrokeshire Council West Midlands    ESTIMATED DECLARATION TIME: Unknown . PA: Midnight. NUMBER OF MEPs:  CURRENT SEATS: Lab  Con  Brexit Party  UKIP  Independent WHAT TO WATCH FOR: By EU election standards, this was a pretty straight battle between the two main parties and UKIP in  with each winning two or three seats. Both Labour incumbents, Neena Gill and Sion Simon, and both Tory incumbents, Anthea McIntyre and Daniel Dalton, are standing again but the other candidates are new. This will be a test of whether the main parties can withstand the march of anti-Brexit parties like the Lib Dems, Greens and Change UK. Last time, the Lib Dems and Greens only just scraped % of the vote each. COUNT DECLARED BY: Birmingham City Council Yorkshire  The Humber      ESTIMATED DECLARATION TIME: .pm. PA: pm. NUMBER OF MEPs:  CURRENT SEATS: Lab  Con  UKIP  WHAT TO WATCH FOR: Magid Magid, a former refugee who became Lord Mayor of Sheffield aged  and banned Donald Trump, will be hoping to pick up a seat for the Green Party. If Labour doesnapost lose any seats, it will install anti-Brexit campaigner Eloise Todd as an MEP - an interesting twist in Labouraposs internal contortions over whether to leave the EU.

Emma Lowe, , who is a single mum of seven – including twins with Downs Syndrome - has paid tribute to her son Harry.The -year-old has been putting in a  hour day to help with their care - taking on the role of aposman of the houseapos. Harryaposs siblings are Thomas, , Benjamin, , twins Arthur and Alfie, six, and four-year-old Elsie. Emma tragically lost a daughter, Molly, aged five months, who also had Downs Syndrome. Her husband walked out soon after her youngest child was born – leaving Emma to cope alone. The former teacher, from Preston, Lancashire, said: “It was a very daunting prospect, especially with two disabled children. “But Harry stepped in and became the man of the house. He is absolutely incredible and I couldn’t cope without him.    “Most -year-olds are out with their mates, having fun, or lazing around. But Harry never gets a minute to himself. He looks out for the twins all the time, just like a parent would. I would just like him to get the credit and the recognition he deserves.” Emma’s heartache began when her daughter, Molly, was born in March , and diagnosed with Downs Syndrome, a hole in the heart and underdeveloped lungs. She died five months later. Emma said: It was heartbreaking and very hard for my older children. We call Molly’s grave her ‘forever bed’ and we visit her all the time.” Emma’s twin sons, Alfie and Arthur, were born in July , and she was stunned when they, too, were diagnosed with Downs Syndrome. She says: “The chances of having three babies with Downs Syndrome were a million to one. But when the midwe held Alfie up, I recognised the features, just like Molly. The condition itself didn’t scare me because I knew I could cope but I was scared, after losing Molly, that the same thing might happen again.”    Arthur and Alfie thankfully did not have the same medical challenges as Molly, though they were later diagnosed with autism. They are also non-verbal and need wheelchairs. The year after the twins were born, Emma had a daughter, Elsie. But without warning, her husband, David, walked out. Her eldest son, Thomas, also left home to go to college – leaving Harry as man of the house. Emma says: “Harry just naturally fell into the role of young carer. It wasn’t what I wanted for him and I certainly didn’t push him into it.  “But he loved caring for the boys and he quickly became invaluable. I really couldn’t cope without him now. “Harry and Alfie in particular have a very special bond. Alfie is completely non-verbal except for one word: ‘Harry.’ Unlike most boys his age, Harry is up at .am to bath and dress his brothers. He will then help feed them whilst having his own breakfast and getting ready for school. Emma says: “By the time he goes to school, he has often been on the go for three hours, watching the twins, keeping them safe, playing with them, and then lting them onto their school bus when it comes.”    And the evenings are just as hectic. Emma, said: “Harry will change nappies, wash clothes, cook meals. He can cook steak and spaghetti Bolognese. “He helps put the twins to bed with me and then, late at night, we will reheat our evening meal and eat together. It can be midnight by the time our tasks are all finished. “Even during the night,the twins wake up crying, he is there with them. I try to make sure he gets his sleep but he wants to look after them. “And when we go out, Harry is on hand to make sure the twins have a good time. He puts them before himself every time. “They both need wheelchairs for any distances so Harry will push one, I push the other, and Benjamin looks out for Elsie.” Harry is anxious to change the stigma around Downs Syndrome and is involved in support groups and charity work.    Emma says: “Harry has even given talks on his brothers. He wants to make people more aware and more accepting. “People have no idea what le is like for him – and other young carers. He adores his brothers but looking after them is demanding and dficult sometimes. “But I know he wouldn’t change them for the world.” Harry says: “When I say I’m a carer, most people presume I look after a parent, but I look after my siblings. I think siblings who care for siblings don’t get the support or the recognition they need. “I don’t get asked to do this. I do it to support my brothers and to help my mum. My mum does a great job, she’s a superhero, and I hope, through telling my story, I can raise awareness of the need for more help and support.” "},{"url":null,"title":"boy 17 rakes 75000 each","story":"NewsBoy, , rakes in £, each year from his bedroom using just his phoneNoah Brunsdon, from Penzance, Cornwall, has created Profit With Noah, which helps celebrities, including The Only Way is Essexand Love Island stars, use the foreign exchange marketShare and Love Island stars, use the foreign exchange market\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.mirror incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _Teenager-makes-£-from-his-bedroom-using-just-his-phone.jpg\" data-tracking\"facebook|share|\" and Love Island stars, use the foreign exchange market\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.mirror incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _Teenager-makes-£-from-his-bedroom-using-just-his-phone.jpg\" data-tracking\"messenger|share|\" and Love Island stars, use the foreign exchange market\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.mirror incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _Teenager-makes-£-from-his-bedroom-using-just-his-phone.jpg\" data-tracking\"twitter|share|\" and Love Island stars, use the foreign exchange market\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.mirror incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _Teenager-makes-£-from-his-bedroom-using-just-his-phone.jpg\" data-tracking\"whatsapp|share|\" and Love Island stars, use the foreign exchange market\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.mirror incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _Teenager-makes-£-from-his-bedroom-using-just-his-phone.jpg\" data-tracking\"linkedin|share|\" and Love Island stars, use the foreign exchange market\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.mirror incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _Teenager-makes-£-from-his-bedroom-using-just-his-phone.jpg\" data-tracking\"flipboard|share|\" and Love Island stars, use the foreign exchange market\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.mirror incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _Teenager-makes-£-from-his-bedroom-using-just-his-phone.jpg\" data-tracking\"email|share|\"CommentsByLisa LetcherBradley Jolly:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsNoah Brunsdon left school with just two GCSEs and has since formed a lucrative business \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email A -year-old boy is raking in an astonishing £, each year from the comfort of his own bedroom using just his phone.

The information was then used by Western forces to help identy vulnerabilities in the planes, an intelligence source revealed.British spies from MI worked with the CIA and Mossad, the national intelligence agency of Israel to hatch the plans, MailOnline reports. The aim was to find out more about Russiaaposs supersonic TU- bombers, known as Blackjacks.   The plot involved a Russian crew drinking tea during a flight from Russia to Caracas with secrets stashed at the bottom of the packet by a Western source placed in Russia.According to The Sunday Express , the bomberaposs upgrades have transformed its defensive capabilities which make it dficult for enemy fighters to lock onto it.In the wake of the Novichok attack in Salisbury last year, diplomatic tensions between Russia and the West are fraught and the intelligence agencies had to come up with a plan to extract information whilst avoiding sending spies into the country. A solution came in the most quintessentially of British solutions - tea.  Spies discovered Putin was sending two Blackjacks to Venezuela in a show of support to President Nicolas Maduro in December, . Russia relies upon the re-selling of Venezuelan oil and gas and had signed a pact with Hugo Chavez in .Putin seized the opportunity to display the bombers off the US coast and so a plan was then hatched for the information to be carried unknowingly on one of these Blackjacks.It was stored at the bottom of a packet of loose Russian Caravan tea that was on board the bomber aircraft. Agents even had to calculate how much tea the pilots would drink during the -hour flight.  If there was too much, the packet would not be thrown away.  When the plane landed at Simon Boli airport in Venezuela, an agent retrieved the discarded packet and then took it to a CIA officer waiting at a hotel in Caracas. The secrets were taken to the US for analysis before it was shared with UK and Nato forces. An intelligence source told MailOnline:  An hour after landing, a quantity of rubbish, which included the tea packet, was taken from the aircraft while it was being refuelled. The packet, which contained a small amount of tea, was among items placed in a rubbish disposal point. That it worked was due, in no small part, to luck, but such is the way with many operations.apos "},{"url":null,"title":"brits down beer horn ryanair","story":"NewsBrits down beer horn on Ryanair flight while air stewardess looks onPassengers are seen drinking beer out of a funnel while on board an early morning flight from London Stansted to AlicanteShareCommentsByGerard CouzensLaura Forsyth:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video brits-down-beer-horn-ryanair-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,video.suppressDates:true\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email A group of boozy Brits downed a beer horn on a Ryanair plane - while an air stewardess looked on. The passengers who were heading to Benidorm were seen guzzling alcohol from a funnel on their flight.Each took turns filming themselves chugging from the bong on board the early morning journey from London Stansted to Alicante. One was seen lying on his back in the aisle as his friends poured the contents of two beer cans into the funnel he had connected into his mouth. Footage shows the group roaring with laughter when it spilled over him. An air stewardess was seen trying to calm the men down, when one of the party asked her: “Can you hold it up ” She seemed to tell them that “this is fine” in broken English before disappearing from the camera shot.    The flight attendant appeared to make no attempt to stop them as they poured more beer for another man wearing an armband and football top. As he ended up covered in lager, one of his friends shouted: “It’s a waterfall.”  They carried on with their shenanigans without any intervention from the flight crew for several minutes. Beer was poured straight from the can onto anotheraposs face while someone shouted: “Top it up.”  The man holding centre stage from the aisle carried on drinking before shouting: “Have you got any more ” The revellers then proceeded to dance and sing in the aisle - with one placing the funnel upside down on his head as the others chanted: “He’s got a beer bong on his head.”  Seconds later one of the party threw more lager over a mate who reacted by laughing: “Spillage in the village.” The incident is understood to have happened on board the .am Ryanair flight from London Stansted to Alicante on Saturday.

Located in Hull, the grey doorway is now part of a recently opened souvenir and convenience store. Every day, hundreds of people walk past it, unaware of the notorious and tragic past that lies behind it.But the door once led to an infamous slum known as “Bartle’s Entry”, according to historian Mike Covell. Hull Live reports that within seven small houses lived seven families and  people.There was no running water – not even a communal tap – no toilets, inside or out, and no heating.The slum was also re with crime . It took its name from John Bartle, a miller and baker of ships’ biscuits, who operated from    Whitefriargateas early as . By the s, he was a success and opened a mill roughly where RB stands today at the corner with Mount Pleasant.Soon, though, tragedy struck. In , his son, John Junior, lost his we Jane just months after they were married. She was . Two years later, Bartle’s eldest son, James, died at just . Still, his business went from strength to strength and newspapers often featured adverts for his bread, biscuits and confectionery.    In , Bartle died at his Whitefriargate warehouse and John Junior took over. A few years later, records reveal the state of the notorious slum that sat next to the thriving business. Crammed into the shocking accommodation were the Reed family, the Moment family, the Robinson family, the Greenwood family, the Squires family and the Hill family. Conditions were said to have been truly appalling which is likely to have been the cause of deaths that followed. Among the many stories from the short history of Bartle’s Entry is the death of William King, who was found leless in his bed by his we in April . He went to bed without complaining of any illness and mystery still surrounds what killed him. Theft was another problem. The following year, police raided the slum and apprehended a William Johnson for stealing a large amount of clothes. As late as , an advertisement appeared in the Hull Daily Mail, offering houses in Bartle’s Entry to rent at three shillings per week. By then, the Bartle family had left and their bakery had been converted first into an umbrella warehouse and then into a branch of the Yorkshire Post newspaper. The slum houses, now recognised as unfit for human habitation, were closed and condemned at about the time of the First World War.

It has been uncovered next to the A in Newington, Kent. The site includes remains of a temple which has since been named Watling Temple - making it one of only  sites recorded in England. Archaeologists also uncovered an ancient seven-metre road which is believed to have been an alternative route to the A which runs from London to Kentish coast.    Experts have hailed the discovery as one of the most signicant finds in the region - but the newly revealed settlement is destined to become new homes as part of a Persimmon Homes new development. Chairman of Newington History Group Dean Coles said: This is very exciting. The scale of this site, with the huge number and quality of finds, changes our knowledge of Newingtonaposs development. We already had evidence of a Roman burial ground and Roman occupation in the immediate vicinity and this excavation shows there was a thriving manufacturing site in the heart of our village. The temple and major road are massive discoveries. It proves the A wasnapost the only Roman road through the village.    As a group, we are keen to trace the route and destination of this new aposhighwayapos which may have connected with another temple excavated  years ago on the outskirts of Newington and a villa unearthed in . Experts will analyse the findings and publish a report but the ancient remains will once again be covered up to make way for the housing development. Archaeological director at Swale and Thames Archaeological Survey, Doctor Paul Wilkinson said: This is one of the most important discoveries of a Roman small town in Kent for many years with the preservation of Roman buildings and artefacts exceptional. Archaeology project manager Peter Cichy added: This is one of the most signicant sites in Kent but itaposs only the beginning of months and months of work. We will be analysing and dating our finds, sorting and piecing together thousands of pottery shards and writing up our report. Romans invaded Britain in  AD and remained for almost  years.

It was said that they were bringing down the tone of their sought after area, reports the Liverpool Echo . Mr Birchall, from the Eccleston Park estate in Prescot, Merseyside, decided to display two Liverpool flags outside his house ahead of the Champions League final next Saturday.Last year when his team reached the final in Kiev, Neil hung banners on his coners and went all out. However the football fan is said to have reined in his decorations this year - with his home sporting just a couple of banners. So he was stunned to have a letter pushed through his letterbox this week, asking him to remove the two flags.    The reason being that his neighbours believed that they resembled what would normally be seen on a council estate. The letter writer was also concerned that it could affect house prices, as they tried to keep the area sought after for housebuyers. Neil, who has lived on the estate for almost  years, said: I thought it was one of my friends on the wind-up, but Iaposve called everyone I know and they say itaposs not them. I couldnapost believe it when I read it, I thought it was a joke, thereaposs one other house with flags up on the estate, but I only have two up on my house.    No one said anything about the flags last year and I didnapost get any letters then, so I donapost knowitaposs someone whoaposd just moved into the area. Iaposve shown it to everyone and they canapost believe it, itaposs worded very strangely. Neil is driving to Madrid to watch the final on Saturday night with two others and is planning to keep the flags up while heaposs in the Spanish capital. Since receiving the letter Neil has put another flag up in a show of defiance. He added: The flags will be staying up. When we got the letter my lad was sad, because he thought we would have to take them down, but Iaposm not taking them down. The letter in full Dear Residents I am writing to you today on behalf of some of your fellow neighbours and surrounding residents. Some of us are very proud our local team has reached a final in Europe and we are all very passionate about it. Some of us are lucky enough to be going also, some not so. However we are proud members of Eccleston Park and itaposs beautul surroundings. We like to stand out and keep this suburb as sought after as possible.

Samantha Rae, , was swerving across the road and was later seen getting out of her car before tripping up on the kerb. A concerned driver who had been following her along the A near Hinckley called the police as soon as they saw Rae’s -month-old son was also in the car when it stopped at the townaposs local Aldi. The mother was breathalysed and found to be over the drink-driving limit. She was arrested and pleaded guilty to drink-driving on Friday when she appeared at Leicester Magistrates’ Court. Prosecutor Sally Bedford told the court: “It was about .pm on May  when a witness called  having followed this defendant on the A. “They were concerned by the standard of the defendant’s driving.  She was driving on the wrong side of the road and when she pulled over and got out of the car she was staggering all over the place and tripped up the kerb. “There appeared to be a small child with her.” She added that Leicestershire Police attended and found Rae appeared to be “extremely intoxicated”. Ms Bedford said: “She presented as being very much under the influence of alcohol. She was arrested and taken to the police station.” At the police station, the -year-old mum, of Bradgate Road, Hinckley, was breathalysed and found to have a reading of  microgrammes per ml of breath. The legal limit is  microgrammes. Ms Bedford said: “She was interviewed and explained she had too much to drink and decided to drive to Aldi to purchase a dessert for dinner. “She accepted her standard of driving was very poor.  The court heard Rae had been deputy head of a large British school in Shanghai, but had then moved to Indonesia, where she had started drinking a lot. Since moving back to England she had been hoping to get work as a supply teacher, but she said she recognised that with the drink-driving conviction her prospects of employment would be extremely limited now”. Rae, who did not have legal representation, told the magistrates: “I’d just like to apologise profusely for my actions. I’m deeply filled with regret and remorse for putting my child at risk.” She told the court she had been working with the charity Turning Point to address her alcohol problem. She said: “They’re keeping me motivated to stay on track and not drink. “Once again, I can only apologise for my behaviour.” The magistrates ordered Rae to complete  hours of unpaid work and she was disqualied from driving for two years.

Kaiden Jake Shattock, now sixth months old, was born with an undiagnosed condition that meant he was born with only  percent of his skin  - just enough to cover his face. Jessica Kibbler and Jake Shattock, who were  when they had their baby, said Kaiden was in so much pain that even the nurses couldnapost stop themselves from crying. Kaiden, whose hearing is also impaired, was born  weeks into the pregnancy and while Jessica had had some complications while carrying him, there had been no indication of his condition. The parents, from Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, both now , described Kaiden as red raw, like a piece of uncooked meat when they first saw him nine hours after he was delivered.  When the nurses took us into the room to introduce us to Kaiden for the first time, he was red raw, like a piece of uncooked meat, Jessica said. There we were, two -year-old new parents, with no experience of raising children, and our first was born very weak and very ill. Everyone was silent, and everyone was distressed and upset. Jake and I cried, but even the nurses left the room and cried their eyes out because they didnapost know what to say to use and didnapost know how  to help him.  Kaiden was so fragile he couldnapost be held for ten days and even than he had to be wrapped in a mattress before being picked up. Being born with skin on his face only, he couldnapost wear any clothes. He was miraculously able to grow some skin after six weeks, although it is so thin and fragile that itaposs easily prone to tearing and scabbing. The toddler has since battled necrotising enterocolitis, congential herpes, dermolysis, and bronchiolitis thanks to his lack of skin and premature birth. Although doctors warned the parents it was unlikely the baby would make it through, Jessica and Jake said they will do anything in their means to help their son.  Jessica suffered with hydronephrosis - a kidney complication - during her pregnancy, and almost lived at the University Hospital Coventry  Warwickshire. She suffered bleeding and a broken amniotic sac nearly three months before Kaidenaposs due date, and went into an early labour. There had been no sign, however, that her son would be born with something akin to a full body burn. The young mum said after spending six weeks in intensive care and being unable tohome until he was  weeks, Kaiden now weighs lb oz and is very happy. Heaposs so perceptive - heaposs really starting to take everything in, she said.  She said despite his ear impairment, heaposs got the loveliest smile and the prettiest laugh,you get him going. We managed to pull him through - and weaposre so happy. We donapost know how long this will affect him, orthis is lelong but weaposre there to look after him and to love him no matter. Now heaposs very happy, and so much better after all the treatment heaposs had. Doctors originally speculated his skin condition was caused by a sepsis-congential herpes combination, but have since ruled that out and tested for countless skin disorders. Kaidenaposs case is now being examined by specialists abroad.

Fty local authorities admit they are burning “low-grade” packaging made from ­polyethyleneas it’s so brittle it needs to be sent to specialist recycling facilities. The problem is we don’t have any. Until last year, China received two-thirds of it, then it shut up shop. Other countries receiving our waste have also imposed restrictions, leaving us to deal with it. So instead of being turned into products, it is burned to generate electricity. There is a logic to turning waste that can’t be recycled into energy rather than being sent to landfill. But only as the last resort. The  incinerators we have in England produce the same amount of toxic particulates each year as , lorries – contributing to air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. I try my best to reuse packaging but when I do recycle, I want to know my efforts have not been betrayed by it all being shoved into a furnace.    England is on the brink of burning more rubbish that it recycles. While rates of domestic waste recycling have stalled since , incineration has tripled between   and  , although this is not due to a reluctance to recycle, or to do our bit for the environment. There is a huge gap between the best and worst local authorities. But this doesn’t mean people in Westminster or Birmingham, or any other area with poor recycling rates, can’t be bothered. The system just isn’t working. To find a way out of this pollution crisis we must ­radically reduce how much is produced in the first place. We need to ban plastics that can’t be recycled and businesses should set up proper systems for those that local authorities find most dficult. But in order to be able to stop burning rubbish and dumping it on vulnerable communities abroad, we must also get rid of our ludicrously complex and chaotic recycling system of over  dferent schemes. With bewildering collection systems of multicoloured boxes, bins and bags, it is perhaps not surprising recycling rates have flatlined. A nationally consistent system would mean every household in the country recycling the same items, helped by a set of easily recycled materials.

The investigator was said to be gathering “dirt” to discredit his accusers in the hope of reopening his case. But fresh reports from his native Australia claim the -year-old has abandoned hopes of clearing his name. When askedhe was planning to appeal his child abuse convictions, Harris told reporters: “No.”  The former Animal Hospital star added that he was suffering from diabetes, which requires frequent trips to the local doctors, one of his only regular outings. “I’ve got diabetes. I’ve suffered from it for  years,” he said when he was approached near his mansion in Bray, Berks. And a friend - named only as Michael - revealed Harris is rarely seen outside his riverfront property where he lives with his ailing we of  years, Alwen Hughes.

Born in , by the age of  she was recruited to her first woman’s team – one of many created during the First World War – and played for her country not much later in . Standing ft tall, the chain-smoking left-footed winger was an equal to any man – and one of the best players England has produced. In a -year career she scored nearly , goals. As our Lionesses prepare to head to the World Cup in France next month, Lily will become the first female ­footballer to have a statue when a le-size bronze monument is unveiled at Manchester’s National Football Museum in the same month.    Cousin June Patten, , says Lily would be proud but humble about the honour. “She was strong, she was forceful, she was determined,” says June. “It is safe to say she was the best woman ­footballer in the world. “We all knew her as ‘Our Lil” and we are proud that she was one of us. She may have been fearsome on the pitch, but off the pitch she was one of the kindest, most gentle, funny and loveliest people you could have met.” Lily was born in a rented house in St Helens, Merseyside, the fourth of labourer George Parr and his we Sarah’s seven children. She first honed her football skills playing alongside her brothers on waste ground near their rented family home. The local lads soon counted her as their equal with her fearsome reputation on the pitch becoming the stuff of local legend.    June explains: “The boys used to call for her and ask her to play football. She was just accepted as one of the lads. But one of them one day said to her I bet you can’t kick a ball hard. He said I’ll go in goal and you kick the ball at me. She kicked the ball so hard she broke his arm. She had a kick like a mule. She was a better footballer than all the boys.” It wasn’t long before Lily’s talents were spotted. It was towards the end of the First World War and most men were on the frontline fighting. Women took the helm working in mills and munitions factories in tough conditions, so bosses decided that taking up a sport like football in the fresh air would be good for them. So the beautul game became the women’s game with  ladies teams dotted across the country attracting crowds of thousands, and raising money for war charities. Dick, Kerr Ladies was the best of the bunch. It was run from a munitions factory in Preston, Lancs, with the factory girls grafting hard by day and taking the ­footballing world by storm at weekends.    Lily scored an incredible  goals for them in her first season. And she represented England in the first recognised women’s international ­football game, helping her country beat France -. When Dick, Kerr played St Helens Ladies on Boxing Day of , , people flocked to Goodison Park in Liverpool to watch the game, with ­thousands more said to be locked out. But just a year later, in spite of the popularity of women’s football, the ­Football Association banned women’s clubs from its grounds, deeming the sport “quite unsuitable for females”. The ban remained in place until the late s, but that did not stop Lily from continuing to play. She toured abroad with Dick, Kerr, staying with the team until  and scoring more than  goals in her career, making her England’s most prolic goal-scorer of all time. Lily was also known for her aggressive style of play, which didn’t always go down well with the referee or the opposition. In April  Parr and Hilda Durbar of Stoke United were sent off for fighting in Dick, Kerr Ladies’ ­fractious – win before , fans at The Old Recreation Ground.    But she also had a mischievous side – she was rumoured to swipe balls from the field and sell them for profit and asked for her wages to be ­supplemented with her beloved Woodbine cigarettes. June remembers that cheeky streak well, laughing: “She was a chain smoker. One day she was playing and the ball was at the other end of the field. “There was a man leaning over the rail smoking so she took his cigarette off him, took a big drag of it and then gave it him back. “The smoking didn’t seem to bother her though.” Her cousin lived with a woman called Mary, and June recalls: “Everyone was very proud of her. She used to come on a Sunday evening to my grandma’s house, she used to bring her friend Mary who was a lovely lady, she was delightful, and we used to look forward to her coming. “She and Mary were such a joy to be with. In those days people didn’t contemplate it, but looking back now they were very likely to be gay. They were a very happy couple. “But it didn’t register with us – they were just Lily and Mary.” Lily trained as a nurse working at ­Whittingham Mental Hospital, near Preston, until she retired. She died from breast cancer aged  in , but her legend lives on.    She was the first female footballer to be inducted into the Football Hall of Fame in , and next month her statue, commissioned by chocolate makers Mars, will be unveiled. Football historian Gail Newsham, who has written a book about the legendary Dick, Kerr Ladies team, says there is no doubt that Lily was one of ­England’s greatest players of all time. She says: “The power of her shot was always a great asset and her ability. She was naturally gted and fearless. “The longevity of her career makes her stand out too and enabled her to score so many goals. “The fact that she played for so long obviously shows her love of the game. She was always admired by team mates and opponents alike. “People now look up to her as being one of the first ‘stars’ of the game. There can’t be many more players,any, who have scored more goals than Lily did.”And Gail believes England’s ­Lionesses need look no further for inspiration than Lilythey want to bring the World Cup back homethis summer.“If they can believe in their own ability as Lily did in hers, they won’t go far wrong,” she says. “Be fearless and never give up. I am sure the ­Lionesses won’t let Lily, or the rest of the Dick, Kerr Ladies, down.

Its is alleged the agency accused the celebrated civil-rights campaigner of having up to  affairs. As the US Baptist minister rose to prominence in the s and s, he was subjected to years of wiretaps and eavesdropping by infamous intelligence chief J Edgar Hoover, who believed he had Communist Party ties. Details of the covert tapes have been revealed by biographer David Garrow, who says he has unearthed files not scheduled for release until .    The author claims Dr King, who was only  when he was killed on April , , spent  years – almost a third of his le – under the FBI’s watch. The covert surveillance was designed to undermine the civil-rights activist, as Hoover feared his popular movement could destabilise the country. Agents honed in on King’s philandering and claims he fathered a child – claims which Garrow argues could lead to “painful historical reckoning”. Although the tapes, recorded by bugs in two lamps in hotel rooms booked by King in January, , are still kept in a vault at the US National Archives, the author and historian has unearthed the FBI summaries of the ious incidents.    He claims they show King had extramarital affairs with up to  women and, shockingly, even “looked on and laughed” as pastor friend Logan Kearse raped a parishioner. The recording from the Willard Hotel, near the White House, in Washington DC, shows how King was accompanied by Kearse, who died in , along with several female parishioners of his church. In his hotel room, the files claim, they then “discussed which women among the parishioners would be suitable for natural and unnatural sex acts”. The FBI document says, “when one of the women protested that she did not approve, the Baptist minister immediately and forcefully raped her” as King watched. He is alleged to have “looked on, laughed and offered advice” during the attack. FBI agents were in the room next door, but did not intervene.    The following day, King and a dozen others allegedly participated in a “sex orgy” engaging in “acts of degeneracy and depravity”. When one woman showed resistance, King was allegedly heard saying that performing the act “would help your soul”. Senior FBI officials allegedly later sent a copy of the incriminating tape to King and called him an “evil abnormal beast” and told him his sexual exploits would be “on record for all time”. The letter also suggested he should commit suicide before his wrongs were revealed to the world. Mr Garrow said he had no idea of the scale or the ugliness of it, nor of King’s apparent indference to rape until he saw the files. He said: “It poses so fundamental a challenge to his historical stature as to require the most complete and extensive historical review possible.”    Historian and leading American civil rights activist, Edith Lee Payne, told the Mirror she was disgusted at the claims.The -year-old, of Detroit, Michigan, who became the iconic poster girl of the I Have A Dream speech in Washington, said: “This  information on Dr King is beyond disturbing.It’s blatantly obvious that this person is using the sterling reputation of one of the most admired and respected men for personal attention and for what remains to be seen. “Certainly an attack on Dr King would get him attention. Fortunately, there are still people around who were close to Dr King and know him and his character.The le of a dedicated, committed, selfless man, husband, father, pastor, and civil rights leader as Reverend Dr Martin Luther King, Jr. demanded that his time and efforts meet each challenge and responsibility. His respect as a civil rights leader reached millions of people from every wall of le, race, creed, colour, gender, nationality and religion in this country and around the world.Personally, I am immensely honoured and proud to have marched with him twice. The second time was the August , , March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom in Washington DC that rocked the nation and the world and we still celebrate Dr King more than five decades later and by generations who werenapost even born.   He will continue to be celebrated for generations to come. He was that kind of man. If the FBI really had damaging evidence on Dr King they would have exposed it.From first-hand accounts to me from members of his inner circle, he was never alone even he travelled. His time was consumed in strategies, meetings and organizing in preparation for acts of civil disobedience or whatever he was called upon to do, and, of course, rest.Heaposs authored scores of books and articles, delivered speeches public and private but his best time was spent with his family, a loving we, who accompanied him often, and with his four children whom he adored.Reverend Dr Martin Luther King Jr. lived a le of selfless service to God first and to humanity. There was no room or interest for anything . To suggest that he would knowingly or willingly engage in anything illicit or criminal would discredit everything he sacriced for, stood for and ultimately died for.Yesterday, the claims ided opinion among posters on social media.

Ted Bundy, Charles Manson and aposSon of Samapos David Berkowitz were just some of the notorious killers who described their horric crimes in chilling detail to him. For years he hid his abhorrence for the murderers, rapists and assassins across the table, collecting valuable information which would help snare many of Americaaposs most dangerous criminals. “Some of them were charming, but it was a superficial charm,” the -year-old said, recounting his conversations with monsters. “It was like staring into the eye of a shark, they would have killed methey could.” Now Douglas, who pioneered criminal profiling at a time when many thought it was a waste of time, said he is not surprised that public interest in his work – and particularly in Bundy and Manson – has spiked. He was the inspiration for Netflix series Mindhunter, while “manipulative”, “sadistic” but “charismatic” Bundy, who confessed to murdering  women, is now the subject of a high profile documentary series and movie.    Douglas interviewed Bundy repeatedly while he was on Death Row – and revealed he had to warn a colleague who he thought was falling under his spell. The profiler – whose work took a huge toll on him, nearly costing him his le - also toldthat Bundy was nearly successful in convincing the bureau to prolong his le in exchange for his co-operation – but Douglas opposed it. Describing the killer – who featured in a recent Netflix documentary and was portrayed by Zac Efron in movie Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile – Douglas said: “He was ruthless and he was a sadist. “He was a manipulator and a necrophiliac, but he was also very charming and gregarious. “He made a full confession to me and another agent.  “Later I had to speak to that agent because I felt he got too close to Bundy, he almost reached the point of feeling sorry for him. “Bundy would act like he was a victim, he claimed that pornography caused him to act the way he did, but that was baloney. “I had to remind the agent that Bundy was very manipulative, and that he was acting this way because they were getting ready to fry him.” And Douglas said the ploy almost worked.  “I had a call saying they wanted to keep him alive so they could study him some more, but I said no, itaposs really not necessary,” Douglas recounted. “I said Iaposd got to know him fairly well, thereaposs nothing more he can tell us.” Not long afterwards, Bundy was executed in January , aged . But Douglas said that from Bundy he learned that many killersto the scene of their crimes - a fact that helped catch killer Gary Ridgway, who was responsible for  murders.  Regarding the serial killer and rapistaposs portrayal on film, the ex-FBI man said: “I donapost think heaposs gloried in the movies, but I would have liked to see more on the impact on the victims and their families. “These people destroy lives.” Another notorious figure who Douglas interviewed, Charles Manson, is set to be portrayed in upcoming movie Once Upon a Time In Hollywood, starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt.  Describing his meetings with Manson, the profiler recalled: “Heaposs ft ins, it surprised me how small he was. “He stood up on a chair to exert himself over us. I knew he was going to do that because it was something he would do on his ranch. He was very dficult to interview, and some were very intimidated by him. “I interviewed him a couple of times, he said aposYou have to give me something. They know in the yard that the FBI are here.apos “He said he wanted my sunglasses, which were a pair of Ray Bans. He wanted them so he could go back and show them that heaposd ripped us off. “So I gave him the sunglasses, and he talked.”  From Manson, Douglas learned how cult members carried out the murder of actress Sharon Tate and four others at her home in August . In the hope of starting a race war, follower Lynette Fromme also attempted to assassinate President Gerald Ford in Sacramento. “I used a lot of buzz words to try and win his confidence, I tried to blend in and use the phrases I knew the Manson family used,” Douglas revealed. “In the end he said I was as nutty as him. “He was so into the helter skelter of creating a race war that his followers wanted to show they could be a somebody.”  The profiler said interviews would normally take place inside prisons at night, because the jailed monsters would often feel more at ease. When this wasnapost possible, FBI agents would dim lights to make it as dark as possible while serial killers talked. Others who Douglas interviewed in the early days of profiling included murderers Gary Ridgway – who confessed to killing  – John Wayne Gacy, who killed , Edmund Kemper and Gary Speck. He said the case that still haunts him the most is that of Lawrence Bittaker and Roy Norris, who became known as the Tool Box Killers during a killing spree which claimed the lives of five women.  They raped and killed their teenage victims over a period of five months in Southern Calornia in . “They made audio tapes of the torture, they would kick back, open a Guinness and play it over again,” Douglas said. “You could hear the screams. It was nauseating, I could only listen to a few seconds.” Douglas was the inspiration for FBI character Jack Crawford in the Hannibal Lecter movies, and worked with producers during the filming of Silence of the Lambs. To hammer home the true horror of his work, he played a segment of Bittaker and Norrisapos audio to Scott Glenn, who played Crawford, ahead of filming. “He was in tears, he was so emotional,” Douglas recalled. “Until then he said he was against the death penalty, but that changed it.” As a young agent he was determined to speak to serial killers to find outthere were any similarities that could help identy other murderers faster. From his work came the realisation that animal cruelty as a child could be a sign of evil deeds to come, and many experienced dficult childhoods. “They lack empathy, they see themselves as the victim,” said Douglas.   “They canapost identy with those they kill. If you do get them to cry, theyaposre putting on an act. “You have to show a feigned empathy with them to get what you want. Some agents would get angry and want to choke the guy, but you canapost do that. “I would find myself looking in the face of one of them and youaposd try to imagine what this face would look like when they were raping and murdering their victims, what the victim would see in the last moments of their le. “In most cases they donapost look like theyaposre capable of the crimes they committed, but you know theyaposre guilty.”  Kemper, who killed  including his grandparents and mother, was the first killer to be interviewed by Douglas and his small team. “He was talking about disposing of his motheraposs body, joking about it,” he said. “After we did that interview myself and the other agent got in the car and looked at each other, exhausted. We both needed a drink.”  Another breakthrough Douglas recalls was with Dennis Rader, who became known as the BTK killer – which stood for aposBind, Torture and Killapos. He was responsible for  deaths between  and . “I asked him what motivated him, and he said it was all about the rope,” Douglas revealed. “His thing was bondage, he sent sketches of his victims to the police.  “The main question I wanted to ask him was why he stopped for three years at a time. “In answer to that he told me heaposd got caught. One day he came home at lunchtime and put on a female victimaposs clothes and face mask, he was into autoeroticism. “His we walked in on him, but she never put two-and-two together and realised he was the BTK killer. “He said: aposJohn, I only stopped because I got caught.apos” At its height, Douglasapos department would be working on , cases a year. He believes there are between  and  serial killers carrying out murders each year in the United States - and poor communication between hundreds of law enforcement agencies means many are getting away with their crimes longer than they could be.  In Netflix show Mindhunters, which is due tofor a second series in the summer, Douglas is represented by idealistic young agent Holden Ford, played by Jonathan Groff. “The first series begins to show the toll that his work takes on him,” said Douglas. “I suffered anxiety attacks because of it. “In  I was teaching in New York City and I thought I was having a heart attack.” Days later, at the age of , he collapsed in a hotel room in Seattle. “I nearly died,” he said. “I laid on the floor for three days because I had a do not disturb sign on the door. “I was in a coma, and it needed months of rehabilitation. “I told the bureau that I couldnapostto active duty because I couldnapost lt a firearm, but they told me they just needed my brain. “At that time my brain was shot to pieces.” Nevertheless it would be more than a decade until Douglas retired from the FBI in . His first book, Mindhunter, was published the same year. Douglasapos second book, The Killer Across The Table, was released on May . On June  he will be the keynote speaker at the Eventim Apollo in Hammersmith, where members of the public can hear him speak at True Crime in Conversation.

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense.

What a lovely morning.To all who sent cards for my th, including the community council, the Wednesday Club, the Inveraray Highland Games , my warmest thanks. And many thanks to those who helped me up after my fall and in particular Stuart Campbell of Brambles who took me to the surgery, whose very kind people cleaned me up and sent me on my way to my party half an hour later.And a mention to Take the Floor too on Radio Scotland on Saturday night. Thank you Inveraray and District Accordion and Fiddle Club and Margaret Mather our secretary for this request.So I won#t forget my th in a hurry, but such kindness and friendliness cannot be forgotten ever.My thanks to you all,Niall Iain MacLean, InveraraySir,I read with great interest the letter in the March  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser from C Rees, Lochgilphead.In addition to all that was mentioned I wonderyour readers are acquainted with the McCrone Report which was written in the s As I’m sure your readers are aware this was when oil had just started flowing from the North Sea. Mr Gavin McCrone was, at that time, a civil servant instructed to write a report on the possible effects of North Sea Oil on the argument for Scotland’s devolution.This quote comes from a letter written, by Mr McCrone, in April : #The Paper was written over a year ago in the weeks immediately before the February  election. This will be particularly apparent on page  where, of course, the ministerial pronouncements referred to relate to the Conservative Government.#So he was instructed to write this report by a Conservative Government but was reporting to a Labour Government.This quote comes from the end of the letter: #When my paper was written it was classied “secret” and given only a most restricted circulation in the Scottish Office because of the extreme sensitivity of the subject.#The report discussed the possibility of Scottish Independence and came to the conclusion: #What is quite clear is that the balance of payments gain from North Sea oil would easily swamp the existing deficit whatever its size and transform Scotland into a country with a substantial and chronic surplus.#Now, this is a very tiny segment from a document that could have changed our history but that’s in the past and we must now look to the future.What is upsetting is thatthis wealth had been invested in an oil fund or more fairly distributed by the  British Government # either Conservative or Labour # there might not, now, be an upsurge in support for separation from Westminster.Wilma Watts, TarbertSir,With Theresa May’s Brexit deal yet again failing to get through the House of Commons and a delay to the date the UK is due to leave the EU, it is clear that we are simply lurching from crisis to crisis.One wonders what good an extension will actually do given the negotiating position of both the EU and the UK. The UK is deadlocked, in terms of its people, Parliament and Cabinet and the likelihood of any semblance of a deal that command the majority of the House of Commons is unlikely. This is especially true given the deep isions within the Tories, both Remainers and Leavers, as well as opposition from the DUP.Given this situation those like myself have long argued that a UK-wide referendum on the deal, a so-called ‘People’s Vote’, with the option to remain in the EU, is the only credible way to break this deadlock. For those who argue that this would damage our democratic process, I am not sure we can slump any lower than the situation we are currently in.As David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary and an ardent Leaver, pointed out before the EU referendum: #If a democracy cannot change its mind, it ceases to be a democracy.#There are few I know who voted for Brexit in the belief it would make them poorer, and it is up to the public to give its view on whether the deal, and more importantly its implications, are what it wants.For once I agree with Jacob Rees-Mogg who previously supported a vote on the renegotiated settlement. A statement he now curiously seems to have forgotten.The Scottish Parliament has led the way in backing a People’s Vote and now that we know the precise nature of the deal, it is up to the public to have its say.Alex Orr, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 13","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWe could be wrong, but the confusion over Minard war memorial seems to be nothing a sit-down over a cup of tea couldn#t fix.It#s a pity the community missed out on the centenary fund, but there are general UK funds available for war memorials.

An implementation plan was produced in December  to cover the years -. Who in Argyll and Bute is responsible for this plan  How many of the outcomes have been achieved As someone who has been involved with autism personally and professionally for many years, I find it extremely disappointing there seems to be an inability by those in authority to get organised enough to address the issues and provide services for autistic people and their families.There is no need for further drafts and consultations.Someone in the authority needs to take responsibility for the existing strategy and implementation plan and get on with it.Maureen Mackintosh, Ardrishaig.Sir,Scotland’s small building firms had a strong start to , in contrast to the UK construction small and medium sized enterprisesector, according to the Federation of Master BuildersScotland.The FMB State of Trade Survey for the first quarter of , the only quarterly assessment of the UK-wide SME construction sector, showed SME workloads declined for the first time in six years.In Scotland, however, there was a jump of  per cent compared with the previous quarter. Thirty per cent of weighted responses were positive, up from  per cent from the fourth quarter of .It is encouraging the Scottish construction industry is bucking the wider Brexit trend with workloads and enquires in rude health. The UK-wide picture is very dferent, with the construction SME sector overall contracting for the first time in six years.Scotland’s good fortune could be due to fewer EU workers being based north of the border compared with other parts of the country, like in London where one in three construction workers are from the EU.Relying less heavily on migrant workers has meant the Scottish construction industry hasn’t fallen foul of thousands of EU workers ing home during the long march to Brexit due to no longer feeling welcome in the UK or sure of their future here.Scotland’s builders, however, must not be complacent. Looking ahead, the First Minister has indicated thatthe UK does leave the EU later this year, she wants a second independence referendum before the next Scottish Parliament election in . This additional political uncertainty, on top of the continued uncertainty stemming from Brexit, could impact on the construction sector in Scotland.The fear is a looming second referendum could test consumer confidence this year and next. For construction SMEs, this is particularly concerning as their prospects are vulnerable to dips in consumer confidence as so much work comes from the private domestic sector.Gordon Nelson, Director of FMB Scotland.Sir,I was joined by my fellow Conservative councillors in Kilmory recently as we discussed atthe numerous challenges facing Argyll and Bute.Ferry sailings, roads, education and the SNP#s late single farm payments were all mentioned.With the SNP hammering local authority spending and cutting our budgets, challenges in delivering services will become more prevalent.Despite this climate of cuts from the separatists, Conservative councillors are delivering for Argyll.

It is obvious to everyone that the pier not being open is a resource wasted.#Inveraray Pier has been in existence since . Comprising an older stone-built section and later timber structure, it was once a thriving hub for Inveraray#s herring fleet and a popular destination for passenger steamers. It was used by everything from pleasure craft to puffers, with the military also making good use of it over the years.In more recent times it has fallen into disrepair and was closed off to public access in the last decade.#When we heard it was for sale we decided to make a bid,# continued Mr Byrne.#It would have been a shame to see it fall into the hands of someone who would want to use it just as a private pier. It#s about securing its future.#The Byrne family intends to re-open the pier for public use # but Mr Byrne is keen to dampen speculation about the potential future uses for the structure.Before anything  happens, the condition of the stone and wooden sections must be assessed, and reports have been commissioned from engineers and conservation architects.#I don#t want to raise expectation unnecessarily, but the most likely scenario is that we look to re-open the stone pier first of all,# explained Mr Byrne.Repairs would be needed to the stone structure and ironwork. New handrails and safety equipment would be needed along with lighting and basic security measures such as CCTV.Beyond that, the future of the wooden pier looks less certain.refurbishment is not an option, alternatives might include floating pontoons, while the potential for dredging around the pier and harbour might be considered.Through an agent, The Argyll Partnership, the Byrne family has contacted the Clyde Marine Planning Partnership with a view to having Inveraray included in the fledgling Clyde Regional Marine Plan, stressing that the pier #represents a great opportunity to contribute to the economic, social and environmental needs of the Clyde Marine Region#.And the new owners have said that the community council, Inspire Inveraray and others from the area will be fully involved as the redevelopment takes shape. The plans are also said to have the backing of the Duke of Argyll.Mr Byrne concluded: #Hopefully local people will want to help and come forward with ideas.#I don#t want to raise hopes at this early stage, but I hope that buying the pier is a good thing to do.#"},{"url":null,"title":"sports club lotteries 24 5 19","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe numbers drawn for the Kilmory Camanachd Club lottery draw on Monday May  were ,  and .

When she contacted the council to press for vegan meals they claimed it was not possible to provide vegan meals that complied with the nutritional guidelines for school meals.ldquoThat is quite clearly incorrect. The British Dietetic Association has long recognised that we can get all the nutrients we need on a fully plant-based diet, at every stage of le.ldquoIf Glasgow and East Renfrewshire councils can produce vegan menus that comply with guidelines, so too can Scottish Borders Council.ldquoAs a result of the councilrsquos refusal, the eldest child of the vegan parent had already missed out on free school meals in P-.ldquoI wrote to Scottish Borders Council challenging their refusal to provide vegan meals, pointing out their legal obligations under human rights and equality law.

It is not acceptable that vegan children are missing out on free school meals, or that they are excluded from eating in the school canteen with their friends.ldquoWe should be supporting children who have made a moral decision to avoid animal use and killing, recognising the impact their behaviour has on others.

revealed that the council paid the sum over the last six weeks, in order to get a former employee to sign a non-disclosure agreement.The request has also revealed that Scottish Borders Council has spent pound, of taxpayersrsquo money on so-called lsquogagging ordersrsquo since April .Non-disclosure agreements are contracts which are signed by both employee and employer, and which typically prevent staff or ex-staff from publicising certain information.That information can range from commercially sensitive details, such as innovations or company finances, to anything likely to damage an organisationrsquos reputation.Non-disclosure agreements have also infamously been used to prevent employees discussing allegations of misbehaviour, with a number of high profile cases in the UK making national headlines.A Scottish Borders Council spokesperson said: ldquoNon-disclosure agreementsare included in ious types of agreement entered into by the council to resolve a situation.ldquoNDAs are included for the benefit of both the council and the other party parties.ldquoIt is important to note that an NDA is one part of an overall agreement to settle a dispute, and the majority of any costs will be met from within the relevant servicersquos budget.The contracts are sometimes used when employees and their organisations have reached a settlement to a dispute, such as a claim of wrongful dismissal, without going through a full employment tribunal hearing.Reacting to the payouts, Hawick and Hermitage councillor Davie Paterson said: ldquoI am a bit concerned at the use of no disclosure

even-handed approach to non disclosure agreements.He said: ldquoSecrecy by a public authority is sometimes necessary, but any overuse does not reflect well on a public authority which should be committed to openness and transparency. ldquoI read of growing concern about the use of non disclosure agreements across a range of public bodies with Westminster MPrsquos, for example, calling for these to be made lsquoa thing of the pastrsquo.ldquoThat said I donrsquot currently think that Scottish Borders Councilrsquos use of these agreements is particularly out of line with their use by

Impressively, the Belarus fighter rose instantly, but was back on the floor by the roundrsquos end, saved from what looked like certain defeat by the bell.There was no escape for Baranchyk in round seven, however, Taylor hunting him down and connecting with shot after shot.To his credit, Baranchyk soaked up the considerable punishment he was receiving to hold his own in rounds eight and nine, before being rocked again in round  but just surviving to the bell.Knowing now he was well behind on points and that only a knockout would save him, Baranchyk emptied the tank in the final two rounds. Rather than trying to evade him, Taylor threw plenty of punches of his own, leaving the crowd gasping with concern on more than one occasion, but the Prestonpans ace stayed on his feet and knew he had done enough to win the world title he so craved.There was no tense wait for the result to be announced ndash there was no doubt at all who the winner was going to be.And as the words ldquoand the

He goes to bed with his T rex, plays with dinosaurs constantly and knows even the complicated names of lesser-known dinosaurs.However, we have tried very consciously to allow our kids to be who they are and resist the gender stereotyping that defines what a girl should be and what a boy should be.But here was my youngest daughter, at the age of five, clearly articulating the ision between girlsrsquo and boysrsquo toys.Her list was in line with the way toys are still marketed. Often there are two versions of the same thing, one for girls and one for boys.Even some story books are defined in this way, with images and colours which are used to reinforce the gender identity of the object evengender is not specically mentioned.Donrsquot get me wrong, I have no problem that my son loves dinosaurs.But I do have a problem with marketing directed at my children to force them into a narrow definition of what toys they should like based on a patriarchal version of gender.In truth, itrsquos not so much the toys themselves but the emotions and ways of being that are deliberately connected to them.Itrsquos the idea that boysrsquo stuff promotes bravery, toughness, being fierce and adventurous, while girlsrsquo stuff promotes cuteness, romance, beauty and love.It is changing and itrsquos much better than it used to be because there is so much more awareness and debate about this issue. Gender neutral marketing is more common now, mainly as a result of public pressure.But as the conversation with my daughter shows, we still have a way to go.But does it really matter  Is it just a politically correct obsession that is making a mountain from a molehill ldquoBoys will be boys, after all, and ldquogirls are all sugar and spice, and all things nice.It really matters, of course, and I think it matters just as much for my son as my daughters, perhaps even more so.That may be controversial, but I believe that as gender stereotyping is being challenged, it is often more dficult for boys to free themselves from the traditional definition of male identity than it is for a girl.I say this as a father of four girlsand one boy.Perhaps part of the reason for this is the fact that being male is still in many ways the privileged gender, and so there is an understandable focus on removing the restrictive definition of female roles which limit opportunities for women.But the struggle for gender equality has to be a two-way processit is to be ultimately successful.We must also unshackle our boys from the narrow definition of what it is to be male, a definition which still remains powerfully entrenched in our mindsets and the way society works.I personally suffered from this when at school. I was ldquosoft, sensitive, a daydreamer. I was often made to feel I was not a proper boy. There was no space for me to realise that the lsquoladdishrsquo way of being male was not the only way.Irsquom not advocating taking the dinosaurs away from my son and forcing him to play with a unicorn or Barbie doll. Even I loved dinosaurs when I was young. But it does mean allowing him, and yes encouraging him, to explore sides to his nature that society would still label as feminine: nurture, co-operation, make-up, dresses, dancing, looking after dolls and toys, and feeling vulnerable and being allowed to express it.The best way to encourage boys to express this part of who they are is through role modelling by other men, especially in the early years of childhood when a childrsquos brain is forming, and the childrsquos view of how the world works is being created.This includes how to treat others on a personal level.So nurture and care by male family members can be a crucial part of this. But one gender inequality we rarely hear about is the fact that men make up only two per cent of early years childcare workers. And this is an inequality not just for adults, but for our children.It conveys the message to young children that caring and nurture is not a manrsquos job or a male quality. So we grow up believing this is lsquonaturalrsquo.And this idea is so entrenched that there have even been examples of parents complaining that a man is working in a nursery!Looking after children is as much a manrsquos job as it is a womanrsquos. Or it should be, and seen to be. But itrsquos not just about work, or even childcare or parenthood. Itrsquos about ways of being and understanding that there are hundreds of ways to be a man or woman and we all have the right to make our own path.Thatrsquos why itrsquos important from the beginning to show that therersquos no such thing as boysrsquo toys or girlsrsquo toys: there are childrenrsquos toys.Or perhaps more accurately, to show the emotions and qualities traditionally associated with them are not gender specic.As always, children teach us. When we got home, Lewis put his T rex to bed. ldquoHersquos tired, he said, ldquoand hersquos a nice T rex.This was my lesson from my son: a T rex can be nice.He summed up the issue as only a child can."},{"url":null,"title":"looking-back-25-years-since-east-lothians-independence","story":"Twenty-five years ago this week, the Courier proclaimed the news with the headline: ldquoItrsquos independence for East Lothian.This week, East Lothian Council chief executive Angela Leitch said: ldquoThe Local GovernmentAct of  saw the abolishment of the two-tier Region and District Councils to be replaced with  unitary authorities across Scotland.\"I believe this has greatly benefited East Lothian communities, as responsibility for major services including education and social work were decentralised from Edinburgh and instead became the focus of political decisions at a more localised level.\"Over the years, our politicians have ensured ongoing investment in all of our towns and villages, providing facilities for local people, developing our infrastructure and continually working to improve the services we deliver. This has been recognised in a iety of inspection reports that have confirmed that East Lothian Council is a high performing council and has an ethos which recognises the importance of working closely with its residents and communities.\"Our elected members all live within the county, understand local issues and can ably represent the views of communities.\"Previously, some political decisions about our county were approved by people who had no real knowledge of East Lothian.\"Local government reorganisation has improved both local democracy and the ability of local people to hold the council accountable for the decisions it takes.Here, we take a look back at how we reported the news that the county had secured its place as a stand-alone local authority in the upcoming local government reorganisation:East Lothian has won the battle for independence.In a dramatic about face, Scottish Secretary Ian Lang has given in to the majority wishes of the population and decided it can stand on its own two feet.From , the district will once again become master of its own house as an all-purpose local authority.It means East Lothian councillors will be responsible for running a full range of services ndash from education and social work to rubbish collection and recreation.The Local Government Bill which will end the -year lespan of Scotlandrsquos network of region, district and island authorities is currently going through its final stages in Parliament.And earlier this week, Mr Lang ndash supported by local Labour MP John Home Robertson ndash tabled an amendment to give East Lothian the go-it-alone status it wanted.It was the high point in a hard-fought campaign by angry locals which began last year when the Government announced its original intention to lump East Lothian in with Berwickshire.But their success in fighting off that idea was not the end of the battle ndash they still had to persuade Mr Lang and his local government minister Allan Stewart that East Lothian was NOT too small to become an authority in its own right.They had also to force them to give up alternative plans to create an East Lothian-Midlothian-West Lothian authority ndash and more recently a proposal to merge East and Midlothian.As councillors and senior staff celebrated the announcement with champagne, [district] council chairman George Wanless smiled and said: ldquoWe are absolutely delighted with the outcome.He said it was dficult to say what eventually changed the minds of ministers.ldquoBut I have no doubt that the campaign the district council fought had a lot to do with it.He added: ldquoIf I was being charitable, I would say it was a case where the Scottish Office actually listened to the people for a change...It was, however, a ldquogreat decision for the people of East Lothian, who had supported the campaign from the start.ldquoI would like to thank all those who came out on the streets and took part in demonstrations in the early days of the campaign ndash and all those who wrote to Ian Lang in support of the idea that East Lothian should be an all purpose authority.Councillor Wanless totally rejected the previously-held Government view that East Lothian was too small to stand on its own.ldquoWe currently have a population of something like , and growing.ldquoBy the year  we could have at least , and my colleagues and I along with our officials are confident we can handle all the services that the new council will be responsible for.And he insisted: ldquoWe will do so in the same economic and efficient way the electorate have been accustomed to over the years.MP John Home Robertson said the White Paper to reform local government could have been the ldquodeath knell for East Lothian.ldquoBut people all over East Lothian fought back in a massive local campaign and we have won a magnicent victory.He paid tribute to Councillor Wanless and others who took part in the campaign, saying: ldquoWe have shown that public pressure can move even this Government.ldquoHowever, we are not out of the woods yet.ldquoLocal government is all about providing important services to local communities and we must continue to fight to ensure that East Lothian is properly provided with the funds it requires through revenue support grants.The councilrsquos Conservative group leader, the Rev Dr David Whiteford, said: ldquoI am very pleased that the Scottish Office ministers have listened to the electorate.ldquoThe view of the electors all along has been consistent ndash that East Lothian could and should be an all-purpose authority.ldquoI believe East Lothian has the capacity and potential to become an authority on its own and its staff are well capable of serving very well the needs of all the people.He added: ldquoI am very pleased that that message has now been accepted by the Scottish Ministers and that they have departed almost entirely from their original plan.ldquoLarge is not always beautul and I think we can do better on our own.He believed the transition to a stand-alone East Lothian council would be fairly simple.ldquoThe staff structures are already on the ground and all you really need to do is build on that.ldquoI do not anticipate a great deal of dficulty.ldquoIt is a challenge.ldquoIt is something that we should think through.ldquoWe have a new council coming into being and we should try to run it in a new style way.ldquoI hope councillors will concentrate on the needs of East Lothian people and will try and make that their main concern.Said SNP councillor George Thomson: ldquoEast Lothian has a growing population.ldquoWe have a good district council which is well capable of becoming a single tier all-purpose

The Committee on Climate Changewhich inspired last weekrsquos landmark target, is in no doubt that mass reforestation ndash and wersquore talking billions of trees ndash will be one of the major methods of scrubbing CO from the atmosphere.Scottish Greens: How you can help fight climate changeScotland is well placed to deliver on this at least. Those barren hills and glens used to be under a dense covering of foliage. The forests were cleared for agriculture and charcoal in the south, and latterly for sheep and deer in the north. So mass forestation is only restoring the ecological default in Scotland.Nice to know, too, that Scotland, on paper at least, is leading the way on meeting climate change targets, having reduced emissions by a creditable % since . This is better than the UK as a whole, which is itself a world-leader in climate control. Scotlandrsquos abundant renewable energy is going to play a major role in transforming the UK economy.Transport is one of the main areas yet to be decarbonised, and every watt of that green energy is needed to make the switch from petrol and diesel in the next decade. Itrsquos long overdue. The internal combustion engine is th-century technology, horribly complex, unreliable and inefficient. Future generations will be astonished that we allowed our city streets to remain sewers of toxic chemicals.Mind you, the Scottish Government needs to put its foot on the environmental accelerator pedal. It is three years since I wrote a series of articles on electric cars after being allowed to drive some of them around Scotland. There were precious few charging points back then, and therersquos scarcely any more now. Yet, the electrication of transport should be a relatively simple exercise.Every petrol station should be a charging station, every supermarket car park, every school and hospital. Wherever cars congregate, in fact. The good news is that no-one who tries a modern electric car will want to drive anything , because they are faster, cheaper, safer and more reliable.Of course, manufacturing any car uses prodigious amounts of energy too, requires many costly materials and produces toxic waste. Electric cars arenrsquot a solution to climate change, but electrication of transport must be, especially micro-transportation. Every city in Europe seem to be turning to those electric scooters ndash except in the UK where they are illegal. Half of the bicycles sold in Germany now are electric. People are turning naturally to more energy-efficient transport so why not give them a push :Climate clock is ticking and now is time for politicians to fightThe CCC report was rather benign on flying. Yoursquoll be pleased to know that itrsquos not being phased out. This is probably because reducing aviation requires international agreement. However, cuts in air passenger duty seem dficult to justy. The Scottish Government wants APD cut by % to attract more business and tourists to Scotland. But Nicola Sturgeon is going to have to bite the environmental bullet here. The optics are wrong. It looks too much like a middle-class subsidy, even though many working-class people swear by Ryanair.Then therersquos the nuclear conundrum. Scotlandrsquos nuclear power stations account for % of electricity generation ndash a large proportion of our nominally clean energy. But they are old and unreliable and in need of replacement. However, nuclear power stations are regardedas a safety issue following Fukushima. They are also ruinously expensive and damage the environment by producing toxic waste which needs to be stored for thousands of years.The nuclear industry leapt upon last weekrsquos CCC report as a vindication of nuclear as part of the de-carbon equation. Big money is going into painting the atom green. But the prospect of the Scottish Government commissioning a new nuclear plant, given the explosive cost of Hinkley Point C, Englandrsquos first new nuclear power station in decades, seem remote. Renewable energy is much cheaper, joule for joule,it can be brought to grid fast enough. We are in a race against time to seeTorness and Hunterston can be made redundant before they fall apart.There are other issues too. Homes need to be insulated, gas boilers are going to have to go. Wersquore told to keep our home thermostats at  degrees, when most of us donrsquot have them. Itrsquos all expected to cost -% of GDP. But what was remarkable about last weekrsquos much-anticipated report was how doable it all appeared. By comparison with the apocalyptic forecasts of the climate Cassandras, like -year-old school striker Greta Thunberg, the CCC sounded like a walk in the environmental park. Nicola Sturgeon insists that cutting carbon will improve our health and wellbeing and the quality of le. Wersquoll all be happier, cleaner and probably working less in our new habitable planet.I hope shersquos right. There was an air of wishful thinking about last weekrsquos pronouncements. But therersquos nothing wrong with accentuating the positive. The problem with the more alarmist forecasts of Extinction Rebellion, who want net zero by , is that they induce not willingness to change, but a sense of futility and public apathy. If addressing climate change is going to involve banning travel, eating no meat, digging for vegan victory and plunging the economy into a biblical recession, as we close down whole sectors of industry, then people will not buy into it. The Yellow Vest movement was ignited by an environmental tax.Scottish Greens: How you can help fight climate changeIt may well be that the climate change targets are still too conservative. According to the UNrsquos International Panel on Climate Change, CO emissions need to be cut faster to prevent the planet warming by more than .C ndash the new tipping point. But the Scottish and UK governments have consistently outperformed their targets since they started making them seriously over a decade ago. They can do so again.Much of climate hygiene is self-evident. The public are morally signed up to it, and while abandoning their petrol and diesel cars may seem a grim prospect now, in practice it is likely to be a liberation. Most cars spend their lives sitting near a pavement losing value through depreciation. With proper public transport and urban alternatives, everyone wins.Vested interests are always a block on progress, but there is now a remarkable consensus, from the CBI to the GMB, BP to the NFU, the BMA to BMW. Addressing climate change need not take us back to a pre-industrial world of squalor, disease and hardship. The human race isnrsquot over yet."},{"url":null,"title":"three-months-after-its-launch-how-strong-is-the-pulse-of-the-nations-newest-tv-channel","story":"Itrsquos a period in which the pound million channel dedicated to Scotland and Scottish content has, at times, attracted record digital audiences, won a quarter share of Scottish viewers, been the third most-watched channel in Scotland after BBC One and STV, reached more people between the ages of  and  than any other channel in Scotland, gained serious traction on social media and, in the best of its content, made good on its promise to give Scottish audiences programmes they wonrsquot see anywhere  and which deal with the issues and subjects that affect, concern and interest them .But itrsquos also a period marked by a wild iance in audience ratings , by whispered rumours of discontent and in-fighting, by a perceived lack of brand identity and by a barrage of negative headlines either questioning the need to have the channel in the first place or pouring scorn on specic programmes, such as The Nine or Catriona Shearer-fronted gameshow Wonderball.:  years of rock and roll - and all that jazzLaunching BBC Scotland in Glasgow in February, BBC Director-General Tony Hall outlined the aims of the channel. As he saw it, they were to celebrate Scotlandrsquos strengths in arts, comedy, science and ldquothought. To reflect the countryrsquos ersity. To allow audiences ldquoto interrogate the things that matter to them and, along the way, to ldquoreinvent public service broadcasting. BBC Scotland, he stressed, would offer space for discussion and debate alongside opportunities to ldquokick back and have fun. It would be about the country speaking to itself but also to the world. It would be local, national and global.In other words it would be a lot of things to a lot of people. Or it would try to be. So, three months after its glitzy birth and with the numbers soon to roll over to Day  of its existence, how is BBC Scotland bedding in  What do audiences think of it  And how well is it measuring up to Hallrsquos lofty claims Steve Carson, BBC Scotlandrsquos Head of Multi-Platform Commissioning, is predictably bullish about its prospects and its track record. To his mind the station is about trying to take risks, giving a  to ldquoa strong range of voices and communities and doing ldquonew things and dferent things. So far the strike rate is good, he thinks. Among the successes he points to are Getting Hitched Asian Style, a documentary series following a wedding planning company in Glasgow, the opening night screening of Nae Pasaran , and Last Breath, a drama documentary about a North Sea er stranded on the sea-bed.Identying a stand-out is ldquolike naming your favourite child, he says. ldquoBut I think Asian Weddings is something I was pleased to see hellip It was quite straightforward but it got into communities you donrsquot often see and certainly donrsquot often see in that sort of context.For an example of risk-taking that paid off he points to Sink Or Skim, which took a fond look at the World Stone Skimming Championship held annually on the isle of Easdale in the Firth of Lorn.ldquoThatrsquos not a subject many channels would have commissioned, but it was a beautully made piece and it was funny watching it go out and looking at social media because people were going lsquoI canrsquot believe theyrsquore doing something about stone skimming. Is this part of their sport portfolio rsquo. But by the end of it the same people were going lsquoThat was really goodrsquo.Sink Or Skim was a one-off but The Peoplersquos News is a weekly discussion of topical events in which ordinary Scots go in front of the camera and have their tuppence-worth on topical events. Those featured might not have the political contacts of a Laura Kuenssberg, say, but they have something just as important: context. They represent the social and political views of people in a spread of communities distant from London and far removed from the Central Belt. Itrsquos another example of the channelrsquos guiding principle that BBC Scotland should be a  for discussion and debate and again itrsquos a programme that wouldnrsquot have aired anywhere .ldquoWe could have done a dferent version of this channel which would have been a lot less risky and done a lot more of what other channels do, says Carson. ldquoA Scottish version of BBC Four, for example, would have been a less risky proposition. But we already have that, so we felt it was important to try new things, go for harder to reach audiences and deliberately take risks knowing that not all of them ndash in fact many of them ndash wonrsquot pay off. Thats what wersquore about.So which risks havenrsquot paid off ldquoThatrsquos like naming your least favourite child, he says. ldquoI think the programmes that we have originated between pm and pm have had a tough time, but again our medium term strategy was not to originate as much there. The Nine has had ratings which have gone up and down, but wersquove always said thatrsquos a competitive slot. But on a digital channel ndash and wersquore already the biggest non-terrestrial channel in Scotland with a three per cent share, which is well ahead of projections ndash audiences will go up and down across the night and the week.:  years of rock and roll - and all that jazzIf therersquos a lightning rod for criticism, The Nine is it. An hour in , staffed by a team of presenters and journalists that numbers  ndash at least in the publicity shots ndash and fronted by Rebecca Curran and award-winning former ITN journalist Martin Geissler, itrsquos the stationrsquos flagship news programme.A lot rides on its wellbeing and it seems a little peaky. It was reported that on one day in late April viewing figures dropped to just . They picked up the following day, to , but even on April , the first day of the inquiry into the Clutha disaster, they couldnrsquot quite hit . From a first night high of ,, thatrsquos a signicant drop.ldquoThe Ninersquos average is signicantly higher than that figure and its reach, which is really important in news, is reaching a quarter of a million a week, Carson counters. ldquoItrsquos offering something dferent. If you wanted to point at a show which is something we wouldnrsquot have otherwise done, The Nine is it ndash an hour long news and analysis programme which looks at Scotland, the UK and the world through Scottish eyes.So is it simply the right show but in the wrong time slot ldquoWersquoll see. Nine orsquoclock is a competitive slot but there is a demand there and people are turning to it. The appreciation for The Nine is very strong and wersquore finding that across the board. You might get some programmes that donrsquot have huge average audiences but the appreciation is strong.In a front page story earlier this month, London-based broadsheet the Sunday Times quoted a BBC source who called The Nine ldquoa turkey. The same source added: ldquoYou canrsquot have a channel that nobody watches. Journalists like their output to be watched and it wonrsquot be long until some of the channelrsquos main talent head for the door. Another source spoke of a ldquopoisonous atmosphere in the newsroom causing behind-the-scenes tensions which could cause key staff to walk. True or   ldquoThat is not the case, Carson says bluntly.Among the keenest watchers of how BBC Scotland has fared over these first three months is Dr Lisa Kelly, a lecturer in television at Glasgow University.ldquoIrsquove been pleasantly surprised, she says. ldquoI think I probably wasnrsquot holding out much hope at the beginning, primarily due to the budget ndash pound million for programming isnrsquot much to play with in the television landscape.To put the budget in context, the BBC is spending nearly three times that amount on the new EastEnders set. But funding aside, Kelly is excited by the apparent focus on nurturing and showcasing new talent. Shersquos also impressed by the choice of programmes and pleasantly surprised at the internationalism of its outlook. One innovation she particularly welcomes is the Next Big Thing strand, which screens short films such as as Meet Me By The Water by Scots-Asian writer-director Raisah Ahmed.ldquoI think therersquos been quite a range of programming. It seems like they are trying to be erse in terms of their representation. So obviously you have Getting Hitched Asian Style and The Nine, which is trying to tackle current debates around issues of representation. So I think it has been quite successful so far.And does it matterratings are low for some programmes ldquoI donrsquot know that it does this early on. I think itrsquos important that we have access to original Scottish programming at a local and national level.There are other challenges, she thinks, besides ratings. One is establishing the channelrsquos identity. ldquoIrsquom not quite sure what its brand is yet in terms of how itrsquos selling itself. I noticed that before the launch it was targeting young people with this notion of fresh and original ideas, but I donrsquot know whether theyrsquoll be able to sustain that.Another is proving that the bold talk ndash of nurturing young talent, giving voice to dferent groups and communities, taking risks and tackling ersity ndash will be backed by bold actions.Wherersquos the Scottish Phoebe Waller-Bridge, for example  And how embedded is the commitment to ersity and inclusion, to actually hearing new voices and seeing dferent stories rather than it just being rhetoric with no change Theyrsquore questions for which Steve Carson has a ready answer. Sothe Scottish Phoebe Waller-Bridge was out there with a project she was aching to make, is he convinced he would find her and commission it ldquoI hope so. And I think we are finding quite extraordinary talent at all levels and also stretching people who might already have done one thing but are now doing something . Like State Of It, which is Robert Florence [co-writer of sketch show Burnistoun] doing quite a scabrous satirical show. Itrsquoll be coming out in the autumn.There is data which can help, however. A measuring system known as ldquosocial listening can analyse social media responses to any subject and from that gain an insight into how that subject is viewed, expressed as the over-riding emotion associated with it.:  years of rock and roll - and all that jazzBBC Scotland set the algorithms running at launch and four weeks later the results came back. ldquoThe strongest emotion in social listening was surprise, says Carson. ldquoThat was really encouraging. So modern Scotland, outward looking, surprising and focussed on new talent ndash thatrsquos the core identity of the channel. SoBBC Scotland is a keyboard emoji, itrsquos a colon and a zero.Three months ago, the channel launched with a Miracle. Whether itrsquoll need another one to make it sing in the long term is harder to judge. As they probably donrsquot teach you to say in continuity announcer school, watch this space.BBC Scotland: The Good, The Bad And The NineGetting Hitched Asian StyleA behind-the-scenes documentary following Glasgow wedding planners Saffron Events as they prepare for a succession of glamorous weddings, Getting Hitched Asian Style proved so successful that it received a repeat run on BBC One and has been re-commissioned for a second series on BBC Scotland. Produced by the Scottish ision of London-based Firecracker Films itrsquos a good example of the channelrsquos stated commitment to programmes which reflect Scotlandrsquos ersity. Verdict: funny, interesting, occasionally jaw-dropping but ultimately humane.A View From The TerraceBorn out of The Terrace, a long-running podcast, AVFTT is fronted by four young presenterswho sit on sofas and talk engagingly about Scottish football. Refreshingly free of Old Firm bias itrsquos fast becoming a Friday night staple for those fans of the Beautul Game who think subjects such as the on- and off-field shenanigans of Partick Thistle legend Chic Charnley or how Eriskay has one of the best pitches in the world are as worthy of discussion as whorsquoll be the next manager of Real Madrid. Verdict: a great signing.Sanjeev Kohlirsquos Big TalkA weekly show in which the comedian is joined by a  of guests for a ldquosideways look at the big issues of the week, filmed in what looks like the foyer of the BBCrsquos Pacic Quay HQ in Glasgow in front of what looks like a smattering of audience members. ldquoI never in my le want to endure another excruciatingly mirthless hour of supposedly witty commentary on the weekrsquos news, wrote one Herald critic. ldquoIt was so awful the only way to hang on to consciousness was to watch what was happening outside the glass-fronted studio. Less trenchant criticism has concentrated on the showrsquos stfness and its uneven format. Verdict: could do better.WonderballItrsquos probably destined for cult status among Generation Z-ers as an endless source of memes, but in the here and now BBC Scotlandrsquos flagship gameshow hasnrsquot been exactly showered with love. Letrsquos not take it too far, though: Wonderball is not, as right-leaning tabloid the Daily Mail has suggested, the worst show of its type ever aired, eventhat paper might like it to be. But you canrsquot say that those who have pointed out its flaws ndash the somewhat complicated rules, say, or the unintentional snigger value of two young men being instructed to play with the blue balls ndash donrsquot have a case. It hasnrsquot been a ratings hit either, with viewership dropping as low as  for one episode. Verdict: not utterly pointless, but not likely to become the next Pointless.The NineA team of talented and accomplished presenters, a  minute running time and a news agenda that blends hard-hitting investigations with quirky or thought-provoking items hasnrsquot stopped BBC Scotlandrsquos flagship news programme taking considerable flak from some quarters. Earlier this month one newspaper talked of a ldquotalent exodus from the channel and quoted a BBC insider who called The Nine ldquoa turkey. Damage has undoubtedly been done as a result: negative news stories about behind-the-scenes tensions and potential resignations may not be true, but they contribute to a narrative of failure which becomes hard to shake over time. What is true is that ratings for The Nine have been disappointing on occasions, though in mitigation its time slot doesnrsquot help. Verdict: a rocky start for a potentially stellar offering that may flourish in a dferent time slot."},{"url":null,"title":"top-scientist-backs-public-health-campaign-on-stupid-nitro-meat","story":"In an interview, Professor Denis Corpet said the link between nitrite-meat and bowel cancer is ldquoclear and said parents and consumers need to know what they are eating.His call came after the Herald on Sunday launched a campaign urging the Scottish Government to ensure that the meat offered in schools and hospitals is free of nitrites. Every opposition party at Holyrood backed the call, meaning that it has majority support in the Scottish Parliament.: Parent groups urge action on process meat in schoolsLabour MSP Monica Lennon said: ldquoProfessor Corpet is right to demand that more public information is made available in Scotland about the risks posed by nitro-meats. Scottish Labour fully backs a ban on processed meats containing nitrites in our school and hospitals. The Scottish Government can act now to protect and improve the health of the nation, and they should act swtly.In , the cancer wing of the World Health Organisation published a report which placed processed meat, which includes bacon, ham and deli products, in the same carcinogenic category as tobacco and asbestos.Experts concluded that a daily intake of g of processed meat - the equivalent of two rashers of bacon, or one hot dog - increases the risk of colorectal cancer by %.The health risk occurs when processed meat which includes nitrites - a preservative - is heated, producing carcinogenic nitrosamines in the body.Previous estimates have suggested that % of bowel cancers and % of all cancers in the UK are caused by eating red or processed meats.Bowel cancer is the third most common type of the disease in Scotland. Every year around , people are diagnosed and around , people die.Herald on Sunday campaign: time to dump nitro meat from schools and hospitalsHowever, although the WHO report was published four years ago, scientists and politicians have been frustrated at what they regard as a lack of action from governments across the world.In February, it was revealed that around three quarters of councils in Scotland are offering nitro-ham to pupils, and nearly twenty local authorities confirmed that they provide other nitrite-meat, including bacon, corned beef and chipolata links.Nitro-meat is also served in hospitals and, on this basis, we launched a campaign to stop these products from being given to pupils and patients.Professor Corpet was one of the scientists behind the WHO report and is based at the French National Veterinary School in Toulouse. He said of the research he carried out: ldquoWe were able to demonstrate that the rats that were given sausage, or sausage roll, or bacon, are at higher risk for colorectal cancer, than the rats that were given the same meats without nitrites.ldquoIt can be prevented by removing nitrites.On governmental inaction since the reportrsquos publication, he said: ldquoThe consumption of processed meat is carcinogenic. That was the true statement. It should be enough to act or to change things.ldquoThey [Governments] did nothing. They were just waiting. I donrsquot know why. Four years later, nothing was issued, in France, or Europe or in the UK. This was very strange.Labour council leader: I want our school meals to be nitrite-freeProfessor Corpet said industry mounted a lobbying effort to claim they were not ready to make changes, but he insisted: ldquoThe Government should say lsquotry to make something which is not carcinogenicrsquo. The Government should say we want safe meat. Some [companies] will just remove nitrites, others will add vitamin e.On removing nitrite-meat from Scottish schools, he said it would be hard to implement a ban when parents feed their children ham at home. However, he backed a public health campaign on processed meat and nitrites: ldquoThey should be told that they should not normally eat it. As soon as the consumers are aware, they will choose [something healthier].He said nitrite-meat could either be phased out over a number of years, or reduced to a level such as once a week: \"It is really stupid to have processed meat [presented] as normal meat.Professor Corpet also said there is a poverty aspect to the debate: ldquoIt is worse for poor people who eat a lot of low price hot dogs, which are full of nitrites while rich people are eating salmon, he said. ldquoPoor people will move more slowly than rich people.However, his main target of criticism is the national food quangos whose job it is to protect the public: ldquoI understand why Governments were not worried, as they have other things to do. But it is the agencies - it is their job.The Scottish Government last year launched a consultation on overhauling the food and drink regulations for schools. One of the proposals is for the introduction of a maximum level for red and processed meat.At First Ministerrsquos Questions on Thursday, Labour MSP Monica Lennon asked Nicola Sturgeon whether she agreed that nitro-meats should no longer be served in Scotlandrsquos schools and hospitals.The First Minister replied: ldquoThere are, of course, international standards, with which we will fully comply. We are absolutely committed to supporting the health and wellbeing of children in schools and have a key role to play in the provision of balanced, nutritious food and drink every day, which our regulations help to ensure.Guillaume Coudray: removing nitro-meat from schools and hospitals is \"urgent\"A Scottish Government spokesperson said:ldquoProviding healthy meals for children and patients is vitally important. We regularly consider what public health campaigns are necessary and will study with interest the comments from Professor Corpet.ldquoWe expect schools and hospitals to serve healthy and nutritious food.

in a school setting.This newspaper last week urged the Scottish Government to rid school dinners and hospital food of nitrites, a preservative which is linked to bowel cancer.A majority of councils and NHS boards use nitro-meat and opposition politicians have called on the Scottish Government to intervene.SNP ministers are considering strengthening the national guidance on nutrition in school meals, plans that will include a limit for processed meat.Speaking on behalf of Connect, which used to be the Scottish Parent Teacher Council, Prior said that parents are concerned about the nutrition and quality of school meals.ldquoHealthy eating is essential to learning, concentration, brain development, good eating habits for le and wellbeing ndash surely giving children school meals of the highest quality and nutritional value is the best investment we can make  This means serving fresh, not processed, food, she said.ldquoAs well as nitrites, processed meat such as ham, sausages or

School meals are, for some young people, their mainmeal of the day, so it needs to be good quality.ldquoOur most disadvantaged children are entitled to a free school meal and deserve not to have chemical laden food. But any cost increase incurred could not be passed on to the pupils and their families, as school meals currently remain reasonable value for money and should not, through cost, become a luxury.Plant-Based Health Professionals UK, a group set up to promote wellbeing, is also critical of the use of processed meat in hospitals.ldquoIt is indisputably one of the vital issues of our day to raise awareness of the cancer-causing and disease hazards of consuming processed meats: health service leaders and government need to take a lead to get these food risks removed from our hospitals.ldquoPlaces which are dedicated to healing and health education should not be serving foods that are known to be detrimental to health.It added: ldquoWe see it as a dereliction of collective health professional responsibilitiesred processed meat continues to be served in our hospitals to patients, staff and visitors.Professor Annie Anderson, a professor of public health nutrition and medical adviser for Bowel Cancer UK, also commented: ldquoThe research linking processed and red meat, such as bacon, ham, salami, and some sausages to bowel cancer has been emerging for over ten years, and there is some evidence about the role that nitrites may potentially play in this risk.ldquoA few simple changes to your lestyle can help stack the odds against bowel cancer. As well as avoiding processed meats, limiting our intake of red meat, keeping a healthy body weight and alcohol intake low as well maximising physical activity."},{"url":null,"title":"65-years-of-rock-and-roll-and-all-that-jazz","story":"TO -year-old Helen Hardie, ldquoit was music to some people, and it was a heck of a noise to others.David Dowie, , remembers: ldquoIt really affected most of the youth, and dance halls were full all the time.

The house, designed by John and Robert Adam, is full of furniture designed by Thomas Chippendale, but the grounds are just as glorious.There are plenty of places to start your walk but one of the best is the small car park off the Barony Road near the A at Auchinleck. This is the northernmost point of the Duchess of Rothesay Avenue, a long, straight path lined with lime trees and a quarter of a million daffodils. Go mid-morning and,yoursquore lucky, you will walk all the way in the sun. You can also stop half way at the Temple Gate, a -year-old gatehouse restored as part of the ongoing work on the estate.At the bottom of the avenue, wander round the arboretum and check out the Japanese-style bridge over the River Lugar. The bridge is only a few years old but its design was taken from an original drawing submitted by the Scottish architect Robert Weir Schultz in the th century.Next follow the River Lugar through the woods towards Cumnock. The town is the capital of Ayrshires industrial history and youll see plenty of evidence of it on the walk, including the hoist of the former Barony mine on the horizon, like a giant letter A. Wander along the river before turning north and heading back up to the car park.Pit Stop: The Coach House Cafe on the Dumfries House estate is a great place to stop. Itrsquos open seven days a week and serves that most modern of delicacies: the vegan sausage roll.MARK SMITHThe Commando Memorial and High Bridge, Spean Bridge, LochaberTime: Around - minutes, or longer to fully appreciate the scenery.What makes it special: It might be just shy of three miles but this little walk has everything: breathtaking views of Ben Nevis, oodles of history, a good mixture of flat paths and short inclines and accessibilityIt is easily located, by foot a mile from the village of Spean Bridge, or start half-way up the hill, through a gate off the A. Go through a kissing gate at the foot of the Commando Memorial, the A-listed monument built in  to soldiers who trained here during the Second World War.The walk is steeped in childhood memories and family landmarks, weaving through wooded and open paths along the River Spean, close to my old primary school, Kilmonivaig, and the pebbled shore of the River Spean, where my sister and I were taken for picnics with banana sandwiches in the holidays.The old croft house where my mother grew up, Achnahannet, is visible in the distance, at the start of the route. The first half of the walk is almost entirely downhill, through woodland, grass and heath and a joy to run.The path eventually joins the old railway line, and arrives at the ruins of High Bridge, crossing the steep gorge of Glen Spean.There is an information board about the bridge and its role in the  Jacobite rising. It was the site where the first shots were fired against British troops by Jacobites loyal to Prince Charles Edward Stuart. Three days after the clansmens victory, the Prince raised the standard at Glenfinnan, marking the start of the doomed campaign.Scotlands favourite gentle strolls: Part oneThe path eventually veers away from the river and crosses heathland, ascending gradually and then sharply. There is a welcome seat, ahead of the steepest incline to take in lovely views of Aonach Mor and Ben Nevis.The path is well made and suitable for some all-terrain baby buggies. However, the wooden bridges can be slippery and dogs must be kept on leads.Pit stop: The route ends by the side of the A, around half a mile from the village, where walkers can enjoy a restorative cup of tea and decent scones at Spean Bridge Woollen Mill.CAROLINE WILSONStrathclyde Park, MotherwellTime: Its up to you really. There are so many options. A full circuit on the path alongside the loch is just over three milesWhat makes it special: The park has , acres of mature woodland, rough wetland and open water, providing a home for more than  dferent species of animals and birdsA level tarmac path runs round the loch. This is the one I tend to do, andI am feeling energetic I walk around twice. You will, however, spend your time avoiding the cyclists and dog walkers. I do this walk with my friend who is afraid of dogs, which is entertaining to say the least! From Strathclyde Park to Barons Haugh RSPB nature reserve short sections of the walkway have relatively steep gradients. A detour around the nature reserve will reveal meadow, marshland, scrub and woodland habitats. After leaving the reserve the walkway passes Dalzell Estate, originally a royal hunting forest. In the th century the estate lands were transformed into an orderly and landscaped park. From Dalzell Estate and beyond Adders Gill the path is prone to flooding, especially in winter, so an alternative route is signposted.Pit stop: The waterfront cafe is good for coffee and cake, or a soup and sandwich.JACKIE BROGANUrgha to Rhenigidale ndash The Postmanrsquos Path ndash HarrisTime: - hours.What makes it special: An ancient island route that features stunning coastal views, sheltered coves and abandoned villagesUntil its road was opened in , the tiny settlement of Rhenigidale could only be reached by boat, or via the Postmanrsquos Path, a spectacular and in places challenging, .-mile route across hill, bog and rock. It wasnrsquot only the postie that used the path, of course children walked the route once a week, in all weathers, to and from secondary school in Tarbert.Starting out in Urgha, two miles from Tarbert, the gentle start offers great views of Clisham, the highest peak on the Western Isles, giving way to a steeper descent. The detour to the deserted settlement of Molinginis ndash which once had  residents and its own school ndash is well worth the ersion.Further along the route, the zig-zag descent to the shore at Loch Trolamaraig can be tricky, but itrsquos the perfect place to enjoy a picnicthe weather allows. If yoursquore lucky, you might see seals or even an otter near the shoreline.Heading back upwards, past more abandoned cottages and round steep clfs, Todun, the m hill above Loch Seaforth, dominates the latter stages of the walk. Through a gate, you eventually reach the now famous road, built after a David and Goliath fight by local man Kenny Mackay, the former postman who walked the path three times a week and still lives in the village.Scotlands favourite gentle strolls: Part oneStanding above Rhenigidale, on a clear day you can see to the Shiant islands and beyond. You can see why Mr Mackay and the other residents love the place so much.Pit stop: Facilities are limited ndash there is no hotel, shop or cafe ndash butyou need to rest your head, therersquos a cosy hostel run by the Gatlf Trust and a holiday hometo let.MARIANNE TAYLORNewport-on-Tay and Berryrsquos Den, FeTime: Half an hour to a whole day ... itrsquos up to youWhat makes it special: This lovely community, straight across the Tay from Dundee, is just ripe for a wander around ... and Berrys Den is an unexpected treatDundeersquos all the rage just now hellip and itrsquos all thanks to the VA. But what to do once yoursquove visited this amazing attraction  Whatyou want to get out of the city  Well, herersquos an idea hellipIf you look across the river from the museum, thatrsquos Newport, and yoursquoll notice a huge patch of woodland that seems to cut the village in half ndash thatrsquos Berryrsquos Den.I grew up just along the road from here, and this wonderful labyrinth of tracks, ornamental ponds, giant trees, hidden woodland paths and historic buildings was the ultimate urchinrsquos playground.Nowadays, it still holds the same charm, and you can get to it with a five-minute drive across the Tay Bridge. You can even walk there on a nice day ndash it takes less than an hour. There are a number of ways in: just out of the wee town centre on High Street, halfway up the hill on Cupar Road ... or my recommendation would be to keep walking up Cupar Road until youre almost at Newport Primary School. The entrance is then on your right through the grand gate, and from here you can wander through the whole estate to the bottom gate on High Street .And while yoursquore there, why not stroll around Newport itself .Pitstop: Newport has plenty of shops and places to eat, so you wonrsquot be stuck for sustenance.ANDY CLARKKirkintilloch to Torrance loopTime: Around  hoursWhat makes it special: The glorious backdrop of the CampsiesOK, so its not the most picturesque of starts, in Barleybank car park in Kirkintilloch ndash but it does get better, I promise.Cross Cowgate and head down the slope on to the Forth  Clyde Canal towpath heading towards Bishopbriggs.Meander along the canal ndash its all fairly flat so not too strenuous ndash and after about one mile you come to the Stables. Passing the restaurant ndash or indeed stopping, like me, for refreshment ndash continue along the towpath to Cadder church.From here, its a leisurely stroll to Cawder Golf Course and along the riverbank path towards Torrance .In Torrance, heading up the main streetbeyond The Rambler pub, turn right into a small play park. This park was the former site of Torrance railway station which used to welcome children from inner city Glasgow in the s and s to their first taste of the countryside.Scotlands favourite gentle strolls: Part oneTake the path down to the left and come on to the route of the old Kelvin Valley Railway line.Follow the old railway line through open farmland, with further views of the Campsie fells. When you can follow the old line no further, head down the wide path to the right and go along the edge of Hayston Golf Course to reach a wooden gate and sign for Kirkintilloch. Continue along the path to reach the River Kelvin, head up the path between fields to reach Hayston Road. At the top of Hayston Road, cross the A Glasgow Road and turn right.Take the small path crossing the bridge and leading you up a short steep hill back onto the Forth  Clyde Canal and back into Kirkintilloch.Pitstop: Take your pick of the Stables, The Torrance Inn, The Wheatsheaf and The RamblerVICTORIA BRENANCorstorphine Hill to Inverleith in the footsteps of Robert Louis StevensonTime: frac hours What makes it special: The views, the iety of terrain and the fact that for large parts of it yoursquod never know you were in the cityEven without the RLS connection itrsquos a beautul walk, starting high with a glorious view over the capital from Corstorphine Hillthen dropping down into the lush riparian walkway that accompanies the Water of Leith as it runs from Roseburn to Stockbridge past the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art and St Bernardrsquos Well. But for fans of RLS itrsquos a particular treat.At Rest and Be Thankful on Corstorphine Hill you can stand in the spot where Alan Breck Stewart and David Balfour say their farewells at the end of Kidnapped. From there you can either head east along Ravelston Lane or descend the hillrsquos southern slope to the main road where at Western Corner you find Sandy Stoddartrsquos towering  sculpture of the pair. Then itrsquos on to picturesque Dean Village, fictional home of Catriona MacGregor Drummond, the titular heroine of Stevensonrsquos  sequel to Kidnapped. Finally you end up at super-posh Howard Place in Inverleith, where the author was born in .Pit stop: Do it on a Sunday and Stockbridge Farmersrsquo Market will be in full swing. The paella is excellent. Monday to Saturday, Edinburghrsquos answer to Notting Hill is packed with chi-chi cafes, pubs and eateries. There are also great cafes at the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Artrsquos Modern One and Modern Two, and at the Royal Botanic Gardens, which are opposite Howard Place.BARRY DIDCOCKKelvin Walkway ndash Kelvin Aqueduct to Botanic GardensTime: Around  minutesWhat makes it special: In the heart of Glasgow, this walk transports you out of the hustle and bustle instantly ndash a breath of fresh airStarting at the Kelvin Aqueduct, follow the path down through the trees and emerge beside the River Kelvin. The roaring rapids quickly dissipate into calm ndash a haven for birds and other wildle. Itrsquos a matter of following the river, meandering past the remains of the North Woodside Flint Mill and under the huge archways of the Kirklee footbridge. The HaPenny Bridge, rebuilt in , is good for a game of Poohsticks or a nice place to stop and watch the river below. Even on a rainy day, the ancient trees and foliage are a good canopy to shelter under while you watch the dozens of dogs scampering by, swtly followed by their owners.If yoursquore feeling energetic, take a shot on the Scandinavian-style outdoor gym equipment close to the flint mill remains, or give it a miss and continue on until you reach a set of huge iron gates and a bridge crossing the river. At the other side, atop a set of steep, winding steps is the Botanic Gardens and civilisation once again.Pit stop: As itrsquos such a short walk, best focus on the end and make a beeline of the Botanic Gardens cafe once yoursquore done.HANNAH RODGERLanglands Moss, Langlands Road, East KilbrideTime: A leisurely woodland walk through the network of new paths and the forest takes about an hour to  minutes.What makes it special: Sweet-scented trees, an abundance of butterflies, birds and bees, and the knowledge that the peat bog is saving the planet by acting as a huge carbon sinkLanglands Moss is a little gem of a place, on the outskirts of the industrial estates at the southern edge of East Kilbride. The local nature reserve is managed by the mighty Friends of Langlands Moss volunteer conservation group and is a place of great beauty and importance, and a very pleasant spot to escape from the everyday. Schoolchildren and environmental groups have worked hard to preserve the peat bog and surrounding woodland, and there are now frog ponds and a wildflower meadow to admire, plus a network of forest paths. They can get muddy at times so sturdy footwear is essential, but all are accessible.Pit stop: There is no visitor centre, yet, at Langlands Moss, but just along the road in Auldhouse village sits The Lost Lamb, a fantastic restaurant adjacent to the long-standing pub the Auldhouse Arms. Perfect for a hearty lunch, or for relaxing in the outdoor seating area with a cold drink, admiring the countryside views.ANN FOTHERINGHAMAndyoure after something a bit more energetic ...Meikle Bin, Campsie FellsTime: - hoursWhat makes it special: Its a walk into the wilds for the reasonably fit through beautul countryside and rewarded by fantastic views, all within easy reach of the central beltI can see this hill from my bedroom window, and getting there is as much an adventure as climbing it. From Kilsyth, take the brilliantly named Tak-Ma-Doon Road across the Campsies and down to Carron Bridge. As you climb this ridiculously steep and windy road, you really feel yoursquore leaving any last hint of urban le behind.Scotlands favourite gentle strolls: Part oneAs you drive along theof Carron Valley reservoir, Meikle Bin looms large on the skyline on your left. Stop at the car park at the western end and then just follow the path. Itrsquos simple, and beautul, and a great place to take the dog. Cross the bridge over the River Carron, and then its basically a steady but not-too-strenuous climb up through the woods. There are a number of turn-offs along the way, butyou stick to the main path its not too dficult to find your way. Keep going until you get to the path to the summit on the left.Now it gets serious, and steep, but there is the wreckage of a downed plane and a Christmas tree complete with decorationsto find. Besides, the view at the top makes it all worthwhile. Retrace your steps to get back down.Pitstop: On a hot day, take a picnic and stop at the bridge over the River Carron. Let the dog have a swim hellip in fact, why not go for a paddle yourself  Itrsquos a lovely spot.ANDY CLARK"},{"url":null,"title":"labour-heading-for-good-kicking-in-euro-poll-says-john-mcdonnell","story":"His comments come after deputy Labour leader Tom Watson said the party must ldquofind some backbone and fully commit to a second referendum on Brexit to have any chance of winning the next general election.Mr McDonnell said he understood Mr Watsonrsquos frustration, but that the party had been right to ldquotread a really dficult road of trying to bring Leave and Remain supporters back together.The shadow chancellor said Labour would pay an electoral price for that stance when European Parliament results begin to be announced late on Sunday.Mr McDonnell told Sky News: ldquoI think we most probably will get a good kicking in the election results tonight.ldquoWersquoll see.We are braced for that.He added: ldquoBut, you know, we had to do the responsible thing.ldquoIt was a hard road to follow.

I first came across his political commentary in the spring of  while studying at UC Berkeley, in Calornia.Milo Yiannapolous, the far-right British polemicist, had just been kicked off campus after students and anti-fascist protesters surrounded the building where he was due to speak and set fire to a floodlight with a molotov cocktail. And the ldquoalt-right, an umbrella term used to describe the majority of the far-right at the time, were angry.The definition of alt-right, short for alternative right, has been contested by academics and the movementrsquos erse nature makes it almost impossible to summarise.But it can broadly be classed as a set of far-right ideologies, such as white nationalism, anti-Semitism, anti-feminism and centrally, the right to free speech.Like any ideology, the movement has ious levels of intensity from extreme far-right neo-nazis, to those who pick and choose which aspects of the movement to uptake in order to remain socially acceptable.The alt-light is a term often used to describe the movements YouTube personalities, who tend to avoid voicing extreme views, but have been known to espouse many of the movementrsquos beliefs to their hundreds of thousands of followers.Mr Benjamin has previously been grouped in this category, but Mike Wendling, BBC journalist and author of Alt-Right: From chan to the White House, explained the term ldquointellectual dark web may more accurately describe him and the other YouTubers who descended on Berkeley that year.ldquoHersquos cultivated a fan base, hersquos cultivated quite a passionate fan base, but hersquos not alt-right, Mr Wendling said.ldquoHersquos explicitly said that he doesnrsquot believe in the alt-right.ldquoOn the other hand hersquos obviously very offensive. He claims to be for free speech but itrsquos more specic than that, itrsquos not really about free speech itrsquos about the freedom to offend people.Benjamin on the campaign trail in South West EnglandMr Benjamin and many other YouTubers from this so-called ldquointellectual dark web rallied on Berkeley in the name of ldquofree speech, when a number of other far-right speakers were banned from campus following the Milo shutdown.They documented the unfolding ideological clashes between controversial far-right figures and anti-fascistcounter protesters, but events quickly escalated to violence.During one protest, I witnessed a car drive through a crossroads full of people and carry on, full speed, out of the other side with a man clinging onto the bonnet.The incident happened just months before -year-old Heather Heyer was killed at another far-right protest in Charlottesville, Virginia, by James Alex Fields Jr., who also drove his car intentionally into a crowd.These YouTubers depicted the Berkeley protests like war zone.For example, well-known alt-light YouTuber, Canadian-born Lauren Southern, frequently used militaristic language in her content.She titled one video ldquoThe Battle for Berkeley and declared in another, ldquoWe took back lsquocommorniarsquo because of one terrible battle decision by the communists!When Mr Yiannapolous planned a ldquofree speech week on the campus in September that year, Mr Benjamin flew over to join his fellow \"dark web intellectuals\"., who recently came under fire posted a satiric video of a dog hed taught to raise its paw in the manner of a Nazi salute. \" alt\"HeraldScotland: Mr Benjamin on stage with another YouTuber, Count Dankula , who recently came under fire posted a satiric video of a dog hed taught to raise its paw in the manner of a Nazi salute. \" class\"editor-image\"Mr Benjamin on stage with another YouTuber, Count Dankula , who recently came under fire posted a satiric video of a dog hed taught to raise its paw in the manner of a Nazi salute. The violence of the Spring protests had mostly subsided by September, but, like the other YouTubers before him, Mr Benjamin filmed his curbside political arguments with the counter-protesters.In a one-and-a-half hour ldquoFree Speech Documentary on his channel, you can see these arguments in full, as well as the  he gives to the notoriously violent Proudboys, an organisation which claims to be just a ldquopro-Trump drinking club.Speaking to one of their members Mr Benjamin said: ldquoDo you want to tell me about the Proudboys, because I have a funny feeling you guys get a lot of bad press and you donrsquot get to tell your story.This week, leaked chats from the group obtained by The Huffington Post, revealed they were discussing injuring and even killing their ldquoenemies.One message read: ldquoAll I want to do is smash commies too. Actually Irsquom lying, Irsquom way past just hitting them. When the time comes I will stop at nothing to fully eradicate them all!Read more:Boris Johnson under pressure over attacks on Scotlands public spendingIn  many U.S. commentators labelled the Berkeley protests as simply alt-right vs Anta, but ious ideologies existed on both sides and to call either a homogenous group would be a mistake.Nevertheless, through extensive analysis of the videos posted by Mr Benjamin and other ldquointellectual dark web YouTubers who attended the protests, it appeared they operated within an unofficial, online network.By interviewing one another, sharing each otherrsquos content and allowing the far-right voices to dominate over any other, YouTubers such as Mr Benjamin, Ms Southern, and even ex-VICE journalist Tim Pool, established what could be described as a pack mentality during the Berkeley protests.Mr Benjamin did not interview Anta protesters with any veil of journalistic professionalism, choosing instead to mock them in his videos. While when he interviewed far-right figures he gave them uninterrupted airtime to deliver their message.He also frequently used the content of the other far-right YouTubers who were attending the protests, which helped to push a joint narrative that the Anta were the violent ldquocommunist aggressors, while the ldquopro-free speech protestors were justied in their retaliation.Despite their assertions they were not part of any group, the YouTubersrsquo coverage clearly favoured the far-right protesters, in a classic display ofldquoin-group, out-group mentality.They labelled the Anta protesters as one indistinguishable violent faction, while the opposing side were seen as erse and acting in self-defence.Although Mr Benjamin and the other YouTubers videos garnered hundreds of thousands of views, did they actually have any offline effect \" alt\"HeraldScotland: Mr Benjamin was milkshaked while on the campaign trail this month \" class\"editor-image\"Mr Benjamin was milkshaked while on the campaign trail this month That September, Mr Yiannopoulos delivered a speech to a small crowd from the Sproul Steps on the UC Berkeleys campus.Dressed in a stars and stripes hoodie Mr Yiannopoulos shook hands with supporters and made a few dashed words before he was whisked away by bodyguards.The ldquointellectual dark web hailed it as a ldquovictory for free speech, and yet the furore and mass crowds that swelled during that year seemed to ebb away as quickly as they rose.Now Mr Benjamin has stepped out from behind his computer yet again, this time onto the political stage in Britain. But will his huge online fanbase, which donates thousands to him monthly via crowdfunding s, manest into support at the polls Mr Wendling doesnrsquot think so.ldquoIf you have a message that gets so many people riled up then surely you can convert that into a political messageyou do it the right way, he said.ldquoBut maybe that is the problem, maybe itrsquos simply a fact that the actual campaign is not as compelling as your YouTube videos.ldquoThe signicance is that they are people with large YouTube followings, who come from fairly provocative, offensive, or extreme right positions and they have not been able to translate that into a political movement.The majority of the media attention that has surrounded Mr Benjamin during his election bid has centred on the tweet he sent in , in which he said he ldquowouldnrsquot even rape Labour MP Jess Phillips.The tweet Mr Benjamin sent in . Mr Wendling added he has not conveyed ldquoany sort of philosophy during his campaign, ldquoall hersquos known for is a rape joke, he said.But the ability of online power to translate into electoral success is still yet to be proven on both sides of the political spectrum.Following the success of the Black Lives Matter protests in the U.S. one of the movementrsquos leaders, DeRay Mckesson, ran for mayor of Baltimore in .Despite rallying thousands of protestors for racial equality and having a strong online base with over , followers on Twitter, Mr Mckesson received just over , votes finishing in sixth place.ldquoTherersquos always been a disconnect between developing a large social media presence and turning that into a mainstream electoral success, Mr Wendling said.ldquoThe jury is definitely still out on the actual influence of social media.While out on the campaign trail Mr Benjamin has been doused in milkshakes, banned from election hustings and a police investigation has been launched following that  tweet.Despite naming his channel after a conqueror who is remembered as the first ruler of an ancient empire, it appears his political history may be recalled as one which was swtly extinguished by pound. milkshakes."},{"url":null,"title":"most-scots-blame-poor-wages-for-workers-claiming-benefit-says-survey","story":"A total of % of respondents to a YouGov poll for Citizens Advice Scotland gave this response when questioned on the reasons for claiming benefits.One in sixsaid they need extra to look after themselves or family members due to expenses such as illness or childcare.Just over a thirdbelieve claimants have been unlucky with their circumstances, such as accruing unexpected debts.Almost a fthbelieve benefits claimants \"are lazy and dont want to work more than they currently do\".The online survey of , adults also found that three quarters of peopleagreed workers on benefits work just as hard as anyone  and % agreed there should be more help for people to claim what they are entitled to.Around a thirdagreed thatbenefits were not so generous people would learn to stand on their own two feet, but % said cutting welfare payments would have a negative effect on the lives of many.More than halfbelieve people who rely on social security are in that situation through no fault of their own.However, more than a thirdsaid most people could managethey just budgeted sensibly, and % agreed the majority of benefits claimants have it easy because they get everything paid by the Government.The survey results have been released ahead of Citizens Advice Scotland launching a new campaign on Tuesday, aimed at encouraging people to get a financial health check through the organisation to ensure they are receiving payments for which they qualy.Citizens Advice Scotland chief executive Derek Mitchell said: \"This polling busts a series of myths around social security, and shows that the vast majority of people believe that our welfare state is there to help workers who need a hand, especially as the cost of living is soaring while wages have remained broadly the same.\"People should be claiming what they are due.

The council’s Infrastructure Services Committeedecided on Thursday, May  to introduce alternative arrangements to push up recycling rates and reduce materials sent to landfill. They approved an option to use households’ existing bins in a three-weekly collection cycle while officers continue to work to explore funding opportunities for further changes. One bin and a food waste caddy will continue to be collected every week meaning week one will start with general waste binsand food waste collected, week two will see Recycling binand food waste collected, and week three will also be a recycling bin and food waste collection.The materials that can be recycled on the kerbside remain the same - the only dference is that the blue-lidded recycling bin is emptied more often.The new service will be piloted in some areas in  and rolled out to the rest of Aberdeenshire in .Households will be contacted in advance by post.As over % of the waste produced in Aberdeenshire is recyclable using the existing recycling services, this change should allow an increased recycling rate, while work continues to seek other ways to push that up even further using kerbside services. ISC chair Peter Argyle said: “Clearly the decision by Zero Waste Scotland not to consider our funding bid has had a negative effect on our well-developed plans to push up Aberdeenshire’s recycling rate and send less recyclable materials to landfill.“This was not our first choice as a solution, but this is the position we find ourselves in and we feel that this option makes the most of a dficult situation and will help push up recycling rates. “At present, we see this as an interim measure, while we work to deliver a permanent scheme which provides a service for our residents which enables them to recycle as many materials as possible.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.ellontimes webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Meldrum Library is located at the Academy campus\"  Help Doctor Who by visiting library viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\"“One of the key things we continue to try to impress is that we want residents to simply think for a second about how they dispose of the waste they generate, then use the services we provide as best they can.” Vice chair John Cox said: “It can come as no surprise to anyone that councils are trying their hardest to offer services which push up recycling rates and make the most of recyclable materials. “I’m pleased officers have been able to come up with an interim alternative which keeps us moving in the right direction. “Although landfill capacity is essentially reduced,recycling services are used to their full capacity most households should be able to cope and the use of the food waste bin means there should be no additional hygiene issues either.”Other changes to be introduced under the new Waste Strategy are still going ahead – including improvements to Household Waste Recycling Centres from this month and an increased number of garden waste collection points across the area this summer.Over half the materials in local non-recyclable waste bins are recyclable through existing services – equating to around , tonnes of recyclable materials being landfilled at a cost of £.million a year.Not only does maximising the value of a material benefit the environment, it also frees up money for other essential council services."},{"url":null,"title":"changes to come at aberdeenshire hwrcs","story":"As part of Aberdeenshire#s sht towards greater recycling rates and sending less materials to landfill, tyres and asbestos will no longer be accepted at any of the area#s Household Waste Recycling Centresfrom Monday, June .The change, which also applies to four of the council’s waste transfer stations, is expected to save around £, a year and have minimal impact on householders. The money saved will be used to employ extra staff at recycling centres, who will advise customers how best to dispose of materials, helping to increase recycling rates and reduce disposal costs. Tyres are not classed as household waste and the council has no legal responsibility to deal with them – anyone buying new tyres can pay for disposal of the old ones at the same time. Although one of the lowest tonnages of any materials handled at HWRCs, tyres are one of the most expensive to dispose of. With very limited options to recycle or reuse them, they are currently sent to a cement kiln for use as fuel, at a cost to the council. Asbestos, only currently accepted by the council at four sites under limited circumstances, is currently sent to a specialist landfill site for disposal at signicant cost. Although tyres and asbestos together only account for less than .% of the waste handled by the council each year, neither method of dealing with these materials is classed as recycling. Waste Manager, Ros Baxter, said: “We know a very small number of Aberdeenshire residents bring tyres or asbestos to the council for disposal. This service is an expensive one to provide and only benefits a few residents. “Neither of these materials contribute to the council’s recycling rate, but they do cost signicant amounts of money to deal with and take up space at the facilities where they are collected. “Requiring the person or company which generates this type of waste to ensure it is disposed of correctly at their expense not only saves the council money which is being reinvested in better services, it also frees up space for the recycling of other materials in future.“Many tyre retailers offer a disposal service for old tyres for a small fee and vehicle users should make use of this service where possible, as most people do.“There are commercial companies who will accept asbestos waste for disposal at two licensed landfill sites for a fee and anyone disposing of this material is advised to contact them.” Signs will be in place at facilities which have accepted the materials in the past advising of the change.

To enter the competition, members of the public should post a portrait photo celebrating walking in some way, on Twitter or Instagram, using the hashtag #HumansOfTheWalk. Multiple entries are allowed with the competition running until Friday, May , next week. Those who take part are in with the chance of winning a Nikon B Coolpix camera.Ian Findlay, chief officer at Paths for All, said: “Orkney has a number of great walking routes — whether it’s residential streets or local paths and green spaces — and we’re keen for the community to celebrate how they make these part of their daily routines.“We want the photos to be a true reflection of everyday walking — walking that builds friendships, gives you headspace and gets you feeling fitter and out enjoying nature.“Walking can help prevent ill health, build communities and create a happier, healthier, greener Scotland and we know that people can demonstrate just that with their Humans of the Walk photos. “We want to revolutionise the way people use their cities, and stop our spaces from being dominated by cars. Scotland’s towns and cities should be a backdrop for people walking, scooting, cycling or simply spending time enjoying cleaner, quieter, calmer streets.“Paths for All is looking forward to seeing them all and wish everyone who enters the competition the best of luck.”Paths For All#s aim is to signicantly increase the number of people who choose to walk in Scotland, whether it’s walking for leisure, to work, to school or to the shops. The charity works to create more opportunities and better environments for walking, as well as cycling and other activities to help make Scotland a more active and greener place.For more information on Humans of the Walk and the competition, visit: https:www.pathsforall.org.uk humanscopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This is both the highest volume of advance sales ever achieved in the voluntary-run festival’s -year tenure, as well as the greatest number of pre-festival sellouts. Stromness, the festival’s hometown in Orkney’s West Mainland, has already begun welcoming early arrivals, including some of this year’s furthest travelled visitors # Cape Breton’s globetrotting powerhouse quartet, Còig # as well as famed Irish singer Cara Dillon and Irish firebrands Four Men and a Dog, who are currently celebrating their th year on the road.Whilst early arrivals are no rarity for the festival, a far greater number than usual are already in Orkney, owing to a one-day Air Traffic Controllers’ strike across Scotland’s Highlands and Islands taking place today. As well as the closure of Kirkwall Airport, Inverness — a hub for flights from Ireland and England, before the final hop up to the islands — is also shut. With just a fortnight’s notice,  inbound arrivals originally scheduled for today, Thursday, have been rerouted, leading to early arrivals for most.Those already enjoying Orkney’s famed hospitality will soon be joined by fellow headliners including the groundbreaking Scottish three-piece, Lau a newly formed trio of celebrated Irish musicians John Doyle, Dermot Byrne and Éamonn Coyne and internationally renowned Hebridean vocalists, Julie Fowlis and Kathleen MacInnes, who visit Orkney as part ‘Between Islands’ # a collaborative project led by Stornoway’s An Lanntair, uniting musicians from Orkney, Shetland and the Outer Hebrides. Emerging artists are also prominent in this year’s festival programme, with appearances from BBC Radio Scotland’s Young Musician of the Year , Benedict Morris new Scottish six-piece Heisk and Helensburgh fiddler Ryan Young, whose accompanist, Jenn Butterworth, will work a double-sht across the next four nights, also playing with the high-spirited Glasgow group Kinnaris Quintet. In total,  acts will meet in Stromness — with the  visiting acts welcomed and outnumbered by Orkney’s thriving local folk scene, which itself features internationally renowned artists such as Saltfishforty, The Chair, The Wrigley Sisters and Gnoss, alongside local favourites including Hullion, the Kirkwall City Pipe Band # currently celebrating their centenary year # and many more. This amounts to an estimated  featured musicians # though many more will meet in Stromness, with the town’s pubs and hotels bursting with informal pub sessions from opening to closing time across the four days, alongside the ticketed programme. As well as Stromness, this year the festival reaches out to communities in Birsay, Burray, Finstown, Kirkwall, Orphir, Quoyloo, Sanday, Sandwick, St Margaret’s Hope, Stenness and Tankerness.In order to stage such a large event, the festival gratefully receives generous support from public bodies and corporate sponsors, from throughout the local and national business communities. This year’s principal supporters are Orkney Islands Council, Creative Scotland, NorthLink Ferries, Loganair — who also facilitated the rebooking of all those affected by the air traffic strike at zero cost, the Pier Arts Centre, and EIS, alongside many more inidual event sponsors and corporate patrons. The festival also benefits from many thousands of hours donated by hundreds of volunteers, who give their time freely to bring the world-renowned event together. From the twelve-strong year round management committee, to those who might work on just one event in their local community hall, each one of the festival’s community team is vital to its long standing, continued and increasing success.Festival director, Bob Gibbon said: “After many months of preparation we are delighted to be welcoming visitors and artists from far and wide, friends old and new, musicians from across the globe, to Orkney for what is set to be a memorable weekend of fun and good times. #Everyone has come together create a magnicent programme of events, and the festival just gets better and better. Orkney should rightly be very proud of what we can share, and this weekend is about sharing music, memories, time and happiness. Enjoy it everyone!”The festival’s chair, Elaine Grieve added: #I say this every year but I#m really excited about the programme for the weekend. There#s something for everyone fabulous visiting acts and a great number of local artists — and that#s something we really want to share with audiences. #It#s such a lovely time with many familiar faces ing and new joining the fold # a bit like a huge family reunion!#Alan Morrison, head of music at Creative Scotland said: “There are few places in Scotland with a more magical atmosphere than Orkney, where the stones of past civilisations sit alongside the buzz of the modern world. That’s also true of the Orkney Folk Festival, where the island’s heritage is woven into music being made by some of our best standard-bearers and rising stars. #It’s great to see so many brilliantly talented artists sharing a bill with musicians from far and near – andsome of them had to arrive a day early, well, that just means the sessions are already underway.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

In Orkney there are a lot of farmers on their own, with  cows, living a lonely existence — they might not see another person for weeks.#He said that#s why he makes a conscious effort to socialise with others.

It#s hard to come away from the farm and be social, but it does have its benefits, and sometimes the lack of time is over-used as an excuse.##There are  hours in the day, so you need to give one to yourself.

Instead, it’s about our ability to act as decent human beings, to use reasoned arguments against those we disagree with and,these fail, to agree to disagree in a spirit of civility,perhaps not always friendship. And it’s also about our political leaders demonstrating that they are committed to these basic standards and disapprove of those who fail to live up to them.In recent times, we have seen MPs harrassed and intimidated outside the Westminster parliament, called “traitors” and “Nazis”, while throwing milkshakes has become so common that police have asked some fast-food restaurants to stop selling them when a particular type of politician is in the area.: Kenny MacAskill: Brexit-induced contempt for politicians is risk to democracyAnd yesterday, Police Scotland’s Deputy Chief Constable Will Kerr told a meeting of the Scottish Police Authority that they had decided to deploy more than  officers to ensure public safety during today’s European Parliament elections. “We would have never normally done that in the past.

But the continual improvement of financial services, driven in part by Scotland’s booming fintech sector, enables us to understand our spending better now than ever before.window.twttr “Cash rules everything around me,” was the refrain of “C.R.E.A.M”, by the Wu-Tang Clan, commenting on the big-spending US rap music scene in the s. But the music stars of the future are unlikely to have the same reverence for dollar bills, pound notes, or indeed any other kind of physical currency.Thanks to the rapid development of smartphones and financial technologies, we all now have the ability to pay for pretty much anything without ever having to visit a cash machine.And fintech companies are now working closely with the established banking giants to better understand how people engage with both money and technology.Whether it’s getting an approval for a mortgage, or simply saving for a rainy day, technology is helping tailor better products to help us achieve our financial goals.Such products may not inspire any pop or rap hits of the future, but they are already an invaluable tool for many people.To develop such a consumer-led approach, the country’s fintech firms are busy trying to understand what drives our spending.Stephen Ingledew, the chief executive of FinTech Scotland, has had years of experience in the financial sector, where he has played an active and major role in implementing \u2028customer-focused and technology-enabled initiatives.As a former senior executive for large companies, such as Standard Le and Barclays, as well as smaller financial enterprises, he is ideally placed to help both with mutually beneficial enterprises.“Organisations are not just focusing on the emotional side,” he says. “What we’re involved in is how fintech people engage with money and technology.“The interesting thing about fintech is it does not start with finance or technology – it starts with the human need. Then companies work back to find out how they can better serve that need. It could be spending, it could be saving, it could be anything to do with money.”Ingledew admits that in the past, the big banks often adopted a one-size-fits-all approach to products. However, he is confident that fintechs can help change that.“Because you start with a human point of view, you are more likely to actually meet people’s real needs,” he adds. “That’s something financial services has not always done very well in the past. It has tended to rather push products on people rather than start with the need. Fintech is turning that upside down.“Fintech is helping banks take a much more consumer-led approach, rather than simply trying to sell a product.”Role of moneyThe FinTech Scotland boss is understandably keen to promote the innovative work already being done north of the Border. He cites MoneyMatiX as one example of a fintech company which helps customers better understand where their cash comes from and where it goes each month.He says: “MoneyMatiX is all about helping people understand the role of money – they call it financial literacy. If you’ve got a better understanding, you can make better decisions – whether to spend, whether to save, how best to pay.Castlight Financial, which offers real-time affordability and financial capability analysis, is another.Ingledew says: “Castlight Financial, based in Glasgow, helps customers really understand their ability to borrow money. “Rather than taking a credit score, they are understanding someone’s behaviour. How money is going in and out, how they are spending. How that could be improved so they can get a low rate of interest when they borrow.“They are focused on behaviour. One of those aspects is people’s emotional responses to what we buy and how we spend it. “The key thing about data is that it’s not just about financial data, or looking at someone’s financial record in a very narrow way. “What affordability assessment does is look at people’s data. Two people may get the same salary but their behaviour may be very dferent. One may be very frugal, one may be very spendthrt. That’s where behaviour becomes very important – instead of just looking at where the money comes from and where it goes out.”While the average bank customer may not be intimately familiar with fintechs, that does not mean that they have not already benefitted from their work.“None of these fintechs are going to become household names in the near future, like HSBC or RBS. What they are doing is helping the big institutions to reinvent themselves,” Ingledew observes. “They are behind the scenes.”“The strength of Scotland is we have these big companies here.

which would cost jobs, businesses and livelihoods - is firmly back on the Tories’ agenda.“That makes it all the more essential that Scotland has a choice of becoming an independent country.”The Scottish Government is expected to publish legislation next week to hold a secopnd referendum but control over the constitution lies with Westminster and Mrs May had rejected calls from Ms Sturgeon for a repeat of the  vote.But Mrs May’s exit will not resolve the Commons stalemate over Brexit, Ms Sturgeon added.“It will not resolve Brexit itself,” he said.“Putting another Tory leader in Downing Street without a general election is not the solution to this crisis. “The only way to resolve Brexit is to put the issue back to the people.”But the SNP leader wished her departing Tory counterpart well for the future.“While we had many political disagreements - not least over her handling of Brexit and her disregard for Scotland and the Scottish Government - leadership is not easy, and Theresa May should be thanked for her service.”But Ms Davidson was quick to warn that any potential leadership candidate must take a strong line against a second referendum in order to win her endorsement.“Theresa May knew when she took on the job of Prime Minister that the challenges facing our country were unprecedented,” Ms Davidson said“Her time in office has been characterised by the hard work, resilience, quiet dignity and attention to detail for which she is known.“Above all, by opposing the SNP’s call for an immediate second independence referendum in , the Prime Minister demonstrated her resolute commitment to the Union, and to Scotland’s place in it.“As Britain’s second female Prime Minister, she has been a role model for girls and women across the United Kingdom, showing that there is no glass ceiling to their ambitions.“As leader of the Scottish Conservatives, I want to see candidates show that same level of commitment to Scotland’s place in the Union, an ability to advance our interests at home and abroad and, crucially, demonstrate how they intend to bring our country back together after the isions sown by two constitutional referenda.”West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine MP Andrew Bowie who served as Mrs May’s parliamentary private secretary paid tribute.“It has been the privilege of my le to serve such a dedicated, loyal, patriotic and thoroughly decent woman,” he said.“We saw again today why we have been so lucky to have her as leader of our party and country.”Labour leader Richard Leonard said Mrs May leaves the country “more ided” and has fallen short on her promise to tackle the “burning injustices” in society.“She will leave the country in chaos as a direct result of her refusal to compromise over self-imposed red lines on Brexit,” she said.Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said Mrs May faced “an impossible job” to deliver Brexit that would not damage the country. he said: “People have lost patience with the Conservatives.

Cross-border friction over demands for a repeat of the  referendum will step up a gear with the appointment of May’s successor in mid-July after a fast-track leadership contest was unveiled last week.First Minister Nicola Sturgeon is to seek a section  order, which would give Holyrood the legal authority to stage a second referendum, from the new occupant of Downing Street after the legislation for a referendum has begun its Parliamentary process at Holyrood.: Populist surge in EU polls will make prospect of Brexit deal even harder, say expertsIt is expected to be on the statute book by the end of the year. May has always ruled out a section  order and Scots Tory leader Ruth Davidson has already warned any prospective UK leader must take a strong stand on Scotland’s place in the UK and rule out a second referendum.The growing expectation is that new leader could be Johnson, the former foreign secretary, who has indicated he could be ready to pursue a no-deal Brexit, prompting fears over the impact on Scotland’s economy and population growth. SNP deputy Westminster leader Kirsty Blackman said: “The prospect of Boris Johnson as Prime Minister is utterly horrying to people across Scotland, as he panders to calls from extreme Brexiteers to deliver a deeply damaging no-deal Brexit.“With Johnson the clear favourite to take over at No , it is absolutely no surprise that more and more people believe Scotland’s future should be as an independent country in the EU.“Andhe does actually make it to Downing Street, that will simply send support for independence soaring even higher.“A no-deal Brexit simply isn’t an option – it’s time to end this Westminster impasse and put the question back to the people with the option to remain on the ballot paper.”Plans to introduce Irish-style citizens’ assemblies in Scotland will also be set out by Russell in an update to MSPs. These would adopt a more collegiate approach to issues which “sharply ide” opinion and were unveiled by Sturgeon last month as she set out plans for a Holyrood Bill to enable a second referendum. Among the issues they will look at are the work required to give Scots the detail needed to make “informed choices about the future of the country”.Former SNP deputy leader Angus Robertson insisted many Scots No voters from  were already turning to independence.He branded Johnson an “old Etonian Bullingdon club buffoon” and warned the rest of the world was “watching agog” at the prospect of him taking over as Prime Minister.“In Scotland we are now facing Boris Johnson as prime minister and hard Brexit despite not voting for either,” he wrote.“It is the clearest, most extreme example of a democratic deficit imaginable.“This cannot be as good as it gets. The UK political system is broken and failing the people badly.“Massive pennies are dropping for many people who voted No in the  independence referendum.“What was previously unimaginable for them is now absolutely necessary.” But the prospect of Johnson or another hardline Brexiteer resulting in a huge spike in support for independence was played down by polling expert Sir John Curtice from the University of Strathclyde.“What we know about Boris is that he’s capable of reaching parts that most Tory leaders can’t reach,” Curtice said.“If he can win voters in inner London, why can’t he win voters in Scotland “The more serious point is what he does as leader.“I think what would be more relevant would bea Tory leader was to pursue no-deal, and that goes pear-shaped, then that might have an impact in Scotland. “But basically, because of the state of the House of Commons, that ain’t going to happen.“Thereafter, my argument would be it depends how he performs as prime minister and what he does and all the rest of it.“In the meantime, Boris may actually be the one person who’s capable of winning some votes back and might help the Tories in Scotland.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"div","story":"A DIVE vessel with  women on board was escorted into port after she began taking in water off Shetland on Sunday. issued a mayday call in bad weather soon after midday when she was approximately eight miles east of Sumburgh Head.

They were among the first pioneers in planting English and Scots settlers in Ireland. But by , Smiths settlement failed and the lands reverted to the crown.On  May , King James I granted the Ballymena Estate to another native Irish nobleman, Ruairiacute Oacuteg MacQuillan. The estate passed through several owners, eventually passing into the possession of William Adair, a Scottish laird from Kinhilt in southwestern Scotland.The estate was temporarily renamed Kinhiltstown after Adairs lands in Scotland. The original castle of Ballymena was built in the early th century, situated to take advantage of an ancient ford at the River Braid.In  Charles I confirmed the grant of the Ballymena Estate to William Adair, giving him the right to hold a market at Ballymena on every Saturday. He hired local Irish as workers on the estate they served as tenant farmers for much of the next two centuries and more.And from those early days, Ballymena became a commercial hub for central Co. Antrim, steadily growing in prosperity through the years of the linen boom in the th century.Until recent years, the traditional market had been held at the area known as the Fair Hill on lands bordered by upper Broughshane Street, William Street and Thomas Street.When the area was sold for the development of what is now the Fair Hill Shopping Centre, the Saturday market was moved to its current venue near the Seven Towers Leisure Centre.And that is pretty much where the whole tradition kicked off nearly  years ago as the site is pretty much right in the front garden of what used to be the Adair familys residence in Ballymena!Mid and East Antrim Borough Council is urging you to come enjoy, explore and love your local market this May as part of UK wide campaign to support our local traders. ‘Love Your Local Market’ runs from - May.

Farm attacks in South Africa are reported almost on a daily basis to the rest of the world and must be condemned. There is no denying they happen, the tragic results are plain to see. But what can be done about it  How does this affect how other farmers get on with le and their daily work I’ve been fortunate enough to visit and report from South Africa on five separate occasions now over the past  years and come away each time with a sense of dismissal but also hope.South Africa is a beautul country, physically, and produces some of the best food and wine demanded by consumers around the world.Politically, it’s a dferent place. A place where the state is not in charge. A state that cannot even control its basic power supply, without some form of corruption.But where does that leave agriculture and the farmers  No matter what political persuasion anyone holds, everyone must eat. Over the years of visiting farms in South Africa I noticed farmers becoming despondent, feeling let down, feeling a sense of ‘what’s the point of it all ’I’ve talked to farmers who were attacked, who lost loved ones, and who gave up.However, during my latest visit in early March this year I witnessed a positivity among farmers that really I never experienced before.Yes, nothing politically has changed, except for the worst, but farmers are more defiant, more ambitious and are investing to make their farms more efficient in order to give them a future.During the big livestock equipment show EuroTier in Germany last November I talked to a few South African farmers interested to see how technology could make their farms more efficient. It was really comforting to visit a number of farmers on this trip who are putting new technology to play in order to improve their businesses. Visiting Greenway Farms Ltd with headquarters at Tarlton to see how business partners Vito Rugani and Vincent Sequeira handle over , tonnes of carrots per year grown on , hectares was really inspiring.The passion and ambition shown by these leading vegetable farmers has resulted in a range of Rugani juices that are now being exported across the world. They have invested heavily in new state of the art equipment to extract juice from vegetables. The science is baffling, the set-up is extremely professional and as for the juice, well…..I have to admit this was the first time I ever tried carrot juice and it was absolutely delicious. The knowledge I gained from Vito and his team will stay with me for a long time. I just hope he finds a way to export the range to the UK!Next visit was to Corne Nel’s Doornfontein Melkery in Randfontein where they milk  cows. Dairy unit manager Pieter Barnard gave me a very informative tour around the farm.Having been brought up on a dairy farm myself in Northern Ireland this visit was particularly interesting and I was also impressed to see more investment in equipment to make le easier. A new rotary parlour installed two years ago certainly speeds milking time up and perhaps investment into robotic milkers will help too with the dferent milking groups in the future. The sun can be a challenge where livestock are concerned and it was good to hear plans to build new housing in the corals to keep the cows cooler. With excellent production figures and a sound understanding of the cows, this farm is certainly gearing up for an exciting future.Before travelling across the border to visit farms in Botswana I went to see Sarel Haasbroek’s grain farm in the Carletonville area of Gauteng. Again this is another progressive farmer positive about the future and was excelling in importing the Horsch machinery brand into South Africa. Up in Francistown, eastern Botswana, I was warmly hosted by the Munger family at Wayside Brahman Stud Ltd for four nights. During my stay there I was given a comprehensive run down of the breeding herd, commercial herd, game farm, and the egg laying enterprise. What a farm! Rowland and his son Rowly are certainly well respected in the area and for the cattle they produce. Wayside was started by Rowland’s father Keith who was also present during my visit. And then it was off to see another beef farmer, this time with Bonsmara cattle, Calla Visser, for a very early start checking his cattle. Every night Calla has to go and round up over  cattle on his farm and herd them into outdoor corals for the night to protect them against theft and predators such as hyenas or leopards!And, every next morning Calla and his staff start very early going around the five dferent corals on his , hectare farm counting all the cows, calves and bulls hoping they all made it through the night alive.This, of course, is a new line of management for me but was nonetheless interesting to learn. A visit to Bobbsies Chickens Ltd based in the east at Tshesebe guided by general manager Gerhard van der Merwe was another super visit. Botswana, too, impressed me, as did the farmers there. I received detailed insight into the beef and poultry industries there and look forward to the next time I can visit.Some of the Botswanans though need to learn how to drive!

Over the years my da became sole owner of the butchers, it was always called A’town Meats,” he said.Gerald said his father was the eldest of five children and that Tom’s three brothers and late sister all emigrated to Canada, with his father opting to stay in Ireland to raise his young family.“At one stage he had opened up a butchers shop in Poleglass, inside a group of shops at the time and a shop in Ladybrook which my brother Vincent ran. Dad sold the business in September  and stayed on because it was coming up to Christmas, up to the Christmas club and what is a very busy time. After Christmas he stayed on, right up until around March, April time when he started to feel unwell. He was told it was cancer and started radiotherapy in October last year.”Gerald continued: “The Christmas period was very bad as he was very anxious waiting on results following the treatment. It wasn’t that he got the all clear, but he was told everything seemed ‘positive’. He knew by the end of January, early February something wasn’t right, the pain started coming back and he was told that ‘it’ was back.“A week or so later he was told that it was terminal.”“He was in hospital about a fortnight and we took him out to bring him home. He was only out three weeks and one day when he passed away.”Gerald spoke poignantly of how A’town Meats was known as a “meeting place, a place for people to come and talk”.“People would come in for a yarn, for many it was their way of getting out of the house and a chance for conversation.”Gerald said his father was a founding member of the Donegal Celtic Football Club and loved the GAA, especially local clubs Lamh Dhéarg and Rossa.“Last year was the best year of his le as he got closer to his kids. He was always working. His kids, his grandkids,you wanted to go see him you went to the shop. Eventhe children were being baptised, made their communions, their confirmations, you brought them to the shop. He was there six-days a week. I would have seen him on Christmas Day going into the shop and getting burgers, getting whatever was needed for restaurants who would’ve contacted him needing food. He went round, opened up and made sure they were catered for.”As well as a prominent businessman, Gerald said his father was a “bookmaker as well”.“He applied his trade at Celtic Park, Drumbo, Dundalk and Dunmore, it was a hobby as much as anything . He loved to see people winning.”He added: “One of the first times he ever done the book, a fella ended up owing him over £, and he said he would have it up to the shop that Tuesday. When the guy came up to the shop, my da was still meeting and greeting the customers, they came first, they were the be all and end all.“Dad gave the man a large meat parcel and said to him ‘take that down to the house with you’. The fella said it was the first time he had owed someone money, paid it and actually left ‘with a smile on his face’. The fella brought it down to his family and they were saying how nice the meat was and he replied: ‘Well of course it is, it cost me £,!’”Gerald said his father could pick up on when his customers were going through hardship.“He knew without them having to say anything. He would give them some food just to help them out, he never spoke of it, it was the people who would come in and tell you how he had helped.“A wee woman came into the shop one Christmas and she couldn’t afford the turkey so she said she was just going to take a ‘wee chicken this year’ and offered a ring as a means of payment. He wouldn’t hear of it but the wee woman insisted on giving over the ring. The wee woman passed away and her daughters came into the shop months later and he said he had something belonging to them and brought out the ring.“He was a very private man and religious in his own ways. He would’ve walked from his house in Donegall Park to Clonard, walked down for the Rosary and to St Paul’s as well. He always kept himself fit, he did Slimming World in his ’s and went out of his way to get the accreditation to sell the Slimming World endorsed food in the shop. He had people coming from all over to buy it.“He was always reading and went back to get his Degree in History. He loved the horses, he was always saying I would ‘scud’ his bets, that I was the worst ‘picker in the world’.“At the end of the day he was a very hard working, very generous, honest man. All his le he would’ve said ‘I’m doing this for you, I’m doing this for you’, in terms of working so hard at the business. He loved his family.”Gerald’s daughter and Tom’s granddaughter, Charleen Straney, described her “granda” as “a much loved man and very highly thought of by everyone who got to know him.”Tom Straney’s Requiem Mass will take place todayin St Agnes’ Church at noon."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"finucane new lord mayor of belfast","story":"JOHN Finucane said his father was in his thoughts as he was officially made the new Lord Mayor of Belfast last night.The Sinn Féin councillor, a new face on Belfast City Council, was nominated by the party for the position of the city’s first citizen.John’s father, prominent Belfast solicitor Pat Finucane was shot dead in  by a state-controlled loyalist gang in front of his family.Speaking in the Chamber at the council’s AGM on Tuesday evening, John said: “Tonight is a special night for them and, of course, for me.“And of course never far from my thoughts, more so on a night like tonight, is my father Pat. “I know my dad would be proud tonight as my entire family are, as am I, of the position being elected Mayor of Belfast places me in.”John added that his focus for the year ahead will be on ersity and inclusiveness.“As Mayor, I want to bring a message of ersity and inclusiveness to the year ahead.“I have been brought up and lived my le in an inclusive, welcoming environment where dference and ersity are embraced and celebrated, and I am proud of that.“I am the product of a mixed marriage, of a Catholic father from West Belfast, and a Protestant mother from East Belfast. “I have relatives who are unionist and I have relatives who are republican. “My upbringing has shown me that everyone deserves to be, and must be, treated equally.“I want a strong, vibrant Belfast in which political persuasion, sexuality, religious choice or skin colour make no dference as to how a citizen is treated. “I want a Belfast where we champion the rights of the most vulnerable in our society and do so proudly, without fear, without favour.“I will never accept that undeniable rights are merely privileges, to be given and taken from those in need by those in power. “It is my intention as Mayor to convene a special conference to celebrate the vibrancy and ersity in this city and to show how that fantastic ersity can enrich our city and the lives of all our citizens.“As Mayor I will reach out the hand of friendship and do my best to help build a future we can all be proud of.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"rio is on the ball on the springfield road","story":"FORMER Manchester United and England footballer Rio Ferdinand was in West Belfast on Tuesday to officially open the new office of one of the UK’s top football agencies at the Innovation Factory on the Springfield Road.Rio is an ambassador for New Era Global Sports Management, which is the first big name football agency to open an office in the North –their first office outside of London.New Era Global Sports believes in a holistic approach, supporting players throughout their careers and into retirement and Rio is hopeful the agency can make an impact here.“There has been so many good Irish players – Roy Keane, Robbie Keane, Jonny and Corry Evans, John O’Shea, Craig Cathcart, I could go on,” said Rio.“There are loads here and there will be more coming through.“It is about nurturing and creating the pathway for these players. The amount of lads leaving here for England but ing a year later is far too high. It is not about their football ability but due to a lack of support network for them.“There is that fear factor of moving away and we want to help them stay on the ladder.“It is an important moment for New Era. There is so much talent in Ireland and now we have a place to facilitate them.”The Innovation Factory office will be run by former professional footballer, Lee Mudd, who says the agency was drawn by the vast untapped potential talent throughout the island of Ireland.“There are a lot of talented young players here and having an office in Belfast will provide them with the opportunity to make it on a bigger stage. We currently have  players on our books from Ireland and Northern Ireland and I would expect this to grow considerably in a short time as there is so much potential here.“We recognise that it is an enormous challenge for a young person to leave this country and go to live in England. It is important to provide them with a support network. It can be a tough, ruthless environment and they need a caring team behind them to look after them, not just now but throughout their careers.”Lee points to the example of New Era Ambassador, Rio Ferdinand who has seen many highs and lows during his career and is now a successful businessman, media pundit and mentor to many young professionals.“Rio has been with New Era since the start and is the perfect example of how the company has helped him on his journey and shown him that there is a le after playing football. We want young players here to have access to all that experience.“We are in a growth phase and the Innovation Factory gives us the chance to build our business and increase capacity as needed. We also liked the networking opportunities with other businesses that have ambitious plans it offers us the chance to feed off this energy and new ideas”Shane Smith, Innovation Factory’s Community Engagement Officer added:“We are very excited to welcome such a prestigious sports agency to Northern Ireland.“New Era Sports has recognised the facilities and support we have to offer and we look forward to helping them expand their activities in Northern Ireland.”"},{"url":null,"title":"belfast telegraph named uk regional newspaper of year","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsEU Elections Top  CompaniesNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The parties are currently engaged in talks attempting to restore devolved government with civil servants responsible for running the country.Asked about her message to the local politicians, Baroness Paisley said they needed to \"lay aside their baggage and face facts\".\"So many petty things, they dont see the big picture,\" she said.\"So many people are crying out for help and they are failing them by not taking responsibility.\"It is going to get worse and that leaves us open to all sorts of trouble.\"She added: \"I would say to them cut out the petty things and dwell on things that matter - think of the people.She said she was \"aggrieved\" the  MLAs were still taking a salary and it was not fair on civil servants to be doing the job of elected representatives.\"It is abominable for people to take money for nothing,\" she added, \"they are not doing the job they were elected to do.\"Baroness Paisley also said the parties needed to be more open with the public, adding: \"There is nothing in the open, what goes on is hidden.\"We are all sinners no matter who we are or what we are.She was asked about the DUP fielding its first openly gay candidate, Alison Benningtion and the subsequent resignations from the party after her successful election, including her late husbands brother in law and how some have said the late Ian Paisley would be \"turning in his grave\".\"We are all sinners no matter who we are or what we are.. that girl may not know Christ died for her,\" she said.\"I do not hate Ms Bennington, I dont know the girl. I dont hate anybody no matter who they are or what they have done against me.\"But we have to love Christ first and what He says we have to obey his word. These things are written for our benefit.\"Baroness Paisley said she hoped the party was not making a move away from the ethos her husband established the party under.\"It was a decision taken at the time and I think it was taken as a defiance to see what would happen.\"And I think it should be put to the whole party and a proper decision made on what should be done.\"Turning to Brexit and Arlene Fosters comments on leaving the countrya united Ireland came about, Eileen Paisley said it would take an \"awful lot\" for her to move saying so long as their was freedom of religion she would remain.\"I would not like a dictatorship or someone whatever their religion was to be persecuted because of that.\"It is a big question. If we go right back to the beginning, the iding of Ireland. The people or Ireland, north, south, east and west, I think are a great people.\"No matter what part of Ireland a person is from.. they are a fellow country man or woman.\"I just wonder why it had to be ided at that time and I think that was the wrong ision. It is too big an issue for me to ponticate on.\" I dont want my mind and soul to be poisoned with an unforgiving spirit.Baroness Paisley said she missed her late husband more, and more every day and she was told many times by others across the political ide and the communities his leadership was missed.She recalled how her husband wanted to be a farmer when he was a young boy and it was when sowing corn he heard the call from God that it was not he seed He wanted Ian to sow.She said in his first sermon in Sixmilecross in Co Tyrone he spoke for only  minutes before running out of material and immediately vowed to never speak again.\"And the man that was taking him told him youll speak all right, and so his words were fulfilled,\" she said.In his final years the Free Presbyterian Church ostracised its founder. Baroness Bannside said it was \"very callous\" but pointed to Jesus and how despite all he had done for his people, was crucied.Baroness Bannside said she no longer worships at the Free Presbyterian Church as it would \"leave her open\" instead going to her granddaughters husbands baptist church.\"I just put it away, I dont bother...

The fatal flaws still remain. The backstop is still there meaning Northern Ireland could be cut off from its main market in Great Britain by a new regulatory border. \"Unless there are treaty level changes, Brussels would always have the whip hand.\"Mrs May yesterday set out a -point compromise package in her final attempt to secure approval for her deal, which has already been rejected in Parliament three times.She is to offer MPs a vote on whether to hold a second Brexit referendum in a last-ditch effort to secure support in the House of Commons.Her new Brexit deal, which was agreed by Cabinet only after a stormy two-hour session, will be brought to Parliament in the first week of next month.As well as a vote on a second referendum, MPs will be offered a choice over the UKs future customs arrangements with the European Union.TUV leader Jim Allister rounded on the Prime Minister for opening the door to a second referendum.

The fact remains there should never have been a backstop in the first place and it was poor negotiations that resulted in its inclusion.\" Alliance leader Naomi Long said: \"Those saying the case for another vote was delusional have been proven wrong. We have not left the EU yet - the decision can be reversed and Brexit stopped.\"Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he would consider the Prime Ministers plan, but warned: \"We wont back a repackaged version of the same old deal, and its clear that this weak and disintegrating Government is unable deliver on its own commitments.\"Mrs Mays proposals were immediately rejected by Tory Brexiteers.

Hotels currently have a wage content of around % of turnover.\"The sector has a iety of roles from entry level at the appropriate national minimum wage level of the candidate through to supervisory, management and executive roles.\"The Federation has not seen the evidence that the LPC received last week and therefore is not in a position to answer the specics.

Some say while those carrying out the work are obliging, they are not responsible the delay or the lack of communication.Businesses are also hoping that customers they have not seen for some time willwhen Irish Street s to a sense of normality.They say the loss of parking spaces has impacted on trade with the work forcing people not to use one of the townrsquos main car parks nearby.During last weekrsquos protest, one trader revealed that her business has been forced to go mobile, visiting the homes of elderly people who cannot safely access her premises in the town centre due to the public realm scheme.Restaurant owner Mizba Uddin says things have been ldquoterrible for his business since work on the project began.ldquoThe business has literally collapsed, he declared, standing outside his restaurant surrounded by barriers used by contractors.ldquoThe situation is very, very bad and we have even have people driving down the one-way system the wrong way. Parking spaces have been lost as a result of the work and not all will be ed when the scheme is completed. People are going where as we do not provide a delivery service.Mizba said one of his main concerns has been the lack of communication from those overseeing the project. He also urged those in charge of the scheme to talk to traders to let them know what is going on.He added: ldquoI was told that the scheme would end in March and have heard nothing since. I am relying on other people to tell me what is going on but it should not be like this. I cannot even clean my windows because there is so much dust everywhere.ldquoSummer time can be quiet for me. Everyone in Irish Street wants this project completed as quickly as possible. As the work continues, there are simply no customers going to any of the shops. The work is killing businesses..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballygalget woman’s two week walk meeting inspirational people  ","story":"A BALLYGALGET woman is one of two volunteers who are spending a fortnight walking in towns and villages around Northern Ireland meeting inspirational people who are improving their communities.Patricia Fleming, a former camogie player with Ballygalget John Mitchelrsquos GAC, called into her old club last Sunday accompanied by Rory Mullan from Derry.They were hand-picked from a raft of candidates to be Big Lunch walkers for this year.Starting last Friday, they are visiting dferent places in Northern Ireland ahead of the Big Lunch weekend on June -.The Big Lunch event is where over six million people through the UK will meet to share food and eat together.Patricia and Rory visited Ballygalget to hear about all the great work the club does in the surrounding area.Patricia, who now lives in Belfast with her family, told the club how its community work was inspiring.ldquoThe reason I picked Ballygalget is that Irsquom from here, Irsquove played on that pitch many times, but I also know the community spirit that exists within Ballygalget. It blows me away when I come home and hear all the things that are happening.ldquoWhen I went for my interview after applying to be one of the Big Lunch walkers, I said thatI was chosen I would like to bring the Big Lunch community walk into rural areas and to Ballygalget.ldquoPeople here are very community oriented. That is not the case everywhere. A lot of people donrsquot feel able to knock on their neighboursrsquo doors.The club hosted a Big Breakfast fundraiser on Sunday towards sending the clubrsquos U- boys and girls to next monthrsquos Feile in Cork.However, the club is also trying to gather support for a huge number of projects, including cross-community work and is also going to host its own event over the Big Lunch weekend.A new cross-community gym opened in the club grounds a year ago, which has proven immensely popular with all sorts of people in the local area, including many who had no links with the GAC.The new building also has space for social workshops and some of the wider community schemes the club wants to pursue.Last year, Ballygalget won an Alzheimerrsquos Society Diversity Award for its work in the community.Club member Roisin Coulter said: ldquoWe are working to become a dementia-friendly community. The idea is to educate people about dementia: what are the signs and symptoms, and how to support someone living with the condition.ldquoEvery month we run a free two-hour workshop, with materials supplied by the Alzheimerrsquos Society.ldquoOur club is very much affected by dementia.

Among the stories he told were e the events of May , , when his antics in a penalty shoot out against Roma helped Liverpool to win the European Cup.He also talked about his career after Liverpool and working with Alan Ball at Southampton at the height of the match fixing allegations that were made against him.When Ball was asked by the media why he was playing Grobbelaar in goal ahead of England international Dave Beasant, Ball reputedly said: ldquoI would rather have Bruce in goal trying to throw the game than Dave doing his best to save it.By common consensus, Bruce was one of the best speakers the club has had and has whetted the appetite for the future to renew the clubrsquos tradition of bringing over guest speakers.Bruce was presented with a small gt from the club by youth team coach Simon Thornton, a set of golf balls and towel from the Royal County Down Golf Club.Club secretary Andy Hall then spoke for a few minutes to highlight some of the highs and lows of the last  years and to thank IFA regional development officer Seamus Heath for all the work he does in promoting football across the Newry Mourne and Down Council area.Andy then invited IFA vice-chairman Jack Grundie to say a few words with Jack presenting the club with a gt to mark the occasion.County Antrim FA president Jim Jess also spoke warmly about the club and presented a memento to mark the occasion with Maurice Johnston, vice chair of the Mid Ulster Football League, congratulating the club on their th anniversary and presenting Tollymore chairman John McIlvenny with a gt to recognise the achievement.Newcastle League secretary Alan Craig was unfortunately taken ill before the dinner and was unable to attend and the club sends its warm wishes to him for a speedy recovery.The final official speaker was Elaine Junk, the former chair of the NI Womenrsquos Football Association during the period when Tollymore had a successful ladiesrsquo side.Elaine congratulated the club on its th anniversary and encouraged them to get a ladiesrsquo team back up and playing.With the official proceedings drawing to a close there was one last surprise with Adrian Howard presenting a le time achievement award on behalf of players and members to Andy Hall in recognition of all his work for the club.It was a wonderful gesture by the club and much appreciated by Andy.The evening concluded with dancing to the wonderful Fth Avenue with Bruce continuing to sign autographs and pose for pictures into the wee small hours..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Locals flying high in F15 championship  ","story":"ROGER Chamberlain and Charlie Horder won the Northern Ireland Flying Fteen Championship on Strangford Lough at the weekend.It was a deserved triumph for the Whiterock duo and also for Strangford Sailing Club, which hosted the event less than a month after the re-opening of its clubhouse which was gutted by an accidental fire in September .The five-race championship attracted a -strong fleet, which included a sizeable contingent of southern visitors, mainly from Dun Laoghaire.After three races on Saturday Chamberlain and Horder were in third place, behind Killyleagh pair Andrew McCleery and Colin Dougan mdash who got off to a flyer by winning the opening race mdash and overnight leaders Brian McKee and John Gibson, also from Whiterock, who were second and seventh in the first two races before winning the final race of the day.Chamberlain and Horder came out of the blocks early on Sunday and comfortably won the fourth race before sealing the championship with fth place in the final race.McKee and Gibson were a disappointing th in the fourth race, but with the discard brought into play, they still had a chance of outright victory.

retired officersrsquo case that Dr Maguire had exceeded his legal remit.Mr White and Mr Hawthorne are now now appealing that ruling.The former policemenrsquos barrister, David McMillen QC, stressed their complete support for the Ombudsmanrsquos role in scrutinising and holding officers to account.He argued, however, that the watchdog lacked the legislative authority to publish such ldquoconclusive findings in the Loughinisland report.ldquoHe simply does not have that power, Mr McMillen said.ldquoThis is an organ of the state, an important and very public organ of the state finding police officers guilty.Askedhe believed the Ombudsmanrsquos report had concluded police officers may have committed criminal offences, Mr McQuillen replied: ldquoIt was replete with those suggestions.But Mr McMillen rejected suggestions that the document could be amended to state there ldquomay be evidence of criminal or disciplinary offences.ldquoThe report is so infected with conclusive language all the way through, about what he found, that a simple rider would not make sense, he said.Barra McGrory QC, for the Ombudsman, countered that the legislation allowed him to express an opinion on the alleged collusion.He said: ldquoThe definition the Ombudsman has set out on collusion is broad enough to encompass behaviour and actions by police officers which cannot be identied as specic criminal offences which could be referredunder that part of the scheme.Following submissions Lord Chief Justice Sir Declan Morgan, sitting with Lord Justices Stephens and Deeny,

households  ","story":"A PROVINCE-WIDE recycling survey carried out last month has claimed that one third of householders in the Newry, Mourne and Down Council area were unhappy with how the local authority had asked them to recycle.The survey mdash carried out by polling and market research organisation Lucid Talk mdash revealed that only % of those surveyed would recycle when it was convenient for them.The survey revealed that of those who said they would recycle only when it was convenient, % indicated that they would be encouraged to recycle morethere was one bin that took all recycling, including glass mdash a service that until last month was unavailable in the former Down Council area.In addition, the survey showed that where the council area could lsquocomminglersquo glass in the same bin with the rest of their household recyclables mdash plastic, paper, card, tins and cardboard etc mdash householders were on average % happy with their glass collection method, compared to % of those in council areas that did not.Re-Gen Waste Ltd managing director, Joseph Doherty, said the survey results indicated that prioritising simplicity and convenience was the best approach to ensuring a high level of household recycling.He continued: ldquoSince April , glass can now be commingled with household recycling waste in the Down legacy council area, meaning that all householders across Newry, Mourne and Down can now put their glass into their blue bins.ldquoWe should see an marked improvement in recycling figures and a decrease in the percentage of glass placed in black bins across the entire council area.Mr Doherty said local authorities need to encourage the maximum number of people to recycle the maximum volume of materials, weighed against the cost of processing the material, and the potential financial benefits from reducing landfill costs, and selling on recyclable material.ldquoThe councils we with work in Northern Ireland, England and Scotland tell us that household friendly schemes such as commingling recyclables, plastic, paper, card, tins and cardboard and glass in one bin, are much preferable to residents than any pre-sort scheme using smaller containers or bins and that it is actively improving their recycling rates, he said.Last March, of the households in the Newry, Mourne and Down area that could commingle their glass with their recyclables in the same bin, % of respondents said they would recycle lessthey had to separate their household waste, including glass waste into separate caddies.Mr Doherty added: ldquoMore and more local authorities are seeing the benefits and cost savings achieved by switching to commingling collection services, alongside an ultra-modern Materials Recycling Facilitylike ours that receives, separates and prepares recyclables for productive use where.The Lucid Talk survey was carried out across all of Northern Irelandrsquos  district council

Kielty has called for an end to the segregation of education along religious lines in Northern Ireland.He believes that someone like Good Friday Agreement peace talks chairman George Mitchell could be the man tasked with the job of overhauling the countryrsquos ldquoided schools.At an Ulster University event in Belfast last week focusing on sectarianism, the Dundrum man said the segregated education issue needed to be addressed.He also criticised what he described as the ldquocasual sectarianism and ldquotribalism which characterises parts of society.He continued: ldquoI think we really have to address education, segregated education and I think that as a society we kind of have to start calling out that casual sectarianism.ldquoWhenever we had peace here we thoughtwe move on to a Glaswegian level of sectarianism that is fine, so we only hate each other every week when we go to football. That is not good enough. The tribalism of that is not good enough.The comedian also suggested that the integrated education term was ldquoinsulting.He explained: ldquoAround the rest of the world that is called education. What we have in this country is segregated education.The Dundrum man also paid tribute to the ldquobrilliant work of teachers but said people felt those high standards were enough and did not tackle the underlying ision.ldquoThe natural  of mixing and realising that we are exactly the same and having a school that has got a rugby team and a GAA team, you donrsquot have to go to that schoolyou like GAA. There are just certain things that we really need to have a look at and I am not sure that we are necessarily ready for it.Speaking at the Belfast event, Mr Kielty argued that changing the education system would have to be done by an international figure like former US senator George Mitchell.ldquoOnce we actually get through it we will go, lsquogee why didnrsquot we do that before now rsquo, but it is a dficult one, he conceded, suggesting that social media is contributing to the lack of exposure to dferent views.ldquoYour own opinion is folded back into yourself on the screen every day, he said. ldquoMore than ever, we actually have to put the screen down and make an effort to realise that we are the same.ldquoWe talk too much about dference here. You are either a British person living on the island of Ireland or you are an Irish person who is currently actually in the UK. You are actually a bit of both.Mr Kielty added: ldquoThe minute that we accept that that is going to move in a fluid way, and it is perfectly fine to be a bit of both, that is kind of where we need to be.Meanwhile, the charity which has been working for almost three decades to bridge the gap between starting integrated schools and securing full government support has welcomed Ulster University proposals for a concerted effort in Northern Ireland to eradicate sectarianism.The university, supported by the Sir George Quigley Fund, launched lsquoSectarianism in Northern Ireland: a Reviewrsquo at a conference at the UUrsquos Belfast campus last week.The Integrated Education Fundmdash which was established in  mdash praised the conference for addressing the issue and welcomed Patrick Kieltyrsquos comments that educating all children together is the way forward for a shared future.The review contains more than  proposals for how bodies including government, business, education, youth services, arts and sport could work collectively over a sustained period of time to foster greater collaboration and understanding across communities.As well suggesting that a government department should be established specically to tackle sectarianism, the researchers propose establishing a new civic body to help shape community efforts toward reconciliation.IEF chief executive Tina Merron said the organisation ldquoshares the vision, held by the overwhelming majority of citizens, of a united community and a shared future.Ms Merron said that at the signing of the Good Friday Agreement there were , pupils in  integrated schools, compared with more than , attending  integrated schools today.She said that with no government plan for integrated education, the growth was down to ldquodetermined campaigners and pioneering parents.She added: ldquoWe see a reformed education system as an essential ingredient of this future an education system which brings children, staff and governors from Catholic and Protestant traditions, as well as those of other faiths or none and of other cultures, together in schools, an education system which recognises and respects ersity and ensures that all young people feel confident and welcome in their school environment..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Sinn Fein’s Casey chosen as district’s first citizen  ","story":"SINN Feinrsquos Charlie Casey is Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos new chairman.The Newry politicianrsquos appointment was confirmed at the local authorityrsquos annual meeting on Monday night when he succeeded the SDLPrsquos Mark Murnin as the districtrsquos first citizen.The new council vice-chairman is Rowallane SDLP councillor Terry Andrews, who succeeded Sinn Feinrsquos Oksana McMahon, who represented the Crotlieve area but lost her seat in the recent local government election.The new chairman was presented with his chain of office by his predecessor, who also losthis Slieve Croob seat at the recent election.The new first citizen said he was delighted to be nominated for the position by his party and hoped to do the position justice, urging all councillors to unite to protect services under the threat in the council area, particularly those in relation to the health and welfare of all, in particular, the most vulnerable.Cllr Casey also took time to thank Mr Murnin and Mrs McMahon for their work over the past year and the other councillors who were not ing to the council following the election.Addressing members as chairman for the first time, Cllr Casey urged them to fight for lesaving and le-changing services, champion the cause of equality and take forward the councilrsquos commitment of putting the organisation at the heart of everything it does.ldquoNewry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos mission is to lead and serve the district as a prosperous and healthy area and ensure it is sustainable from an economic, environmental and social perspective.

Some Barbadoes gentlemen, then at Martinique, coming off to wait on Capt. Reddish, the French man of war’s boat, that was rowing from the shore to the ship, took the Barbadians and carried them on board the French man of war whereupon Capt. Reddish sent his lieutenant to demand instant satisfaction for the insults done to the king of Great Britain’s subjects, even under the nose of one of his ships of war. On this the French Captain disown’d any orders of his to the officer in the boat, reprimanded him for meddling with the gentlemen, and made him ask for their pardon and thus the whole matter ended, intirely to the honour of our Captain, and to the satisfaction of us all who wish to hear the ancient English language spoke on board our ships.SAXONY.Dresden, May , N.S.The king of Poland has ever since histo this capital, been confined to his room by a slight intermitting fever, occasioned by a cold, and attended with pain and a little inflamation in one leg.Gibraltar, April , .From on board his Majesty’s Ship the Somerset.Upon our arrival here from Port-Mahon, general Sabine sent a message to Admiral Hadddock, to acquaint him, that a Spanish frigate had taken out a vessel belonging to Gibraltar several Moors upon which Admiral Haddock wrote to the Spanish admiral at Carthagena, and sent lord Augustus Fitzroy, to demand satisfaction, which was immediately given, the Moors with their effects were deliver’d up, and a most obliging answer sent to our admiral.LONDON, May . It was yesterday currently reported, that the Fleet of ten French men of war, was ready to sail from Brest to the Baltick we are likewise inform’d that a squadron of fteen British men of war will be sent by way of observation to those seas.Terry Bradley: A portrait of the artist Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"It’s talked about town that the king of Spain has absolutely refused the ,l. stipulated by the Convention, and to give up his pretended right of searching our ships, ‘till we have delivered up Georgia and Gibraltar into their hands.

He shook my hand, and showed me some of the facilities.I was shown how the ldquoMagic Carpet works, an interactive board on the floor. It lit up with a flower pattern, that moved and shimmered when stood on.I was then invited to the soft play room, where Elias flung himself over the equipment, scampering above me and the assistant. He grinned for the camera.Ysgol Y Deri particularly shines in the creative approaches it takes to putting its students first.In the big school I was shown to ldquoThe Holodeck, a Star-Trek-esque room filled with projectors and touchscreen sensitive walls.There was a French quiz projected across the walls, and the students jumped around the room selecting the correct words.The sensory experience was not only impressively creative, but vital to some studentsrsquo learning.The school has many similar rooms built to offer a multi-disciplinary team approach to the youngsters and offer a fully holistic experience.They have a large team of therapists on site, including nurses, occupational therapists, speech and language therapists, physiotherapists, music therapists and play therapists.They also offer a huge range of interventions, designed to put their pupilsrsquo happiness and education at the forefront.They offer yoga, mindfulness lessons, climbing, gardening, wood work, pet therapy, rebound therapy and hydrotherapy, as just a small example. Timetables are crafted to suit inidualsrsquo needs, as some pupils respond better than others to certain lessons.I was shown to a classroom where a group of seven students worked on their laptops.These students were proud of their work and excited to talk about maths.We were then ushered through as a group for a photo with next doorrsquos class, a group with physical disabilities.The students waited patiently as overhead cranes helped those who could not walk into position.Everyone smiled. Thumbs and peace signs were flashed.Afterwards, a Learning Support Assistant tapped me on the shoulder and reminded me to take a photo of Caitlyn.I pointed the camera at her, and Caitlinrsquos smile immediately reached her ears.Maxine, a fellow student, told me how proud her family were of her and her work.The happiness of every one of the pupils is palpable, filling every area of the school, as does the pride of the teachers.ldquoWe have our pupils come back in every now and then, said Stacey Long, the schoolrsquos transition officer.She helps pupils move on from the school and into adult le.ldquoThey always tell me how much the school meant to them, how helpful it was in getting a job.ldquoWe try hard to get pupils ready for adult le where we can.ldquoWe have a coffee shop on campus where several students get plenty of work experience.The curriculum covers both the national curriculum as well as general le skills.One interactive quiz I was shown could be rapidly switched from a lesson on the Great Fire of London, to a quiz on which materials go in which recycle bin.There are plenty of extra-curricular activities on offer too, including choir and youth club and regular trips outside of school.I was given a glimpse into a gym, along with a music recording room with plenty of recording equipment, and the school radio room.Outside, pupils are given a huge playground with an outdoor classroom, space to play sport, a climbing wall and little walled off sections for each of the primary classes.Developer Barratt Homes was also on the site, building a sensory garden for students to enjoy.Last week a group of pupils of ying abilities went on a trip to Paris, where they were involved with ious Comenius [European Union education] projects and forged links with numerous schools in other European countries.

I wanted to pay them a fuller narrative.No major publishers have picked up the books yet. ldquoI was disheartened early on in the process. One publisher advertised themselves as being very inclusive.ldquoI reached out to them but was disappointed by their feedback ndash all they said was a childrenrsquos book is  pages long. It felt like you can only be a BME authoryou conform to these standards. Really,yoursquore trying to promote ersity in publishing you should look outside the box!The books use the personal experiences of the boys as inspiration. ldquoTwo years ago we travelled around Europe. We found a caravan and went exploring, and the books have been inspired by our adventures ndash the first being Charlie the Fearless and Tancho the Brave.ldquoTheyrsquore all about courage, and being brave enough to admit when something scares you. They focus on looking out for one other, and how love makes you brave.ldquoA Place to Call Home deals with the anxiety of moving, and the unknown, as we travelled and settled in Penarth.ldquoTheyrsquore about making the best of situations ndash there are little anecdotes in every story, like the time we broke down in north France.

Unfortunately the swing bridge has been out of commission since June .I have met with residents and local Labour councillors, who have been working closely with residents to discuss their concerns and plans to make the bridge once more available to the public.The bridge is owned by the Vale of Glamorgan Council and leased to Penarth Quays MarinaLTD. It was built to ensure that both residents and boat owners had equal access to land and water.I understand that there are no mechanical reasons why the bridge should not be used.The Vale Council and PQM have agreed that safety upgrades need to be carried out for the bridge to reopen. In October  PQM submitted a planning application for modications to the swing bridge. I have been told that PQM were contacted by the Vale council to mody the current application to include lower intensity flashing lights and lsquosilent alarmsrsquo. Unfortunately PQM felt that the changes would not meet the safety standards they felt necessary and choose to withdraw the application. I understand that the Vale Council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report which will feature in future discussions between the Vale and PQM over the future of the swing bridge.The swing bridge has been an integral part of marina le for many years and is enjoyed by both residents and the thousands of tourists to the area. Connecting the two sides of the marina the bridge acts as a short cut for residents, particularly useful for those with walking dficulties. Having spoken to local businesses about the potential for the reopening the consensus seems to be generally positive. Reopening of the swing bridge, customers could use the car park on Llwyn Passat and use the bridge to access Portway businesses.I hope that the Vale council and PQM are able to work together to find a solution. I think we can all agree that the way forward is to ensure safe operation of the bridge while minimising disruption to adjacent properties.Before the Easter recess I met with residents to listen to their concerns over plans to remove Victorian lampposts from across Penarth. The cast iron lampposts, which have been an integral part of Penarthrsquos street scene for a century are being replaced by the Vale council with modern LED lighting. I am disappointed that several lampposts along Cwrt-Y-Vil road have been removed without notying residents.Residents have set up a petition, of which over a thousand people so far have signed asking for the old posts to be left in place with new ones installed beside them.

I was glad to help get their and other constituentsrsquo voices heard on this in Parliament, because itrsquos not being debated enough - itrsquos getting lost behind other things.So whether itrsquos local action we can take on recycling and packaging, or global action on climate change and carbon emissions, we all need to do more to deal with an emergency thatrsquos going to affect us all for generations to come.I was out and about again in Penarth this weekend, along with a team of our fantastic Labour town and Vale councillors, talking to people about the forthcoming European elections. There was a lot of support for our clear Welsh Labour position backing a final say in a peoplersquos vote for the public on any Brexit deal.Following the mixed results in the local elections in England and Northern Ireland last week, there was much talk about Labour lsquobailing outrsquo the government. Let me be crystal clear on this ndash I will never lsquobail outrsquo the disastrous Tories on Brexit, and neither will the overwhelming majority of Labour MPs.We can resolve the situation, but not by any backroom stitch-up that would risk letting down both those who voted Leave and Remain. The only way forward out of this mess is to let the people have the final say on any deal. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

And under my leadership, a Conservative administration will proudly put the people of the Vale of Glamorgan first.ldquoNaturally, we are open to working with other councillors who share those ideals.ldquoOthers - including those who resigned from the Conservative party - will have to explain to voters where they stand on these issues - and I would urge them to back us, rather than propping up a Labour administration that was rejected by the Vale at the last election.Cllr Bailey said he had a six-point plan for the Vale.He pledged to deliver the Dinas Powys bypass stop inflation-busting council tax rises scrap proposed parking charges review the local development planto curb inappropriate development protect rural schools and oppose the Barry Biomass plant.Cllr Bailey said that he was also keen to improve engagement with the public, after a series of hugely unpopular decisions taken by the existing cabinet.He said: ldquoDuring the elections in , we promised to build a stronger relationship with local residents by consulting them on key decisions.ldquoUnfortunately, too many people feel that their views are simply being ignored and that Vale consultations are just tick box exercises. Take the proposals around car parking charges, or the closure of Llancarfan School. I donrsquot think anyone outside of the Civic Offices believes that those decisions werenrsquot already done deals, and thatrsquos simply unacceptable.ldquoAnother good example is the councilrsquos failure to listen to the public over Penarthrsquos original Victorian lamp posts.ldquoIrsquove been criticised for wanting to listen to the people who elected me, and I make no apologies for that. Under my leadership, thatrsquos exactly what would happen and whilst I do accept that there are dficult decisions to be taken, we have to take the public with us - not ignore their legitimate concerns. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential. To excel.Mr Brown agreed. ldquoOur amazing staff believe in every young personrsquos potential to succeed and really do go the lsquoextra milersquo for pupils, he said. ldquoOur pupils flourish academically but also as well rounded, confident young people ready to contribute to society.The extra-curricular provision at the school is broad and this really helps to develop our students confidence and skills beyond the classroom setting.That extra-curricular provision is a key focus for the school.Lessons finish at .pm, earlier in the day than most other schools, but that affords pupils plenty of time to take on other pursuits.The school offers a huge number of activities, ranging from the expected - rugby, football, hockey, theatre and orchestra - to the esoteric, like German Film Club or Cipher Club.School trips in recent years have taken students to such exotic destinations as Costa Rica, Iceland, Borneo, Morocco, Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, allowing students to soak in culture both at home and abroad.Clearly, a huge pupil base allows for a huge number of options.The schoolrsquos ability to bring such a population to the table, and keep them focussed, has produced excellent results.In the last fty years alone, it has produced Olympians, rugby internationals, Members of Parliament and television presenters.It has ties to Nasa, and men who walked on the moon have visited the school for talks.Its most curious claim to fame comes in the form of a mascot painted on a wall.Emma Davies, a former pupil of the school, had a design chosen as the official Welsh Wenlock ndash the Olympic mascot for the London  games.But Stanwell flourishes academically, as well.In its  GCSE results,  per cent of Stanwell pupils achieved at least their expected grades, compared to  per cent of the rest of Wales. The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work.

An estimated  million people were eligible to vote in what was considered the most important European Parliament election in decades. Full results are expected overnight.The balloting, which began on Thursday, pitted supporters of closer unity against those who consider the EU a bureaucratic presence and want topower to national governments and sharply restrict immigration.Italyrsquos Interior Minister Matteo Salvini, a major figure among the anti-migrant hard-line nationalists, said that he felt a ldquochange in the air and that a victory by his right-wing League party would ldquochange everything in Europe.Mainstream centre-right and centre-left parties were widely expected to hold on to power in the -seat legislature that sits in both Brussels and Strasbourg.

There is a piece of disused waste groundwe have had it signed over to us. Tullygally PS pupils in a game of Tug of War at Lurgans Centrepoint“Pat will come over and he will introduce his Train B Smart and we can work out of his Hub.“Early intervention is key to get those children knowing the mental and physical well-being is the way forward. That will also have a bigger influence then on the parents and the wider community.”Ms Andrews is mindful that the school pitch is currently unused because of the anti-social behaviour. She is keen that this project moves forward for the sake of the children and the community.“But without the funding, we can’t move forward. The EA has already signed over the pitch and council are working hard to give us the waste ground behind it but without a working Assembly, I am afraid this will be a missed opportunity.Tullygally PS pupils in a game of Tug of War at Lurgans Centrepoint“We need £, to make this project work and start building the Train B Smart Hub at Tullygally Primary School,” she said.But the Hub won’t be just for Tullygally PS, as Pat explains: “The whole idea with Train B Smart is for the local and wider community to be able to participate in multi-sports. That’s the key aim. We know not everybody is going to be an elite athlete, that’s not the point. The point is that everybody can get enjoyment out of it. This is why the children are here. We want them to enjoy sport.”And Pat has the backing of some big names from his former manager Alex Ferguson and team mates Roy Keane and Roy Carroll.Police probe arson attack and suspected gas leak in Craigavon Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Former Manchester United goalkeeper and Wigan Athletic player, Roy Carroll popped into Centrepoint in Lurgan on Thursday to help train some of the pupils.And he was very impressed, spotting potential stars of the future.Former Northern Ireland player Roy is fully behind Pat’s bid for a Train B Smart Hub in Craigavon.He said: “Pat and I used to play football together at Wigan Athletic. I came home about three years ago and Pat asked me to come up and help out and it is always a pleasure to come and work with him again.“I just came here today to give the kids a bit of training. It is great what they are doing.“Sports takes a lot of pressure of kids and that’s what its all about. It takes a lot of pressure of adults as well when they go out on the pitch and play, whatever sport they want to play. “It’s a great release. It’s great what Pat McGibbon is doing here.

We have a business that has very much enjoyed its own expansion and we want to shine a light on our next generation of young professionals”.According to Susan Dunlop, that’s a well refined mantra at GMcG Chartered Accountants. Susan is one of seven directors at GMcG, having joined the firm more than  years ago and who now heads up the firm’s Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Part of planning for the future has been the recent appointment of a new director in Audit and Business Advisory Services, together with an associate director who will head up the firm’s Corporate Finance department. Both are signicant investments at management level and a reflection of the firm’s growth and ambition across its three offices.“As a leading independent accountancy firm, many of our key strengths lie in our ability to get things done, through local decision making, management and accessibility of our people” Susan says.Accessibility is regularly acknowledged as being of great value to the firm’s clients and has become a key component of how the firm does business.“Business owners know they can lt the phone and speak to any of our directors, at any time of the day. For us, that’s just part of our client service, but our clients expect it and they know it can make a huge dference to getting an issue resolved quickly and effectively, allowing them to get on with running their business.”As local businesses face uncertainty and challenges across many fronts, Susan and the management team recognise the importance of being positioned as the complete business advisor and having the expertise, understanding and experience to deliver. “Businesses evolve through dferent circumstances and with dferent requirements. We need to be one step ahead, providing the right expertise at the right time. GMcG can offer this expertise through our service lines which include Audit and Business Advisory, Tax, Forensic Accounting and Investigation, Corporate Finance, GMcG Digital and International liaison, through our TIAG membership.” The firm delivers these services though a team of more than  employees across three offices in Belfast, Lisburn and Portadown. Having initially operated as independent firms in each locationthe GMcG evolution was completed in  when the three firms merged completely under a single GMcG brand. This was a signicant investment and transition for the firm.Gill Johnston, director at GMcG Portadown, says: “It was vital that we didn’t lose focus on the profile and client relationships we had developed over many years in each location. “So we are delighted with the success of the transition and how the shared systems and expertise are adding real value to client service delivery across each location”. GMcG services a broad client base from sole traders to large corporates, including a erse range of businesses and private iniduals, public and not-for-profit sector entities, as well as legal and other professional services practices.For Susan and the rest of the team, the firm’s independence and longstanding client relationships are what bolster the firm’s success.“We have a loyal and growing client base and are particularly proud of the fact that many of these relationships go back decades or transcend generations. We advise many of these clients on succession planning, helping them develop their business through the next stage of its journey. “In our experience, all of this is underlined by the importance of investing in client relationships, getting to know the client’s business, their issues, opportunities and the type of expertise they need.“It can be a long term effort and something that often demands dedication beyond a nine to five working day. But we always view it as a rewarding investment, especially when we see our clients thrive and grow.”As part of the firm’s growth and expansion, GMcG has undergone major investment in its overall strategy, its people, IT systems and recruitment.With no shortage of drive and ambition, it’s very much a case of ‘been there, done that’ for GMcG, having themselves undergone restructuring, appointed new directors, undertaken signicant investment, experienced dynamic growth and transitioned seamless succession planning.“We have done it ourselves, and been through it all,” Susan says. “We have grown our firm and understand many of the challenges and opportunities facing SME clients with real aspirations or plans for business development we have that insight and experience that has really proved valuable in advising many of these clients.”Building on these foundations, the firm today has a strong focus on developing the next generation of its service team. A younger generation of professional advisors are moving up the ranks in the firm, with other new faces joining the expanding management team.Nigel Moore, who started with the firm back in  as a trainee, has been appointed director in the Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Director Stephen Houston also started his career as a trainee and heads up GMcG’s Lisburn office. Robbie Milliken, who has more than  years’ experience across corporate finance and business banking, has also joined the firm to head up its Corporate Finance department.Susan is keen to acknowledge that GMcG is a firm that is proud of its working environment, and that career progression is part and parcel of its ethos.“We give employees every opportunity to progress through the ranks and be rewarded for their success, and we can point to two of our directors who commenced as trainees. We feel this is testament to the experience and environment we offer, and to our commitment to ensuring employees reach their full potential”. “Importantly, achieving the right work-le balance is something we facilitate and promote as much as possible across all grades. We are very aware of the importance of mental health and wellbeing and are delighted to have partnered with a mental health charity for the last two years, with mental health programmes delivered across GMcG’s offices.”GMcG also has the global reach to serve clients wherever the growth of their business takes them, through its membership of The International Accounting Group .Lyn Canning Hagan, who heads up GMcG Tax Services and is one of the firm’s TIAG liaison directors, says:“TIAG, together with its sister alliance TAGLaw, provides GMcG and our clients direct access to accounting, tax and legal expertise across more than  countries worldwide. “This is hugely beneficial to businesses with international markets or operations and many of our clients have already benefited from this global expertise across numerous jurisdictions.”Looking to the Ulster Business Next , which features in this edition of the magazine, Susan Dunlop says many of those small and medium-sized Northern Ireland businesses making the list are exactly the type of clients GMcG is working with.“We’re proud of our track record of helping SME clients across all sectors achieve success through growth, restructuring or expansion, drawing on our own experiences to make a real dference in shaping their future plans.”So, it goes without saying that the future is more than bright for GMcG – a firm with decades of experience, but one which is always looking forward.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/sto1.jpg","title":"ni business rates to undergo full review","story":"Posted on Thursday May  by John Mulgrew There will be a full review of Northern Ireland’s business rates system, a top civil servant has revealed. Sue Gray, Permanent Secretary of the Department of Finance, announced the full review into the taxation system for companies here, during a Local Government conference, with Retail NI and law firm DWF, at Titanic Belfast. The reform and re-examination of business rates has been one of the core concerns among the retail and hospitality sectors for the last few years. It’s one of several key business issues which had been kicked down the road due to the ongoing impasse at Stormont. The news has been welcomed by Retail NI and Hospitality Ulster. In a joint statement, the groups said: “Both our organisations are delighted that the Department of Finance have announced this review into non-domestic rates. We have consistently lobbied for this over a number of years and are pleased that our joint call has been heard” “While this is not an end in itself, it is a means to an end. This review provides us with a roadmap for radical change to an antiquated and not fit for purpose system of business rates which is a major burden for our members “In this review we will be outlining signicant changes to rates, including our proposals for a targeted approach to small business rates relief, a revamp of the rates hardship fund, green rates rebate for business who invest in carbon neutral technology and greater relief for new start businesses. “At the last UK Budget, the Chancellor gave independent retailers and hospitality businesses a third off their rate bills in England. We want nothing less than this for our members in Northern Ireland.\" Ms Gray says that \"in recent years signicant changes have taken place in our high streets and town centres. It is critical from a business perspective, as well as a government funding perspective, that our rating system is capable of responding to this wider process of change. That’s why today I am announcing a full and comprehensive review of business rates. “We must create a rating system which generates the funding our public services need while supporting businesses in all sector and enabling economic growth right across Northern Ireland. “In an environment where we are working without ministers, there are limitations to what we can do by way of policy change. But we need to be ready with updated advice for incoming ministers for theirto office. This fundamental review is therefore a critical part of this process.” And Aodhán Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, said: “We wholeheartedly welcome the announcement of this review and it is a credit  the Permanent Secretary’s drive to make positive change. “The fact that retail is % of the economy and pays a quarter of all business rates is simply not sustainable especially give the seismic structural changes going on in the industry. “We have some of the highest business rates in Europe and they are a disincentive to investing in Northern Ireland. We are already playing catch up to the rest of the UK on business rates reform where our businesses pay p in the pound more than the UK average. “This review must look at all aspects of the system. There must be equity in any new system that allows for a widening of the tax base and an audit of the plethora of exemptions some of which have been in place since the s. “If we don’t get business rates right, we risk further shop closures which will  not only cost jobs  but leave a gaping hole in NI finances.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/js_1.jpg","title":"could a new dawn boost ni business development","story":"Posted on Friday  May  by Ulster Business While Brexit is still upon us, John Simpson says the business sectors finances have proved stronger than predicted and lending could be boosted on the outside as the veil of uncertainty lts The darkest hour comes just before the dawn: an apt reference to the prospects when Brexit is finally taken out of the daily diet of news, concern about business disruption, and foreboding about dficult trading prospects. Brexit is proving to be a slow departure. This year the economy has proved more resilient than many feared. Employment has remained at high levels, jobs for skilled employees are available, and with less certainty personal incomes have been maintained.Political uncertainty and efficient business management are an uneasy mix. In the recent winter and springbusinesses have had to live with an intense series of destabilising influences. For over  years, businesses in Ireland and the UK have grown accustomed to near frictionless EU market conditions. customs duties had disappeared on all internal EU trading. For businesses on this island, the memory of cross-border customs duties had all been but forgotten.   Looking at the lending performances of some of our own banks, the numbers seem to be adding up. In its full year accounts for , Danske Bank posted pre-tax profit of £.m, while new lending rose % and overall business lending increased by %.Across Donegall Square, Ulster Bank saw its income rising from £m to £m during , while profit after impairments stood at £m. There was a % rise in new corporate lending, while small business rose by %.Meanwhile, across the UK as a whole, Barclays has announced a £bn lending fund as part of a series of initiatives to help small and medium-sized businessesto succeed and flourish through Brexit and beyond.Only older colleaguescan remember the perils of railway journeys interrupted by a one hour stop at Goraghwood station, close to Newry, while all passengers were asked by customs officersthey had ‘anything to declare’. More affluent older travellers would more likely recall the cross-border queuing requirement for the predecessor of the ‘green card’ for cars. Today, the challenge is of how to deliver the political agreement that the border on this island should be either frictionless or non-existent as the UK plans to leave the EU. In the new era there will be redefined relations between NI and the Republic, within the framework of UK-EU relations. The important part lies in negotiations on working arrangements that have not yet officially started.For the remaining part of  and going into , the business scene might be described as getting ‘ready for le after Brexit’.In the last three years the business community which forms the core of the private sector in Northern Ireland has been trading successfully.  The evidence from local reviews of the larger profit making businesses has been encouraging. Year-on-year turnover has been increasing faster than inflation and, even more critically, profitability has been maintained and often improved.Work to identy how well locally owned and controlled businesses have performed has been reassuring. To be included in the review of the Top  more profitable Northern Ireland business, which will be published in more detail, the cut-off point has risen to just on £m annual pre-tax profits. In a further reassuring feature and in contrast to the preceding year, during the year  the number of business casualties fell to a very small number.While the overall performance of businesses in the private sector has been better than is sometimes appreciated, there is a mixture of features in the complex matrix of business performance. The evidence is often from personal subjective sources but the elements do point to a consistent pattern. Businesses have been trading, in general, with improved profits but with turnover rather less buoyant. Employment has been increasing, now more slowly, but pay rateshave not fully recovered from the fall in real earnings in the past decade. Interestingly at a regional and national level, changes in wage rates have not shown the boost of an inflationary increase that might have been expected when unemployment levels have fallen to near record lows.Bargaining in the labour market has been restrained, probably influenced by the siren voices of emerging problems as the Brexit withdrawal agreement has dominated the political and economic policy agenda. This points to the emergence of a contrast between the trend in overall business profitability, which has improved, alongside the trend for inidual personal incomes to lag behind the real levels of the past decade. To a modest degree, business profitability may have improved relative to changes in the costs of the payroll.While the scale of the dference should be treated with caution, as business evolves during the rest of , business finance may be better placed to activate improving investment plans.The post-Brexit business scene should be pointing to reduced uncertainty, even with some predictable new business obstacles, and a helpful change in government economic policy to incentivise faster economic expansion. That prospect, alongside a business sector that has a stronger capacity to invest and grow, makes the months ahead more encouraging than many experts expect.In summary, the business sector is understandably anxious to see aof greater business stability and, for a mixture of reasons, may now be more likely to implement more ambitious investment programmes. Add to this combination the possibility that official Government economic policy will be more flexibleand there is a hope that, out of the recent grey clouds of possible recession, there will be incentives leading to a more buoyant economy here.Just one moment of caution: the brightness of a new dawn in  may be dimmedthe political processes constrain the application of improved economic policies through a refreshed local administration. Business has been performing well, despite the huge levels of uncertainty. However, the political environment could drown out an improving economy. That challenge has not changed.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/graham_11.jpg","title":"word from the wise graham lapsley","story":"Posted on Wednesday  May  by Ulster Business Name: Graham Lapsley, head of private banking, Danske Bank How did you start out in business   Banking has always been in my blood as my father joined Belfast Banking Co Ltdin . As a boy I remember being in Northern Bank branches ‘helping out’ when my father was completing regular evenings doing overtime. This was an environment that I was familiar with, although I didn’t ever think I would make banking a career. In  I found myself in Limavady branch and thoroughly enjoyed branch banking at a time when there were no computers, no autobanks and lots of staff. I’ve benefited from lots of dferent roles at the Bank in my career, each bringing its own challenges. I left my role as head of personal credit last year to take up my current position as head of private banking. What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far On a personal level changing job roles always brought new challenges. Change is a constant which I accept and while I’ve worked in Danske Bank for  years I have had senior roles in branch banking, wealth management, business banking, risk management and now private banking.   As an area manager in branch banking, I found the leadership of the transition from Australian ownership to Danish ownership in  a huge challenge. This change was as exciting as it was challenging as we benefited from huge investment and the Dane’s leading edge technology. I didn’t go directly from school to university, but I’ve been lucky enough to have had employer support to complete a business studies degree and a masters’ degree in executive leadership. I’ve also attended business schools in Boston, Lausanne and London, with each giving me new tools to add into my skill set.  How would you describe your management style  I am energetic and enthusiastic. I love working with our relationship managers and customers to build a financial solution. I am very results oriented and prefer a direct style. I am very self-awareand have a positive outlook.  What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I’m not sure that I would change anything. I’ve learnt from my mistakes and that made me a better banker in the long term. Perhaps my ambition in my early career took me into roles that didn’t match my skill sets, but I did take away vital learnings from these experiences  Have you done it all on your own  Absolutely not. My we Sonya and family have always been a great support and this enabled me to have a good work le balance. I have a strong network personally and professionally, which is mutually supportive. I’ve also been lucky enough to have worked with many leaders who have greatly inspired me.  What’s more important, your product or your people  In Private Banking, without a doubt our people. We are a people business and our strength in Private Banking rests with the professionalism of the private banking team. We offer premium relationship management to our private banking customers, supported by leading edge digital solutions. Our customers value our expertise and the ability to meet up in person to discuss financial plans.  What makes your business stand out from the competition  There are numerous competitors in the marketplace, but we are the biggest private banking relationship management team in Northern Ireland. Danske is also the leading corporate and business bank in Northern Ireland, and many of these customers have their personal needs looked after by my private banking team.  What piece of advice would you give to a  year old you  You’ll never be judged on what happens to you, but you will be judged on how you react to it. And you won’t get the experience you need, until the day after you needed it.

I’ve heard employers bemoan the fact that this generation can’t communicate face-to-face or they place more emphasis on their passions outside of work than their own career development.While some of this is no doubt grounded in their experience, employers perhaps need to adjust how they engage with the new generation beyond just offering them quirky perks and trendy working environments. Hays recently sponsored The GoodIdea, the biggest ever AI hackathon in NI organised by AINIand Hackily – a two-day event hosted by QUB School of Computing and Ulster University Magee campus for around  hackers in Belfast and  in Derry.The hackathon provided a welcoming and collaborative environment for hackers to build out brilliant, innovative, and impactful ideas using AI under a theme of ‘AI for good’, where hackers were challenged to utilise open data sources to create an innovative solution to a real-world problem.It was an opportunity for students – who made up % of the attendees – and experienced professionals to meet fellow hackers, learn new technologies, and work alongside seasoned mentors.Far from being underwhelmed by Generation Z, we were inspired by the talent pools from dferent backgrounds such as computer science, physics and maths, coming together to collaborate with each other, learn about bleeding edge technologies and also to put their skills to use in creating something that was a benefit to society. For example, one of the teams invented an algorithm for a computer to read British sign language using a webcam.These were ambitious, driven, competitive young people who worked brilliantly in their teams and certainly didn’t struggle to communicate, eventhey arrived alone and joined a team. A team from Glasgow made the journey across to take part and the hackathon ran right through Saturday night – so we couldn’t fault their work ethic.There were prizes, mentorship and funding available to the winners of the hackathon, as well as recruitment advice and workshops provided to students and professionals by Hays’ own experts across software development, data engineering and cyber security.But the main attraction was undoubtedly in the opportunity to co-create new ideas about how to apply technology to the world they will run in future. That is hugely positive and our challenge as employers must be to make sure the students who will be the candidates of the future in NI’s thriving tech community are encouraged to put that passion into their careers.The undergraduate community is an under-served community of future leaders in terms of recruitment and our desire is to equip undergraduates with the right understanding of what employers in the tech sector want and how they can build their personal brand for the future.Employers need to get past the myths about Generation Z and focus on helping younger employees find meaning in their workthey are to unlock their potential.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/5g1.jpg","title":"belfast to get superfast g mobile broadband this month","story":"Posted on Wednesday  May  by John Mulgrew Suzanne Wylie, Belfast City Council with Karen Dundas, EE Victoria Square store manager Belfast is to become one of six UK cities to get superfast G mobile broadband later this month, it has emerged.
