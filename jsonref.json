Your questions answered as 4.5million people in Greater Manchester, Lancashire and Yorkshire are hit by new lockdownWhat has the Government announced?Health Secretary Matt Hancock last night that people from different households in Greater Manchester, parts of east Lancashire and West Yorkshire will be banned from meeting each other in their homes and in their gardens from midnight.Which areas are affected?The new restrictions apply to the whole of Greater Manchester, parts of east Lancashire including Blackburn with Darwen, Burnley, Hyndburn, Pendle and Rossendale as well as Bradford, Calderdale and Kirklees in West Yorkshire.The same restrictions will also apply to Leicester, which saw the first so-called \u0027local lockdown\u0027 imposed on June 29.What does this mean for the people living there?The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said that the new measures will mean people in these areas will not be permitted to mix with other households outside those in their support bubbles in private homes or gardens.Households will be able to go to bars, pubs and other hospitality venues but two households should not go together, the department added.The DHSC said that restrictions currently in place in Blackburn which saw indoor swimming pools, indoor fitness and dance studios, indoor gyms and sports facilities remaining closed will continue.Why is this being done?In a series of tweets Mr Hancock said that there had been an increasing rate of transmission in parts of Northern England.He said that this was due to \u0027households gathering and not abiding by the social distancing rules\u0027 and the new rules were being put in place in order to \u0027keep the country safe\u0027.How will the restrictions be enforced?The Government said it will sign new regulations to make the changes \u0027legally enforceable\u0027 and will give local authorities and police forces the powers to enforce these restrictions.How fast is the virus spreading?According to the most recent figures from Public Health England (PHE) the rate of infection is increasing across 13 of the 19 local authorities in the areas where the new measures are being imposed.In Blackburn with Darwen, the rate has risen from 83.3 cases per 100,000 people in the seven days to July 20 to 89.3 in the seven days to July 27. A total of 133 new cases have been recorded.Leicester has the second highest seven-day rate despite it falling from 67.8 per 100,000 people to 60.2 over the same period, with 214 new cases.Over the same period the rate has also increased in Manchester, Burnley, Pendle, Bradford, Calderdale, Oldham, Bury, Salford, Stockport, Tameside, Trafford and Wigan, but fell in Hyndburn, Rossendale, Kirklees, Bolton and Rochdale.Rochdale, Oldham, Blackburn and Pendle have been on a PHE watchlist as an \u0027area of concern\u0027 after elevated rates of infection.What is happening in Leicester?The DHSC said that from Monday restaurants, cafes, bars and hairdressers in Leicester can open again in line with the easing of restrictions across the rest of the country on July 4.Leisure centres, gyms and pools will remain closed but cinemas and museums will open and religious ceremonies will be able to take place, it added.The department said that all local restrictions currently in place in the neighbouring borough of Oadby and Wigston will end.But Mr Hancock said that the restrictions on social gatherings imposed on Greater Manchester, East Lancashire and West Yorkshire would also apply to the city of Leicester.Does my household include close family members?Your household – as defined in law – is only the people you live with. If you have formed a support bubble (which must include a single adult household i.e. people who live alone or single parents with dependent children aged under 18) these can be treated as if they are members of your household.What will be illegal?It will be illegal for people who do not live together to meet in a private home or garden, except for limited exceptions to be set out in law. You should not host or visit people you do not live with, unless they are in your support bubble. If you live in the affected areas, you should not visit someone\u0027s home or garden regardless of whether this is in or outside of the restricted area.Can I still meet indoors with people in my support bubble?Yes. Where people from single adult households (people who live alone or single parents with dependent children aged under 18) have formed a support bubble with another household, they can continue to visit each other, stay overnight, and visit other public places as if they were one household.Can I still meet people outdoors?In line with the national guidance, you can continue to meet in public outdoor spaces in groups of no more than six people, unless the group includes only people from two households. You cannot meet people you do not live within a private garden.At all times, you should socially distance from people you do not live with – unless they are in your support bubble.I live in this area. Can I still meet with my family and friends to celebrate Eid?Due to higher rates of infection, if you live in this area you should not host or visit friends and family in each other\u0027s homes or gardens. It will shortly be illegal to do so, unless specific exemptions apply. You also should not meet friends and family in other venues – including restaurants or cafes.Up to two households, or six people from any number of households may meet outdoors (excluding people\u0027s gardens) where there is a lower risk of infection. If you do so, you should still socially distance from those you do not live with, and avoid physical contact.You may attend a mosque or other place or worship, where Covid-19 Secure guidance applies, but you must socially distance from people outside of your household. This means maintaining a distance of 2 metres, or 1 metre with mitigations (such as wearing face coverings). We recommend at this time that, if possible, prayerreligious services take place outdoors.Can I still go to work in this area?Yes. People living inside and outside of this area can continue to travel in and out for work. Workplaces must implement Covid-19 Secure guidance.I live in this area. Can I still go to cafes, restaurants, the gym and other public places?Yes. But you should only go with members of your own household – even if you are going outside of the restricted area.I live in the area. Can people from outside of the lockdown area visit me at my house?No. This will be illegal.Do I still have to shield if I live in this area?Clinically extremely vulnerable people will no longer have to follow the shielding guidance from the 1 August, unless they live in Blackburn with Darwen in the North West and other local affected areas across England where shielding continues.Can I visit a care home?You should not visit friends or family in care homes, other than in exceptional circumstances. Care homes should restrict visits to these circumstances.Can I still have my wedding if it\u0027s in the lockdown area?Weddings and civil partnership ceremonies in these areas can still go ahead. No more than 30 people should attend a marriage or civil partnership, where this can be safely accommodated with social distancing in a COVID-19 secure venue. Further guidance can be found here.Large wedding receptions or parties should not currently be taking place and any celebration after the ceremony should follow the broader social distancing guidance of involving no more than two households in any location or, if outdoors, up to six people from different households.Can I travel outside of the lockdown area to attend a wedding ceremony?Yes.Can I travel into the lockdown area to attend a wedding ceremony?Yes. Weddings should be limited to no more than 30 people and subject to COVID-19 Secure guidelines.People living outside the lockdown areas may travel into the areas to attend a wedding, but should not go into a private home or garden.Can I still visit a place of worship in the lockdown area?Yes, but you must socially distance from people outside of your household. This means maintaining a distance of 2 metres, or 1 metre with mitigations (e.g. face coverings). We recommend at this time that if possible prayerreligious services take place outdoors.Can funerals still take place in the lockdown areas?Yes. Funerals should be limited to no more than 30 people and subject to COVID-19 Secure guidelines.People living outside the lockdown areas may travel into the areas to attend a funeral.Can I holiday in the lockdown area, or visit shops, leisure facilities, or cafes in it?Yes. However, you must avoid socialising with people indoors when doing so.Can I travel in a car with someone I do not live with?You should try not to share a vehicle with those outside your household or social bubble.

But that has been pushed back to August 15 \u0027at the earliest\u0027 amid an uptick in infections across the country.Mr Johnson also revealed that the mandatory wearing of face coverings will be extended to include galleries, cinemas and places of worship.Me Johnson said: \u0027With those numbers creeping up, our assessment is that we should now squeeze that brake pedal in order to keep the virus under control.\u0027On Saturday August 1 we had hoped to reopen in England a number of the higher risk settings that remained closed. Today I am afraid we are postponing those changes for at least a fortnight.\u0027That means until August 15 at the earliest casinos, bowling alleys, skating rinks and the remaining close contact services must remain closed, indoor performances will not resume, pilots of larger crowds in sports venues and conference centres will not take place and wedding receptions of up to 30 people will not be permitted but ceremonies of course can continue to take place in line with Covid secure guidelines\u0027.He added: \u0027I know that he steps we are taking will be a real blow to many people, to everyone whose wedding plans have been disrupted or cannot now celebrate Eid in the way that they would wish and I am really, really sorry about that but we simply cannot take the risk.\u0027Mr Johnson said the the new rules on face coverings will apply from August 8, with the police being tasked with increasing enforcement in order to ensure members of the public comply.He said: \u0027We will also extend the requirement to wear a face covering to other indoor settings where you are likely to come into contact with people you do not normally meet such as museums, galleries, cinemas and places of worship.\u0027We now recommend face coverings are worn in these settings and this will become enforceable in law from August 8.\u0027 The announcement came as it was revealed Covid-19 cases have risen to a seven-week high in England and the R rate could now be above the dreaded level of one in both the North West and South West amid growing fears of a second wave.Government statisticians today admitted there is \u0027now enough evidence\u0027 to prove Covid-19 infections are on the up, estimating that 4,200 people are now catching the virus each day in England alone.The Office for National Statistics (ONS), which tracks the size of the outbreak by swabbing thousands of people, said the number of new daily cases was just 1,700 a fortnight ago.One in 1,500 people currently have the coronavirus - 0.07 per cent of the population. The figure does not include care homes and hospitals.Boris Johnson today said they \u0027can\u0027t ignore this evidence\u0027 as he announced he was \u0027squeezing the brake pedal\u0027 on easing the coronavirus lockdown. Number 10\u0027s scientific advisers today also upped the R rate in the UK, saying they now believe it stands between 0.8 and 0.9.

I wanted to create an image that felt precious and spiritual, that shone a light and memorialised the BAME victims of Covid-19.The picture was created to recognises the contribution of the key workers who have died. Around the edges of the image is a border created out of the transport and NHS symbols, the professions of those who have been the worst affected.The portraits are of (from left): Andrew Ekene Nwankwo, a nurse, Donna Campbell, a healthcare support worker, Belly Mujinga, a rail worker, Mary Agyeiwaa Agyapong, a nurse, Ranjeet Riyat, a consultant in emergency medicine, Khulisani (Khuli) Nkala, a mental health nurse, Meks Nyack Ihenacho, a London bus driver.Written in the background are all the names and occupations of people who have died. I have left room to imply that there are more names to come.On a number of levels, I was very keen to support Patrick Vernon’s fund. From a personal perspective, as a family we have a huge debt of gratitude to the NHS. The Homerton ICU in London saved my daughter’s life. Before Christmas, we spent five weeks in intensive care with my daughter, who was on a ventilator with pneumonia. The ICU staff at the Homerton became like family to us, and when Covid-19 hit we felt intensely worried and upset for them, especially knowing how many fantastic BAME members of staff there were and how much more they were at risk.I have been appalled by the government’s handling of the crisis and the unnecessary deaths caused by lack of PPE, planning and the late lockdown and, ultimately, the systemic racism that has caused so many unnecessary deaths. I am deeply saddened for all the families who are suffering with the loss of their loved ones.

Rita was 17 when the photojournalist Lizzie Sadin photographed her. A year before, she was living with her family near the foothills of the Himalayas. A friend told her of a life of opportunity lying in wait in India, just a few hundred miles away. After crossing the border from Nepal, Rita was captured, imprisoned and forced into a life of sex work for visiting tourists. Rita’s eyes blaze into the airy calm of Porquerolles island.In 2017, Sadin, a former social worker in Paris’s périphérique, was the Carmignac photojournalism awards’ eighth winning laureate. On the basis of a two-page pitch, she received a €50,000 (£45,000) grant. She used the money to embed herself, with her camera hidden beneath her coat, in the shady dance bars of the Nepalese borderlands, capturing stories of modern-day slavery.Sadin is one of 10 photojournalists to receive such backing over the course of the last decade. To mark this milestone, Fondation Carmignac is exhibiting each laureate’s work in a retrospective titled 10 Years of Reportage, on show until 1 November 2020.With Rita’s eyes at its centre, the show is curated to urgently explore some of the biggest existential questions we face – the hidden truths of modern slavery, the cost of endless conflict, the consequences of habitat loss and the quest of freedom for those living under authoritarianism.“I came to Libya to document the humanitarian crisis of migrants trying to reach Europe through Libyan territory,” says Narciso Contreras. “But, actually, what I found is a market.”From February to June 2016, the Mexican photographer travelled through Libya after the fall of Muammar Gaddafi.He captured how Libya has become a human marketplace in which destitute migrants are bought and sold as they attempt to make their way to Europe.Contreras uses the exhibition to show the first images – taken on his iPhone – of a transaction taking place between traffickers, which helped NGO groups affiliated with Carmignac prove modern slavery was taking place in Libya.Contreras concluded that, far from trying to resolve the situation, “Libyan authorities were running, and profiting from”, the trafficking of people.Arctic: New Frontier – Yuri Kozyrev and Kadir van Lohuizen, 2018If you’re planning to visit the north pole, it might be a good idea to get a move on. On the basis of all authoritative forecasts, the ice of the Arctic will be gone by 2030, to be replaced by a water world created by anthropogenic global warming.Never before have two photojournalists simultaneously covered the irreversible changes that are taking place in the Arctic. That is until Yuri Kozyrev and Kadir van Lohuizen, working in coordination, created Arctic: New Frontier in 2018.Kozyrev followed the routes of the Russian Arctic ports, from the city of Murmansk to the Taymyr peninsula and the islands of the Russian Arctic. Van Lohuizen, meanwhile, started in the Svalbard Archipelago and followed the northern Arctic route through Greenland, Canada and the northern tip of Alaska. Each captured the expansion of the region’s ports, industrial forces and military sites – “a process that will change the map of the world forever”, Kozyrev says.The New Zealand-born photographer Robin Hammond calls Robert Mugabe’s Zimbabwe “a garden of Eden that became a hell to many of its inhabitants”. In the processing of taking portraits of Zimbabwe’s pro-democracy activists, Hammond was imprisoned twice. “They wanted to show me the terrible living conditions they have to endure,” he says. “But some were afraid for me, and warned me of the danger.”His portraits include the face of the activist Masvingo, staring out from a pool of darkness. Hammond hides his body, severely burnt after soldiers threw a can of lit petrol into a campaign office for Zimbabwe’s Movement for Democratic Change.Iran: Blank Pages of an Iranian Photo Album – Newsha Tavakolian, 2014In 2015, Tavakolian became the first female photographer from the Middle East to join Magnum, the photography collective. The year before, she was the Carmignac laureate for a body of work that explored, via moving and still image, the personal stories of her own generation – the Iranian millennials who have grown up in Tehran after the 1979 revolution and the country’s bloody war with Iraq.As a self-taught photographer, and when still a teenager, she took to the streets to photograph the 1999 student uprising in Iran, “spending a week scaling trees with a zoom lens” while militia marched through the streets.Her series here captures nine men and women, shot in and around Tehran, as they communicate the tension of “being marginalised by those speaking in their name”, Tavakolian says. In Iran, “they try to fit into a landscape they regard as not being their own. They, like many of the others they represent, adapt.”Seen together, the Carmignac Foundation’s retrospective is a stark reminder, in the midst of the bucolic beauty of the French Riviera, of the first world’s increasing responsibility to the poverty, oppression and vulnerability that is the daily reality for most people in this world.Carmignac Photojournalism Award: 10 Years of Reportage is on show until 1 November 2020 at Villa Carmignac, Porquerolles"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/94a609aea440a248512a7b5309886c72674b2a1e/2_0_5902_3543/master/5902.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a128a16e4689d3ad7d51e7b7723f4041","title":"being inbetween girls of our time in pictures","story":"A series documenting and exploring the lives of girls aged between 10 and 12 a time of transition between girlhood and young adulthood.

It may be easier to just buy a supermarketSupermarkets have been waiting several years for Amazon to make its next move in the UK’s near-£200bn food retail market and it came this week when the American company revealed plans to expand its online grocery service Amazon Fresh.Amazon has already won over millions of Britons with the rapid-fire delivery of books, toys and household essentials to their front door, and coronavirus lockdowns have made it a lifeline for some households.Fresh has operated with little fanfare in London and the home counties for several years but the online retailer has promised wider availability by the end of 2020, including in major cities such as Birmingham, Manchester and Edinburgh.To win over shoppers, Amazon is offering the service as a new perk to the estimated 15 million Britons that are paid up members of its Prime membership scheme, which offers extras such as faster delivery and streaming services for a £79 annual fee.“Grocery delivery is one of the fastest-growing businesses at Amazon,” said Russell Jones, country manager, Amazon Fresh UK. “We will keep improving the grocery shopping experience so by the end of the year, millions of Prime members across the UK will have access to fast, free delivery of groceries.”The move is timed to capitalise on new shopping habits forged during the pandemic when many households opted to buy their groceries online for the first time. Ocado recently revealed it had a waiting list of 1 million customers after its automated warehouses struggled to cope with the huge surge in demand.Amazon brought the Fresh service over from the US in 2016 and the following year caused a storm when it spent more than £10bn on organic food chain Whole Foods Market. But instead of going it alone here Amazon has put together its food range through partnerships with homegrown chains including Morrisons and upmarket regional chain Booths.Relationships with the manufacturers of major grocery brands such as Pepsi, Cadbury and Heinz means the Fresh service carries “tens of thousands of products” – a selection comprehensive enough for a weekly shop.“Amazon is going to have to work incredibly hard to dislodge people’s loyalty to their existing supermarket,” says Bryan Roberts, an independent retail analyst. “Depending where you live people are either Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Asda or Morrisons shoppers and when they go online are more likely to buy from those retailers because they’re familiar with the range and the pricing and the private label.”He adds: “One of the big things everyone is ignoring is that grocery home delivery is brilliant at the moment but that’s because everyone is at home. Fast forward 12 to-18 months, that isn’t always going to be the case.”Amazon has 14 depots capable of handling groceries around the country and says it has expanded its fulfilment network in key locations to handle the expected customer demand. But analysts think it does not have adequate infrastructure to offer a competitive grocery delivery service nationwide. Yet.Last year, the proposed merger of Sainsbury’s and Asda was blocked by the competition watchdog, which argued that the proposed £7bn deal threatened to push up prices and reduce the choice and quality of products on sale in stores. There has been no deal action since then. Analysts think if Amazon’s chief executive, Jeff Bezos, wants to make waves here it will have to buy an incumbent, with Walmart-owned Asda or Morrisons the most likely targets.“Amazon is probably going to be the next key player in any consolidation in the industry, particularly if, as it as it decided in the USA, that the only real way to move to the right in groceries is to buy a store estate,” says Clive Black, an analyst at stockbroker Shore Capital.“Asda is for sale and the big American private equity firms are looking at it, so we can’t rule that out even though Walmart and Amazon are going head to head in the states at the moment. They also have a formal relationship with Morrisons.”Ocado ZoomOnly available to a limited number of postcodes from a small site in west London (second planned for north London).

However, the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, must come clean and acknowledge that our railways are now in public ownership and take direct control of running them rather than continue to line the pockets of fleecing privateers with taxpayers’ money.”While the emergency measures are temporary, they come at a crucial juncture for the future of England’s complex rail franchising system.The government commissioned a review of the future of railways, following a string of failures of franchises that ended up being effectively nationalised, including the Northern network earlier this year.The former British Airways boss Keith Williams, who is leading the ongoing review, said last year that the government should take a “step back” from the UK railway, which could potentially be run by a new body."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1b3f5728bd5ac96268397b6b29a651ee29dd3733/0_196_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cc9c6eaf7ed65bb4fcc394a79c684df3","title":"owner of uk chip firm arm reported in talks about sale to nvidia","story":"Japan’s SoftBank could offload semiconductor maker within weeks for at least $32bnThe UK-based microchip designer Arm is the subject of “advanced talks” aimed at selling the British tech company to a US computing giant.The computing firm Nvidia is negotiating with Arm’s Japanese owner, SoftBank, to acquire the Cambridge-based group in a deal that could be agreed within weeks, according to a report by Bloomberg.The news came two weeks after the Wall Street Journal reported that SoftBank was exploring a sale of Arm.A deal to acquire Arm could be the largest ever in the semiconductor industry, which has been consolidating in recent years as companies seek to ersify and expand. Arm’s technology underpins chips in products including Apple devices.Arm was sold to SoftBank in 2016 for $32bn (£24bn) and any transaction would value the business at a further premium, the Financial Times reported.The news will be viewed as a step by SoftBank to improve its finances, just months after the Japanese conglomerate posted its biggest loss ever.In May, SoftBank reported a $12.7bn annual loss, after announcing a $19.6bn profit the year before.The results were largely caused by the large bets SoftBank had made on a series of tech-related companies, that had once been considered stars of the startup world, only to have since struggled.

Up until now, the government had asked all employees to work from home where possible.In addition, the advice in England to avoid public transport is being scrapped. However, some of the largest office occupiers in the country do not appear to be in a rush to return to their workplaces, with many waiting for the end of the school summer holidays at the start of September. And some will be waiting until 2021 at the earliest before they consider asking homebound employees to return to their offices. Here we take a sector-by-sector look at some major employers and their working plans.Rose said some staff benefited from the flexibility of home working, but said the bank would likely end up with a “hybrid model of still needing offices and space to bring people together to make sure our culture stays strong”.It has offered bank branch staff washable face coverings that they can wear on their commute or at work. It has also imposed limits of two people per lift, and installed thermal cameras and temperature checks at building entrances. The bank has also temporarily banned hotdesking and put up screens in areas where social distancing is not possible.Lloyds Banking GroupAround 50,000 of Lloyds Banking Group’s 65,000 workers have been able to work from home during the Covid-19 outbreak, and will continue to do so until at least the end of September. It is also reviewing whether it needs so much office space, given the home-working trend. Most of those unable to work from home are bank branch staff across its three high street brands – Halifax, Lloyds and Bank of Scotland – who count as essential workers.BarclaysThe lender doesn’t intend to bring the bulk of its 50,000 UK staff back to the office until at least the end of September. However, around 20,000 people are working in the bank’s branches and call centres, as well as at its trading desk in Canary Wharf. Like Lloyds, Barclays has also said it is weighing up its needs for office space. “We are going to think about our real estate mix, given the lessons that we’ve learned,” said Jes Staley, Barclays chief executive.Goldman SachsThe bank has welcomed back around 1,000 of its 6,000 UK employees to its London offices since 15 June. As the sole occupant in its London building, staff have been spread across six floors, masks are offered at reception, and temperature checks are conducted on arrival. The US-headquartered bank has also opened its roof garden, to allow staff to hold meetings while still abiding by social distancing rules. Most of those who have returned so far are working in highly regulated jobs, or have struggled to work from home.DeloitteThe accountancy and consulting firm has had its 20,000 employees working from home since mid- March, reopened a small number of its offices in early July, and is considering reopening more.EYAfter carrying out a consultation with 1,300 of its employees, EY has decided to reopen its UK offices from 7 September with reduced capacity, which they will steadily increase. Workers can request to return to the office, but the majority of staff will continue to work from home for the time being.AstraZenecaBritain’s biggest pharmaceutical company has around 8,300 employees in the UK, three-quarters of whom have been working from home during the pandemic. The remainder have been working on site as key workers in labs, manufacturing and support. No staff have returned to offices so far, but a phased return will begin in September.GlaxoSmithKlineGSK, which employs 15,000 people in the UK, has started bringing small numbers of staff back to its offices, if they have said they would prefer to work in the office. It doesn’t have a date for a “mass return” to the office yet. Scientists who work in “critical” areas in research and development and those who work in manufacturing or distribution have been working on site throughout the crisis. BPThe oil giant has around 6,500 office-based staff in the UK. The company says the number who have returned is extremely low, and it doesn’t expect it to increase significantly in the short term.National GridAlmost all of National Grid’s 4,000 UK office-based employees continue to work from home. It expects to maintain its current working arrangements until at least September. It also expects any return to the office to be gradual and carefully managed.SSEThe energy company has reopened some of its sites so that certain employees can return to its offices, where appropriate measures have been put in place. All 10,000 office-based staff continue to work from home, and the firm says the current arrangements will remain in place until at least September, when it will review the situation.Allen \u0026amp OveryThe law firm is opening its London office from 7 September to any of its approximately 1,900 staff based in the capital who want to return. Those going back to the office will work there on alternate weeks to allow for social distancing.Clifford ChanceThe vast majority of the law firm’s approximately 2,000 UK staff continue to work from home, and there are no immediate plans for change. A small number of critical staff are working from Clifford Chance’s offices in London and Newcastle.Slaughter \u0026amp MayThe London office reopened on a limited basis in early July, but the law firm only anticipates a small number people to be working there on any given day. The firm keeps the situation under review, but does not expect it to change in the near future due to social distancing requirements.ShoosmithsThe firm’s 13 locations will reopen on 3 August to its 1,600 employees, but will give workers the choice to decide where and when they work. The two-metre social distancing rule will be maintained inside offices, with caps on the number of staff allowed to attend each office each day, who must register their attendance three days in advance.FacebookThe US tech firm has over 3,000 employees in the UK, and three offices in London. It has yet to set out its reopening plans. Founder Mark Zuckerberg has told its workforce that the firm will permanently embrace remote working, even after the pandemic, and expects around half of its global staff to work remotely over the next five to 10 years.VodafoneThe mobile operator does not plan to return to its offices in Newbury and London before the end of 2020. It employs just under 9,000 people in the UK, and has contact centres in Newark, Stoke, Manchester and Glasgow.PearsonAll the publishing firm’s UK offices remain closed, with its 3,600 staff working from home.

BT is spending £12bn rolling out full-fibre broadband to 20m homes by the late 2020s.On Friday, BT revealed a near-£400m decline in revenue in the three months to the end of June. The company blamed the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, which meant it was unable to broadcast sport such as Premier League football on BT TV and in partnered pubs, as well as a drop in demand for its services from small businesses during the lockdown."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c544dca6e5d7968a6f2c065341d1dedf58bcea45/0_0_3335_4229/master/3335.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=007b3a1c6a445b341ed54d171ed11b14","title":"choose us president mark zuckerberg american people","story":"The social media titans are more powerful than politicians. But it doesn’t have to be this wayThis week, in a hearing on Capitol Hill, you could gaze upon the men with the power to determine November’s presidential election and the future of American democracy – but the men in question were not politicians. Rather they were the four tech titans who appeared by Zoom before a congressional committee. Even via video link, the power radiated from them: the heads of Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple loomed from the monitors as veritable masters of the universe, their elected questioners mere earthlings.That hardly exaggerates their might. Between them, and with their users numbered in the billions, Facebook and Google determine much of what the human race sees, reads and knows. Mark Zuckerberg’s writ runs across the planet, no single government is able to constrain him: he is an emperor of knowledge, a minister of information for the entire world. A mere tweak of an algorithm by Facebook can decide whether lies, hate and conspiracy theories spread or shrivel.That’s been true for a while, but in 2020 it’s gained an extra urgency. We know the impact social media had in the US election in 2016 – when ever wilder fictions and fantasies were allowed to proliferate about Hillary Clinton and when, according to the Oxford scholar Philip Howard in a new book, Lie Machines: “There was a one-to-one ratio of junk news to professional news shared by voters over Twitter.” In fewer than 100 days Americans will choose a president, and there are no guarantees that the same thing will not happen again.What’s more, it’s now clear that the online spread of falsehoods is a matter of life and death. (They knew that already in Myanmar, where the violence against the Rohingya people was incited on Facebook.) In the midst of a pandemic, solid, verified information is an essential tool of public health. If bogus claims and unhinged conspiracy theories – like those aired in a pseudo-documentary such as Plandemic – land in people’s news feeds, it’s as if the water supply has become contaminated. Eventually Facebook and YouTube took down Plandemic, with its evidence-free assertions that Covid-19 is the fault of Bill Gates and the World Health Organization, that vaccines are bad and that wearing a mask is dangerous, but not before millions had ingested that garbage on those platforms.Of course, cranks and fantasists have been with us forever, but social media has given them a reach they could never have dreamed of. Armed with Facebook, the would-be propagandist can distribute messages globally and instantly and, at the same time, deliver them to a precisely selected audience, thanks to the copious data Facebook holds on its users, the use of which allows ads to be micro-targeted for a price. And remember, this data isn’t limited to the attitudes you might have expressed online, but could include the purchases you’ve made on your credit card, even the mundane details of your life, as recorded by the gadgets that comprise the internet of things.Occasionally the social media behemoths are compelled to take at least the appearance of action, if only for the sake of managing their own reputations. It happened this week, with the eventual removal of grime artist Wiley from multiple platforms after he went on an extended, hate-filled rant against Jews: after a 48-hour “walkout” from Twitter, organised by an ad-hoc group of activists and celebrities, the network appeared to realise hosting high-profile racism isn’t a good look. Today, Twitter removed the account of white supremacist David Duke, which prompts the question: what on earth took you so long?Make no mistake, the presence of lies and hate on these platforms is not some regrettable bug. It is a feature. The business model for social media requires attention – eyeballs – and the best way to get that is engagement. Messages that stir anger, fury and yes, hate, keep people online more effectively than content that is merely interesting or amusing. It’s why studies show that false news spreads faster than true news: the algorithms are designed to favour virality over veracity.What can be done? There’s no shortage of ideas. Some start with the demand for fact-checking and, after the 2016 election, Facebook took steps in that direction. But when it emerged that one of its fact-checking partners was  Daily Caller, a rightwing news website known for pushing misinformation, the scheme’s credibility plunged.Or, more simply, Facebook, YouTube and Twitter could admit that of course they are publishers and they should therefore take the responsibility that goes with the mighty power they have. If that means hiring a million moderators to check their content, weeding out lies and hate, then so be it. They can hardly cry poverty: these are close to trillion-dollar companies.If they don’t like the analogy with publishers, then perhaps they’d rather be treated like, say, car manufacturers, who, if found to be delivering a dangerously faulty product, have to recall and fix that product, regardless of the expense. At the moment, the social media giants enjoy legal protection from such liability in the US.Politicians could change that, just as they could follow Howard’s demands in Lie Machines and break the big companies’ “monopolisation of information” by legislating a citizens’ right to donate their own data to smaller organisations: that way such groups would be more able to compete with the tech giants and those able to pay for their services.But, as this week’s hearing proved, elected representatives are not powerful enough to do that alone. They’d have to work together, governments across the globe. They’d need the backing of advertisers, withdrawing their pounds and dollars from companies that give a platform to hate. And they’d need all of us to declare we’re sick of this poison in the information bloodstream, and we won’t rest till it’s drained away."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/02ff8bf7753432a0fa6e9d4fd4935593074887e8/0_267_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTQucG5n\u0026s=32fd0db21f09d80298e7bc80b7b545f6","title":"sgroppino recipe cocktail lemon sorbet italicus tavolino london","story":"This classic Italian sorbet-based refresher works as aperitif, palate cleanser, after-dinner treat or even pudding in its own right, so take your pickSgroppino can be traced back as far as the 1500s, when it was served as a palate cleanser between courses at aristocratic Venetian dinners.

It’s not a particularly fashionable viewpoint, granted, but to hell with the pinch-faced cognoscenti! The Fiver is already lost in a reverie of all those famous finals from the competition’s heyday, like when Sunderland beat Nasty Leeds 1-0, or Southampton beat Manchester United 1-0, or Ipswich beat Arsenal 1-0, or Spurs beat QPR 1-0, or Wimbledon beat Liverpool 1-0. Ah misty water-coloured memories of a time when the sun always shone, the whole nation watched on, and Rizla had a surprisingly strong brand presence on the pitchside hoardings.But times change, and new government legislation means you’re no longer allowed to shill speciality papers designed for the careful construction of stalemate-enhancing McCartney Cheroots. We’re pretty sure other legislation has been passed as well, enshrining by law the presence of at least one of Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester City or United at every single bloody final. That would explain why this has happened every year since Portsmouth took on Cardiff in 2008 – another 1-0 masterpiece seared on the memory – though if it’s not true and there’s been no new edict, something might have gone very, very, very wrong with modern football. Wah! Let’s hope we were right first time, eh kids?Another thing that will certainly remain constant on Saturday: it’ll be lovely and sunny, just like in the old days. And as hazy summer beams stream across the Wembley turf, Arsenal and Frank Lampard’s Chelsea will contest English football’s showpiece occasion for the second time in four seasons, and the third since 2002. Arsenal have won all three of those previous meetings, though Chelsea will take plenty of heart from the 4-1 skelping they gave the Gunners in last year’s Big Vase final, even if the man of the match in Baku, Eden Hazard, is long gone, and it’s now FLC’s Frank Lampard coaching their defence.The Blues go into the match as slight favourites, though while The Fiver has no dog in this race, we’re kind of hoping the Gunners will prevail, simply because Lamps is more likely than his opposite number Mikel Arteta to have a highly entertaining full-blown pitch-side tantrum. The Fiver’s brave prediction, then, because despite the state of those back lines, it’s the FA Cup final isn’t it: 1-0. To Chelsea.

Whatever your trade, glowing reviews are good for business.But since setting up Surrey Hills Handyman in 2016, Lingard has sought to gain further advantage, using Google My Business, a free tool for businesses to manage their online presence across Google services. The tool helps him display his five-star ratings and the favourable reviews he has earned on his online profile, which – alongside the use of Google ads to reach new customers – have helped him grow his business exactly how he wants. Like word of mouth, in digital form.Four years on, Lingard can afford to be choosier. He specialises in “all the little jobs” that people often can’t find someone to do or don’t have time for themselves, focusing on quality, not quantity, “like bits of tiling or installing kitchen splashbacks, putting up picture hooks or fitting doorbells”.It’s here that promoting himself through Google tools has really paid off, taking on greater importance in recent months. Lingard had already taken to using Google ads, using keyword research to help find out what prospective clients were searching for online in and around Guildford – for instance, jet-washing a patio during the summer months – and then advertising those specific skills. This ability to be flexible and fleet of foot has had a significant impact on his business – “It’s quick, effective and direct,” he says – but really came into its own following the lockdown, when he was able to swiftly angle his remit as a “contactless service” in order to address customer fears around social distancing.Meanwhile, his Google My Business profile has helped him to keep existing customers updated with his working hours, while the review rating builds his reputation and earns trust with new ones. Lingard says Google also enables him to concentrate on the job at hand rather than tying himself up fielding calls asking what jobs he can do – the photos on Google My Business help showcase this to prospective customers. Even with the unpredictability of the future, given the pandemic, there is significant potential for tradespeople like Lingard to grow their businesses as households contend with the crisis. Homeowners have had more time to contemplate their surroundings, while a growing number of the UK workforce expect a permanent change to their company’s approach to flexible working post-lockdown. It means many homes and gardens will require improvements. Lingard’s Google profile, for example, flags up his skills at assembling flatpack office furniture.At a time when the wider job market looks uncertain, Lingard reveals that he is booked up six weeks in advance. “In a time of social upheaval and economic downturn such as this, demand for my services could have dwindled to nothing, but I’ve even been able to turn work away,” he says. “Google My Business has been central to me weathering the storm and future-proofing myself.”To find out how Google can help your business adapt, visit: g.cosmallbusiness"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1de80d6c88b6832010edf537da5c49bf9a1ad0f/0_183_5433_3259/master/5433.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=677e4bdfb22ec11f5cb79f5c4f0cc39a","title":"couples in england coronavirus are you planning on getting married at the start of august","story":"We would like to hear from those who have to change their plans due to coronavirus guidance from the governmentWith less than 24 hours notice, Boris Johnson has announced that the government is postponing the easing of lockdown measures which, from tomorrow, would have allowed couples getting married to have a reception with up to 30 people.  would like to hear from people getting married this weekend who were planning to have a reception but have now been told they are not allowed to.

I don’t know their families. I don’t trust them and you shouldn’t either.”But it wasn’t long before my fear of Mum online became my fear for her. It began when she joined Facebook, and went on to post one too many earnest-mum comments (“My daughter is so beautiful!” she’d write under every picture). I showed her how to message me directly instead.At that moment I stepped into the role I remain in today: tech support. I am her Sherpa for the digital world.

She said she would postpone taking her seat in the Lords until March, when she will quit her Holyrood seat of Edinburgh Central before the Scottish parliament election in May.A senior party source said the Conservatives believed Panelbase’s results were accurate and that put the future of the UK in peril. The Scottish party believes a large part of their challenge is countering deep antipathy towards Boris Johnson among potential Tory voters in Scotland.His backers believe Ross can counter attacks that he will be controlled by No 10 by pointing out he was the first UK government minister to resign in protest over the decision by Dominic Cummings and his wife to travel to Durham during lockdown while they were ill with Covid-19 symptoms.In his statement on Friday confirming he planned to stand, Ross said: “This is a crucial time in Scottish politics. We are months away from an important election, and need strong, decisive leadership of our party to take on and defeat the SNP in seats right across the country.“Scotland is an integral part of the United Kingdom and that’s a relationship I want to maintain and improve. Under my leadership, this will be an absolute priority.”In a move likely to provoke opposition attacks about being a part-timer, Ross will seek a seat at Holyrood in the 2021 Scottish parliamentary election but is expected to stay on as MP for Moray. The Tories will cite Alex Salmond’s decision to remain an MP after winning a Holyrood seat in 2007, when he became first minister.Davidson said several other Holyrood party leaders, including her predecessor as Scottish Tory leader, Annabel Goldie, and former Labour first minister Jack McConnell, had taken peerages. She tried to forestall attacks on her decision to move to the Lords by insisting it had a significant political and constitutional role.“As a chamber dedicated to scrutinising and revising legislation, the upper house is stronger when it includes a range of voices with experience from different jobs, backgrounds, specialities and parliaments across the UK, and I believe I can make a contribution to its work,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c16acc9f9bb7fe7b4d5ba188e1be8afa0418e53b/0_13_800_480/master/800.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=30bba58f77f06b035ca196fe33fa1bc8","title":"you cant just accept it the sporty 80 year old who wont take bladder weakness lying down","story":"As a busy magazine editor, remembering to do pelvic floor exercises wasn’t always the first thing on Wendy James’s mind. Now, aged 80, she explains why she’s making time for them, alongside regular tennis and core-strengthening pilatesThe card dropped through the letterbox just as I was leaving for my regular coaching session at the tennis club. “Welcome to your ninth decade,” it said. I’d just turned 80 and was planning to celebrate by doing a tandem skye for a local charity.I wasn’t shocked by the card’s message (no, really). I was prepared by the good-ageing philosophy of a thoughtful man called Cecil Kellehar who was fourscore years when he wrote for Choice, the lifestyle magazine for over-50s that I edited in the 1990s. Take it as it comes. Don’t rail against it. Have someone to love. Have something to do. Have something to look forward to. Keep fit.The last one’s easy: I’ve played tennis since I was 10 and do so three times a week if I can. I’d even been asked to join an over-75s group playing indoors every week. Covid-19 and the lockdown ended that, as well as something else I was really looking forward to: jumping out of a plane. Meanwhile, I’m in a weekly Zoom choir and we happily sing out to our heart’s content.I’ve got a husband and family (at a distance) to love and I’m always writing (journalists are like that), so that is certainly something to do. Emailing my MP about doing more to erase the inequalities revealed by the pandemic keeps me occupied.“Take it as it comes”, was my dad’s philosophy too. But sometimes you just can’t accept what life throws at you. Incontinence, for instance. Reading Miriam Margolyes’ frank account of hanging on to her pee, I related instinctively. We all know if you laugh for too long you can leak!But why on earth should it happen? Why is it so commonplace? At the end of the 1960s, after I’d had my two daughters, the health visitor encouraged me to do pelvic floor exercises daily. But I was a full-time working mother with a mortgage, and life went at such a speed that I never paid enough attention to my own body. When my son arrived in the mid 1970s, living pace was even faster – and tennis was put on hold.By the mid 1980s, I was back on the court, expending energy and eradicating angst built up from working long hours on women’s magazines. Fashion, beauty makeovers and diets, Princess Diana and Fergie, royal gardens and fabulous knitting patterns kept me occupied. It was a strange time. My periods were all over the place, as were my emotions – and I was putting on weight.It’s marvellous that we talk freely about women’s health today and it’s easier to find a sympathetic ear and a wealth of options to deal with oestrogen deficiency and menstrual problems. My heart went out to British tennis player Heather Watson whose performance in an important tournament was affected by the time of the month. Now you can avoid periods entirely if you want, with no ill effects – certainly no red or wet patches on tennis whites.My solution was twice-yearly HRT implants, which kept me stable until the 1990s, when I unexpectedly started leaking urine. My GP said my bladder had prolapsed, dropped down into my vagina, so I began doing pelvic floor exercises with a vengeance. I was inspired by Diana Moran, the Green Goddess, who created a range of keep-fit exercises for Choice. She made it all look so easy!At 60, I retired, just after the second of my older sisters died of ovarian cancer. Fearing this would be my fate, too, I used some pension money to go private to remove my womb and ovaries – and had a bladder “lift”. Fortunately, it didn’t involve the mesh, which has been devastating for many and is now banned. Mine was just a stitch, my surgeon said.For 10 years, every Saturday morning I attended a pilates class – our lovely instructor Lidia helped us focus on strengthening the core: making the abdomen and back muscles stronger helps your pelvic floor muscles to control the bladder. We lay on our backs, breathing deeply in and out as we lowered first one leg then the other to the side, eight to 10 times.I kick myself that I didn’t continue with pilates after we moved to the country. The wee problems recurred and I was back to wearing pads. Things improved a little when my GP suspected vaginal atrophy – caused by lack of oestrogen – and prescribed Vagifem, oestradiol tablets inserted like a pessary.Despite all this, I found I still often make an urgent dash for the loo. As a consumer journalist for more than 45 years, I’m always looking for ways to make things better. Panties with integral pads are useful, as accidents are contained. I bought a Kegel8 Ultra 20 electronic pelvic toner, a device with a spoon-like object that goes into the vagina. It was difficult to lie down for half an hour a day with this in place, and I discovered the prolapse was back. This doesn’t happen to everyone, I hasten to say.Then I read about Finnish Innovotherapy, a non-invasive training method using specially designed shorts and electrodes to generate contractions of the muscles. Five days a week, 30 minutes a day over 12 weeks certainly improved my awareness of my pelvic floor and the leaking lessened. It was a costly remedy: I bought it over six months, interest free. It may not be a realistic option for everyone – and you still have to do exercises.One thing I’ve learned about myself is that I need to be given instructions, and having downloaded MyPFF app onto my iPad I squeeze and breathe to order. And there’s new hope: I came across Alex Miller, a Canadian fitness trainer, who believes she has found why our pelvic floor muscles lose their ability to work properly. As we age, we slump! Do you notice yourself hunching over – when you’re using a laptop, driving, sitting at the table or in an armchair. Instead of being upright, our head and chin go forward, as does the abdomen. Raise your shoulders and chin, bring your head back and your body is properly aligned.Her combination of pilates and yoga exercises have shown me the error of my ways. I sit up straight, hold my tummy muscles in, breathing deeply in and out, and try to remember to use MyPFF app every day. When Covid-19 is gone, I’ll be ready to jump out of the plane – wearing a parachute, and hopefully no pad!As incontinence affects one in three women over 35, we should all be having more open conversations about this everyday condition that impacts women of all ages.

We have seen this occur across the globe as countries begin to see demand slowly returning to the hospitality sector,” said the STR director Thomas Emanuel, adding that it would take “multiple years” for urban demand to return to 2019 levels.While many had reopened, city hotels were still struggling as numerous nearby attractions and events venues remained closed, said Jane Pendlebury, chair of the Hospitality Professionals Association. And fears of travelling on public transport still loomed large.“We’ve seen coastal hotels and those in traditionally popular destinations, such as the Lake District, enjoy a bumper few weeks as UK-based travellers look to escape post-lockdown,” she said. “The picture has been far from rosy for other operators.”“Outdoor holidays have exploded in popularity this year, with one booked every three seconds on our website,” said Pitchup’s founder Dan Yates, pointing out that a popup campsite in the Lake District that went live last week took over 600 bookings within days. “In the words of the deputy chief medical officer, it’s a ‘biological truism’ that outdoor environments are safer than those indoors.”Demand on campsites is running at treble the normal levels and availability is extremely limited for week-long breaks next month in Devon, Cornwall and other popular counties. Bookings are also treble that of the same time last year on the Cool Camping website, and sales of camper vans have also reportedly risen significantly.“I always think that the best memories are created doing something new,” said the campsites founder Martin Smith. “With around 100 counties in the UK – and each one offering something a little bit different to the last – you can travel and still avoid the crowds this summer. Wherever you go, a few nights under the stars is good for the soul.”The growing popularity of camping seems unlikely to abate after 41 flights to Spain from Stansted, East Midlands and Manchester airports alone were cancelled between Sunday and Wednesday.The package holiday provider Travel Republic confirmed it was forced to cancel several thousand bookings over the next two weeks. All Tui holidays have been cancelled until 17 August for mainland Spain and until 10 August for the Balearics and Canaries.“We’re now doing everything we can to support those affected,” a Travel Republic spokesperson said. Jet2, which has asked some holidaymakers on Spain’s islands to cut short their breaks, did not respond to requests for comment.The Visit Yorkshire chief executive, James Mason, said people were discovering a “new-found appreciation of what’s on their doorsteps” after months of lockdown, as he praised his county’s ersity and beauty.“In our pretty market towns we have some of the best seafood in the country, then travel inland and you could be in the wilderness of one of our three national parks.”Fran Tham, 76, from just outside Cardiff, will have her first caravanning holiday this summer in three decades. “We’re not caravan people but I’m excited to see the family and have a barbecue,” she said of her plan to see her daughter in her new caravan in Suffolk.“It’s a low-key holiday but it feels like a big step as we are in our 70s and have been very careful in lockdown. We would have gone to Tenerife to stay with friends but we don’t want to fly now.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3e5197993804c6162fc329e33640cdf107117690/0_86_3072_1843/master/3072.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=55be248f264495f8d5aff7c9b359ef71","title":"politicians face masks winners and losers in pictures coronavirus","story":"Even Donald Trump and Jair Bolsonaro have accepted that wearing a face covering in return for saving thousands of lives works. But who nailed the look – and who was left with egg on their face?Most politicians – indeed, most adults – have come round to the idea that putting up with having a bit of fabric on your face in exchange for saving thousands of lives is a good deal. (Except for Ann Widdecombe, who is continuing to be Ann Widdecombe.)There were numerous examples of politicians, many of whom are the actual leaders of their nations, struggling to put a mask on. Given that most now have read the memo that there’s a raging pandemic, here’s how the political mask scene is looking.Trump’s mask is a rather smart one, with the White House logo on it. Presumably, this is: a) so he can find his way home, and b) because he may only have a matter of months left there, and he wants to make the most of it. I am not convinced he will leave the White House even if he is voted out, though. (I’m also not convinced he will be voted out, but that’s another piece.)The technical term for the above photograph is: A Vibe. Here we have the first minister of Scotland with her new look while literally posing in New Look. This is a photo op with an on-brand tartan mask to signal the reopening of Scotland’s high streets. But there’s also a touch of Succession-esque ballsiness, with a hint of fashion week and a shade of the first week of The Apprentice. There’s a woman on the left who has got the knee-flash down pat, but nothing is taking away from Sturgeon’s moment here. Shout out to the woman second from the left whose mask appears to be covering her entire face it’s almost a balaclava.Just imagine, for a second, being so ill that you have need of an ambulance. That you are in an ambulance, very sick indeed. Then imagine Boris Johnson leering around the corner at you wearing his blue mask, which he has managed to make look like a corner-shop carrier bag hooked over his ears. Which, granted, could be seen as an improvement. Incidentally, the ambulance in the picture could well be one of the private ones the NHS spent £92m on last year. I honestly would be surprised if the password for his computer wasn’t creepingprivatisation123.This is Brazil’s president. Brazil is second only to the US in terms of the number of people who have died – it has surpassed 90,000 – but Bolsonaro has described the virus as “a little flu”. His hobbies, until recently, included going to anti-lockdown rallies, mask-free – until the country’s legislative body ruled that all Brazilians have to wear masks in open spaces, and the president was not exempt. (He has attempted to dilute the laws since.)I can’t even openly laugh at Michael Gove here, which is a first, because I have also suffered the indignity of clouded spectacles when wearing a mask. A tip, though: place the glasses frame on top of the mask, to keep it airtight. Here, Gove (for international readers: Gove is part of the British government, serving as the chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, which isn’t worth explaining) wears a rainbow-embossed mask – a nod to the NHS. Gove said that wearing a mask in shops was “basic good manners” and he trusted people to exercise “common sense”. He was then photographed in Pret a Manger without a mask. Common sense has never been Gove’s strong point.I, too, thought this was an advertisement from the Cornwall tourist board. It is, in fact, a photograph of the Labour leader posted on Twitter. Quite apart from the beautiful sea and sky, and Keir’s dreamy far-off look, what I enjoy about this portrait is imagining how it was taken: the photographer repeatedly saying “excuse me” as they made an absolute nuisance of themselves in the aisle, narrowly avoiding decking people with a lens bag and holding up the drinks trolley by 10 minutes. The other thing of note is the table. Not a single empty Wispa wrapper. No wooden stirrer splattered with milk. Can we relate to someone who hasn’t paid £4.99 for an egg-and-cress sandwich a week past its sell-by date? Time will tell.I couldn’t find a picture of India’s prime minister wearing a mask, which rather seems a mistake when his country has the fastest-rising number of Covid-19 cases in the world. To be fair, India has infrastructure problems, which has meant it is starting at a disadvantage to other nations. Modi apologised for a rise in homelessness and food poverty as a result of his rapid and draconian lockdown strategy. But since then, he has reverted to his usual self, saying that India’s response to the pandemic has “defied global expectations”. Anyway, here’s a dude wearing a mask with a photograph of Modi on it, showing his support for an awful job well done.This is how I imagine the studious Angela Merkel was in school, patiently waiting with her hand up to give the correct answer, and possibly even anticipating the next question. It’s how I imagine Merkel timidly asking her teammate in netball for the ball, absolutely not wanting it at all. It was never in doubt that the German chancellor would get behind masks, because she is a former scientist. I’m pretty sure she could deliver a moving speech on the unity of masks and how they are an opportunity to bring us all together as we fight for a better Europe.Word is that Priti Patel keeps wearing a mask outdoors, and then taking it off indoors, which is so stupid that it is entirely in keeping with what I assume Patel would do. Here, the home secretary stands, arms crossed, taking the same pose as French interior minister, Gérald Darmanin, with French police, who she no doubt referred to as “plees”, because that is how politicians always pronounce police. (I don’t know either, but show me one who doesn’t.) Here we have the president of Poland, Andrzej Duda, and his wife, Agata Kornhauser-Duda, casting their ballots in the presidential election earlier this month. Kornhauser-Duda has gone for an on-brand red-and-white combo – the colours of the Polish flag. Her husband presumably didn’t have time to consider such sartorial matters because he was campaigning to rip away the rights of LGBT people. Which worked, incidentally, because he has been re-elected. It’s a bit like how Mark Zuckerberg says he wears the same T-shirt every day because choosing an outfit would distract from his focus: which is turning the world into a fake-news, surveillance-hell trash fire. I’m paraphrasing, but only a little.Competent Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, reporting for duty the one person in the government who seems to have a basic level of proficiency. Sunak, when approaching a lectern, doesn’t suck all of the optimism out of a room. Here, Competent Rishi is wearing a mask with a valve a mask that, according to scientists, is more harmful than not wearing one at all, and has been banned in many countries. Oh, Rishi, you had a good run. Except for the freelancers, who would very much argue that you didn’t.The French president there, wearing his mask. Brigitte Macron absolutely not wearing a mask. Do you think Brigitte is going to wear a mask? Have you met Brigitte? Brigitte will be wearing shoulder pads eight times the width of her knees she’ll be wearing shades that protect her from the blinding light of her own teeth, thank you very much. Do you think – for even a second – that Brigitte is going mask-shopping when she’s in the middle of more important things, like hanging out with Rihanna? If you think Brigitte is going to detract for even a second from being the best-dressed first lady in politics you are wrong.Finally, the Chinese president wearing a flattering teal number. This colour hovers somewhere between hospital scrubs and the Males, but I assume he’s going for the former. Mostly, I don’t want to think about the Males because it seems as if far-flung beach holidays are a long way off. I am having to stay put in a country in which a “culture war” has erupted over a bit of fabric (and not for the first time: see the niqab). I do not like wearing masks because I find them claustrophobic. But I also do not like mass death. Hmm, it’s a tricky one. But, and good God, I hate to say it: I now have something in common with Trump and Johnson."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c789718798e381c19d7a9e30f07c0feaf1955b06/0_131_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b3e1f17f6718e4dd407ead9118d33164","title":"what new lockdown rules northern england coronavirus measures","story":"All you need to know about the updated coronavirus measures affecting more than 4m people More than 4 million people across swathes of northern England were given less than three hours’ notice on Thursday night that they must endure tighter lockdown restrictions to stem a resurgence of Covid-19 cases.But what what exactly do the new measures mean for those living in affected areas in the north and elsewhere in England?Greater Manchester, including the City of Manchester, Trafford, Stockport, Oldham, Bury, Wigan, Bolton, Tameside, Rochdale and Salford. In Lancashire, affected areas include Blackburn with Darwen, Burnley, Hyndburn, Pendle and Rossendale. Bradford, Calderdale and Kirkless, in West Yorkshire, are also included.The government says people living in the highlighted areas are not allowed to meet other people they do not live with inside a private home or garden. Exemptions apply where people have formed support bubbles or for “other limited exemptions to be specified by law”. Published guidance also states that if people live in the affected places they should not visit other people’s properties or gardens outside the areas with additional lockdown restrictions.Pubs, restaurants, cafes and gyms remain open in the affected areas but people are being told not to socialise with other households in these settings. New laws passed by the government will enforce the restrictions on people meeting in private homes and gardens, meaning to do so will be illegal unless an exemption applies. The police will be able to issue fixed-penalty notices of up to £100 to those who breach the rules.The guidance on meeting people in public outdoor spaces in the affected areas remains the same, in line with the rest of England. People can meet outside in groups of no more than six people, unless the group includes only people from two households. Social distancing must be maintained with those who do not live together in households, unless they are in the same support bubble.Yes, people living inside and outside the affected areas can continue to travel to and from work.From 1 August, clinically extremely vulnerable people do not have to follow shielding guidance “unless they live in Blackburn with Darwen in the north-west and other local affected areas across England where shielding continues”. But people are being told not to visit family or friends in care homes, unless in exceptional circumstances.Weddings, civil partnership ceremonies and funerals in affected areas are allowed but must be limited to no more than 30 people. People are also allowed to travel to the affected areas for these ceremonies. Places of worship are open to visitors but people must socially distance from other households, as well as take extra care, such as by wearing face coverings, and the government recommends religious services take place outdoors, if possible.People in the affected areas should not visit or host friends or family in private homes or gardens, the government says, nor should they meet and mix in restaurants or cafes. Two households, or up to six people from different households, may meet outdoors in public spaces but social distancing must be maintained for those who do not live together.People may attend mosques but social distancing must be maintained between households. “This means maintaining a distance of 2 metres, or 1 metre with mitigations (such as wearing face coverings). We recommend at this time that, if possible, prayerreligious services take place outdoors,” government guidance states.In Blackburn with Darwen, where lockdown easing was paused this month, indoor facilities including gyms, fitness and dance studios, sports courts, swimming pools and water parks remain closed by law. The same measures apply to Bradford. Leicester city, which was already facing tighter lockdown restrictions, is also included in the measures restricting household visits, although pubs and restaurants there are still due to reopen from Monday as planned. In Luton, temporary restrictions will be lifted from Saturday to bring it in line with the rest of England after the government said “significant progress has been made in controlling the virus”.Outside of the affected areas, the  lockdown guidance remains the same for the rest of England. People are allowed to meet in groups of two households in any location, including inside private homes, but social distancing must be maintained between those who do not live together unless they are in the same support bubble. So-called support bubbles, which allow single adult households to mix without social distancing with one other household they do not live with, are counted as a single household. Outdoors, up to six people from different households can meet. Households are also allowed to stay away from their homes with one other household, but social distancing must be observed. It is against the law for gatherings of more than 30 people to take place in private homes. Businesses can host larger groups providing they follow Covid-19 secure guidelines."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cdfd3f9f3b965a8aafc02b215267d384115ab0f1/0_369_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=749ed6e948b71063a8fe96ebef48e0e8","title":"coronavirus live news england tightens restrictions who says young people behind some spikes","story":"France confirms ‘marked increase’ in cases Vietnam records first Covid-19 death Tokyo sees new daily record cases numbers climb in Spain, Germany and RussiaGreece has announced another extension to the end of August of a controversial lockdown on its overcrowded migrant camps as infections in the country pick up.The lockdown on camps introduced in March will now be extended until August 31 “to prevent the emergence and dispersal of coronavirus cases,” the migration ministry said in a statement.Greece, with 203 Covid-19 deaths, has so far not been as badly hit as many other European countries - and there have been no deaths in the migrant camps, AFP reports. But the presence of more than 26,000 asylum seekers on the five Aegean islands - in camps with capacity of under 6,100 - has caused major friction with local communities.The reopening of Greek airports and borders to tourism, accompanied by the removal of lockdown restrictions for the general population, has led to an increase in cases.Here’s a summary of the latest coronavirus developments:Muslims, wearing protective masks as a precaution against infection from coronavirus today gathered for the Eid al-Adha prayer inside the Byzantine-era Hagia Sophia, recently converted back to a mosque, in the historic Sultanahmet district of Istanbul.India’s Bihar state is battling the twin treat of the coronavirus and devastating monsoon floods, AP reports.The floods have swamped large parts of the densely populated state and displaced more than 300,000 people as of Friday.Every year the state faces flooding by rivers originating in neighbouring Nepal that affects millions, but doctors and experts said the bigger worry this year is the rapidly spreading coronavirus. So far, Bihar has recorded 48,197 cases including 282 deaths. Thats a far lower death toll than other densely populated states that are witnessing a sharp rise in cases, but with experts warning of multiple peaks in India, Bihar could be facing an uphill task to halt the virus.The World Health Organization recommends one doctor for at least 1,000 people, but in Bihar, the ratio is about one for every 17,000.The state is also falling short on testing and has only recently increased daily testing capacity from 10,000 to over 14,000.Lithuania said it will impose a two-week quarantine on travellers arriving from France starting Monday after a surge in coronavirus cases there, AFP reports.The Baltic state’s chief epidemiologist Loreta Asokliene told reporters Friday that France is the latest addition to a Lithuanian list of countries that have seen at least 16 new confirmed coronavirus cases per 100,000 people over the last two weeks. The updated “black list” requiring all incoming travellers, including Lithuanian citizens, to self-isolate for two weeks will include 12 EU member states as of Monday, she added.The others are Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Luxembourg, Malta, Portugal, Romania, Spain and Sweden.France’s seven-day average of new Covid-19 cases has risen above the 1,000 threshold for the first time since the first half of May, when it eased its lockdown.French health authorities reported 1,377 additional confirmed cases of coronavirus on Thursday, one day after identifying 21 new clusters, bringing the total to 147.People who had visited Italy accounted for more than a quarter of the first reported cases of the new coronavirus outside China, according to a new study that found most initial infections were linked to just three countries, AFP reports.Researchers from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention used publicly-available data to trace the early spread of Covid-19 to dozens of affected countries in the 11 weeks before the World Health Organisation declared it a pandemic.They found that 27 percent of all the first reported cases were people with travel links to Italy, while 22 percent had been to China and 11 percent had travelled from Iran. The study, which was published in the journal The Lancet Infectious Diseases this week, found that overall three quarters of the first cases in affected countries were linked to recent travel.Other initial cases were travellers from Southeast Asia, Europe, Africa and the Americas.Researchers examined online reports from health ministries and other government agency websites, social media feeds, and press releases for information on first cases and early outbreaks. Germany has added three northern Spanish regions to its list of high-risk destinations, meaning anyone arriving from those areas will have to produce a negative coronavirus test or go into quarantine for 14 days.Germany’s foreign ministry said it had toughened up its warning against travel to the regions of Catalonia, Navarre and Aragon following a spike in COVID-19 cases there.The move comes after Germany’s Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for disease control added the three regions to its high-risk list.“A mandatory quarantine can only be avoided through a negative COVID-19 test,” the ministry said.The ministry had on Tuesday already advised against non-essential travel to the three regions but Friday’s tightened restrictions underline the growing alarm about returning holidaymakers bringing the virus back with them, AFP reports. The affected regions include the tourist hotspots of Barcelona and the beaches of the Costa Brava.The restrictions imposed under the state of emergency, which began in mid-March, were only gradually lifted in May and June.The Hong Kong government has postponed its upcoming elections for one year, citing the growing coronavirus outbreak in the city but sparking immediate accusations that the pandemic was being used as a pretext to suppress democracy.The city’s leader, chief executive Carrie Lam, announced on Friday she had invoked emergency regulations to delay the 6 September vote, saying it was the “hardest decision I have made in the past seven months”.“The Legco election is held once every four years and it’s a really tough decision to delay it but we want to ensure public safety and health, and we want to make sure the elections are held in an open fair and impartial manner,” Lam said.She said the Chinese central government supported the decision.The government’s consideration of a postponement was leaked earlier this week, and was labeled an “assault on fundamental freedoms” amid growing Beijing control over the semi-autonomous region, and coming a day after 12 pro-democracy candidates were disqualified from running.The potential postponement has sparked fury from opposition and pro-democracy groups.On Friday afternoon, a coalition of pro-democracy legislators accused the government of using the pandemic to delay an election they were looking like losing.Here is the ’s report on Boris Johnson’s postponement of lockdown easing in England.Thousands of demonstrators are expected to gather in Berlin at the weekend to protest against restrictions introduced to dampen the spread of coronavirus.Under the umbrella title ‘End of the pandemic – the Day of Freedom’ erse groups from the extreme left and right, including anti-vaxers, Holocaust deniers, and conspiracy theorists who believe the virus has been imposed by an elite in order to gain power, are due to hold dozens of inidual protests across the German capital.Police and lawmakers have urged participants to observe physical distancing rules and to wear face coverings, amid evidence that the frequency of the virus is increasing once again.Among the demonstrators, one group has suggested ‘storming the Reichstag’, the German parliament building. Others have rejected the idea, arguing it could bring the entire demonstration into disrepute. Over 1500 police are expected to be on duty, with around 22,000 protesters due to take part from across Germany, according to Berlin’s interior ministry.The main gathering is expected to take place at the Brandenburg Gate in the centre of Berlin, before participants march down the wide ‘17. Juni’ boulevard to the Victory column. Other protests are planned for elsewhere in the city.The anti-coronavirus restriction demonstrators had been thought to be in decline since Germany began to gradually relaxed its lockdown rules, after reducing the number of active infections.But parts of what is meanwhile being viewed an established scene, drawing in a range of interest groups, including followers of the elusive US group QAnon -an online conspiracy theory cult focused on the idea of a “deep state” dominance, one of whose heroes is US president Donald Trump, or the alliance ‘Querdenken’ (‘lateral thinking’) whose followers sport tin foil pendants and are against a coronavirus vaccine – have gained more traction the longer the pandemic has continued. Its sympathisers have used social media to gain support. This weekend’s events are supposed to mark the first time the various groups will actively, rather than accidentally, come together.One of its figureheads, a celebrity vegan cook called Attila Hildmann, has been banned from speaking at the rally due to the defamatory, far-right rhetoric he has used at previous protests.Nikolai Nerling, a prominent Holocaust denier, who broadcasts his views on YouTube, is expected to be present. The far-right NPD has also announced it will participate.One of the protesters’ broad demands is for the German parliament to call new elections in September, a year ahead of schedule, so that voters have the opportunity to bring down what is referred to as the “corona emergency government” of chancellor Angela Merkel.UK prime minister Boris Johnson has announced he will reverse a decision to relax a range of lockdown measures due to come into force in England on Saturday, including cancelling plans to allow a full range of beauty treatments. The further easing of lockdown restrictions in England that were due on 1 August for higher risk settings, including allowing small wedding receptions and the reopening of bowling alleys, skating rinks and casinos, has been postponed for at least two weeks, he said.Indoor performances will not resume, pilots of crowds in sports centres will not take place, and wedding receptions of more than 30 people will not be permitted, he added.His announcement follows that to tighten restrictions in parts of the north of England as part of targeted measures.Full details from his press conference can be found here:Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said today that the government will postpone highly anticipated legislative elections, citing a worsening coronavirus outbreak in the semi-autonomous Chinese city, AP reports. The Hong Kong government is invoking an emergency regulations ordinance in delaying the elections. Lam said the government has the support of the Chinese government in making the decision.Hong Kong has seen a surge in infections since the beginning of July.The postponement is a setback for the opposition, which was hoping to capitalise on disenchantment with the current pro-Beijing majority to make gains.Pro-democracy lawmakers have accused the government of using the outbreak as an excuse to delay the elections.In India, a vendor sprays sanitiser as a preventive measure against the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus on ‘rakhis’ (sacred thread) at his shop ahead of the annual Hindu festival ‘Raksha Bandhan’, in Hyderabad The Raksha Bandhan festival is marked by a simple ceremony in which sisters tie sacred threads known as ‘rakhi’ on their brothers’ wrists as a prayer for their prosperity and happiness.Japan has signed a deal to secure 120m doses of a potential coronavirus vaccine, the German pharmaceutical group BioNTech, which is developing the drug with US pharma giant Pfizer, said today.Financial details of the deal were not disclosed, with BioNTech saying the terms were based on the timing of the delivery and volume of doses, AFP reports. But an agreement announced recently between the labs and the US put the price of 100m doses of the potential vaccine at almost $2bn.First deliveries to Japan are planned for the first half of 2021, added the Mainz-based company.More than 200 candidate vaccines are being developed around the world with roughly two dozen at the stage of clinical trials with human volunteers.In Texas, hurricane season means preparing for one natural disaster in the middle of another, Erum Salam reports from Houston. On a recent weekend in Houston, hundreds of people thronged a local Home Depot, buying plywood, bags of sand and gallons of water. They were getting supplies – not for a quarantine DIY project – but rather purchasing materials to protect their homes during hurricane season.It is a yearly ritual in Texas, but 2020 is different. Not only is America facing an unusually active hurricane season – Texas has been hit once already – but the coronavirus pandemic looms over the state’s preparations.Covid-19 definitely presents a challenge. Hurricane shelters need good ventilation, and to be able to enforce social distancing.“Reflecting the economic impact of the pandemic, the Portuguese Gross Domestic Product (GDP) registered a strong contraction in the second quarter of 2020,” Statistics Portugal said in a statement.It said domestic demand, both in private consumption and investment, were the main drivers of the drop in GDP.Portugal is also heavily dependent upon tourism, and Statistics Portugal pointed out that “non-residents tourism (was) almost … interrupted” by the restrictions on international travel and lockdowns."},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Coalition will have to devise new plan following ruling of seven-judge courtHard data indicating scale of impact likely to be far greater than unreliable past forecastsProjections show flooding could have far-reaching negative effects globally by 2100"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Michael Viney: Irish numbers have more than doubled since the counts of Operation Seafarer in 1970Michael Viney: A predator denning in parks, gardens and wasteland gets mixed responsesA beefed-up, independent National Parks and Wildlife Service would be just the ticketMichael Viney: Wild grasses have loved the mood swings of our climate this yearAnother Life: As one of many of the world\u0026rsquos declining seabirds, puffins are now receiving much more necessary and serious attentionAnother Life: A new book on the founders of the Tyler Prize shows their political influenceAvian science journal Ibis reports \u0026lsquogreat conservation concern\u0026rsquo about the speciesAnother Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?Greater industry involvement required if bovine TB to be eliminated by 2030 targetMichael Viney: Camera traps are now used as a regular part of hare monitoringMarine life with very specific habitat needs threatened in the face of sweeping changeThree terrapins as pets seems a bit ambitious considering their needs"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4318692.1596198547!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"trinity college lawns dug up to make room for wild flowers","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Lawns being removed from the front entrance at Trinity College. Photograph Nick BradshawThe manicured lawns at the front entrance at Trinity College Dublin have been removed and are about to be transformed into a wildflower meadow in response to Ireland’s “bioersity crisis”.First announced in February, the move which make islands of the famous twin statues of Edmund Burke and Oliver Goldsmith, brings to an end to 150 years of grass cutting, which made the lawns at the front of the college as smooth as a cricket pitch.The conversion into a bee-friendly, wild-flower meadow began in recent days after the public overwhelmingly backed the move in an online poll in April.Of almost 14,000 votes, 12,500 were in favour of replanting the front of the university which faces onto College Green.Prof John Parnell, chair of Trinity’s grounds and gardens committee, said the results sent a message that “people want to see more bioersity and in particular want institutions to set an example”.Though the area may end up looking less tidy, supporters of the idea say it will be an important reminder of what wild nature looks like.Research shows lawn-mowing, ground preparation and pesticide control can disturb important insects that feed and nest in the soil.Planting wild flowers and minimising interference supports bioersity, and provide a habitat for native insects and food for pollinators in the city centre.The plants will a mix of annuals and perennials, with as many of them being of known Irish origin as possible. The aim was to extend flowering over as long a period as possible.The area will flower in spring and summer, and be left untouched over the winter months when pollinator insects – such as butterflies, hoverflies and bees – hibernate.The re-wilding move represents a pioneering attempt in Ireland to place wild-flower spaces in the heart of the city. The area – one of the most prominent areas in the capital – sees thousands people pass by on a daily basis.Plants and grasses at other parts of campus are already in the form of mini meadows and cut only a few times a year to encourage wild species and to assist students and academics studying ecology."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4318097.1596136727!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"12 ways of avoiding dementia identified in major new study","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe authors call for nine ambitious actions to be undertaken by policymakers and iniduals. Photograph:iStockModifying 12 risk factors over the course of one’s life could delay or prevent 40 per cent of dementia cases, according to the latest verdict of The Lancet Commission on dementia prevention, intervention and care.The commission has added three new “key modifiable risks factors” that make people more vulnerable to dementia excessive alcohol consumption in mid-life, suffering head injuries in mid-life and exposure to air pollution in later life. Led by 28 world-leading dementia experts, the report builds on the nine risk factors from childhood to later life identified in 2017, and provides an up-to-date analysis of the best evidence on the prevention of dementia. “The potential to prevent cases of dementia is high,” it adds.Its latest report presented at the Alzheimer’s Association International Conference on Thursday calls of states and iniduals to be ambitious about preventing dementia and lays out a set of policies and lifestyle changes to help prevent dementia. Worldwide around 50 million people live with dementia, a figure projected to increase to 152 million by 2050, rising particularly in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) where around two-thirds of people with dementia live. Dementia affects iniduals, their families, and the economy - with global costs estimated at about €1 trillion annually.Combined, the three new risk factors are associated with 6 per cent of all dementia cases – with an estimated 3 per cent of cases attributable to head injuries in mid-life 1 per cent of cases to excessive alcohol consumption (more than 21 units per week) in mid-life, and 2 per cent to exposure to air pollution in later life. The remaining risk factors are associated with 34 per cent of all dementia cases. The factors associated with the greatest proportion of dementia cases in the population are less education in early life hearing loss in mid-life, and smoking in later life (7 per cent, 8 per cent, and 5 per cent, respectively).In certain countries, however, the proportion of older people with dementia has fallen, probably due to improvements in education, nutrition, healthcare, and lifestyle changes – demonstrating the possibility of reducing dementia through preventative measures, it concludes.“Our report shows it is within the power of policy-makers and iniduals to prevent and delay a significant proportion of dementia, with opportunities to make an impact at each stage of a person’s life,” says lead author Prof Gill Livingston of University College London, UK. “Interventions are likely to have the biggest impact on those who are disproportionately affected by dementia risk factors, like those in low- and middle-income countries and vulnerable populations, including Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic communities,” he added. Prof Livingston added: “As societies, we need to think beyond promoting good health to prevent dementia, and begin tackling inequalities to improve the circumstances in which people live their lives.” Risks could be reduced by creating active and healthy environments for communities, “where physical activity is the norm, better diet is accessible for all, and exposure to excessive alcohol is minimised”. The authors call for nine ambitious actions to be undertaken by policymakers and iniduals: – Aim to maintain systolic blood pressure of 130 mm Hg (millimeters of mercury) or less in midlife from around age 40 years– Encourage use of hearing aids for hearing loss reduce hearing loss by protecting ears from high noise levels– Reduce exposure to air pollution and second-hand tobacco smoke– Prevent head injury (particularly by targeting high-risk occupations and transport)– Prevent alcohol misuse and limit drinking to less than 21 units per week– Stop smoking uptake and support iniduals to stop smoking (which the authors stress is beneficial at any age)– Provide all children with primary and secondary education– Lead an active life into mid, and possibly later life – Reduce obesity and diabetes. These actions, they say, are especially important in LMICs such as China, India and Latin America, where dementia rates are rising more rapidly than in high-income countries. This is due to increasing life expectancy, and a higher frequency of dementia risk factors such as lower rates of education high rates of hypertension, obesity, hearing loss and rapidly growing rates of diabetes. The authors note they were careful to only include risk factors with strong evidence for a causal link. Their report calls for holistic and inidualised evidence-based care that addresses physical and mental health, social care, and support that can accommodate complex needs of those with dementia. “Keeping people with dementia physically healthy is important for their cognition but they often have other illnesses which they may struggle to manage on their own, resulting in potentially harmful preventable hospitalisations,” it notes.

enough people comply voluntarily.Minister for Health Robin Swann said: “Many of those who have been shielding will understandably be nervous about leaving their homes for sometimes what will be the last time so we can all play our part in assuring them by showing kindness and consideration.”Those shielding included people with conditions like multiple sclerosis or rheumatoid arthritis which would leave them particularly at risk should they be infected by coronavirus.They received special food parcels delivered to their door and other official support.Stormont’s chief medical officer Dr Michael McBride said: “I realise how difficult a time this has been for you and your families, your actions have undoubtedly saved lives.“For the rest of us, think of everyone you meet as someone who may have been shielding.“Please show you care.”On Friday, the North’s Department of Health said 10 more positive cases of coronavirus had been detected, bringing the total number of people who have test positive to 5,948.No new deaths were recorded for the 18 day in a row, leaving the total in the region at 556, according to official figures.However, figures published on Friday by the Nisra official statistics agency showed that four deaths involving Covid-19 occurred in the last week, from July 18th to 24th, bringing the total of deaths to 854.Of this total, 448 (52.5 per cent) took place in hospital, 349 (40.9 per cent) in care homes, eight (0.9 per cent) in hospices and 49 (5.7 per cent) at residential addresses or other locations.The 357 deaths which occurred in care homes and

finding those most at risk of catching it.Amnesty International said it set a benchmark for data privacy.No personally identifiable informationdata is collected through the app – it only uses non-identifiable, randomly generated codes and shares only that information.There are no hidden features to track citizens and it does not track geographical location.Northern Ireland director Patrick

Photograph Nick BradshawThe \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                            One of the statues depicting slave girls holding torches. Photograph: Wikimedia CommonsNineteenth century documentation proves conclusively that the statues taken down by the Shelbourne Hotel do not depict slave girls, an art historian has said.Kyle Leyden, who is a lecturer in the history of art and architecture at the University of London, says the original catalogue from which the four statues were ordered clearly label them not as slaves, but Egyptian and African women.Hotel management said on Tuesday they took the decision to remove the pieces, which have been in place for 153 years, in light of world events and the Black Lives Matter movement calling attention to the legacy of slavery around the world.In a statement on Wednesday, Dublin City Council said it was “not aware of permission being granted to remove the statues concerned. “The matter is under investigation by the planning enforcement section and therefore no further comment can be made on the matter at this time.”The catalogue of the Val d’Orsne foundary in Paris, where the statues were cast, has been digitised and is available online.The statues were originally designed and sculpted by Mathirin Moreau (1822-1912) son of another famous French sculptor, Jean-Baptiste-Louis-Joseph Moreau.In 1849 he entered into an association with the Val d’Orsne foundry and became one of its directors.Under the arrangement, he supplied models to be cast and mass produced by the foundry, which could thus sell them on to architects under his name on the basis of his fame as a sculptor. They were sold to those who could not afford an original work.Mr Leyden said the architect who designed the Shelbourne facade, John McCurdy, would have ordered the four statues from the catalogue, which was published in the late 1850s.It was clear the from the catalogue that McCurdy ordered two “Égyptienne” female statues to stand astride the front doors of the hotel, and two other two statues entitled “Négresse” for either end of the front facade.The word “Négresse”, as used by the French in the mid-19th century, meant the female figure was of African origin, but not from North Africa.Mr Leyden explained that, if the statues were intended to depict Nubian slaves, they would have been classified as such because they were in vogue in the mid-1860s.. However, such statues were usually male or female nudes and were depicted in poses of servitude.The Shelbourne Hotel statues are of well-dressed females in an enlightened pose, he stressed.“’Nubian slave’ was a well-known and much fetishised nineteenth-century visual trope and to some buyers of statues would no doubt have been an attractive and very fashionable visual reference which was distinctly au courrant,” he said.“Verdi was writing Aida about a Nubian slave at precisely the time the Shelbourne was being built. If Moreau, the Val d’Orsne company or McCurdy had wanted a statue of a Nubian slave, they would have had no qualms about calling it precisely that.”Mr Leyden said the blame for categorising the statues as slave girls may lie with the novelist Elizabeth Bowen, who described them as “Nubian in aspect holding a torch-shaped lamp. Two of the four are princesses two are slave-girls”. That description was published in her 1951 book on the Shelbourne Hotel.“As anyone who has read it can attest, it was never intended to be an academic history of the hotel but rather a novelesque evocation of the place and its people,” Mr Leyden explained.“ It is not based on what we would today deem to be sound academic research. “Yet this reference has been repeated ad nauseam ever since. There is no source for the slave assertion save Bowen’s own romantic imagination coloured by her knowledge of nineteenth-century Orientalist literary tropes.“Indeed, several other statues in the catalogue (mainly male) are specifically labelled as Nubian, but not the two chosen at the Shelbourne. They are not slaves. They are not shackled. All four wear golden anklets as symbols of their aristocratic rank. They are all aristocratic women of Egypt and Africa.“Thus it seems likely McCurdy chose these statues firstly because their proportion suited his building. Secondly, their symbolic message was one of luxury, hinting at the deliciously licentious opulence of the new hotel. Choosing statues from the best art foundry in the world would also have had much currency in promoting the opulence of the hotel.” Mr Leyden said the Shelbourne Hotel had made a wrong decision in getting rid of the statues from their plinths and had clearly misrepresented them as the depiction of slaves.He suggested the issue could have been easily resolved by placing leaflets at the front door describing the provenance of the statues.“The statues could become commercial incentives to visits rather than an embarrassment and, should any problems arise, the leaflet will easily explain why they are there,” he said.Shelbourne Hotel management did not respond to a request for comment.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4318184.1596153027!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"d%C3%A1il suspended twice after tds roar at each other over speaking rights","story":"The Dáil was suspended twice in the final hours before the summer recess as TDs argued furiously over speaking slots for Dáil debates.

Image: Oireachtas TVThe final hours of the Dáil sitting before the summer recess ended in vitriolic exchanges with the House being suspended twice in a tumultuous row over speaking slots for Dáil debates.Small political parties and Independent groups expressed fury at a deal they claimed would allow the Government to remove them from the early stages of debates and effectively “muzzle” them.The Government sought the changes to give their backbench TDs better speaking slots.In chaotic scenes, Government and Opposition TDs roared at each other across the Dáil auditorium in the Dublin Convention Centre.Leas Cheann Comhairle Catherine Connolly struggled to maintain order and was forced to suspend proceedings for 10 minutes when TDs refused to take their seats.And Tánaiste Leo Varadkar hit out at the “arrogance, nastiness and abusiveness of the smaller parties and far left parties” who tried to dominate the chamber.In a major broadside he said he was “embarrassed to be a member of this chamber tonight frankly because of the behaviour of some of the parties”.He said the new procedures would still give Opposition parties 74 per cent of the speaking time, “even though they’ve less than half the seats”.Mr Varadkar claimed that any time a Government Minister or backbencher tries to make a point “you shout us down in the same way you bully people online”.He said they repeatedly tried to “bully people in here because they are from a larger party”.The row erupted when People Before Profit TD Richard Boyd Barrett and Rise TD Paul Murphy refused to resume their seats.Mr Murphy claimed the Government was attempting to marginalise left-wing parties and groups.Ms Connolly described TDs’ behaviour as “disgraceful” before suspending the House.Ceann Comhairle Sean Ó Fearghaíl later was forced to suspend the House a second time and accused Mr Boyd Barrett of “histrionics” when he again refused to sit down.Earlier, Social Democrats TD Catherine Murphy said the Dáil would restart in September with “an outrageous proposal to change the rota of speakers in a way that had not been changed since the 1920s”.Fine Gael TD Brendan Griffin told Opposition deputies they were a “national disgrace and we’re entitled to our speaking time and we won’t be denied our right to speak”.People Before Profit TD Bríd Smith said it was like a “dictatorship” of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael.Sinn Féin TD Pádraig Mac Lochlainn said what had happened was deeply regrettable and his party had put forward a compromise proposal to strike a balance for all but the proposal was rejected.When a vote was taken in the Dáil the Government proposal was accepted by 86 to 63 votes.The uproar followed a row earlier in the day on the issue when it was first raised.Under the new proposal, the Government parties, Sinn Féin and Labour will speak in the first slots.Then Government and Sinn Féin will speak again followed by the next largest party (Social Democrats) and so on.It means the Coalition and main Opposition parties will get to speak before each smaller party or grouping gets a chance to be heard.While the amount of speaking time does not change, speakers from the smaller parties will not be heard until much later in the proceedings, when usually there is less interest in the debate.Mr Varadkar said it “wasn’t fair” that in the previous Dáil “Independent TDs and people from micro parties got more speaking time than Government backbenchers”.Social Democrats TD Jennifer Whitmore said “it beggars belief” that the Government and Sinn Féin have come together “to exclude voices of the Social Democrats, Solidarity-People Before Profit and Independent groupings from the speaking times”.But Mr Varadkar insisted “we are going to re-establish democracy in this House” and the Opposition “can try to shout us down as much as they like”.The row in the chamber on Thursday followed a stormy meeting on Wednesday of the Dáil Reform Committee where the Government parties and Sinn Féin agreed to change the current arrangement where a representative from each party and grouping gets to speak in rotation at the start of debates.Ms Whitmore said “it is undemocratic and unfair. It is very disappointing that Sinn Féin has joined the Government on this front.”Rise TD Paul Murphy claimed “the Government is trying to muzzle the Opposition” and it was not about the amount of speaking time.But Mr Varadkar said every TD’s mandate “is equal” and “we had a situation in the previous Dáil where Government backbenchers could not get speaking time”.He said “Independent deputies and people from micro parties got more speaking time than Government backbenchers did and that wasn’t fair.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4318876.1596208666!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"north south ministers discuss sharing passenger locator data","story":"Plans to ensure information in passenger locator forms for those flying into Ireland are shared more effectively between North and South was discussed at a North South Ministerial Council meeting.

Photograph: PA A plan to ensure that information in passenger locator forms for those flying into Ireland are shared more effectively between North and South was discussed at a North South Ministerial Council (NSMC) meeting on Friday. At the meeting, attended by First Minister Arlene Foster, Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill and Taoiseach Micheál Martin and Government Ministers, Ms O’Neill said people needed to “hold their hands up and say there has been a confused picture” in terms of travel regulations North and South.“I think it is confusing for citizens in so far as we have two jurisdictions on the island with two different approaches and that in itself is confusing. We feel the anomalies need to be addressed as quickly as possible,” she said.She said a meeting of the British Irish Council had been called in order to discuss different travel arrangements and advice in the UK and Ireland. Mr Martin defended Ireland’s position on international travel and said the Government had taken a cautious approach. The meeting was also given an update on the most recent Covid-19 figures by the acting chief medical officer Dr Ronan Glynn. Mr Martin also said it was not yet clear if the spike in cases reported in the State on Thursday was a pattern or a series of isolated clusters.Mr Martin said Covid-19 was “a vicious virus and it spreads like wildfire in certain settings.”He said the most significant issue was the effectiveness of the testing and contact tracing system.“That can never be lost sight of as we learn to live with Covid-19.” Mr Martin cautioned against reading too much into the recent increase in Covid-19 cases in the State, ahead of a Cabinet meeting next week during which the Government will decide whether it can proceed to the next phase of re-opening. On Brexit, Mr Martin said there had been progress.“There is work underway in terms of the protocol. I think it is fair to say there has been progress in principle in relation to the operation of the protocol.”“I think it is the shared opinion of all of us that we want an agreement that optimises the economic situation on the island of Ireland.”Ms O’Neill said: “On Brexit, time is running out, we are the eleventh hour. We have four months left and what we have is a situation where businesses and citizens in north are confused as to what will be the outcome. We need certainty and clarity.“We have to have the protocol implemented in full, it recognises our special and unique circumstances on this island.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4316073.1595964623!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"post brexit checks may deter firms like tesco from trading in northern ireland","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tConcerns that big British businesses such as Tesco will be deterred from trading in Northern Ireland after Brexit have been raised in the House of Lords. Photograph: Tolga AkmenAFPGettyConcerns that big British businesses such as Tesco will be deterred from trading in Northern Ireland after Brexit have been raised in the House of Lords.Lord Kerr, the architect of article 50 which enabled the UK to exit the EU, has warned that the special arrangements put in place to avoid a border on the island of Ireland may be a fatal trade barrier for some companies.Under the Northern Ireland protocol, all businesses sending goods to the region from Great Britain will have to make formal declarations for the first time, with food sellers such as supermarkets subject to separate checks on chilled and fresh food from January.“How confident are you that GB businesses are just not going to write off the Northern Ireland market?” he asked the Northern Ireland minister Robin Walker who was appearing before the Lords EU committee.Just three weeks ago the first details of the new trading conditions across the Irish Sea emerged, with businesses obliged to complete three rounds of customs, security and transit forms on all goods being transported to Northern Ireland.Mr Walker said the government intended the new system to be “light touch” and streamlined.However, he faced further questions about the government’s preparedness with Lord Teverson questioning whether the new IT system, the Goods Vehicle Movement System, would be tested in time.And the former Conservative chancellor Lord Lamont challenged Boris Johnson’s repeated assertion that Northern Ireland businesses would continue to enjoy “unfettered access” to Great British markets.Lord Lamont argued there was a clear conflict in the Brexit protocol between article 5, which demands Northern Ireland businesses complete exit summary declarations for all goods being transported to the rest of the UK, and article 6, which promises “unfettered access”.“That is a rather awkward thing,” he told Mr Walker as he defended the government position, saying it was within the UK’s gift to ensure unfettered access.Mr Walker conceded that some of the detail of the protocol had yet to be agreed by the joint committee chaired by Michael Gove and the vice-president of the European Commission, Maroš Šefcovic.He also said details on the Northern Ireland border operating model, expected yesterday, would be published in the “coming weeks”. - "},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Pro-democracy opposition, which was seeking a majority, says move politically motivatedCountry records first Covid death after finding virus lurking in tourist city of DanangXinjiang records 112 local transmissions UN says millions could be forced into povertyInternational lawmakers condemn move as \u0026lsquounacceptable obstructions of democratic process\u0026rsquoAustralian state reports daily record of 723 new infections as PM calls for patienceNajib convicted of all seven charges in first trial linked to multibillion dollar scandalHarry Harris\u0026rsquos facial hair had offended some South Koreans with reminder of Japanese ruleGood-natured crowd witnesses Chinese officials moving in as US consulate closesExperts say unfolding disaster exacerbated by mistimed lockdown ordered by Narendra ModiMove is seen as a retaliation for China\u0026rsquos removal from its consulate in Houston, TexasThere is a real fear in China that things are starting to spin out of controlRecord 10 deaths confirmed as Victoria\u0026rsquos second wave is driven by workplace spreadLockdown declared in border town as \u0026lsquorunaway\u0026rsquo returns from South - state media\u0026lsquoWhy are they playing Radiohead?

The average ticked up today, and cases certainly aren\u0027t falling, but we do need some context.An increase in localised outbreaks is also entirely expected at the end of a pandemic, and experts say cases are now so low that, if these levels were happening without knowledge of coronavirus, nobody would have spotted the new disease.Professor Carl Henegehan, director of the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine at Oxford University, said: Across the board, normal life is not resuming because we\u0027re still instilling a sense of fear in the community when cases are very low.If we didn\u0027t have testing now we wouldn\u0027t even be considering it a problem, because it\u0027s so low. If this was an influenza outbreak, we would have called it finished by now and said we were through this wave, and we would have started to get back to normal.  That\u0027s very pertinent to the \u0027second wave\u0027 talk from the Government now.  You cannot scare people to death and expect there to be no repercussions.Before lockdown was eased, experts warned that an ongoing endemic level of disease was a price we may have to pay for getting the economy and health service back on track.

The second hottest day was 38.5C reached on August 10 2003 in Faversham, Kent. Friday’s sweltering heat came as the Met Office released its annual State of the Climate report, in which it said climate change was exerting an increasing influence in the UK.After a dull July, which had only two-thirds of average sunshine for the month, more than 100,000 people descended on Bournemouth beach, keen to make the most of the heat. Dorset police said the area was “rammed” by 1pm and threatened to block off roads and put on extra patrols, in an attempt to avoid the crowds seen in the area last month. Bournemouth Christchurch and Poole Council encouraged beachgoers to use a new smartphone app that alerts visitors when sections of the beach are overcrowded, making social distancing impossible.Yvonne Jones, 66, a beach hut holder in Poole told the BBC that Boris Johnson should have made sure people stayed in their own counties.” She said: The traffic is horrendous - I live locally and it was a nightmare to get here. It\u0027s the locals who end up suffering.Motorists were being turned away from an overflowing car park in the luxury peninsula of Sandbanks in Dorset by 11am. Southeastern Railway put on extra trains to Ramsgate and Margate, but urged travellers to reconsider their journey because of the difficulty of social distancing. Thanet Council also asked beachgoers to stay away from its most popular spots, including Joss Bay, Botany Bay and Viking Bay. Brighton and Hove City Council issued a statement at 2pm telling people to stay away from the city because it could no longer enforce distancing. In a message on Twitter, the council said:  We\u0027re concerned about the number of people in the city. If you\u0027re not already here, please don\u0027t travel to the city today. There is limited capacity on public transport. Large numbers make it impossible to maintain physical distancing.Although cooler temperatures are expected on Saturday, it is still likely to be in the mid- to late-20Cs across the weekend, with the southeast particularly warm. Mr Partridge said: Both days are going to be mostly dry across the UK with sunny spells and some showers at times that may be out to the north and the west of the country.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"governments dystopian overreach shows slippery slope action","story":"Does anyone else sense that Britain has fallen victim to a coup d’état by epidemiologists? Was that the real Boris who gave a press conference this morning telling us that theatres won’t be able to open after all, and we will have to wear masks in museums, cinemas, libraries and churches? Or was this merely an actor, while the real PM sits bound and gagged in the basement of Number 10 while Professor Chris Whitty (or maybe a dark cabal led by Professor Neil Ferguson) runs the roost?I ask because the government’s decision-making no longer seems even remotely concerned with weighing up the economic costs of the arbitrary rules being forced upon us by the day. All that seems to matter is one thing and one thing alone: getting the number of recorded cases of Covid 19 to fall week-on-week. One small blip, one little reversal, and the hard-won progress back to some kind of economic normality must be sacrificed. Last night it was four million people in the North being ordered not to meet up in their homes and gardens this morning it was theatres being told that they cannot, after all, reopen their door to live performances tomorrow. That, and all of us being ordered to wear masks in yet more public spaces.It wasn’t long ago that the deputy chief medical officer Jenny Harries was telling us that masks were worse than useless in stopping the spread of coronavirus. On 12 March she told us that they weren’t a good idea for the general public because they could trap the virus, making it more likely that we would inhale it. On 23 April she told us that there was a “very, very small potential benefit” of wearing them “in some enclosed environments”.  But then they became compulsory on trains and buses. Next, we had to wear them in shops, too. And now it will be museums, cinemas, libraries and churches. Give it another fortnight and I’ll bet we’ll have to wear them walking down the street, too.It might sound a small thing, but not if you are running one of the affected places and businesses it isn’t. Having to wear a mask completely takes the fun out of all kinds of activities. It medicalises every environment, turns every meeting place into emergency ward 10. It makes me just want to stay at home.It is typical of the mission creep which has afflicted the government’s response to Covid-19 from the beginning. First, we were told that we would have to swallow restrictions on our everyday lives in order to prevent the NHS from being overwhelmed, to “flatten the sombrero”. We were told it we would beat the virus in 12 weeks – i.e. by the beginning of June. Then it was all going to be over by Christmas, then the middle of next year.What really seems to be happening is that human society is being permanently remodelled to prevent all transmission of infectious disease. We are being gradually conditioned for a J G Ballard-style dystopia where all normal human contact is prohibited.It makes me laugh to think that just over a year ago a man walking down an East London street was fined £90 for covering his face while he walked past a facial recognition camera being trialled by the police. Now, we get fined for not covering our faces – even when approaching the counter in a bank.

Abolishing compulsory English is seen as a way to promote a united Indian identity from an early age.For much of the BJP’s support base, English is associated with colonial times and the old corrupt ruling Indian elite which followed afterwards and its abolishment as a mandatory language fits Mr. Modi’s wider policy of driving Indian nationalism.While only 0.02 percent of India’s 1.38 billion citizens speak English as a mother tongue, it was seen as the vital bridge in a erse country where 19,500 different languages and dialects are spoken.Parents took to social media to express their anger at the decision, saying it would reduce their children’s future employment prospects, with fluent English considered essential for highly-coveted and well-paid jobs overseas.In 2018, India was the highest recipient of remittances in the world - with over £60 billion sent home - with its citizens typically working in English-speaking countries including the United Kingdom and Australia.Aside from the decision to scrap English in primary schools, the NEP was received with enthusiasm by Indian parents.As part of the policy the Indian Government will increase its spending on education from 4.4 percent to six percent.India’s public education system is chronically underfunded, with a shortage of around 800,000 teachers nationally and over 75 percent more classrooms needed to meet demand in the northern state of Bihar.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"prince andrew lobbied us government favourable epstein plea","story":"Friends of the Duke of York have demanded women accusing him of lobbying the US government to try to secure Jeffrey Epstein a “favourable” plea deal must now produce proof.In a scathing attack after the latest release of court documents from America, a friend told The  “precious few” claims against Prince Andrew had stood up, adding how “allegations are not the same as facts.” Two alleged victims of the multi-billionaire financier claim Prince Andrew had tried to intervene to secure his former friend a so-called “sweetheart plea deal” back in 2008, new papers show.The women - named only as Jane Doe 1 and 2 - appealed for the release of more files which they say would prove the prince, as well as other high profile friends of Epstein, “lobbied” the US government for a lenient plea agreement.In 2008, Epstein pleading guilty to a reduced charge of soliciting a minor for prostitution. His 18 month sentence - during which he worked from his Miami home - was vastly shorter than if he had been convicted of more serious sex charges.But, the two unnamed women and alleged victims of Epstein claimed: “(They are) seeking documents regarding Epstein’s lobbying efforts to persuade the government to give him a favorable plea arrangement, including efforts on his behalf by Prince Andrew and former Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz.“They have alleged these materials are needed to prove their allegations that, after Epstein signed the non-prosecution agreement his performance was delayed while he used his significant social and political connections to lobby the justice department to obtain a more favorable plea deal.”Their comments emerged in papers from a now settled 2015 defamation lawsuit filed by Virginia Giuffre, 36, one of Epstein’s alleged victims who claimed Prince Andrew was among the powerful people she was persuaded to have sex with when aged just 17.Prince Andrew has repeatedly denied the claims.The Duke moved to distance himself from his former friend after the conviction, meeting with him on only one occasion in New York in 2010 to formally cut ties.“Allegations are not the same as facts, which is the essential premise on which justice works.  “Let’s see if these allegations stand-up, because precious few about the Duke do – where’s the proof?”Ghislaine Maxwell, 58, the British socialite and former girlfriend of Epstein, had fought unsuccessfully to keep the files secret. In another part of her deposition, Ms Giuffre is asked by her lawyers in 2016 if Prince Andrew would have relevant information that could help investigators.Yes, he would know a lot of the truth, she said of the Duke.

Maxwell faciliatated Epstein’s acts of sexual abuse by acting as a madam.Ms Giuffre in other parts of the testimony says the now famous photo of Prince Andrew with his arm around her waist in a London mansion was taken by Epstein on her Kodak camera. She says she gave the picture to the FBI during their investigations in 2011.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"uk lockdown latest rules guidance government","story":"People from different households in Greater Manchester, parts of East Lancashire and West Yorkshire are banned from meeting each other indoors from.In a late-night announcement on July 30, the Health Secretary Matt Hancock said households gathering and not abiding by the social distancing rules was a reason for the stricter rules and it was in order to keep the country safe.The new restrictions apply to the whole of Greater Manchester, parts of East Lancashire including Blackburn with Darwen, Burnley, Hyndburn, Pendle, Rossendale and parts of West Yorkshire including Bradford, Calderdale and Kirklees.The new rules, which came into effect from July 31, also ban members of two different households from mixing in pubs, restaurants and other hospitality venues, but these businesses will remain open for those visiting inidually or from the same household.Read more: North of England lockdown: what are the rules for Greater Manchester, Bradford and Blackburn?The Prime Minister said planned reopenings for August 1 will be postponed for a fortnight.Boris Johnson told a Downing Street briefing: With those numbers creeping up, our assessment is that we should squeeze that brake pedal... in order to keep the virus under control.On Saturday Aug 1, you\u0027ll remember we had hoped to reopen a number of the higher-risk settings that had remained closed and today I\u0027m saying we\u0027re postponing those changes for at least a fortnight.This now means that means until Aug 15 at the earliest casinos, bowling alleys, skating rinks and the remaining close-contact services must remain closed.Indoor performances will not resume, pilots of larger gatherings in sports venues and conference centres will not take place, and wedding receptions of up to 30 people will not be permitted.Boris Johnson also pushed a new message - hands, face, space - a change of tone from the much-maligned stay alert slogan.People are still being encouraged to get back to the office environment from Aug 1, and Mr Johnson did not row back on this when he postponed the next step in the roadmap out of lockdown.Instead of the Government telling people to work from home, we\u0027re going to give employers more discretion and ask them to make decisions about how their staff can work safely, he said on July 24.He said that this could mean continuing to work from home if safest, or it could mean making workplaces safe by following Covid-secure guidelines.Whatever employers decide, they should consult closely with their employees, and only ask people to return to their place of work if it is safe, he added.The Prime Minister also made clear that anybody could now use public transport, which people were previously only encouraged to do if their journey was necessary. He emphasised that the Government will continue to encourage people to consider alternative means of transport.In depth: Your rights if your employer asks you to go back to workFace coverings are now mandatory in shops, supermarkets, banks and building societies, with fines of up to £100 for anyone who fails to adhere to the new rules. Initially, people did not have to wear face coverings in museums, cinemas, concert halls and theatres when the Government\u0027s rules that came into place on July 24.But on July 31, Mr Johnson announced that face masks had to be worn in museums, galleries, cinemas and places of worship and this will be written into law in England on August 8.Visitors to hairdressers, gyms and leisure centres, dentists and opticians will also not be required to wear face coverings.The Government has indicated that the policy could be extended to offices too, but there has been no official announcement relating to that so far. Face coverings are already compulsory on public transport.Face coverings will be needed in some indoor locations, perspex screens could be used between tables in restaurants and al fresco dining will be encouraged to minimise the risk of transmission. There is also hope that at least some social distancing restrictions could be lifted by the end of the year, after the Prime Minister said that he hopes we will be able to review the outstanding restrictions from November at the earliest, possibly in time for Christmas.He also told a press conference on July 17 that the one-metre-plus social distancing rule could be scrapped by November, saying that the Government is hoping for the best and planning for the worst.Since July 4, any two households can meet together under the same roof, and even stay overnight, as long as they observe social distancing. This means families can now invite one set of grandparents over for lunch and then see the other set of grandparents for dinner, as long as they are not there at the same time.The new rule also allows any two households to meet up in a pub, restaurant, museum or cinema, or even go on holiday together. There is no limit on how many people can gather, as long as no more than two households are meeting at the same time.Existing rules allowing up to six people from up to six different households to meet outdoors remain in place, as does the rule that allows someone living alone to join a support bubble (see the \u0027Shielding\u0027 section below) with another household and be treated as if they live in the same home.Boris Johnson has now said that the Government will look to allow more close contact between friends and family where we can, from October onwards and subject to the sustained decline of the virus.Families will be told to choose one member to visit elderly relatives in care homes.New Government guidance for the care sector – which bans flowers and hugs – says homes can begin allowing visitors shortly after they have undergone risk assessments of safety protocols. The advice recommends limiting the numbers of visitors to a single constant visitor per resident, wherever possible. It says: This, for example, means the same family member visiting each time to limit the number of different iniduals coming into contact. Relatives will be told to wear face coverings and follow advice on social distancing as much as possible, keeping at least one metre away and avoiding handshakes, kisses or hugs. Iniduals who test positive for coronavirus or show symptoms must self-isolate for 10 days.The UK Chief Medical Officers extended the time period from seven to 10 days on July 30. They said that evidence - although limited - has strengthened, suggesting that iniduals who are mildly ill with Covid-19 and are recovering have a real possibility of infectiousness between 7 and 9 days after illness onset.In a statement published online, they said: We have considered how best to target interventions to reduce risk to the general population and consider that at this point in the epidemic, with widespread and rapid testing available and considering the relaxation of other measures, it is now the correct balance of risk to extend the self-isolation period from 7 to 10 days for those in the community who have symptoms or a positive test result.This will help provide additional protection to others in the community. This is particularly important to protect those who have been shielding and in advance of the autumn and winter when we may see increased community transmission.The shielding programme, which was designed to protect the most medically vulnerable to the effects of coronavirus, is due to end completely at the end of July. The Prime Minister said that the Government will be sure to restart shielding at any point if it is required at a regional or national level.Grant Shapps, the Transport Secretary, has published a list of countries and territories where the Government has abandoned its 14 day quarantine policy. However countries including Portugal, Canada and the US have been excluded from the list at present.China, Brazil, Sweden and Russia have also been left off the list under a “traffic light” system that allows holidaymakers to travel abroad without having to self-isolate for two weeks when back in England.Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said it is that  quite likely that more countries will be added to the red list in the near future. On July 26, it was announced that travellers arriving from Spain will have to self isolate for 14 days upon their return. The following day, the Foreign Office updated its travel advice and warned against all non essential travel to mainland Spain and its surrounding islands including Ibiza and the Canary Islands. Speaking on BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme on July 30, Mr Hancock said that scientists were looking into ways to reduce the quarantine period. In recent days, the  has learnt that under plans being finalised by ministers, quarantine for people arriving from Spain and other countries with high levels of coronavirus will be cut to 10 days.This permits customers to sit closer together in venues in which it is not possible for them to be two metres apart, so long as there are additional mitigating measures in place. Waiters are required to wipe down surfaces more often and collect glasses and plates more frequently. People are discouraged from returning their glass or ordering from the bar, with more table service and mobile apps expected to be introduced. The changes also place limits on the number of people who can sit together indoors in pubs and restaurants, with just two households of any size permitted to drink or eat together. To assist the Test and Trace system, customers will be required to register their details with a venue before entry.In depth: Restaurants and cafes are open - these are the new rules Swimming pools have reopened, and grassroots sports has begun again, meaning people of different households can train and play together. Clubs have to submit an action plan to the Government explaining how they will follow the rules.Gyms and sports facilities are now open again, with enhanced cleaning, timed booking restrictions, reduced class sizes and spaced out equipment.While face coverings remain obligatory on public transport, gym-goers are not be expected to wear theirs while working out. Some gyms might require them - so ask before you go.The Prime Minister has announced that from Aug 1 the Government will pilot larger gatherings in sport stadiums, with a view to a wider reopening in the autumn, noting that the aim is to bring audiences into stadiums from October onwards.In depth: A Covid-safe gym workout – what you can, can\u0027t, and shouldn\u0027t do Schools, nurseries and colleges will all open for all children and young people on a full-time basis from September onwards, with schools in England told to keep classes or whole year groups apart in separate bubbles.Primary schools are encouraged to have bubbles that include a whole class, while secondary schools are likely to need bubbles that consist of an entire year group so the full range of subjects can be delivered.Older children will also be encouraged to keep their distance within groups of students and from staff.Schools have also been advised to stagger break and lunch times, as well as start and finish times, to keep groups apart and avoid creating busy corridors, entrances and exits.Students have been advised to consider alternatives to public transport in the autumn.Parents, staff and pupils will be encouraged to walk or cycle to school if at all possible - and schools have been told to consider using walking buses to reduce the use of public transport.The Prime Minister has said that universities are working to reopen as fully as possible when the autumn term begins in September.In depth: Schools are reopening in September - what does the guidance say?Hair salons have now reopened, but the experience of getting your hair cut is very different.Hairdressers are required to wear a full-face plastic visor to reduce the risk of infection and also need to follow strict rules over the disinfecting of equipment.Customers must usually make appointments, and there are limits on the amount of people in salons. Customers are not obliged to wear a mask, but can if they wish to. In government guidance released on June 24, establishments were advised to implement a series of measures to ensure the safety of guests and staff. Those checking in to hotels should expect to see social distancing stickers on the floor, perspex screens at the reception desk  and hand sanitiser or handwashing facilities as they enter the premises during their stay.The duration of activities such as check-in should now be kept as short as possible, and keys should be cleaned inbetween guest use.  Queues may form outside hotels like they have done outside supermarkets, and hotels have been asked to introduce queuing systems using barriers should they be needed.Larger hotels can opt to stagger check-in and check-out times, or place markers on the floor to maintain social distancing.All paperwork is likely to be removed from rooms, along with the telephone, while the plastic pouch containing tea and coffee sachets will either be removed or quarantined for up to 72 hours between guests.It is thought campsites will ensure that tents are pitched further apart than normal so social distancing measures can be adhered to, along with frequent deep cleaning of facility blocks such as showers. Some campsites will be required to reduce the number of pitches to keep numbers down.Campsites in Wales reopened on July 6, while those in Scotland reopened on July 15.  Britain\u0027s theatres, galleries and music venues will receive a £1.57 billion rescue package, which Boris Johnson said will help them while their doors remain closed and curtains remain down.The Prime Minister described the arts as the beating heart of this country as he announced a package of grants in July amid warnings that many venues could fold without urgent government support.Once inside, families and friends who book together will be allowed to sit with each other at screenings, but it is likely that seats will be kept free between different bookings. However, there will be no pick \u0027n\u0027 mix or other self-service snacks.In depth: This is what the Covid cinema experience is actually like The majority of other leisure settings were preparing to reopen from Aug 1 as part of the Government\u0027s roadmap.Bowling alleys, skating rinks and casinos would be allowed to reopen then, the Prime Minister said earlier in July.But on July 31, a day after parts of the north of England were plunged back into lockdown, Mr Johnson said that these plans were on hold. The reopening plans will be revisited on Aug 15.All of the above premises are expected to have \u0027Covid-secure\u0027 measures in place, which will most likely involve limitations on customer capacity.But not all leisure settings will be able to reopen even under the updated guidance.Nightclubs and soft play areas sadly need to remain closed for now, Mr Johnson said in July, although added that this will be kept under review.Churches are being encouraged to implement a booking system, meaning people may need to reserve their space ahead of services.Worshippers are also advised to bring their own bible or holy book to their place of worship with them. Where worshippers are unable to do so, books should be cleaned and quarantined for 48 hours since their previous use. Muslims should also bring their own prayer mat to services.Communion is allowed if it is deemed \u0027essential,\u0027 but worshippers should not drink from the same glass or share the same bread, which could come pre-wrapped. The priest distributing communion should wear gloves and all those involved in the practice should wash their hands before and after.No hymns should be sung or wood instruments used as they create an “additional risk of infection”.For Christenings and other water rituals, only “small volumes” should be splashed onto the body with full immersion avoided. Those present should stand “distant from any splashes” and all those involved should thoroughly wash their hands before and after such ceremonies. Parents should hold their children throughout the Christening service. Small weddings and civil partnership ceremonies can now take place, with groups of less than 30. That number includes the couple, witnesses, officiants, guests. photographers, security or caterers. It does not include staff employed by the venue.Those ceremonies will have to be staid affairs, as guests should avoid singing, shouting or raising their voices during the ceremonies, while the bride and groom must wash their hands before and after exchanging rings.The guidelines also state that only one person is permitted to sing during the ceremony and they should do so from behind a perspex screen. Spoken responses during marriages or civil partnerships should also not be in a raised voice, the guidance says. This is because of the potential for increased risk of transmission from aerosol and droplets.Fathers may not be able to walk their daughters down the aisle unless they live under the same roof.The orders of service will be disposable and cash donations will be discouraged, meaning those wanting to support the happy couple should do so online. Under the new rules, weddings and civil partnerships should be concluded in the “shortest possible time” and limited to the “legally binding” sections of the service.Receptions or parties after weddings - which have so far not not been permitted - were set to be allowed for up to 30 people from the start of August, provided that they take place in a Covid-secure way.These have now been postponed until Aug 15 at the earliest. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/12/11/14/trappist.jpg","title":"alien life planet solar system nasa trappist","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Other solar systems could have large numbers of planets that are home to alien life, a new study has found.The research suggests that other parts of the universe could be host to numerous planets that are habitable, unlike our solar system, where just one of the worlds has the right conditions for life to thrive.Scientists looking for life elsewhere in the universe regularly search for planets in the habitable zone, which are distant enough from their star that the water would not immediately be evaporated away, but close enough that it would not freeze.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesResearchers think that finding planets at that specific distance from their star, which is also known as the Goldilocks zone, is the best hope for finding alien life elsewhere in the universe.The new study was prompted by looking at a famous, relatively nearby planetary system – known as Trappist-1 – which has at least three planets in its habitable zone.Scientists find \u0027lost\u0027 planet in breakthroughThis made me wonder about the maximum number of habitable planets it\u0027s possible for a star to have, and why our star only has one, astrobiologist Stephen Kane from UC Riverside, who led the study published in the Astronomical Journal this week, said. It didn\u0027t seem fair!To understand how many habitable planets a solar system might be able to support, researchers create a model that allowed them to simulate planets of different sizes orbiting their stars. It accounted for the way that those planets would interact with each other as they orbited around their star, stretching over a theoretical time of millions of years.They found that a star like our Sun could support as many as six planets, each of them with liquid water and the conditions to be habitable. Other kinds of stars could support a full seven.If there are more than that, the planets would move too close to each other, disturbing their orbits.The research also helped illuminate the reason our planet has a relatively paltry one habitable planet, and the conditions that would change that. Part of our problem appears to be that the planets of our solar system move around in an oval shape – if their path is more regular and circular, they better minimise contact so that they can have more stable orbits.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas from fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telescope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

It is so large – at two-and-half-times the mass of the rest of the solar system\u0027s planet combined – that it hogs the space and disturbs everything around it, the study suggests.It has a big effect on the habitability of our solar system because it\u0027s massive and disturbs other orbits, Kane said.The research could now help identify other solar systems that could be worth exploring for potential life. That could inform research by Nasa telescopes, such as the Jet Propulsion Laboratory\u0027s Habitable Exoplanet Observatory, which is looking through the universe in an attempt to find which worlds could have the right conditions to be a home.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Spanish prime minister Pedro Sanchez was meeting later Friday with the leaders of Spain’s regions to discuss how to rebuild the economy and where to deploy billions of euros in European Union aid for recovery.UK economy has recovered around half of its coronavirus hitSpain in mid-March went into a more than three-month lockdown, bringing much economic activity to a halt, as Covid-19 cases and deaths surged. The lockdown ended on  21 June.France also reported a precipitous 14 per cent contraction in the second quarter when the country was in lockdown.The country’s startling plunge of 13.8 per cent in April-June from the previous three-month period also starkly illustrated the punishing economic cost of its two-month lockdown. It was the third consecutive quarter of economic contraction in France’s worsening recession. The pain has been so damaging to jobs and industries that the government is talking down the possibility of another nationwide lockdown as infections tick upward again.Analysts forecast that Europe’s economic recovery is unlikely to be rapid. Andrew Kenningham, chief Europe economist at Capital Economics, said: “There are few silver linings in the data published today, which confirm that eurozone GDP slumped just as much as feared in the second quarter and that inflation remained well below target. While parts of the economy have sprung back to life over the past couple of months, the damage already done combined with the current and potential future impact of the virus mean that the recovery will be painfully slow.“Given the rebound since April, our best guess is that economic activity is now some 5-10 per cent below its pre-virus level in the eurozone as a whole – it is hard to be more precise than that.”The latest official figures for the UK showed a 25 per cent plunge in GDP during March and April but there are signs that a partial recovery has begun.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Average house prices jumped unexpectedly by £4,500 in July as the property market rebounded, after sales had dried up during the coronavirus lockdown.Nationwide said prices rose 1.7 per cent last month compared to June taking the average sale price of a UK home to £220,936.The monthly rise was the biggest since 2009, partly fuelled by the suspension of stamp duty announced earlier this month.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBut Nationwide, the UK’s biggest mortgage lender, warned that July’s increase could prove to be a “false dawn” driven primarily by pent-up demand.Most house sales were paused between March and mid-May, with mortgage lending falling to a record-low before quadrupling in June.What are the UK lockdown rules now?How to ease yourself back into socialising once lockdown liftsThe new lost generationWhich countries are seeing a second wave of coronavirus?How to wear a face mask safelyWith unemployment predicted to rise sharply this year as the UK goes through a deep recession, the house price recovery may be built on shaky foundations, Nationwide warned.“The bounce-back in prices reflects the unexpectedly rapid recovery in housing market activity since the easing of lockdown restrictions,” said Nationwide’s chief economist Robert Gardner.“There is a risk this proves to be something of a false dawn. Most forecasters expect labour market conditions to weaken significantly in the quarters ahead as a result of the after-effects of the pandemic and as government support schemes wind down.”“If this comes to pass, it would likely dampen housing activity once again in the quarters ahead.”Property industry experts said the pandemic might also be prompting some people to move house, particularly to homes with more space or in more rural locations.In May, a survey by Nationwide showed that about 15 per cent of people were contemplating a move because of changes to their lives during lockdown.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The UK is staring down the barrel of a period of unprecedented pain, underpinned by mass unemployment as the furlough scheme ends and a likely second spike, which will hit consumer confidence in unimaginable ways and undo all the gains seen in recent months.“If you think we’ve seen the worst, 2021 may just top it.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Potential uses of the helicopter could include scouting ahead of human explorers and  investigating caves and craters. It could also be used to carry small payloads across the planet.Life could exist beneath the surface of Mars, study claimsBy the way, we just had an earthquake in this room, MiMi Aung said. Although objects were rattled, but there has been no significant effects on the launch of the rocket.On Nasa\u0027s livestream, Nasa administrator Jim Bridenstine noted it was lucky that the rocket was not launching from Vandenberg Air Force Base, which is also in California and has seen Nasa launches before.Many viewers commented on Twitter that the earthquake was a benefit, as it woke them up in time to watch the Perseverance mission launch.Nasa can only go to Mars once every 26 months, so missing this launch window would mean a cost of half a billion dollars to maintain the rover before it could launch again.The trip to Mars had already been delayed twice before, because of contamination problems and issues with a crane at the pad.More news can be found on The Independent\u0027s liveblog of the launch.The Nasa mission will send the rover Perseverence to search for traces of potential alien life.The car-sized six-wheeled robotic rover, ]will launch atop an Atlas 5 rocket from the Boeing-Lockheed joint venture United Launch Alliance.Officials indicated that all systems appeared ready to go ahead of the launch, with weather forecasts from the Air Force\u0027s 45th Weather Squadron remaining at an 80 percent probability of launch and fuelling preparations underway for the rocket.Perseverance is due to land at the base of an 820-foot-deep (250 meters) crater called Jezero, a former lake from 3.5 billion years ago that scientists suspect could bear evidence of potential past microbial life on Mars. Scientists have long debated whether Mars - once a much more hospitable place than it is today - ever harboured life.Why Nasa\u0027s new Mars rover will be its best yetWater is considered a key ingredient for life, and the Martian surface billions of years ago had lots of it on the surface before the planet became a harsh and desolate outpost.However, scientists are unsure whether alien life could have survived in the water. Although the waters in Martian lakes appear to have a similar pH to that in Earth\u0027s oceans, other scientists have argued that it would be far too cold for life to survive.One of the most complex manoeuvres in Perseverance\u0027s journey will be what mission engineers call the “seven minutes of terror,” when the robot endures extreme heat and speeds during its descent through the Martian atmosphere, deploying a set of supersonic parachutes before igniting mini rocket engines to gently touch down on the planet\u0027s surface.It is the latest launch from Earth to Mars during a busy month of July, following probes sent by the United Arab Emirates and China.Aboard Perseverance is a four-pound (1.8 kg) autonomous helicopter named Ingenuity that is due to test powered flight on Mars for the first time.Additional reporting by agenciesBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Spanish prime minister Pedro Sanchez was meeting later Friday with the leaders of Spain’s regions to discuss how to rebuild the economy and where to deploy billions of euros in European Union aid for recovery.UK economy has recovered around half of its coronavirus hitSpain in mid-March went into a more than three-month lockdown, bringing much economic activity to a halt, as Covid-19 cases and deaths surged. The lockdown ended on  21 June.France also reported a precipitous 14 per cent contraction in the second quarter when the country was in lockdown.The country’s startling plunge of 13.8 per cent in April-June from the previous three-month period also starkly illustrated the punishing economic cost of its two-month lockdown. It was the third consecutive quarter of economic contraction in France’s worsening recession. The pain has been so damaging to jobs and industries that the government is talking down the possibility of another nationwide lockdown as infections tick upward again.Analysts forecast that Europe’s economic recovery is unlikely to be rapid. Andrew Kenningham, chief Europe economist at Capital Economics, said: “There are few silver linings in the data published today, which confirm that eurozone GDP slumped just as much as feared in the second quarter and that inflation remained well below target. While parts of the economy have sprung back to life over the past couple of months, the damage already done combined with the current and potential future impact of the virus mean that the recovery will be painfully slow.“Given the rebound since April, our best guess is that economic activity is now some 5-10 per cent below its pre-virus level in the eurozone as a whole – it is hard to be more precise than that.”The latest official figures for the UK showed a 25 per cent plunge in GDP during March and April but there are signs that a partial recovery has begun.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We don\u0027t know if someone is positive or negative, Mr Paumier said.But the objective is to follow these people, especially those who are positive, to follow them up, and find out who they\u0027ve been in contact with.The countries affected are:\u0026nbspSouth Africa, Kuwait, Qatar, Israel, Brazil, Peru, Serbia, Algeria, Turkey,\u0026nbspMadagascar, India and Oman.\u0026nbspReutersVietnam reports second coronavirus death on same day as firstTwo people have now died in Vietnam, according to the health ministry.Both deaths were reported on Friday.The country has recorded 546\u0026nbspcoronavirus\u0026nbspinfections since its first cases were detected in January.Additional reporting by ReutersNorthern Ireland coronavirus deaths rise for first time since mid-JuneNorthern Ireland has recorded a rise in coronavirus-related deaths\u0026nbspfor the first time since mid-June.Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate for seven deaths registered in the week ending 24 July, up five from the week before, according to the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (Nisra).This brings the total number of Covid-19 related deaths registered in the region in 2020 to 853.Those aged 75 and over have accounted for 80.1 per cent\u0026nbspof Covid-19 related deaths.The number of deaths recorded by the Department of Health for the same period was 556.Those figures are based on patients who had previously tested positive for the virus.The department today said 10 more positive cases of coronavirus had been detected in the region, bringing the total number infected to 5,948.No new deaths were recorded, leaving the total at 556, according to the department.Spain reports 1,525 new coronavirus in post-lockdown recordSpain\u0027s health ministry has reported 1,525 new coronavirus cases, marking the biggest jump since a national lockdown was lifted in June and beating the previous day\u0027s record rise.It is third day in a row Spain has diagnosed more than 1,000 infections.Cumulative cases, which also include results from antibody tests on people who may have recovered increased to 288,522 from 285,430, the ministry said.Greater Manchester leaders call for greater clarity on new rulesLocal leaders in Greater Manchester have called for greater clarity on new restrictions limiting gatherings in parts of the north of England from today.Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham, deputy mayor Bev Hughes and the leaders of the 10 Greater Manchester councils have released a statement asking the government for further details on the ability of businesses with outdoor areas to continue to operate, and how many people can gather in an outdoor public place.They also accused the government of sending mixed messages to people shielding in Greater Manchester, calling for shielding to be extended in the area until the new restrictions are lifted, and for councils to be given extra financial support to help this group.The statement claimed the group\u0026nbspwere originally informed the restrictions would apply to homes - but\u0026nbspnot gardens. They said they were\u0026nbspnot convinced the restrictions banning cross-household gatherings in gardens was proportionate and called for the government to provide further evidence or to amend the rules.The leaders also said recently-opened hospitality businesses would need further support if separate households are not allowed to meet in them.Their final request was for further improvements to the track and trace system, including the inclusion of workplace data to help identify potential workplace hotspots, financial support for those self-isolating for 14 days who will not be paid or fear losing their job, and quicker escalation of local cases where people can\u0027t be contacted.Police will \u0027use enforcement if necessary\u0027 amid new\u0026nbspface mask rulesIn light of new guidance making face coverings mandatory in museums, cinemas and places of worship,\u0026nbspJohn Apter, chairman of the Police Federation of England and Wales, said: We know the vast majority of the public will comply as the rules for where face coverings must be worn is broadened.Where people are not wearing coverings we expect the owner of the premises or local authority to advise and act.\u0026nbspWhere we are called to assist, as we have done throughout this pandemic, we will offer guidance in the first instance, but will use enforcement if necessary.Music venues \u0027saddened by not surprised\u0027 by cancellation of planned gigs, representative body saysMusic Venue Trust and the network of grassroots music venues across the UK are saddened but not surprised to hear that live music events planned from Saturday 1 August in response to government advice must now be cancelled, Music Venue Trust said in a statement.\u0026nbspSince May 2020, Music Venue Trust has repeatedly informed the government that live music events in grassroots music venues would be extraordinarily difficult to stage, not economically viable, and at risk of being cancelled at short notice during the current pandemic.\u0026nbspA number of venues across the country have attempted to stage such events based on advice from the government, incurring substantial costs to make their venues safe. That expenditure now adds to the growing mountain of debts accrued by those venues working within the government guidelines.\u0026nbspMusic Venue Trust has consistently asserted that no grassroots music venue will be able to stage live music events before 1 October\u0026nbspat the earliest, yet the prime minister has stated that the new reopening date might be as earlier as 15\u0026nbspAugust.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspMusic Venue Trust would\u0026nbsplike to restate and emphasise the position of the sector, which is that a \u0026nbspclear and decisive position on the part of government to provide support for grassroots music venues \u0026nbspin the form of efficiently distributed crisis funding until such time as they can re-open safely and viably would provide the much needed clarity that venues, artists, audiences and the wider public need.Vietnam records first ever coronavirus death after 99 days without a local caseVietnam had been seen as a global success story in combating the coronavirus with zero deaths and no confirmed cases of local transmission for 99 days.But last week an outbreak began at Da Nang Hospital. It has grown to 104 confirmed cases in six parts of the country, including three of the largest cities, forcing authorities to reimpose virus restrictions.Vietnam\u0027s health ministry announced on Thursday that a 70-year-old man had died after contracting coronavirus while being treated for a kidney illness at the Da Nang hospital.Da Nang is Vietnam\u0027s most popular beach destination, and thousands of visitors were in the city for summer vacation. Across the country, authorities are rushing to test people who have returned home from the coastal city, which was put under lockdown on Tuesday.West Yorkshire Police Federation chair criticises government\u0027s \u0027haphazard announcements\u0027 of new restrictionsYet again we are struggling to police - and get to grips with - what can only be described as haphazard announcements made by the Government in relation to tighter Covid-19 restrictions, Brian Booth said in a statement.It is an absolute nonsense that we as the police service have not been afforded the time to put things in place prior to an announcement.Many people in Kirklees, Calderdale and Bradford will have woken up this morning to the news that they are subject to tighter restrictions on their lives. And it will be up to my colleagues to police these restrictions.We must also remember that a lot of the areas subject to lockdown have communities who would have been intending to celebrate Eid and who will now be disappointed by this announcement. And it will be our West Yorkshire Police colleagues who will now be on the front line of having to manage the situation and stop separate households from meeting each other at their homes.One third of Edinburgh Airport staff to lose jobsGordon Dewar, chief executive of Edinburgh Airport, has said one-third of his 750 staff are to lose their jobs, travel correspondent Simon Calder\u0026nbspreports.“This is a bitterly sad day for the airport and for those colleagues who are losing their jobs through no fault of their own but due to the impact of this dreadful pandemic, he said.“The situation has been exacerbated by the introduction of an ill-thought out and unworkable blanket quarantine policy which has massively impacted on passenger numbers.“It will be a very long road to recovery, and we cannot successfully make that journey while we are set up as a 15 million-passenger airport.\u0026nbsp“Aviation jobs rely on passengers and flights. That has been lost in this argument.”Mike Kane, MP for Wythenshawe and Sale East and shadow transport minister, said the way the new Covid-19 restrictions were announced was a complete shambles.He told PA news agency: As much as I always support the government, it\u0027s a complete shambles the way it was announced.It\u0027s been released on social media with hours notice. It puts people in a place of uncertainty, fear and confusion.\u0026nbspHe said local MPs were invited by regional public health officials on Thursday morning to discuss how the pandemic was affecting the area, but he said no one had known about the impending new restrictions that were announced that evening.\u0026nbspThe government has got to do better than this in informing people and give people the heads up, he added.\u0026nbspThese things shouldn\u0027t be binary, it shouldn\u0027t be switched on and then switched off.Up to 30 people allowed to meet outdoors in WalesUp to 30 people will be allowed to meet outside in Wales while maintaining social distancing from Monday.Mark Drakeford said children under the age of 11 will also no longer need to keep to the two-metre rule while outdoors due to the falling transmission rate.The first minister said the changes would help family and friends but would be restricted to outside locations because we know it\u0027s much safer to be meeting in the outdoors and the sunlight.The latest set of relaxed measures comes alongside the reopening of indoor service for pubs, restaurants, bars and cafes from Monday.Mr Drakeford told Sky News: We believe we have some further headroom. The circulation of the virus in Wales continues to fall.That gives us the opportunity to reopen bars, restaurants, cafes and so on, indoors, and to afford some extra flexibility to family and friends to meet in the outdoors.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In it, Moore stars as Jules, a lesbian who is raising two children with her partner Nic (Annette Bening). Speaking to Variety, Moore said, “Here we were, in this movie about a queer family and all of the principal actors were straight. I look back and go ‘Ouch, wow’.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesShe continued, “I don’t know that we would do that today, I don’t know that we would be comfortable.“We need to give real representation to people, but I’m grateful for all the experiences that I’ve had as an actor because my job is to communicate a universality of experience to the world.”Glenda Jackson: ‘My family’s anxious every time I sneeze’Oliver Stone says his films would be ‘vilified’ todayAndrew Scott forced to miss Three Kings performances for minor surgeryThe 2010 Oscar-nominated film was praised upon release, but also drew criticism for casting two straight actors in queer roles.Regarding the casting, the film’s director Lisa Cholodenko told Variety that it was a “super interesting argument”. “While I want to promote gay people representing gay people, trans people, all the rest, queer people, it’s also a commercial prospect,” she added.Cholodenko added that she cast Moore and Bening because “I could feel their gayness. It didn’t feel phony to me. I didn’t feel like I was putting somebody in an outfit and asking them to parade something that was false”.

This is by no means a downgrade – after all, international tourists marvel at the UK’s impressive array of country house hotels, seaside cottages, boutique hotels, traditional inns, pubs-with-rooms and campsites on offer. But for a holiday to remember, a spot of glamping is hard to beat.For those of us who’ve had our appreciation for nature reawakened by lockdown, a glamping stay at a British yurt, gypsy caravan, shepherd’s hut or barn delivers a change of scene, outdoorsy activities, locally-sourced food, charming surroundings, luxury and comfort. Here are some key things to think about before your book...A beginners\u0027 guide to glamping Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesGiven the wide range of accommodation on offer, there really is a British glampsite perfect for every traveller. Just make sure you ask yourself a few simple questions before you book.For example, is there phone signal or Wi-Fi? A forced digital detox could be stressful if you’d hoped to stay contactable, but some travellers will consider it a bonus to be out of reach.Also, is there a pub, cafe or shop within walking distance, or will you need to arrive fully self-sufficient? Strolling to a local farm shop for daily provisions adds to the charm of glamping, whereas driving 30 minutes to the nearest supermarket is less of a joy.Equally importantly, what are your rainy options? This might be anything from a Scrabble marathon with a bottle of Merlot, or an underground caving adventure.Stay safe and have fun with this important travel guidance:Only travel in a car with members of your household andor support bubbleAlways wear a face covering or mask on public transportWash your hands before putting on your face covering and after you’ve taken it offWash your face covering dailyWhere possible, leave the car behind and reach your destination by walking or cyclingThe joy of glamping is that you can be packed in under half an hour – there’s no need to spend hours decanting instant coffee into tiny containers, searching for your head torch in the loft, and spending the drive wondering if you forgot the tent pegs. Bad weather is less of a concern too: a week under canvas isn’t much of a holiday, but cosying up in a gypsy caravan or yurt during a storm can be downright romantic.It\u0027s this convenience, comfort and peace of mind that you’re paying for when you book a glampsite, so don’t overthink the trip or stress about your packing list. Leave that to the camping crew.Whether you\u0027re an extrovert adventurer or a laid-back stargazer, there\u0027s a glamping holiday in the UK for you. Here are great staycation selections to inspire you...Go back to your rootsThe Faraway Treehouse in Cumbria is straight out of a fairy tale, with plush velvet curtains, a roll top bath and a balcony to spot deer from during the day. The treehouse is bound to be a hit with families, but it’s a ridiculously romantic getaway for couples too.Faraway Treehouse sleeps two (with space for two children at no additional charge), from £165 per night.Get away from it allTo really get away from it all, take the ferry to the Isle of Skye and bunker down in a beautifully decorated yurt from Skye Yurts. Be sure to stay for at least five nights to hike this gorgeous island, kayak the coves, dine at the Michelin-starred Kinloch Lodge and generally feel a world away from reality.Base rate is £80 per night for two people.Step back in time – with modern comfortsLawnsgate Camping in the North York Moors offers glamping options including a yurt, gypsy caravan (pictured above) and cabin, as well as conventional tent pitchesThis is a working farm that has been in the family for generations, so it’s the real deal, and the picturesque nearby villages and on-site llama-trekking means there’s plenty to do.The Yurt is from £90 per night The Gypsy Caravan is £55 per night and The Game Larder is £60 per night. Watch the starsThe popular glampsite Finn Lough in Enniskillen offers superb stargazing opportunities through the transparent walls of the camping ‘bubbles’.Kayaking, hiking, wakeboarding and other outdoor activities are available nearby, and this scenic corner of Northern Ireland is also well worth exploring by bike or car.Prices start at £265 per night for domes or £145 for suites.Talk with the animalsYou don’t need to splurge on an African safari to spend the night surrounded by lions, tigers and bears.Glamping prices start from £350 per night.How Gilcombe Farm got ready to welcome glampers When events had to be postponed, Amelia Griffin and husband Simon Gerrard, pictured above, sought a new venture to add to their Crescent Moon events company.The solution? A glamping site on 300-acre Gilcombe Farm just outside Bruton in Somerset, near where they live. “It’s lovely countryside,” Griffin says. “There’s loads of gorgeous walks, and people can come just to enjoy the great outdoors.”The site hosts 10 Lotus Belle tents with comfortable Moroccan-style interiors, each eight metres apart with their own designated toilet and mini kitchen. “We could have put more tents in, but didn’t want to because of the present situation,” Griffin explains.Four-day bookings from Thursday to Monday enable the tents to be cleaned and left empty for a few days, and hand sanitiser is widely available on the site.The farm shop offers local produce and delivers to the tents. The couple have also added yoga classes, and outdoor film screenings when all 10 tents are booked.Your staycation checklist: know before you goMany locations across the UK are reopening but are restricting visitor numbers and offering pre-booked time slots. Keep these four points in mind when preparing for your next staycation…CHECK THE GUIDELINES: England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland all have different rules in place check their respective tourism sites before you travelBOOK IN ADVANCE: If you’re visiting an attraction, book slots in advance where possibleGO OFF THE BEATEN TRACK: Try to visit less popular places and to avoid overcrowded areasPACK YOUR BAGS: Bring a card for contactless payments and always keep hand sanitiser on youTo help plan your trip visit Know Before You GoPlease keep in mind that England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland currently have different guidelines, advice and timelines for reopening tourism. So do please make sure you check the respective official sources for information before you travel.Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

All money raised from the auction will go to The Independent’s appeal partner, The Felix Project, London’s largest food surplus distribution charity.

How to support our campaignSotheby’s senior director Oliver Barker said: “We are grateful to the artists who have generously contributed their works and we’re looking forward to channelling part of the excitement of our major sales in London this month into a cause which will provide food and comfort to the capital’s most vulnerable.”  Evgeny Lebedev, proprietor of The Independent, said: “We are delighted to be raising money with Sotheby’s and some of the world’s leading contemporary artists to help build London’s biggest community kitchen that will continue to feed those in need for years to come.”The Felix Project distributes nutritious food that would otherwise go to waste to 350 frontline charities, schools and holiday programmes in London.Founder Justin Byam Shaw said: “Although our food is surplus and donated to us and we have over 1,500 volunteers, our costs are still spiralling. “The coming unemployment crisis means we are in this for the long term. This new community kitchen will provide a high-quality meal for homeless Londoners, cooked by great chefs using surplus food.” Turner Prize-winning artist Mark Wallinger said: “I am delighted to contribute to help raise funds for The Felix Project, a fantastic charity that does such vital work in providing food for vulnerable people throughout London, work that is ever more necessary in our current crisis.”Sotheby’s Help The Hungry Auction will go live on 20 July and will run until 30 July.Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The statue of Robert Baden-Powell on Poole Quay is to be placed in safe storage following concerns about his racial viewsIt added: “While the percentage of iniduals testing positive for Covid-19 has decreased since the start of the study (26 April 2020), there is now evidence to suggest that it has been rising slightly in recent weeks.“Further analysis indicates that we can be confident that there was a real, small increase in the most recent estimated daily infection rate when compared with the lowest daily rate from the last six weeks, which was 0.05 per cent.”The announcement came as the government called on households in areas of the north of England to no longer mix with others in private residences and hospitality businesses.Meanwhile, planned easing of restrictions around wedding receptions and indoor entertainment businesses have been put on hold, and face masks will be mandatory in cinemas, museums and places of worship from next weekend.Commenting on the figures at a Downing Street press conference, the prime minister said: “Around one in 1,500 now have the virus compared to one in 1,800 on the 15th of July and one in 2,000 on the 2nd of July. The ONS also estimates that there are now 4,900 new infections every day, up from around 3,000 per day on the 14th of July and 2,000 per day at the end of June.”“We just can’t afford to ignore this evidence,” he added, saying it was “vital to stress, of course, that we are in a far better position to keep the virus under control now than we were at the start of the pandemic”.Office for National Statistics\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I literally got the message at his memorial so it was a double crappy day\u0027\u0026nbsp“I have lost five kilos in the last three or four weeks because of stress and because work has been so hostile,” Lottie Pope tells The Independent. “I feel like it is bullying. I go to bed at 11pm and wake up at 3am and can’t go back to sleep because my brain is frantic. It is exploding with stress.”Ms Pope, a former social media manager for an insurance firm, was recently laid off from her job during the public health emergency and believes she was discriminated against for being a mother.A spate of recent studies have suggested the coronavirus crisis is exacerbating gender inequality - with a report by the University of Exeter finding women are almost twice as likely as men to have lost their job during the pandemic. Researchers found seven per cent of women have been made redundant during the lockdown in comparison to four per cent of men.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesWhile a report by PwC, published in May, found 78 per cent of those who had already lost their jobs as a result of the Covid-19 emergency were women.“At the beginning of the lockdown, we were asked to take a 20 per cent pay cut,” Ms Pope, who lives in Tunbridge Wells, says. “I said: \u0027I can’t afford that because I’ve got childcare to pay for\u0027. And then they said: \u0027You have a choice to be put on furlough or be made redundant\u0027. It was a punishment. I also asked them if could I reduce my hours by 20 per cent because I was homeschooling but they expected me to still be full-time.”The women facing lockdown burnout as they juggle jobs with childcareThe 30-year-old, who is a single parent, said hours earlier she had been told she was “critical” to the company and would be working throughout the crisis. But her bosses attitude changed dramatically when she did not agree to take the pay cut, she added.“Social media is a critical, vital thing which can definitely be done from home,“ the mother-of-one adds. ”I had a junior person below me and they kept the junior person. She doesn’t have kids. I feel like it was a case of them discriminating against me because I have a child. I was homeschooling and working full time from home at the beginning of the lockdown. It was so stressful. Now I’m not sleeping at all. I feel really highly strung and I’m very worried about money. I’ve filed a grievance. I can’t take them to an employment tribunal because I worked there for under two years.”A recent London School of Economics study found women are more likely than men to lose their jobs in the forthcoming recession because a greater proportion work in sectors that are forecast to be most badly affected. More women work in hospitality, leisure, tourism and the arts — industries where thousands of workers have already been furloughed or made redundant.Jamie Bird, who lives in West London and previously worked in the education sector, was furloughed in March before being laid off in June.  “I was laid off on the anniversary of my best friend\u0027s death,” the 38-year-old adds. I literally got the message at his memorial so it was a double crappy day. I\u0027ve been feeling pretty down since losing the job. I don\u0027t have any kids but it\u0027s affected my mental health a lot. I\u0027ve lost a job and a relationship so it\u0027s been hard dealing with both. I don\u0027t sleep as well because obviously I\u0027m worried about finding another job and how I\u0027m going to pay for bills and other expenses.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailThe gender bias revealed by coronavirus needs fixingMs Bird said the current job market is “awful” and she fears she is being discriminated against due to her age - adding that it feels like employers are taking on apprentices due to them being cheaper than someone who has more experience.“I applied for universal credit but was denied any for reasons they haven\u0027t explained so I\u0027m out of a job with no income and no help and that\u0027s tough,” she adds. “I think that it\u0027s atrocious that women are more likely to lose their job in the pandemic than men, we work equally as hard and sometimes even harder and yet we still don\u0027t seem to have bridged that gap between being treated as equally in the workplace environment.” Gemma Hirst, who lives in Newcastle, has been forced to start claiming universal credit since losing her job in retail during the coronavirus crisis.“I worked for the clothes company for five years and got promoted,” the 25-year-old says. “During lockdown, I got furloughed. A couple of months down the line, the shop I was at was closing down but they said I could be moved to another store. But they cut my hours and demoted me so I was no longer a supervisor. I didn’t want that so they made me redundant”.Ms Hirst said she had never lost a job before or been without work but she lucky enough to live with her parents - adding that if she was living alone, the universal credit would not be enough to live on.“It would be a tough existence,” she says. “It is scary because there are hardly any jobs out there. When I apply for jobs I get emails saying that the application is on pause due to the pandemic. I have no idea what would happen if I didn\u0027t have family. It doesn’t bear thinking about. I think I would be homeless. I have good days and bad days. There are some days where I think ‘what am I going to do?’ and I am anxious about the future and worried about what is to come.”She said her best friend, who has three children, had been catapulted into a state of panic since being laid off from her job in a care home for the elderly.  “She was struggling to get childcare and her employer said we don’t want you,” Ms Hirst adds. “She was crying. She is a wreck because she has three children to look after on her own.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

At a time when Londoners from all walks of life are struggling due to the impact of coronavirus, the importance of love and care from others has been magnified tenfold.The phrase comes from a work made by the artist Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith – one of several fantastic lots in an auction kicking off today at sothebys to support The Independent’s Help the Hungry appeal.Over the past four months we have raised more than £7.5m for food redistribution charity The Felix Project – a cause for which we have pledged to raise £10m as well as to open central London’s largest community kitchen.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe auction is an opportunity to get your hands on works by some amazing artists – more likely to be seen on the walls of a museum than your living room. They can also be viewed at Sotheby’s, 34-35 New Bond Street.Ceramic has been a recurring motif for Ai Weiwei (a 1995 series of photographs showed him dropping a Han dynasty urn) and he has often used porcelain, for centuries a secret formula known only to Chinese makers. Flowers, too, are significant – when his passport was taken Ai put a bunch of fresh flowers in a bike basket outside his studio every day until he was able to travel freely. This small plate holds a great deal of meaning.Yinka Shonibare deconstructions of icons of western power couldn’t be more current. This elegant woodcut print, using vivid Batik textiles, transposes animal masks from Mali onto the faces of English aristocratic figures enriched off the back of colonisation and slavery. The patterns of textiles overlay the repeating patterns of power and show how history’s long fingers reach into our present.Unfailingly optimistic, Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s work is always a call to care. He’s known for his colourful and impassioned but peaceful slogans (“Make Art Not War” seems like a good standard to live by) and his advocacy of art as a tool for education and understanding. We Have Only Got Each Other quotes his late mother, the artist Deirdre Borlase, spoken in response to the isions revealed during the Brexit campaign — but its universal meaning is clear.I’m a sucker for a good drawing – I’ve always felt that even at 500-odd years distance, it’s the form that brings you closest to an artist the sweep of a human hand that has just left the page. After many years of deeply mining her own emotions and experiences in her work, Emin is an artist at the height of her powers. Her raw, almost agonisingly expressive draughtsmanship gets me every time and this little sketch nails the feeling of having a really good cry.These three etchings – a supremely generous donation from Anish Kapoor, more usually known for the interactive theatricality of his large-scale sculptures – exude a quiet drama. Their simplicity belies their seductiveness velvety and intense, they draw you in, never quite revealing their secrets.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Wallinger was inspired by X-rays of Old Masters, which he thinks of as akin to spirit photography: “The revelation of the invisible, supernatural life of a painting.”A reminder of the pre-lockdown era, when we were able to wander the Hayward Gallery and bathe in the sea of pulsating colour that was Riley’s superb exhibition. This screenprint is from a series that vibrates right off the paper (Tate owns an edition of Elongated Triangles 5, so you’ll be in good company if you get your hands on this one).The essence of things is what Michael Craig-Martin seeks in his work, and colour is part of seducing the viewer to really look at the objects that make up our world.

Parts of the country will be warmer than popular tourist destinations in Europe, including Berlin, Lisbon and Ibiza, where temperatures will reach 25C, 30C and 33C respectively. The weather will be hottest in southeastern areas of the UK and will peak at 35C in Greater London. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe mercury will also rise above 30C in Manchester and parts of Wales. However, it will be slightly cooler in some western areas of the UK because of cloud cover, according to Alex Deakin, a meteorologist at the Met Office. Windy and wet week could end with hottest day of the yearIn places where conditions are warmer, Mr Deakin said there is a chance of thunderstorms forming later in the day. Across the Midlands, eastern and southern England, that\u0027s where we have the risk that the heat and humidity could trigger some big, big thunderstorms, Mr Deakin said. But for most places, it\u0027s all about the heat really, he added. A cold front swinging in from the west will bring a significant drop in temperatures on Saturday, when London and Manchester will have highs of 26C and 21C respectively. The good weather on Friday comes at the end of a July which has had above average rain and below average temperatures and sunshine. So far this month, the maximum temperature has been 28.5C, which was recorded at Heathrow Airport on 17 July.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Boris Johnson’s government has confused and alienated the public on crucial health messages with its “deplorable” last-minute announcement of changes to coronavirus rules, experts have claimed.The Independent Sage group of scientists said the government’s failure to explain the new regional ban on different households meeting indoors with any clarity would damage public engagement with the guidance, which is soon to be law.The announcement of a ban on indoor gatherings in Greater Manchester, West Yorkshire and east Lancashire – which also covers the city of Leicester – was made at about 9.15pm on Thursday via a series of tweets and a short TV clip by health secretary Matt Hancock.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“This is no way to handle a pandemic,” said Professor Gabriel Scally, president of epidemiology and public health at the Royal Society of Medicine. “It seemed designed to undermine public confidence.”Professor Susan Michie, professor of health psychology at UCL, added: “Having such sudden announcements is very damaging from the point of view of morale and people’s engagement.Further lockdown lifting postponed as coronavirus cases rise – liveMuslim leaders have condemned the government for the “shockingly short notice” of new restrictions, which was announced just before the Eid festival began. The new rules ban people in affected regions from meeting each other inside homes or in gardens.The government announced that pubs, cafes, restaurants – and places of worship – can reopen in Leicester from Monday following four weeks in more extensive lockdown than the rest of the country. But people from different households in Leicester cannot meet in homes or gardens.The Independent Sage panel condemned the “inconsistencies and apparent insensitivities” in the announcement.“There’s an inconsistency when people are told you can go to pubs, which is not an appropriate place to celebrate Eid, but you can’t do this in private gardens – which is a lot safer,” said Professor Michie.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, however, said “announcing measures affecting potentially millions of people late at night on Twitter is a new low for the government’s communications during this crisis”.Boris Johnson announced on Friday that measures due to be lifted on Saturday across England – including allowing small wedding receptions and reopening bowling alleys and casinos – have been postponed for at least two weeks.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An artist puts the finishing touches to a wax figure of Prime Minister Boris Johnson, in the entrance line at Madame Tussaud\u0027s in London, as the attraction prepares to reopen to the public following the easing of lockdown restrictions in EnglandA member of staff stands on Ai Weiwei\u0027s \u0027History of Bombs\u0027 during a photocall for the Chinese artist\u0027s new work on display at the Imperial War Museum in LondonStuart Broad celebrates after taking the wicket of West Indies batsman Kraigg Brathwaite.

The statue of Robert Baden-Powell on Poole Quay is to be placed in safe storage following concerns about his racial viewsHowever, health secretary Matt Hancock insisted he was right to act quickly and comprehensively when evidence emerged of increased levels of coronavirus due to households mingling in Greater Manchester, West Yorkshire and east Lancashire.The announcement of a regional ban on indoor meetings between members of different households - which also covered the city of Leicester - was made at around 9.15pm on Thursday via a string of tweets and a short TV clip by the health secretary.It followed phone conferences involving Mr Hancock, health experts and local leaders including mayors and MPs for the areas affected, as well as a meeting with the prime minister at Downing Street. As discussions continued, a planned press conference to announce the outcome of a review of local lockdown in Leicester was repeatedly delayed, prompting mayor Sir Peter Soulsby to accused ministers of messing the city about and declaring: “What a way to run a country!”Where are the new lockdown restrictions and what are the rules?Indoor gatherings banned in northern England amid spike in casesExact details of the new restrictions were not published on the gov.uk website until Friday morning, hours after they came into effect. As Mr Hancock took to the airwaves at breakfast time, it was revealed that Boris Johnson and chief medical officer would answer questions about the changes in a press conference at 10 Downing Street at noon that day.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive updates on politics every morning by emailMs Nandy described the announcement as an “absolute shambles” adding: “Nobody is arguing that the Government shouldn’t move quickly where evidence exits that there has been a spike in Covid cases, and we have certainly seen that in Greater Manchester.“So, it’s absolutely right that they do this. But I cannot describe to you the level of chaos that there was last night with this announcement, because the government was essentially asking people to comply with new rules in just a few hours’ time without any detail about what those rules were going to be.”Tracy Brabin, Labour MP for Batley and Spen in West Yorkshire, said the way the new lockdown measures had been announced was “deeply chaotic”.She said: “To announce this sort of measure late at night on Twitter caused an awful lot of anxiety in my community. It’s a new low.“It affects millions (of people) and businesses. I have been getting messages from families asking ‘can I take my children to the childminder?’, ‘can I go to work?’... It has caused a lot of anxiety.”In a press conference today, Sir Peter Soulsby said there was still confusion in Leicester about what was allowed: “I’m sure lots of people in Leicester will not have a clear understanding of what was announced yesterday and what it means for them.“I think the fact the timing of the decision was put back several times – and even when it came out, the bit about Leicester was very much an afterthought in a bigger statement - leaves a lot of uncertainty and a lot of frustration.” Meanwhile, Conservative MP for the Greater Manchester constituency of Hazel Grove, William Wragg, said: “Greater Manchester is not one homogeneous area. We must always err on the side of caution with Covid, but to treat all 10 boroughs the same is not the right approach.”Notably, his comment was retweeted by the influential chairman of the Conservative backbench 1922 Committee, Sir Graham Brady, who added: “I agree. Latest update for Trafford says ‘infections continue to be at a low level’.”The mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham backed the government’s action, but was critical about the manner of its announcement.“They have a habit of saying something and then it being a few hours until the detail emerges,” he told Sky News.“And that certainly was the case last night, and later on last night a lot of people I think felt very uncertain about what exactly was being announced.“So what I would say to them is ‘I understand the need to make announcements, I understand the need for decisive action, but when ministers go in front of the cameras, make sure you’ve got the detail ready to go exactly at the same time’.”Mr Hancock defended his handling of the new restrictions: “We made the announcement last night, we are moving quickly in some circumstances and I think that’s very important and it’s one of the things that when you face a pandemic like this, it is important sometimes to move quickly, if that’s what’s needed.“And I’m pleased that Andy Burnham is supporting this action. It’s absolutely necessary and of course sometimes we have to move quickly when we can see the growth of the virus and I understand the impact of decisions like these.“I understand that this is not a sort of decision that anybody would want to take, but as we’ve seen before, it is important to move quickly because the virus spreads and you’ve got to make sure you do everything you can do keep ahead of it.”Mr Hancock insisted the new guidelines were “crystal clear”, but appeared to get the details wrong in an interview with the BBC in which he said a household in an affected area could travel to visit another household outside the area, as long as social distancing guidelines are followed.The guidance published by the government states: “If you live in the affected areas, you should not visit someone’s home or garden regardless of whether this is in or outside of the restricted area.”MPs for affected areas said that there was no clarity within their constituencies about what was now allowed or not allowed.Manchester Central MP Lucy Powell said people had been asking her whether they were able to visit elderly relatives they are looking after who live outside of the restricted area, and whether they can go on holiday with another household elsewhere.Describing the launch of the regional restrictions as “a bit of a disaster”, she said: “Shockingly bad comms with potentially devastating consequences for many. We need to be continually cautious but we also need confidence and clarity.”Huddersfield MP Barry Sheerman said he backed the tighter controls, but found it impossible to get clarity on them in the hours after the announcement, tweeting late on Thursday: “Receiving many questions about the tightened lockdown, unfortunately very little information provided by the government and I am urgently seeking answers.”Stalybridge and Hyde MP Jonathan Reynolds said: “I have to say a few tweets from a minister late at night is not the way to announce something as significant as this.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Average house prices jumped unexpectedly by £4,500 in July as the property market rebounded, after sales had dried up during the coronavirus lockdown.Nationwide said prices rose 1.7 per cent last month compared to June taking the average sale price of a UK home to £220,936.The monthly rise was the biggest since 2009, partly fuelled by the suspension of stamp duty announced earlier this month.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBut Nationwide, the UK’s biggest mortgage lender, warned that July’s increase could prove to be a “false dawn” driven primarily by pent-up demand.Most house sales were paused between March and mid-May, with mortgage lending falling to a record-low before quadrupling in June.What are the UK lockdown rules now?How to ease yourself back into socialising once lockdown liftsThe new lost generationWhich countries are seeing a second wave of coronavirus?How to wear a face mask safelyWith unemployment predicted to rise sharply this year as the UK goes through a deep recession, the house price recovery may be built on shaky foundations, Nationwide warned.“The bounce-back in prices reflects the unexpectedly rapid recovery in housing market activity since the easing of lockdown restrictions,” said Nationwide’s chief economist Robert Gardner.“There is a risk this proves to be something of a false dawn. Most forecasters expect labour market conditions to weaken significantly in the quarters ahead as a result of the after-effects of the pandemic and as government support schemes wind down.”“If this comes to pass, it would likely dampen housing activity once again in the quarters ahead.”Property industry experts said the pandemic might also be prompting some people to move house, particularly to homes with more space or in more rural locations.In May, a survey by Nationwide showed that about 15 per cent of people were contemplating a move because of changes to their lives during lockdown.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That allows researchers to build up a picture of all matter in the universe, of which some 90 per cent is invisible, made up of dark matter and tenuous gas.That in turn allows astronomers to watch the processes that gradually make the universe less homogenous, or evenly distributed: parts of the universe that have more than the usual mass attract matter from their areas around them, which makes them less similar to those other parts. The expansion of the universe counteracts that growth.Scientists find they don’t know how fast the universe is expandingSince both of those processes are driven by gravity, they can be used to test the standard model of cosmology and the assumptions underlying our physics. Since that allows us to predict the way that the variations in density would change as the universe aged, those predictions can be put to the test by examining how homogenous or differently clumped the universe really is.The new study found, however, that those predictions were wrong. The universe is almost 10 per cent more homogenous than our current understanding of physics suggests.Like other recent findings, such as the mysterious discrepancy in the expansion rate of the universe or Hubble constant, the data could be yet another crack in the standard model of physics, and could require us to rethink our picture of the universe.“The question is whether these can be solved with a small adjustment, for example with a somewhat more complex behavior of dark matter than the simple hypothesis of totally inert ‘cold dark matter\u0027, said Tilman Tröster, from the University of Edinburgh, in a statement.But the change could be far more fundamental, suggesting for instance that Einstein’s general theory of relativity could need replacing.The researchers behind the new observations were keen to stress that their focus was on accurately taking the measurements, rather than making any leaps about what they could tell us about the universe – or what they could tell us about what we have got wrong about it.As an observing cosmologist, you try to remain impartial and make the measurements as accurate as possible without theoretical prejudices, said Hendrik Hildebrandt from Ruhr University Bochum.One thing is clear: we live in exciting times!”Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas from fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telescope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

Even before the postponement of the election was confirmed, opposition figures had cautioned that any such move would be treated with suspicion.On Thursday, the Hong Kong government had already barred 12 influential opposition figures from running for seats on the city’s Legislative Council.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Much of the law is considered to be tailor-made to target and criminalise those leading the protests. China’s Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office said the law would be a “sharp sword” hanging over the heads of a “tiny number of people” endangering national security.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Former IMF chief Christine Lagarde has praised female leaders around the world for their “stunning” response to the coronavirus pandemic, especially when compared to their male counterparts.Ms Lagarde, who now heads the European Central Bank, said the policies adopted by female heads of state were proactive and their communication style was clear.“I would say that for myself I’ve learned that women tend to do a better job,” she said. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesShe added: “This is my woman’s bias and I indulge in ceding to this bias.”The top 10 worst affected countries are all led by men, both in terms of total number of cases and cases per million people.It is difficult to make a like-for-like comparison without considering factors like health expenditure, tourism and population density. There are also far fewer women in positions of power, with only around 10 per cent of countries having a female leader.A recently released study attempted to factor in these variables, finding that on every metric female-led countries performed better than male-led countries.When comparing countries with similar population sizes, such as Ireland and New Zealand, the researchers found that countries with women in charge experienced far fewer cases.The paper, written by economists Supriya Garikipati and Uma Kambhampati, hypothesised that female-led countries fared better due to qualities shared by female leaders.Previous studies have found that women are more risk averse and favour a style of leadership that is empathetic and science-based.The researchers suggested that these traits meant women leaders are risk averse with regard to lives, but prepared to take significant risks with their economies by locking down early.Prioritising economic outcomes has been one of the reasons for the US not imposing a nationwide lockdown, which has contributed to surging case numbers.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Operators of saunas and steam rooms must calculate how many people can be accommodated at one time… No face coverings are to be worn in the sauna or steam room and these facilities must be regularly cleaned.\" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"The Independent reports that spas are awaiting guidance from the government regarding thermal treatments - including steam rooms, jacuzzis and ice rooms. Spas and saunas are lumped in with beauty treatments, so are working on the same schedule.The government revealed new guidelines on July  that would enable all close contact services to resume, including any treatments on the face such as eyebrow threading or make-up application, working closely with the sector and public health experts to ensure this can be done as safely as possible and in line with COVID- Secure guidelines. Boris Johnson said: From August , we will be reopening most remaining leisure settings and we will enable close-contact services [such as] beauticians to resume.It is unclear exactly how social distancing could be enforced in a sauna or steam room.However, Boris Johnson said in June that the government is keen to reopen close contact services eventually.He said: We also intend to allow some other close contact services, such as nail bars, to reopen as soon as we can when were confident they can operate in a secure way.But nonetheless the government still has concerns about protecting customers’ safety due to the close contact needed in these industries.A report from British Beauty Council suggests PPE measures as well as strict management of communal areas to keep them disinfected.It also recommends having hand sanitising stations posted throughout spas.Gyms in England have reopened as of Saturday, July .The news will come as a welcome relief to bulging Brits looking to regain their fitness, after months of gyms and leisure centres being shut.But there will be noticeable changes at these facilities to minimise the spread of coronavirus while adhering to new government guidelines.Health experts are believed to be satisfied fitness centres are safe to head back to following a steady decrease in Covid- cases.They will need to follow new rules such as limiting the number of people allowed to work out and equipment being thoroughly disinfected after each use.Changing rooms could also be closed and gym-goers will be told to arrive and leave in the same clothes.Gyms and leisure centres will be allowed to reopen in England from July , but at least a third of public facilities are expected to remain shut due to financial hardship.Health Secretary Matt Hancock has also confirmed that indoor gyms, swimming pools and other sport and exercise facilities will not reopen in Luton or Blackburn with Darwen due to an increase in coronavirus cases in those areas.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Recalling he owned a Mercedes sprinter van and had two dogs, Mr Kruimstoh told The Sun: “I was shocked when I suddenly saw his picture while searching for Maddie in the spring.“His departure from here in  was strange.“He gave me notice in the afternoon, got into his packed, small car, and after that I never heard from him again.“Naturally there is a good deal of speculation about whether the police want to dig here like they have been doing in Hanover.”German TV channel RTL reports that television teams and photographers from the UK, France, Belgium and the Netherlands “among others” flocked to Hanover to cover the search for clues in the disappearance of Madeleine McCann.But, the station added, not much is known as yet about the three-day probe of an abandoned allotment.The public prosecutors office in Braunschweig has not updated reporters on what –anything – has been found during the forensic investigation.Skys crime correspondent Martin Brunt described the search,  years after Madeleines abduction, a “dramatic development”.Locals are urging police to come and investigate ANOTHER allotment on a plot that was also rented by Christian B. The -year-old child sex fiend, who is the prime suspect in the search for Madeleine McCann, lived at the isolated garden house for three years after quitting the kiosk he ran.Locals are now urging police to come and dig at the site after they uncovered a cellar at his other garden in Hanover last night, some  miles away.The single storey building is at the end of a track close to a railway line in Braunschweig.Christian B lived on site there between  and  and was often seen with girlfriend Nakscije Mtari.He occupied the land at the same time when five-year-old Inga Gehricke, dubbed the ‘German Maddie’, vanished from a nearby forest during a family barbecue.The site is rumoured to have a cellar beneath it # just like the one dramatically discovered in Hanover yesterday.The Sun uncovered what appears to be a boarded up well at the property this morning. German police who searched a garden on the outskirts of Hannover, northern Germany, used excavators, snfer dogs, shovels and rakes to investigate the plot.Investigators put up two tents and continued to dig even further into the ground after they had cut down trees and bushes earlier this week, the German news agency dpa reported.Prosecutors did not say what the investigators were looking for.At the garden plot, investigators even removed parts of the foundation of a former cabin from the ground that once stood there, dpa reported.A man on a neighbouring plot told the news agency that the garden, where blackberry bushes and a cheery tree grow, had not been used for the last two years.The site was previously home to a German suspect linked to Madeleines disappearance.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Teenagers, it turns out, are a bit of an ordeal.Studies show that mums and dads of teens are  per cent more stressed than  years ago.There’s not just the financial pressures from teens, the constant keepie-uppie with phones, computers and fashion, but the added pleasure of social media.Then throw into the mix hormones, curfews, risky behaviours, smoking, drinking and sex and you have a ­wonderful pottage of purgatory.When your children reach their teens they need to question your authority in order to find the impetus to break away and become independent adults. And they don’t do this lightly. No, they make sure they also judge and question your parenting and basically suck the le out of you.For most of us women it also often coincides with the menopause and ­possibly mid-le crises. I mean, could there be a more perfect storm  Unsurprisingly, girls are more antagonistic towards the female parent. And research shows the task of setting limits for their teenagers falls more to mothers than it does to fathers.I have four childrenand they are all very dferent. One no longer lives at home. He’s  and is my Goldenballs, as his teenage years really lulled me into a  sense of security, being largely painless.I also have two girls, aged  and , plus a boy of . So far . . . and I do love you, girls, BUT . . . the boys are proving simpler, less complicated. Unconscious bias, possibly.Lockdown with these hoodlums forced me to question my sanity, made me feel like I was in freefall and wonder what the hell I had been thinking all those times in the past when my ­Fallopian tubes would jump for joy as soon as I saw a man.I’m a liberal parent. I haven’t sought to make my children my “friends” but I ­certainly wasn’t prepared for the ­contempt, defiance, audacity and ­confrontation that has arrived. About everything, from changing the toilet rollto rudeness , politenessand lack of empathy . I’m not allowed to utter the words, “Well, when I was a teenager”, because allegedly I’ve never been one.I can’t offer advice because I “don’t understand”. I’m not allowed to discipline because that’s “damaging”.I’ve been reprimanded for calling one of the Ungratefuls “lazy”. In modern times, this is “injurious and prejudicial”, I was told. Yes, she used those words. I did once try to explain that she’s intelligent and could go far. “Intelligent” is also detrimental to her mental wellbeing, I was informed.Give me strength.At the beginning of lockdown, I would cry out loud and scream from time to time — just to let off steam because I felt utterly trapped.And because I was parenting on my own, I guess there is no need for orce or separation or marriage breakdown now.But I felt utterly blindsided by the scale of the task because teens nowadays are savvy buggers who are well versed in conversations about ious “conditions” everyone seems to be struggling with — mental health, eating disorders, anxiety.Which is great. But not so great when you’re trying to run through a minefield to get to the other side before they ­criticise your parenting abilities and make you feel like a complete sham.Things have improved slightly. It was that or murder. But it has sapped me of all my energy and made me question what I was thinking when I thought that having kids was a great idea.I joke, of course. They can bring me enormous pleasure when they actually do change the toilet roll. Butyou think weaning and sleep-training is tough, wait until you join the Bewildered Mum Of Teens Club.A very close friend of mine always used to say: “Small children, small problems. Big children, big problems.” So enjoy your little eight-pounder while you can.I exaggerate not when I say I’m sometimes scared to open my mouth at home because one of the Ungratefuls has been a ­passionate advocate of social justice since she first strung a sentence together. Often, I am jokingly and harmlessly inappropriate and un-PC, only succeeding in pushing my middle-age boundaries in a woke world of righteous fundamentalists. But it was when my -year-old Ungrateful sat at the table with a look of absolute panic on his face that I realised things have gone too far. All he had asked his ­sister was: “Can you pass the black pepper  Or is that racist ”I WAS disturbed to learn that the puppy Katie Price bought for her -year-old daughter Princess died in an accident at home. There’s more than one lesson there for a young girl, I would have thought.I was equally disturbed to learn there has been an increase in people buying puppies during lockdown – because apparently, what  is there to do  Except puppies require a lot of work and attention, demand constant ­surveillance and are sentient beings with needs that require a long-term emotional and financial commitment.I worry about how many of these pets will be surrendered or neglected once “normal le” resumes.And why people won’t consider ­adopting rescue dogs when shelters and rescue centres are brimming with ownerless animals.A dog is for le. Not just for lockdown.LOVELY newsreader George Alagiah said that when he first came to England from Ghana at the age of  and headed to boarding school, he made damn sure he had a cut-glass English accent in order to avoid racist and classist bullies.As a foreigner who arrived from Sweden at the same age, I had the same ambition – I wanted to sound like the locals and did not want to stand out.I became all the more determined after slipping up when getting “soup” and “soap” confused, mistaking a sofa “suite” for a sofa “suit” and always referring to spiders’ “cod webs”.It burned like hell to be laughed at because you couldn’t speak properly.Now, I’m pleased to say, my grammar and English is often better than my peers’ because I had to learn everything from scratch and I didn’t want to attract attention.Until I decided on a job in TV, that is.HANDSOME Viking eye-candy Dolph Lundgren has just got engaged.

From the start, Kate was horried at the way Meghan spoke to staff members at Kensington Palace and it was clear they would never click in the way Princess Diana and Sarah Ferguson had once done.The now infamous tiara row, which I first revealed in November , was the culmination of many fallouts before the wedding.Afterwards, William and the Queen’s dresser and closest confidante, Angela Kelly, were united in their decision not to loan Meghan items from the Royal Collection, which included tiaras worn by Diana.As I began to report these stories, it is true to say Harry and Meghan became suspicious of their own staff, incorrectly believing they had been somehow hijacked by dark forces, the so-called “men in grey suits”, at Buckingham Palace.That categorisation is too simplistic.Who are these men  They may have existed in , but the senior figures in key roles behind the scenes within the Royal Family tend to be thoroughly modern members of the metropolitan elite these days.While it is correct to say they encouraged the couple to follow more conventional processes in terms of their dealings with other royal households and the Press, the real-le Sussex Squad was doggedly committed to the couple’s principles and goals.For example, their communications chief Sara Latham — blamed by Meghan for any negative stories in British newspapers — was a highly successful opera- tor who had worked for Hillary Clinton.She was prepared to pack up her le in London and move to Africa with the couple perman- ently to help achieve their humanitarian goals.Much official time and energy was put into the South African relocation planonly for the couple to eventually brand it too dficult.Instead, Harry and Meghan foolishly began to rely almost entirely on advice provided by a small team of fiercely loyal Hollywood advisers.I managed to unpick details of this secret cabal throughout the latter half of last year, but they had been causing major headaches for Buckingham Palace long before that.The group — attorney Rick Genow, business manager Andrew Meyer and talent agent Nick Collins — are typical Hollywood “Yes” people.Just as important were her PR advisers from the controversial crisis management firm Sunshine Sachs, specically Shawn Sachs and Keleigh Thomas Morgan.They had all become close with Meghan while she was a moderate star on the cable TV legal drama Suits, an era when she was so desperate for coverage in magazines she would even set up shots with paparazzi photog- raphers.She kept the Hollywood crew largely on the sidelines during the early days of her courtship with Harry. But as tensions with royal courtiers increased, so too did Meghan’s contact with them.It was this team who bunkered down with Meghan over Christmas and New Year in Canada, secretly drafting the content for the Sussex Royal website that, when published,like a Hollywood press release than a statement of intent by two senior members of the British Royal Family.Much has been written about how I broke the story of Megxit, with the finger incorrectly being pointed at both Clarence House and Kensington Palace.The couple like to promote the idea that they were somehow ambushed into revealing their plans after we published the world exclusive on January .However, they neglect to mention I had originally put the story to their office ten days earlier and had discussed every aspect of what we eventually published with their officials.It is not a coincidence my first story of the move included details of the Sussexes’ unhappiness about the release of photographs over Christmas featuring the Queen, Charles, William and George.The biography goes further by pointing to the absence of a picture of Harry, Meghan and Archie on the Queen’s table during her annual Christmas Day message.It is inconceivable to me that this wasn’t a purposeful slight by the institution, trying to make a point to Harry and Meghan: “Come back and join the party during events like Christmas or we’ll pretend you don’t exist.”It backfired spectacularly.So can such a toxic relationship be healed There is a growing acknowledgement from both sides that so long as Harry and Meghan’s romantic relationship remains strong, that is highly unlikely.But this book is a spectacular own goal by a couple who like to insist they are opposed to bitchy off-the-record briefings and royal revelations using source quotes slagging off other members of The Firm.Because fundamentally, that’s all Finding Freedom is.Unlike Andrew Morton’s game-changing Diana: Her True Story, there is no revelation that makes you think dferently about what went on.A couple desperate to blame others for their unwise decisions have allowed a fanboy “journalist” to confirm a whole load of newspaper exclusives, which they incidentally denied at the time, but spun with their own, often , narrative.Harry and Meghan are not victims of the media, the establishment or the British public.I will never forget that beautul spring day in May  when the entire country celebrated a royal wedding with the type of hope and joy not seen since July , when Charles and Diana tied the knot.It was one of those rare moments, like the London  Olympics, when we celebrated as one.This couple had the world at their feet — superstardom and influence any film actor or pop star would dream of, but without the cumbersome pressure of the throne hanging over them, like the Cambridges.They had a very real chance to help reinvent and modernise the monarchy from within.What a tragedy they have chosen to focus their energies on settling scores in tawdry tell-alls and unnecessary courtroom battles.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

If you live in the affected areas, you should not visit someones home or garden regardless of whether this is in or outside of the restricted area.The mixup came as England was hit with  new positive cases – the highest number in  days – adding to fears the country is facing a second wave of the virus.But the sudden new rules - which means that people can still go to work and even visit shops and cafes - have left Brits reeling after they were introduced about .pm, barely three hours before they were put into force.Prime Minister Boris Johnson is expected to discuss the matter in his coronavirus press conference today.What the new rules mean:About .million people will be affected by the new lockdown rules - which are expected to be subject to a weekly review.The affected areas include all of the .million residents of Greater Manchester, as well as the Lancashire towns of Blackburn, Burnley, Hyndburn, Pendle and Rossendale.West Yorkshire, Bradford, Calderdale and Kirklees were also hit.Leicester was also included in the households ban, but pubs, restaurants and hairdressers will reopen on Monday.However, leisure centres, gyms and pools will remain closed.Earlier Mr Hancock has admitted Muslims living in the area will have their Eid celebrations affected.He said: My heart goes out to the Muslim community. I know that this will have a particular impact on Eid celebrations. Weve been working with Imams and religious leaders to ensure that Eid celebrations can go ahead in a co-vid secure way in mosques and there are some really innovative proposals to celebrate in parks where social distancing is easier and theres more space. But it does mean, for everybody, meetings between households wont be possible and of course that has a particular impact when theres a celebration like Eid coming up for the Muslim community. Baroness Sayeeda Warsi today slammed the lack of clarity over the message on Good Morning Britain, saying she had received calls up to am overnight by confused members of the community.She said: “There is still not clarity on whether that means you can meet outdoors, thankfully there is still some clarication that those mosques that had prepared for Covid Eid prayers with the proper procedures would be allowed to go ahead.“People have voluntarily been part of this response and I think it would have been better to do this with a little more understanding and clarity.”Labour leader Keir Starmer said he would not argue with local action to reduce the transmission of the virus but said: Announcing measures affecting potentially millions of people late at night on Twitter is a new low for the government’s communications during this crisis.He added: For all the bluster, government has failed to deliver a ing track and trace system that would spot local flare ups like these.Lucy Powell, the MP for Manchester Central, said she had been blindsided by the new rules.And Health Secretary Matt Hancock this morning was left trying to defend the move, saying the move had been absolutely necessary.Speaking to Sky News, he said the new rules were crystal clear, saying the test and trace data had shown most of the transmission is happening between households.He added: Everyone can see that the problem with this virus is it thrives on the social contact that makes le worth living.The Health Secretary had last night said he was introducing the new measures with a heavy heart - tweeting the announcement at .pm with details published two hours later before the full guidelines were released this morning.Manchester mayor Andy Burnham said there had been a “marked change” across his boroughs in recent days.Speaking on Good Morning Britain today, he said: The truth of the matter is the pub is a more regulated environment, as is public transport where people are supposed to wear face masks.The home is a less regulated.And he defended the sudden introduction of the new guidelines, saying the virus could move quickly.Lib Dem leader Ed Davey wrote: How this lockdown in Manchester, East Lancs  West Yorks has been introduced is worrying, confusing, frustrating and damaging.No-one doubts these are dficult decisions - but when lives of millions of people are involved, Ministers have a duty to communicate professionally.Others took issue with Wigan being included in the fresh lockdown rules, saying that it had been lumped in with Greater Manchesters rise without recording an increase itself.One local tweeted: Wigan has the lowest rate of cases in Greater Manchester... its not our fault other parts of Manchester are letting the side down.Another added: Wigan has  cases per , and is on lockdown. City of London has  cases per , and no lockdown.

The R rate has become an essential way of the government measuring its success in dealing with coronavirus in the UK.It measures the rate of infection that averages how many people are being infected by one person, with officials using this data to guide the UK out of lockdown.Scientists use it to predict how far and how fast a disease will spread - and the number can also inform policy decisions about how to contain an outbreak.For example,a virus has an R of three, it means that every sick person will pass the disease on to three other peopleno containment measures are introduced.Its also worth pointing out that the R is a measure of how infectious a disease is, but not how deadlyThe R rate indicates how fast coronavirus is likely to spread, and it ies across the UK.Speaking at a press conference this afternoon Mr Johnson said he would not let the virus threaten more heartache across the country.He today announced that some businesses that were set to open tomorrow will no longer be able to open their doors.Place such as casinos and bowling alleys will no longer be able to reopen and this guidance will be updated in two weeks.The Prime Minister also said that he wasnt willing to take the risk when it comes to weddings.Wedding receptions of up to  people will not be permitted, but ceremonies can go ahead with the Covid guidlines, he said.He did however say that shielding rules will still be relaxed from tomorrow, allowing more vulnerable people to get back to normal le.Mr Johnson said the government would study the data and would re-open when we can.However chief medical officer Chris Whitty said we are likely to be at the limit of what we can do when it comes to opening up society once more.Dr Daniel Lawson, Lecturer in Statistical Science, School of Mathematics, University of Bristol said the data from the ONS provides some data of an increase.When cases are low, the average reproduction rate can still be below  but we can see an increase in cases by chance, because cases tend to occur in bursts within a community, which should be capturedtest and trace systems are working.  We can also see an increase in cases by changes in testing or reporting.“Decisions must be made in the face of this uncertainty, such as the announcement that the UK is pausing easing.He added that evidence from Europe implies that we should take the apparent increase seriously, as acting too late can make lockdowns longer and increase mortality.Dr Lawson added that the UK is close to the tipping point and said we should prepare for further rapid action.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It needs fixing.One million people are already receiving it and by the time the system is fully rolled out in , nearly  million will be on it.But there are big problems with the flagship new system - it takes  weeks to get the first payment and it could leave some families worse off by thousands of pounds a year.And while working families can claim back up to  per cent of their childcare costs, they must find the money to pay for childcare upfront - we’ve heard of families waiting up to  months for the money.Working parents across the country told us they’ve been unable to take on more hours - or have even turned down better paid jobs or more hours because of the amount they get their benefits cut.It’s time to Make Universal Credit work. We want the Government to:Together, these changes will help Make Universal Credit Work.Join our Universal Credit Facebook group or email UniversalCredit@the-sun to share your story. And he added: “Most people, including our Committee, broadly agree with the original aims and objectives of Universal Credit. However, in its current form it fails to provide a dependable safety net. It has led to an unprecedented number of people relying on foodbanks and not being able to pay their rent.He said some features of the system were harming women, disabled people and the vulnerable.And he added: “Universal Credit needs more money to catch up after  years of cuts to the social security budget and substantial reform to its design.“The five-week wait for a first payment must be replaced by a non-repayable two-week grant to all claimants.The Lords report also recommends that the punitive taper rate should be reduced - another aim of The Suns campaign - to encourage more people into work.And it says all claimants should have a higher work allowance to allow them to keep more of their hard-earned cash too.The Lords also conclude that including childcare support in Universal Credit was a mistake and paying in arrears is a huge barrier to work - as we have repeatedly highlighted.In some cases it has been a disincentive to work, the report says.The Government should remove childcare support from Universal Credit and be made into a new standalone benefit paid, it added.Jonathan Reynolds MP, Labours Shadow Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, said of the report: “Sadly, this report confirms what many have known for a long time – Universal Credit is simply not working. There is clear consensus that the system is not delivering on its objectives and is instead pushing people further into poverty and debt.Ministers should listen to their Conservative colleagues’ calls for a reformed social security system.The DWP said in response to the report it would consider their recommendations in detail.Minister for Welfare Delivery Will Quince said of the report: “The case for Universal Credit has never been stronger. The system defied its critics in unprecedented and unforeseeable circumstances, processing more than .m new claims at pace since mid-March and paying more than a million advances worth hundreds of millions of pounds to those in urgent need within days.“We remain committed to supporting the most vulnerable in society, which is why we currently spend over £ billion a year on the benefits system. We’ve also increased the Universal Credit standard allowance by up to £, a year, as part of a package of welfare measures worth over £. billion.“We welcome the acknowledgement by the Committee that Universal Credit is here to stay and we will consider their recommendations in detail.”IF youre experiencing trouble applying for your Universal Credit, or the payments just dont cover costs, here are your options:Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It was straight into my purse and then I put the payment through on card and showed them the receipt.“I should not have done it but I don’t like to let people down and a lot of these customers depend on us, coming to us every day.”More than a thousand people angered by the sacking have signed an online petition calling for her to be re-employed or compensated.The petition says: Megan Metcalfe was sacked for being kind to her elderly customers in Birds Bakery, after  years of service.“We the people of Nottingham think that decision is absolutely disgusting, no matter the companys Covid- rules on payment processing, the decision to treat a loyal employee this way for a letimes service is beyond belief.It should be handled more appropriately via a simple disciplinary meeting or just pulled to one side and explained why her actions are not appropriate.“But to be sacked, thats not the actions of a reputable employer and well-known brand like Birds.It comes just days after a -year-old woman was told she couldnt buy bread from Birds bakery because she didnt have a bank card.Former hosiery worker Edna Dalchin has never owned a bank card and prefers to pay with cash.She was stunned and embarrassed when staff told her to put items back because they could not take her money.Lesley Bird, chief operating officer at Birds Bakery, said: “At Birds, we take the safety of our staff and customers very seriously – and have very tight procedures in place during this pandemic.“A lot of our customer base are the elderly – many of them vulnerable – and it is our responsibility to keep them, and our staff, safe.“Like many other food outlets, during this pandemic we have asked customers to only use debit cards because notes and coins are not clean – and this poses a risk to our staff who are handling that money.“In the case of Megan Metcalfe she was taking cash from customers and then making payments with her own card.“This contravenes our current health and safety policy relating to Covid- and is also against company regulations.“It was with regret that we had to ask Megan to leave the business because of those two issues.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Greater Manchester Mayor said there were gaping holes in the system, which would cause unacceptable risk to communities. And he called for support for aposshieldingapos people - due to be ended across England tomorrow - to be extended for regions under increased restrictions.Holding a press conference in the wake of his region being placed under stricter coronavirus restrictions, he called for the government to be clearer in communicating changes.He said: We would strongly recommend to the government that at the time a public or media statement is made affecting any area across the country, it must then follow that detailed information is immediately available at the same time as the making of that statement. He added: We feel that would have led to a much better handling of the information in this case...that didnapost happen here, and I think that has caused some uncertainty and confusion and stress for some of our residents. Mr Burnham said he was only given a matter of hoursapos notice before the new restrictions were introduced in a pm tweet and statement from Health Secretary Matt Hancock on Thursday night. The Mayor said there were holes in the governmentaposs Test and Trace system - which identies people who have contracted coronavirus and tries to track down people they have been in contact with. Mr Burnham called for more data sharing from the national system to local government. If the national team havenapost managed to reach someone whoaposs tested positive for Covid- within a day or so then their details should be escalated to the local authority. He said local teams had a much higher success rate in reaching positive cases. And he called for more financial support for lower paid workers who are ordered to stay at home by contact tracers. He said: There are many people in the areas which have recently been subject to these new restrictions - Greater Manchester, West Yorkshire, East Lancashire - who are not employed in jobs that support them to self-isolate. They know they may not be paidthey do that in a zero-hours job, or indeed they may fear they may lose their jobthey self-isolate.  He said even for those who have access to Statutory Sick Pay, it isnapost high enough. We feel this explains one of the reasons for lower success rate of the national test and trace system in more deprived areas. People know they canapost say to the person calling them what they want to hear. Or also theyaposre reluctant to give the names of contacts knowing that they wonapost be in a position either to listen to whataposs being said. He called on the government to urgently address the issue, reaching an agreement with employers for all employees to get two weeks of full paytheyaposre asked to self-isolate. If we donapost fix that hole in the system our test and trace arrangements will not be strong enough going into the winter, and they need to be, he added.  Mr Burnham also called on the government to extend support for aposshieldingapos people at increased risk from Covid- until the local restrictions are eased again. The shielding point I think is tremendously important. It cannot feel right for someone being at home today whoaposs been shielding for months, to hear that new restrictions are coming in in Greater Manchester and to fear what that might mean - and then to hear that aposoh, your support is about to be withdrawn and you have to go out to the shops to get your own.apos Clearly the government must be able to see that there is a mismatch in that messaging that will cause real anxiety in peopleaposs minds.

People in the whole of Greater Manchester may no longer meet anyone from outside their household indoors - including homes, pubs and gardens. The affected area also includes parts of West Yorkshire and Lancashire. However, people are allowed to continue to meet outdoors as long as they stay socially distanced. They can still go to work, travel, and go to the pub - though only with their own household. With the laws now dfering across England and the short notice, many people in Greater Manchester, Lancashire and West Yorkshire are confused about what they can and canapost do. Hereaposs the best explanation we can provide of what laws apply, where. Where the law will apply Greater Manchester:City of Manchester Trafford Stockport Oldham Bury Wigan Bolton Tameside Rochdale SalfordLancashire:Blackburn with Darwen Burnley Hyndburn Pendle RossendaleWest Yorkshire:Bradford Calderdale Kirklees What you can be fined for - and how much New laws will be passed to ban meeting people from other households in private homes or gardens. Police will be able to fine offenders £ for a first offence, doubling on each subsequent offence. Under previous similar laws the maximum fine was £,. Fines halvepaid within  days. There will be some exceptions, such as for household bubbles . Other rules - like not visiting care homes, not socialising with people in pubs, and not sharing cars - look set to be guidance rather than the law. However, there is already a nationwide legal ban on gatherings over  people outdoors and people must legally wear a face covering in shops and on public transport. We donapost yet know when the law will be published or take effect.What you canapost do You canapost meet up with friends or family indoors If you live in the above areas, you may no longer meet anyone from outside your household indoors. aposIndoorsapos includes private homes, businesses like pubs and restaurants, and private gardens . The exception is for people who are part of the same aposbubbleapos - more on this below. When it comes to private homes and gardens, this rule will be enforced by law with fines of £. In the rest of England, there is no longer a law on meeting people from other households indoors. However, guidance says meetings should comprise no than two households, and be socially distanced.   You canapost go to the pub with anyone outside your own household If you live in the above areas, you may still go to pubs, restaurants, bars and other venues that reopened from July . However, you may only go with members of your own household. You must not socialise with people you do not live with in other indoor public venues. You canapost go to a pub beer garden with anyone outside your own household Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the ban on socialising in indoor public venues will include pub beer gardens. This means you cannot go to the pub socially with anyone from outside your household - whether youaposre indoors or outdoors.  You canapost meet friends and family in their garden The ban on meeting other households in indoor spaces includes private gardens - even though theyaposre outdoors. This is because to get there, you often have to pass through the house. You canapost have visitors to your home from outside the new lockdown area You may not have visitors to your home from outside the new lockdown area. This will be illegal. But you can meet them in a pubic area like a parkyou follow social distancing rules.  You canapost visit relatives in care homes Last week the government announced care home visits in England could finally resume.  But in the new lockdown areas, care home visits will not resume. Guidance for them says: You should not visit friends or family in care homes, other than in exceptional circumstances. Care homes should restrict visits to these circumstances. You canapost travel in a car with people outside your household The guidance for the new lockdown area says: You should try not to share a vehicle with those outside your household or social bubble. If you need to, try to share the vehicle with the same people each time, keep to small groups and open windows for ventilation. You should also sit as far apart as possible within the vehicle, wear face coverings and clean the inside thoroughly and regularly. You shouldnapost travel to the lockdown area from Scotland The Scottish government issued new guidance today advising people living in Scotland not to travel to the new lockdown areas at all. The guidance says: Travel between Scotland and Greater Manchester, East Lancashire and parts of West Yorkshire should only be undertakenabsolutely essential. Anyone currently in the affected areas does not need toto Scotland early - but should be extra vigilant in monitoring for symptoms.What you can do You can meet up with friends or family outdoors People in the new lockdown area can continue to meet people outside their household in outdoor spaces - like a park, forest or the beach. This is still in line with guidance for the rest of England. The law only restricts gatherings of more than  people. However, guidance says you should only meet in groups of up to two households, or six people - whichever is larger. Each household should remain socially distant from each other.  You can meet people in your aposbubbleapos indoors Since June , people in England have been able to form a support bubble with one other household. To qualy, one of the two households has to have only one adult in it. For example, a single mum or a granddad living alone. If youaposre in a bubble, you can continue this even in the new lockdown areas like Greater Manchester. You should basically treat your two-household bubble asit is one household. You can stop shielding from tomorrow Most of the .million aposextremely clinically vulnerableapos people in England can stop shielding tomorrow. This means they can be asked toto work, and follow the same social distancing rules as the rest of the populationthey wish. This is unchanged in most of the new lockdown area. People in Greater Manchester, for example, can still stop shielding tomorrow. Exceptions are Luton and Blackburn with Darwen, where shielding should continue to August . In Leicester shielding also continues until at least August  and could run in some parts of the city beyond that.  You can go to work and use public transportneeded People living inside and outside of the new area can continue to travel in and out for work Workplaces must implement Covid- Secure guidance. Public transport will continue running for those who need it, with face coverings worn by all. You can have tradesmen in your home The guidance is not explicit on whether plumbers, builders or repair workers can work in your home in the new lockdown area. However, the government said they can continue to do so as before. You can travel in and out of the area You may continue to travel in and out of the new lockdown area, as long as you do not break the rules on meetings indoors. People from outside can take holidays in the new lockdown area,they follow the local rules. People who live inside the new area should continue to follow the ban on meeting other households indoors, eventheyaposre outside the zone at the time.  You can go to cafes, restaurants, the gym and other venues - but only with members of your own household All the venues that reopened on July  remain open, with a few exceptions in local areas where there is an outbreak. But you should only go with members of your own household – evenyou are going outside of the restricted area. You can go to a place of worship You can go to a place of worship, but you must socially distance from people outside of your household. The place of worship should also be following Covid-secure guidelines to keep people apart. Officials recommend at this time that,possible, prayer or religious services take place outdoors. This includes mosques, which are celebrating Eid. "},{"url":null,"title":"dont blame muslims matt hancock","story":"NewsopinionDont blame the Muslims, Matt Hancock.

Itaposs natural that people want to shoot the messenger, butyou donapost read the column, donapost like the column you read, or donapost understand the words in it, then you leave me no choice. I shall just have to communicate with you more clearly.And Matt Hancock agrees. He is, as he felt necessary to point out to Radio  listeners this morning, the Health Secretary in the middle of a global pandemic, so you will excuse me for being concerned about the health of the British public. Yeah. Itaposs the other stuff thereaposs no excuse for, Matthew.Announcing a local lockdown,  hours before it began, for .m people on a social media site whose users are % affluent millennials, Mr Hancock said: The spread is largely due to households meeting and not abiding to social distancing.Except the government messaging on social distancing is so chaotic that % of Brits have no idea what the rules are any more.When was the last time you heard a government minister remind you to wash your hands  Itaposs been weeks*. Compare that, class, to the last time you heard a government minister say that masks were not really necessary. You may find that one has been signicantly more recent, and effective, than the other. The people of Rochdale, Leicester, Blackburn, Burnley, Calderdale, Rossendale, Kirklees, Bradford, Hyndburn, Pendle, and Greater Manchester are more likely to be meeting up with others in non-socially distant situations because thataposs the nature of the jobs they are more likely to do, and Boris Johnson ordered them all back to work a fortnight ago. Those areas have lower wages, higher occupancy housing, and more manufacturing. More towns, and fewer villages. None of those things are consistent with staying metres apart, and a month ago the government told them not to bother so much with that, anyway.The people who live there are also more likely to have health conditions which make them more susceptible, and the government told them to stop shielding yesterday . Worldwide, the two factors consistently linked to lower coronavirus rates are early lockdowns and comprehensive testing.We locked down late, as even the Prime Minister grudgingly half-agrees, and our world-beating test and trace system is about the worldaposs worst. Of the .m coronavirus home testing kits sent through the post, only m have been processed. These privately-provided, non-NHS tests are complex, unpleasant, must be collected quickly to be viable, and some people report them being damaged or dropped in a puddle by the courier. Eventhey are sent back, the chances of a  negative are somewhere between  in  and  in . Either way, .m people who should have been tested werenapost. And a fortnight ago, Hancock announced an urgent review of... the way deaths are counted, which may be a few hundred out and therefore making the government look so much worse than it really is. Caposmere, thereaposs more! In June it was revealed that outsourced, inexperienced, Serco tracers contacted an average of . people each. Trained Public Health England officials found  people each. The multi-million-pound private contracts which lost .m tests and needed  members of staff to trace  human were in the gt of, under the oversight of, and signed off by, Matt Hancock.And just yesterday he told the Royal College of Physicians that in future the health service must draw on the ideas and expertise of the private sector because people donapost care who has provided the test. They care itaposs not you, Matt.And he added that bureaucracy - translation: public servants whoaposve done a better job than him thus far - must be cut. There are no ideologues in a pandemic, he trilled, despite the fact he has stuck to the ideology of a competitive, open market in healthcare through the piling-up of, to date, , corpses.  The government guidance, issued overnight on the same fag packet that contains all the previous guidance, says people can go to restaurants with members of their own households, but not pubsthereaposs a stranger there.They can leave the restricted area to go to work, but people from outside the restricted area cannot come to visit. They cannot meet people in gardens, but they can meet in parks. They should use public transport, and must use masks, but no-one will tell them offthey donapost. Oh, and it also claims West Yorkshire is now in the North West. See, Matt, this is why no-one listens to you. You couldnapost find your arse with a map, because you canapost read a map. But itaposs not Mattaposs fault. No. Itaposs the Spanish, whose infection rate is still lower than ours, or the second wave that is not sweeping Europe. For preference, though, itaposs the disease-ridden Muslims the finger is pointed at. So letaposs pepper the order to lockdown with references to the Islamic festival of Eid-al-Adha, which canapost be blamed for any of this because it only started yesterday.Matt does hope you have a nice time, butall those wonderfully-erse, one-quarter ethnic minority places could stay at home, go to work, sit in a park, go to the pub, go to mosque, and take the blame for the omnicrapshambles heaposs made of everything, that would be wonderful.Because letaposs be perfectly clear. The infection rate has tripled in the past week in Oxford, the High Peak, and Watford, doubled in Brighton and Tunbridge Wells, increased by a factor of  in the Ribble Valley and Bolsover, and no-one is telling the residents of those places to behave themselves better. Because in Oxford, the worst of these listed, coronavirus is in just .% of the population.Meanwhile, the infection rate in Blackburn with Darwen which is the worst district in the country, is .%. Last week, when lockdown wasnapost necessary, it was .%.We just canapost ignore this evidence, say Matt and his mates, who have all happily ignored calls for an inquiry into why people from black, Asian and minority ethnic communities are more likely to catch and die from coronavirus.They also ignore the fact the infection rate in care homes a couple of months ago was %, that they didnapost find it necessary to do much about it, and those same care homes have just been told thereaposll be no more tests for  weeks.Theyaposd much rather you think corona is on the march, and thataposs thanks to the poor, brown people who wonapost stay indoors and definitely not down to the rich, white people who wonapost shut up. Theyaposd like to terry everyone about a surge for which there is, at present, no clear or consistent evidence. Because the only time this government scored good approval ratings was back in early April, when we were all scared and Dominic Cummingsapos eyesight was of no concern.

Shortly after pm on Thursday, Health Secretary Matt Hancock announced that from midnight, people from dferent households in Greater Manchester, parts of Lancashire and parts of Yorkshire were no longer allowed to meet indoors. It means people in these areas will not be permitted to mix with other households - apart from those in their support bubbles - in private homes or gardens. Some exemptions will be put in place, including for the vulnerable, the government said. They will sign new regulations to make these changes legally enforceable. The regulations will give local authorities and police forces the powers to enforce these restrictions. Households may go to hospitality, for instance bars and pubs, but new guidance will make clear that two households should not go to hospitality together. Meanwhile local leaders and government have today agreed a number of changes to local restrictions in other areas. Below are the areas affected by the new restriction... Greater Manchester The rules apply to the whole of Greater Manchester after a number of hotspots were identied.

Boris Johnsonaposs update to the nations just as millions affected by new local lockdowns in northern England coronavirus hot-spots face were told to follow stricter new rules, and with little notice. Residents of Greater Manchester, and parts of East Lancashire and West Yorkshire were plunged into chaos overnight as new Covid- restrictions were brought in. The ban took effect from midnight with just three hoursapos warning, and prohibit people from meeting other households in all indoor settings, including private homes and gardens. At a press conference this afternoon, the Prime Minister outlined the reason for the new lockdowns, saying he had warned the Government would act aposswtly and decisivelyapos to stamp out local outbreaks - and more areas could follow. He also announced rule changes affecting all of England, declaring face coverings would be compulsory in more indoor settings including cinemas and churches. He postponed reopening of more settings including ice rinks, casinos and bowling alleys for another fortnight, along with wedding receptions of more than  people. He also put off reopening close-contact services - meaning beauty treatments like brows and facials due to restart tomorrow that many Brits will have booked in must be cancelled.  Englandaposs Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty warned the UK had potentially aposreached the limitapos of how much society could reopen, as infections rise once again. Here are the key changes and rules you need to know about from tomorrow, August . All these venues are able to remain in most of England providing they can show they are aposCovid-secureapos:Hotels and BBs Holiday apartments or homes Cottages or bungalows Campsites Caravan parks Boarding houses Places of worship Libraries Community centres Restaurants, cafes and workplace canteens Bars Pubs Gyms Cinemas Nail bars Beauty salons Swimming pools, lidos and water parks Bingo halls Theatres and concert halls - but on the basis it’s not a live performance. They can only screen past performances for example Museums and galleries Hair salons and barbers Outdoor playgrounds Outdoor gyms Funfairs Theme parks Adventure parks and activities Amusement arcades Other indoor leisure centres and facilities - including indoor gaming, social clubs, model villages, and indoor attractions at aquariums and zoos. Face coverings and masks Face masks will be compulsory in more indoor spaces, in one of the biggest changes announced today affecting all of England. The coverings are already mandatory on public transport, unless you have a medical reason or disability that allows you to be exempt from the rules. That includes conditions like asthma, and also people accompanying someone with a condition who needs to be able to lip-read their companion. From August  the new rules will become law, and will required face coverings be worn in indoor settings where it is dficult to practise social distancing - including cinemas, galleries and houses of worship like churches. The PM will ask police to crack down harder on those breaking the rules. Read more about this rule change here.  You can visit cinemas, galleries and museums - but not have a big wedding reception Wedding receptions of more than  people have been banned throughout England with just  hours notice. Rules were set to change from August  in England to allow small, socially-distanced receptions of up to  people. However, the move was one of those postponed for at least two weeks today by Boris Johnson.  Wedding ceremonies of up to  people have already been allowed in England since July  and can continue - including in Greater Manchester, which is among the northern areas facing separate restrictions from today. However, guests must be socially-distanced and the ceremony must follow Covid-secure guidelines.  With face coverings mandatory in places of worship from August  - though itaposs not yet clearthereaposll be exemptions for the bride and groom. The PM also postponed the reopening of more indoor gatherings and businesses that were due to restart tomorrow. Casinos, bowling alleys, skating rinks and remaining close contact services must remain closed, he said Indoor performances will not resume - ruling out live music, theatre, and dance, and indoor classes. Larger crowds in sports venues and conference centres will also remain off limits Wedding receptions of up to  people will not be permitted, but ceremonies can continue to take place, in line with coronavirus guidelines. You can get a haircut - but you still canapost get your brows done Hairdressers and barbers remain open with protective measures - including face visors for those cutting hair. Nail and beauty salons are now open too. Beauty salons were given the go ahead to re-open on July , just over a week after hairdressers were given the green light. But there remains restrictions on procedures including eyebrow treatments, facials, eye lash tinting and face waxing. More treatments were due to be allowed from tomorrow, August . However the PM today announced the changes due to take effect on Saturday would be postponed at least another fortnight. What you still canapost do anywhere in England:  Large wedding receptions Attend sports matches in a large crowd Big gigs Nightclubs Casino Bowling alleys and skating rinks Indoor play areas including soft play Tattoo and piercing studios Massage parlours Indoor fitness and dance studios Conference centres, other than people who already work thereYou can visit friends and family indoors - but you still canapost hug People in most of England can have friends and family round to their house to eat, hang out and stay overnight - but they still can’t hug. You can also meet in all indoor settings like pubs and restaurants, provided they follow social distancing rules. Indoor gatherings will be allowed between two households who havenapost joined together in a “bubble”. Bubbles - a permanent joining of two households which let people break social distancing rules and stay over - still havenapost been expanded. Currently bubbles can be formed of two households. One of the bubble households has to have only one adult in it, such as a grandparent living alone, a single parent with kids, or a couple who live apart where at least one lives alone. Your household is allowed to meet with one other household at a time. That potentially includes staying over at someone’s house, as long as social distancing rules are followed indoors. More on the changes to these rules for northern lockdowns follow below.  Meeting outdoors Currently up to six people from up to six households can meet in a park or garden,they maintain social distancing - and that hasnapost changed for most of England except in the new lockdown areas. Two households of any size - for example, two families of four - can also meet outdoors, as long as they maintain social distancing. So you can either meet five friends from dferent households, or an unlimited number of friends from one household. This is guidance. The law only prohibits gatherings of more than  people - except for indoor gatherings in the new lockdown area . You can go to the pub - but you can only meet one other household inside Pubs, bars, restaurants, cafes and workplace canteens remain open. If youaposre indoors, you can only meet with people from one other household. And you should still maintain social distancing rules. That means staying either two metres apart, or one metre apart with mitigation measuresyou canapost manage two metres. It means no propping up the bar or standing in groups, and pubs will be encouraged to have table service where possible. All venues - from pubs to places of worship - will be expected to keep a record of people who visit, to enable contact tracing. More on the changes to these rules for northern lockdowns follow below.  You can go on staycation to English hotels, BBs and campsites - but not hostels Hotels, BBs, holiday apartments or homes, cottages or bungalows, campsites, caravan parks and boarding houses are all reopen to paying guests in England. They must follow coronavirus guidelines - but people will be able to stay overnight away from their home. Despite concerns over shared facilities, campsites are reopen too, as long as they have showers and washing-up blocks. Hostels with shared bedrooms cannot yet reopen. The government has not said people in northern regions cannot travel. People in the new lockdown zone, such as Greater Manchester, may continue to travel in and out of the new lockdown area, as long as you do not break the rules on meetings indoors.Large wedding receptions Attend sports matches in a large crowd Big gigs Nightclubs Casinos Bowling alleys and skating rinks Indoor play areas including soft play Tattoo and piercing studios Massage parlours Indoor fitness and dance studiosYou canapost send your child to school Only years R,  and  are allowed back to primary schools in England at the moment. The government wants all children back in September - but was forced to drop plans to do it earlier. Boris Johnson said today getting kids back to school by September remains a aposnational priority.apos  Shielding people can meet groups of friends outside Shielding was eased for .million vulnerable people in England earlier this morng. Shielding people can go out and meet up to five friends - andthey live alone, form a aposbubbleapos with another household. From August , the advice to shield ends completely. But Statutory Sick Pay and direct food parcels for the shielding will also end tomorrow. You canapost play cricket, football or rugby, except with your own household Recreation and sport will be allowed. But people should only play close-contact team sports - like football and rugby - with other members of their household. And indoor facilities including changing rooms and courts will remain closed. Cricket is also off limits for now - with Boris Johnson saying the ball is a natural vector of disease.  You can go back to the office or use public transport -your workplace is apossafeapos Guidelines on avoiding public transport unless itaposs absolutely necessary remain. The government has been urging workplaces to begin reopeningthey can follow social distancing guidelines indoors safely. Everyone  should carry on working from homeat all possible. You can travel abroad - with limits You can travel abroad - and aposair bridgesapos mean no quarantine for Brits heading back from summer holidays in some parts of Europe and farther afield. However the limits of the policy have been felt by Spain holidaymakers, after a series of outbreaks sparked the UK government to close the air bridge abruptly. The UK allows travellers coming from a select list of countries to arrive without a -day quarantine period, including Brits ing from holidays from those countries. See which countries remain on the air bridge list here.  Lockdown changes for Greater Manchester, east Lancashire, and West Yorkshire New laws are being passed to ban meeting people from other households in private homes or gardens, or travelling in cars together. People can still meet in a public area like a parkthey follow social distancing rules. People will also still be able to visit pubs or restaurants - but only with their own households, and they canapost meet up with others indoors - even in beer gardens. They also wonapost be able to visit care homes. There will be some exceptions, such as for household bubbles. The government shortly after midnight updated guidance saying the government would pass new laws to enforce changes to the new northern lockdowns. While it made clear people will be fined £ for breaking the rules in the localised restrictions, the law to enforce it did not exist at the time the lockdowns kicked in.

In their  manesto the Conservatives pledged that free TV licences for the over s would be retained. But on Saturday this much-loved benefit comes to an end. The Tories are trying to pin the blame on the BBC but the responsibility lies entirely with them. They made a promise and now they are refusing to abide by their word. No wonder so many people feel betrayed. Free TV licences are not a perk. They are a leline for millions of pensioners for whom the telly is a source of companionship and a window into the outside world. The decision is especially cruel when so many older people are having to shield because of coronavirus. A government with a conscience would find the money to enable the BBC to maintain the benefit. In failing to do so this Tory administration has shown it is shameless and heartless. Utter failure Boris Johnson is kidding nobody when he claims his handling of the coronavirus outbreak has been a ‘massive success’. The figures from the Office for National Statistics tell the real story – England has the highest number of excess deaths in Europe. An estimated , residents have died in care homes after patients were discharged from hospital without being tested.

And she was sacked when bosses found out - bringing to a sudden end a -year career with the same company.Megan Metcalfe told NottinghamshireLive that she was given her marching orders as her actions were deemed to amount to gross misconduct. Popular Birds Bakery has not been accepting cash for hygiene reasons since reopening following the coronavirus lockdown.They say it is to minimise any risk to staff and customers.  Yesterday, we reported how a -year-old customer was shocked and embarrassed when a Birds branch refused to sell her bread because she only had cash.And today Megan told of how many of the customers at the Birds store where she worked, in Radclfe-on-Trent, are elderly and donapost have a debit card. To make sure they didnapost leave empty-handed, the -year-old of Ruddington decided to ask them to put the money straight into her purse. She would then put the payment through on her card before showing them the receipt. The bakery business said it was with regret that they had to dismiss Megan because of her actions. I realise what I was doing was against company policy. But they had picked up the items and already gotten to the till ready to buy them, Megan said. Thereaposs no way I could let an elderly man or woman walk away telling them they could not buy it because they didnapost have a card. They had also already handled the stock so that would have to be binned or cleaned. Megan says she took around £ of payments in cash and put them through on her card and has kept receipts of the transactions.  She said she was suspended from work for a week with full pay on June  and appeared before a disciplinary hearing the week after before being dismissed from the company. I was just trying to do the right thing. I am really upset by it of course, she added. I worked at Birds for  years and  of them as a manager. I was told I was endangering staff membersapos lives by doing what I did. At no point did money transfer hands. It was straight into my purse and then I put the payment through on card and showed them the receipt. I should not have done it but I donapost like to let people down and a lot of these customers depend on us, coming to us every day. Lesley Bird, chief operating officer at Birds Bakery, said: “At Birds, we take the safety of our staff and customers very seriously – and have very tight procedures in place during this pandemic. A lot of our customer base are the elderly – many of them vulnerable – and it is our responsibility to keep them, and our staff, safe.

Businesses in popular resorts slammed the Government’s “draconian” move, which came just weeks after Spain was put on the UK’s list of safe countries. At Malaga airport, the gateway to the Costa del Sol for millions of Brits each year, half-empty planes landed throughout the day from airports across the UK. Many of the passengers who did make the trip said they were only doing so as they had a business or holiday home in the area. One tourist from Belfast said their flight was “barely % full” while another said theirs was “virtually empty”. Barely any Brits could be seen entering through arrivals, though there was a steady stream from nations such as France, Germany and Holland. A Spanish tour rep said: “This should be full of British right now . It’s so sad.” At the taxi rank, one of the many waiting drivers said: “Everybody is very angry with the British Government, it was a stupid decision by them, not based on facts.” Up the coast on the Costa Blanca, hotels in Benidorm began to close including the four-star Rio Park Hotel. Usually packed at this time of year, with % of its customers British package holiday tourists, it began to close its doors just six days after reopening. About four in five hotels in the town’s Rincon de Loix area are closed. Mr Hancock denied he was stoking up panic after he warned there was a “real danger” of the UK being hit by a fresh spike in cases. He said: “I think you can see a second wave starting to roll across Europe. We’ve got to do everything we can to prevent it from reaching these shores and to tackle it.” Jet said it will evacuate Brits on holiday in Spain and the Balearic and Canary Islands “up to and including August ”. Holidaymakers were told to cut short their holidays and book alternative flights. A spokeswoman said: “We apologise for any inconvenience caused.” Tonight it was announced that people ing from Luxembourg will have to quarantine for  days after a rise in cases there. It came amid speculation that other European countries including Belgium could be added to the list today. Spain’s tourism sector could take £billion hit this summer as the fresh restrictions take another chunk out of balance sheets already battered after months of lockdown. Bosses are hoping an upcoming review of the quarantine order could lt the restriction within days. Tourism Minister Reyes Maroto said: “They have given us a period of  days for the review.” She insisted resorts popular with Brits are “at low risk” of coronavirus and even “better” than the UK. Spain is still fighting for destinations such as the Canary and Balearic Islands to be excluded from the quarantine rule. Ms Maroto said: “There has been talk of a second wave of the pandemic but we’re not at all at that point. “The new outbreaks are under control and are in very specic places, and Spanish tourist destinations at the moment have very low levels of contagion. “That means people can enjoy their holidays there. The virus needs to be respected but that doesn’t mean we can’t have well-deserved holidays.” Spain announced , new cases on Wednesday, the highest -hour figure since May  when the entire country was still on full lockdown.

The -year-old, from Rochdale, is now dealing with people in Leicester who’ve tested positive for Covid-. A number of changes have been rolled out to the job in recent weeks - including a new measure to track down people who donapost answer calls from the team. Where contact tracers would have previously had four days to try and reach people, that’s been reduced in the outbreak groups.  Atexplains: “If after  hours we can’t make contact with them, we escalate it and a team will go to the household and conduct an interview instead of after  hours. That’s key,” he says. The new methods mean Ataposs vital job now involves so much more than just contact tracing. He went on: “When we call anyone from Leicester, we discuss with them in more detail support we can offer – such as help with food shopping and picking up prescription medication. ‘‘It’s hoped having people to do their essential shopping and pick up prescriptions will increase levels of compliance and make self-isolation easier.” Sarah Hartle , a dental hygienist from Manchester, is another NHS Test and Trace caseworker who has seen her job change to help fight coronavirus.  As pubs, restaurants and shops opened up, she and the team faced new challenges when tracing contacts, so they were given extra training to get the right information from people who’d tested positive for coronavirus. “What’s changed is the questions we’re asking the patients,” she says. “If they were in a shop, were they wearing a mask  Was the shopkeeper  Did they pay by cash or card  Were they maintaining social distancing  If you are doing all those things, the people in that particular shop are not classed as contacts. It’s all based on science. Social distancing does work.” And with the NHS Test and Trace team regularly updated on the latest advice and improvements in the system put in place, they’re able to give people the relevant help they need. She adds: “One recent patient needed a Hindi speaker. The system for that is now so simple and quick, the patient is only on hold for about  seconds and then youaposrere back with the interpreter.” "},{"url":null,"title":"dr miriam stoppard ethnic minorities","story":"NewsopinionDr Miriam Stoppard: Ethnic minorities being failed by lack of inclusive planningThe pandemic has starkly revealed that BAME people are less likely to use Covid- testing services – we need to look at issues from their point of view to find solutionsShareCommentsByMiriam Stoppard:,  JUL NewsopinionTesting kit instructions can be hard to understand for people whose first language is not English \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

It’s not just in the UK that ­disparities exist – it’s worldwide. Action is needed to correct this so people from ethnic minorities are included in national and local health planning. Catherine Dodds of Bristol ­University and Ibidun Fakoya from King’s College, London suggest the way forward in an editorial in the BMJ. To keep the R number below one, governments are relying on ­nationwide testing and contact tracing until we have a vaccination programme in place. But while we wait, inequalities mean BAME Covid- infections and deaths keep rising.As Dodds and Fakoya point out we already know uptake of medical testing and screening is uneven across cancer risk assessment, antenatal screening, and HIV testing. The NHS is aiming to expand testing with self-administered swab kits – but this strategy may serve minority groups badly, bearing in mind a  UK study found uptake of HIV self-sampling kits among them was low compared with other groups. Most admitted they would probably not use the kits. Behind this reluctance were privacy issues and kits with complicated instructions that were inappropriately worded for people whose first language wasn’t English. Dodds and Fakoya emphasise until these faults are corrected it’s dficult to see how trust can be built up among our ethnic communities. Isn’t it time we looked at these ­disparities from the BAME point of view, and started framing instructions in a form that’s understandable, acceptable and useful for ethnic minorities instead of imposing a “one-size-fits-all” approach  Given the disproportionate and devastating impact this pandemic has already had among our ethnic minority communities, testing equality needs to be addressed in Covid- screening.

The situation had got so bad for Neo, a Neapolitan Mastf, that the gentle giant was taken to Eastcott Veterinary Referrals in Swindon in desperate need of help. He was struggling to see with skin sagging around his eyes and on his eyelids, but the problem has now been solved thanks to the experts - and his owner says they can finally see the funny side of the situation after it caused a lot of worry. Mark Hutchins, from Chippenham, said: I know it sounds a bit mad when you talk about a dog having a facelt but it was a very traumatic time for the family. Neo was having a lot of problems with his face and eyes because he had so much saggy skin hanging down and he was in a lot of pain and discomfort. We even had to pull his skin back for him so he could see his meal and eat it properly. It was obvious something had to be done, although we were very worried that he wouldnapost look the same afterwards, especially my daughter Millie, who was a bit tearful over it all. Thankfully, the results have been amazing and made a big dference to Neo, whoaposs recovered very well, and we owe a big thank you to the team at Eastcott. Now itaposs all over, we can finally see the funny side of it and itaposs already led to a few chuckles. When people say to me aposOh isnapost he lovely apos I say aposThataposs because heaposs just recovering from a faceltapos.  No-one believes me when I say the vets removed more than a kilo of skin, they think Iaposm joking, but itaposs absolutely true and Neoaposs all the better for it. Ida Gilbert, an advance practitioner in veterinary ophthalmology , said Neo was considered an urgent case due to his struggles with poor vision, which irritated his eyes, and extremely heavy facial folds. The irritation caused him to rub his eyes repeatedly making them sore, and he became anxious around anyone touching his face, which made using eye drops impossible. Neo struggled to open his eyes due to excessive eyelid , so Ida and the team operated on both eyes and simultaneously completed the facelt to minimise the time he had to be anaesthetised. His eyelid were surgically corrected and shortened by mm as well as having ,g of skin removed.

Emma Murby, , had split up with Timothy Green but he bombarded her with flowers, chocolates and sent her a new vacuum cleaner in a bid to win her back while she was in mourning. The teacher, who lives in the village of Eldwick, near Bingley, West Yorkshire, begged the -year-old company managing director to leave her alone - but he left her scores of messages, a Pandora ring and even posed as one of her friends to send her a condolence card. Police eventually the former golf club boss for harassment. At Stockport magistrates court, Green from Wilmslow, Cheshire who runs a company which provides safety inspections admitted harassment. He was banned from contacting Miss Murby for two years under the terms of a restraining order. The court heard the couple had met online in April  on POF and met in person for the first time at the end of that month. Prosecutor Mark Pritchard said: They then had a long-distance relationship where the defendant was living in Wilmslow and the complainant was living in Eldwick. They spent time together at weekends and sometimes met up in the week. At this point the complainant says it was a normal relationship and that she was happy. In August last year she moved in with him for a short period of time and their relationship became strained.  She moved back and after some time the relationship ended. That is when the defendant began his unrelenting course of harassment towards his victim. On March  this year the victim told police she had broken up with the defendant but he continued to contact her. He continued to send flowers and leave voicemails asking her to call him. She replied saying aposI am blocking your calls and voicemails donapost call me again. Stop harassing me.Leave me alone we are not together any more. Do not contact me anywhere.apos But he left her  messages in March,  in April, seven in May. After the victimaposs father died he sent messages to her reporting to be her friend Nick and sent her a condolence card. On the day of her fatheraposs funeral he messaged her saying he had been in a dark place had continued to send messages and cards after from a number of dferent accounts on Plenty of Fish- which all used the same photograph of him.  On May  he sent a vacuum cleaner part to her address which she believes he did to have a reason to contact her. Between  June and  June this year he contacted a friend of the victim numerous times asking about her. On June  he sent her a Pandora ring which she had owned when they were together with tape attached to it. Green later told police he thought Miss Murby had PTSD and that she was blaming him for it. He said he blamed her for him being on anti-depressants. In mitigation his lawyer Steven McHugh said: He is mortied at the position he is in today. He fears going to prison and is taking things seriously. He is not looking for favours and is realistic. The last point of contact was on  June and he wishes to move on with his le. He does not object to the restraining order. He does not wish to reacquaint himself with the complainant. He did not threaten her when he contacted her and had a mistaken belief that contacting her would resurrect the relationship. He pleaded guilty at he earliest opportunity and accepts there was no provocation at all.

While they wouldnapost have been able to travel to the island for this yearaposs getaway, they could have picked to visit one of the countries on the UKaposs travel list - but opted for something closer to home.

Deborah Adlam says she has suffered aposendlessapos pain since her son was aposripped from our family while we sleptapos. PC Harper died after he was dragged along for more than a mile by a car filled with quad bike thieves, who he had tried to intercept. The -year-old had only been married for four weeks when he was killed in Berkshire in August last year. His killers Henry Long, , Jessie Cole and Albert Bowers, both , were jailed for a total of  years today. All three were cleared of murder by a jury at the Old Bailey last week, prompting PC Harperaposs widow to call for a retrial - something which is very unlikely. In a statement today, his mum said: You have no idea how glad I am the trial has now finished. The results are what they are, and now we have to try and live the rest of our lives without Andrew and instead with a huge heavy weight in our broken hearts. I’m unable to explain the enormity of what I am feeling and struggling with since we were woken on th August  with a knock on the door, .am. “Andrew was gone. Killed in the line of duty... the pain we now live with is endless, Andrew was literally ripped from our family while we slept.  “I had to wake his brother that morning on the th August and tell him his brother was gone. Mrs Adlam said her first born had been ripped from her. The grieving mum described how she misses her son aposwith every passing momentapos. She said he was a good, brave, caring, funny and uplting man who will be loved forever. Mrs Adlam can no longer work for fear of a breakdown, hardly sleeps and struggles to find motivation to complete even basic chores.  She added: I have sat in the mortuary of my sonaposs covered body, too damaged for me to see. He will never get to be called aposdaddyapos or hold his own child - we imagined this was not too far away in the future. “The only thing I know for sure, is no matter what, Andrew will remain our pride and joy and will be loved forever. My heart may be broken but you will always be in the centre of it. My fit healthy happy brilliant son died purely because these boys chose to steal a quad bike. I personally have not seen, heard or felt a glimmer of any remorse.  In fact, we have seen the opposite, with Long, Bowers and Cole repeatedly laughing and showing a complete lack of respect during the court proceedings. PC Harperaposs widow Lissie described being in a lost and endless world after her husband was killed in the line of duty, a month after their wedding day. Lissie broke down twice as she read from her victim impact statement at the Old Bailey. Widow Mrs Harper told the court: This is my third attempt at writing a statement.

It has become the third hottest UK day on record, with a sweltering .C recorded at Heathrow Airport.Sun-seekers were pictured piling onto beaches, including Bournemouth and Brighton, to make the most of the mini heatwave. But as lockdown easing measures were put on hold and the government urging people to maintain social distancing, police were patrolling beaches to ensure rules were being stuck to. Parts of the UK are expected to be hotter than Ibiza as the  mile-wide Spanish Plume brings continental heat. But Public Health England’s Heatwave Plan warned there could be travel disruption for Brits heading for the coast. And there is the possibility of thunderstorms later in the evening.  The Met Office has revealed that the mercury has hit .C making it the hottest day of the year by some way. The organisation said: It has now reached . °C at Heathrow and . °C at Kew Gardens, making it the hottest day of the year by some way. Public Health Englandaposs weather advice says: “At C, tarmac roads may begin to melt.” Roasting temperatures are predicted in much of England, with the hottest temperatures of C predicted in London and the South East. Bournemouth is bracing to be slammed by tourists once again after the beach was swamped on the .C hottest day of the year on June . Major incidents had to be declared at beaches including the popular Dorset beauty spot during Juneaposs heatwave, as sunbathers amassed huge crowds in breach of social distancing guidelines. Tesco predicted selling a BBQ and beer rush, with projected sales of almost a million sausages, half a million burgers and five million bottles and cans of beer. The Weather Outlook forecaster Brian Gaze said: “Itaposs a Fab Friday for most – but watch out for thunderstorms later in the South and East in particular.” Another Met Office forecaster said: “Thundery showers are possible later on Friday. “It will be a much cooler weekend though, with temperatures C or more lower on Saturday, with some rain moving from the west later on Sunday to across the South on Monday.” The UK average temperature for this July is currently on course to be just .C, one degree less than the - long-term average of .C, data from the Met shows. So far this month, the highest maximum temperature recorded was .C on July  at Heathrow Airport. The UK has already surpassed % of the average monthly rainfall and only experienced two thirdsof the expected sunshine for an average July, a total of . hours, Met Office figures show. Weaposve not seen a temperature anywhere above  so far or even with a three in it, that is quite unusual for July, a Met spokesman said. In terms of shting the overall weather stats for the month, itaposs not going to do much to the average. August, meanwhile, looks to be starting very a similarly unsettled manner. The Met Officeaposs long range report says: There are some fairly strong signals that unsettled conditions are likely to continue through into the first half of August, with outbreaks of rain and scattered showers affecting all parts of the United Kingdom at times."},{"url":null,"title":"first dog test positive coronavirus","story":"NewsFirst dog to test positive for coronavirus after owner fell ill has diedThe seven-year-old German shepherd named Buddy tested positive for Covid- after his owner contracted it and has now passed away after a three-month illness battleShareCommentsByLorraine King:,  JUL Updated:,  JUL Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news us-news video trump-young-people-almost-immune-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,tcfVersionOne:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,disableAHS:true,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,evergreenArticle:,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,tcfVersionOne:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,disableAHS:true,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news us-news first-dog-test-positive-coronavirus-\"\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

However it wasnapost until mid-May that the family found a vet who was prepared to test him. The test confirmed Buddy was infected with the virus. Mr Mahoneyaposs we Allison told the National Geographic: You tell people that your dog was positive, and they look at youten heads.

There have been claims of ghost sightings and spooky goings-on at Loftus Hall in Fethard on Sea, County Wexford, after the property became the setting for a terrying mythical incident told to have taken place about  years ago.The imposing home, priced at £.m, features impressive Georgian architecture, stunning landscaped grounds and  bedrooms, as reported by the Irish Mirror.The manor became a tourist attraction in , being used for ghost hunts and tours, and it has also has also provided the backdrop for horror films and paranormal invesigations.Itaposs being sold by owners Aidan and Shane Quigley, but potential buyers have been warned of a spooky history that dates back to  when it was known as Redmond Hall. The legend goes one night a mysterious guest called at the home, then occupied by Lord and Lady Tottenham, and their daughter Lady Anne. As a storm raged outside, the family invited the man inside to shelter and the story claims as they played a game to pass the time, Lady Anne bent down to retrieve a fallen playing card from under the table to discover their guest had the aposcloven hooves of the devilapos.  The daughter let out a blood-curdling scream and the satanic visitor is said to have disappeared through the ceiling in a puff of flames and smoke. Lady Anne apparently aposwent into a state of shock and madnessapos before she was forcefully locked away in a tapestry room, dying not long afterwards. Following her death, the family and the servants in the manor claimed to have seen her spirit roaming the halls.  There is always a feeling that you are not alone in Loftus Hall, said Aidan. The once grand interior has now faded but among the peeling wallpaper and decaying ing, there are glimpses of its past splendour with parquet floors, ornate fireplaces and rolling views from its  windows. The site date backs to  when a Norman knight, Raymond le Gros, built a castle on the grounds, before it was replaced by a hall after the black death.

Nikole Thompson, who has two kids, explained that she is moving into a new build property soon with her family. So to keep her home in tip top shape she created a daily, weekly, monthly and annual schedule. The self-proclaimed avid cleaner works  hours per week, but still manages to tackle chores that most of us would be keen to avoid every morning like emptying the toaster or deep cleaning the coffee machine. She took to the Hinch Army Cleaning Tips group on Facebook to share her y list with fellow mums - but she received a mixed response. Day to day Nikole will make all of the beds, wipe down the bathroom, do a load of washing, before hoovering and heading to the kitchen. But she also set aside a list of tasks that need to be completed monthly, like washing the dog beds and cleaning the oven. In April she steam-cleans the carpets and in December she polishes the Christmas decorations.  Talking of the cleaning plans, one person said: Iaposm far too lazy to be this organised but well done you!! Another asked: Do you have a template at all  I struggle a lot with lack of motivation and canapost get anything done. This would help so much to tick off each day week or month. A third commented: I think this is brilliant! Well done you for being so organised! I’m going to try and take a leaf out of your book! You sound like superwoman to me added a fourth.  However one added: Le is too short. Someone once said to me, live le, no one wants to be remembered for cleaning their house. And another said: Blimey do you do anything but clean  As some people still couldnapost believe how much she cleans every day, she was forced to explain just how long it takes on average to complete each task. Daily tasks include:Make beds -  minutes, my son makes his own bed and i just straighten it upTidy up all rooms -  minutes, putting hair make up stuff away and the odd toy Pick up washing -  minute - the boys in this house have a decent aim. Wipe down bathrooms - a minute per bathroom - so maybe  minutes in total giving  minutes to get between the  Put in a load - again no more than  minutes Hoover downstairs -  minutes Empty dishwasher -  minutes Hoover upstairs -  minutes Wipe down work tops -  minutes Wipe down cabinets -  minutes Load dishwasher -  minutes Clean toilets -  minutes So all in all -  minutes  Plus give it five minutes rising and drying the dog food, maybe another five minutes generally cleaning the dining table, extra sweep of the floor after tea etc, wiping down the hob. On a weekend, its probably more like an hour a day with the extras on the Sat Sunday cleaning. Although most members were supportive of Nikoleaposs rigid cleaning schedule, she did receive some criticism which she later addressed.

This cleaning I already do but I like a good visual, which also helps with delegation.

Officers spent two days digging up the foundations of the Christian Brueckneraposs former rented shack - removing concrete rubble from the remains. Diggers, snfer dogs, ground penetrating radar and drones were used to examine the site near Hanover where he stayed after Madeleine vanished. When they left on Wednesday evening, they refused to saythey had discovered anything on the site. But it is believed they lted a stone slab to find an underground cellar full of corrugated iron which a snfer dog reacted to and started barking. The allotment, used as a country escape for city dwellers, was reduced to a patch of sand after the search team left.  There is one old sign left nailed onto one tree trunk at the site entrance warning parents they are aposliable for their childrenaposthey trespass. Brueckner, aged , was said to have stockpiled insulation in the shabby grey shack, which had been demolished before the search took place. The next door neighbour said the allotment lease holder had allowed him to stay there in  after meeting him at a festival and hearing he was homeless. But he was kicked off after falling out with neighbours about a year later.But his lawyer Friedrich Fuelscher calls the search of the site a pure desperate act of the public prosecutoraposs office. This week locals urged police to search a second site an hour away in Braunschweig but his lawyer said “They wonapost find anything there either”. And he ridiculed the public prosecutoraposs office by saying: “Apparently, itaposs hard for investigators to admit they backed the wrong horse. At the start of the search the convicted rapist, who is serving a jail sentence for drug offences, said he was withdrawing his request for an early release.  His full sentence is due to finish in Janaury next year but he is still facing sentence for the rape of a  year old woman in Potugal. But as soon as officers left his allotment site his lawyer revealed he was again applying for early release. The news puts further pressure on police to find evidence which could keep him behind bars. It is believed they have evidence he was in Praia da Luz in Portugal on the night Madeleine went missing in  and that he received a  minute phone call from the area.

The brave pooch Emma Roo was rescued in  from a butchers in Xi’an, China, but not before she had her front legs, part of her tail and the tips of her ears cut away.  She was only about eight weeks old at the time, rescuers believe, and may have been given to meat traders because of a small toe defect. Most of the animals killed for the meat trade in China are stolen or abandoned pets or guard dogs, as well as stray street dogs snatched from towns and cities. Slaughterhouses in the dog meat industry remove an animal’s limbs without any pain relief as they believe it produces adrenaline, which tenderises the remaining meat. After being rescued and taken to a veterinary practice in Bejing, Emma was rehomed for two years, before winding up back at the same clinic in .  The Chinese clinic then turned to Dalmatian Rescue, a US non-profit organisation, in their quest to get Emma a loving forever home. Lelong Dog lover Misha Rackclf Hunt, ,  from Charleston, South Carolina spotted Emma online and fell in love immediately.  I remember first seeing Emma online - she has the most human-like amber coloured eyes. I didnapost even think about the logistics of it. I knew this dog was set to me for a reason. When I met her, I thought she might be cold or not interested in people from the trauma but she came up straight into my arms. By the time we finished our five-hour road trip home, itaposs like she knew I was her person and that I was never going to leave her.  Misha took the dog in - who is now as playful and loving as any other pet. She said: “Eventually, Emma arrived in the US on January ,  – just weeks before the export of animals was banned due to Covid-. “When I first brought her home, she would scream at the top of her lungs whenever I left the room. She was always protective over her food and toys. At one point, she would even guard random pieces of my clothing because she was scared that it would be taken away.”Now safe in the US, Emma has attracted , Instagram fans, with Misha and Dalmatian Rescue raising funds through social media to get Emma a custom front wheel cart from Eddieaposs Wheels and to raise awareness about the cruel trade in dog meat worldwide."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/07/2.34819275-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/07/2.34819275-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/07/2.34819275-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/07/2.34819275-240x180.jpg 300w sizes=(max-width: 940px) 940w, 620w, 300w ","title":"analysis dundee have right to feel aggrieved","story":"The   Championship season will kick off with a bang as Dundee head to fellow-promotion contenders Hearts for a mouth-watering opening day clash at Tynecastle.James McPake’s Dark Blues are expected to go head-to-head with Robbie Neilson’s Jambos in the race to the Premiership this coming season and will have the chance to lay down a marker straight away.Kicking off on the weekend of October , this season’s second tier will be a shorter affair than usual with only  matches and teams facing each other just three times.That means it’s the luck of the draw for home advantage in key games.And it’s fair to say Dundee’s luck hasn’t been in.As well as playing relegated Hearts away twice, the Dark Blues face two trips to last season’s runners-up Inverness and visit fourth-placed Ayr United twice, teams expected to be in the mix once again.On top of that there are two away games on the plastic parks of both Alloa and Queen of the South – the first of those on Boxing Day before the Dee end their campaign at Palmerston on April .With an odd number of games, half the teams would also miss out on one home game and, once more, lady luck hasn’t shined on the Dark Blues with  home matches and  away.With money tight at the club due to the coronavirus shutdown, Dundee have the right to feel aggrieved they will have to go with one less home game than others as well as only having one big pay day from a sizeable Hearts travelling support.That is, providing fans will be allowed inside the stadiums by that point.On paper, James McPake and his men have been handed a dficult Championship calendar but it’s also one with opportunity.The opening day Hearts clash will kick off the campaign with one of the biggest games of the season. However, it’s also a chance to lay down a marker.Grab a positive result there and the Dark Blues head into two home games on the bounce with Morton and newly-promoted Raith Rovers coming to town before the end of October – an opportunity to get off to a flying start.On the back of a trip to face Ayr, Dundee play Dick Campbell’s Arbroath at Dens before a Highlands clash with Inverness and then facing a Dunfermline side that has strengthened well over the past few weeks.After a Boxing Day trip to Dumfries, it’s the only midweek fixture of the campaign – home to Alloa – four days before hosting Hearts in what’s likely to be one of the biggest matches of the calendar for the Dens men.With only  of the  matches before the turn of the year, getting  off to a strong start will be essential to any promotion bid.That’s where the fixture list looks to be in Dundee’s favour – successive home games against the Jambos, Ayr and Inverness with trips to Raith and Arbroath in between.That run from the start of the year through to March’sto Tynecastle will be the key to success for James McPake and his men before heading into the final eight matches.The Dark Blues won’t be too happy with the card they’ve been dealt by the SPFL but defiance in the face of adversity is a trait at Dens Park.And come the final day on a Friday night at Queen of the South, the players will still fancy they can finish up on top and get the club back to the big time – eventhey have to do it the hard way.A full fixture list can be found here.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

I was lucky enough to play under Ivanin  but I’d lost three before we’d managed to get one.“Jim was manager for a few before then as well so that was probably big thing for him, not being able to do the clean sweep of Scottish football.“Aberdeen were the benchmark, with the New Firm at the time, the two of us were competing against one another.“Them having won European titles probably was sore for him, especially having gone so close.“You look at Roma and then Gothenburg it was, obviously, a big thing for him.”Bowman, who would go on to make  appearances for the club, checked in at Tannadice in  and was part of United’s efforts to make the Uefa Cup showpiece that season.They, arguably, could go down in history as the club’s greatest-ever side.However, the former Hearts man was quick to hail McLean’s title-winning side of  as the best of all.“I would still say when they won the league in  was their best team, what an achievement that was for the club,” he added.“But he kept on evolving the team by bringing myself, Jim McInally and Iain Ferguson to the club in .“When I look back at my time, the players I played with were absolutely brilliant.“They were top professionals as well with the way they conducted themselves off the park. That’s probably why they got so much success.“The likes of Heggie , Davey , Eamonn , Luggy , Holtyand Maurice , they were all great.“For Jimmy Mac, Fergie and I to come into that, playing with them week-in, week-out, it certainly makes your football a lot easier to do.”Bowman looks back on their European adventures with great fondness, hailing the Arabs as some of the best supporters on the continent.“When you look back at the  Uefa Cup run and we were playing Lens in the first round, there wasn’t loads of press and fans but the hype grew as we went on,” he continued.“As we went through the rounds you could see it building.“The fans were brilliant. They’d travel everywhere – the crowds for Barcelona, Monchengladbach and Gothenburg in the final were exceptional.“People even came to Romania to see us play Craiova, it was an Iron Curtain country at the time so that was dficult for their visas and getting there.“It just shows you exactly what United fans were and are still about.”LEE WILKIE: Coronavirus effect for Dundee United may be survival this season, then kick on in the next campaign\" title\"#LEE WILKIE: Coronavirus effect for Dundee United may be survival this season, then kick on in the next campaign# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp lee-wilkie-dundee-united-fc-micky-mellon embed # secretKqynNAaff\" data-secret\"KqynNAaff\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

The route runs along Beach Esplanade, Beach Bouled and Justice Street.The work is expected to several weeks to complete.Aberdeen City Council will continue to review, monitor, and evaluate the interventions while discussions are held with stakeholders, and when the measures are in place.The continual reviewing may mean changes to the interventions, and it is also a requirement of the fund, which is being administered by sustainable transport body Sustrans Scotland.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":null,"title":"happy lockdown birthday june 26 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSend us a photograph of your family member or friend enjoying their special day and we will publish it and wish them a happy birthday.Remember to include their full name, age, where they are from and a bit about what you did to make the day at home special.Send your photographs to editor@argyllshireadvertiser"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor june 26 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,In publishing the opinion piece #All lives matter# from your contributor on page  of the June  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser, you have demonstrated a profound lack of understanding of the current Black Lives Matter protests.The tone-deaf piece is an attempt by your contributor to shut down engagement and perpetuate ignorance.How anybody can make the claim that all lives matter after witnessing such horric police brutality is beyond belief.All lives cannot matter until Black Lives Matter.Instead of deflecting and diluting the conversation, surely it is time to educate ourselves about what is happening, and to fight systemic injustice Madeleine Conn, ArdrishaigSir,The SNP continues to demonstrate its economic incompetence.New figures show the SNP government underspent its budget by a quarter of a billion pounds in -, and failed to use £ million of borrowing capacity. ​Instead of demanding further borrowing powers and more funding from the UK Government, the separatists should learn to use the resources they already have.With such colossal mismanagement, it#s no surprise that even senior SNP advisor Andrew Wilson has stated that Scotland is set to be the worst performing economy in the developed world. Once again, the separatists# numbers simply don#t add up.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands wardSir,Exactly two years ago I was diagnosed with stage three, oestrogen positive breast cancer.I’d just come back from a week#s holiday in Spain with Isabel and Margaret. Days before I went on holiday I’d had a biopsy following referral from my GP. Although there wasn’t a cloud in the sky, my holiday was definitely clouded by impending results#I had chosen to wait until after my holiday to get them.The journey that Monday to go to Gartnavel is one I’ll never forget. My partner Frank didn’t shut up the whole way there, obviously he was nervous. I couldn’t be bothered with the small talk and just wanted him to shut up. Obviously I was nervous and he was just trying to keep my mind off it, but I was too busy silently praying. The number  is something I see all the time so I spent the whole journey looking for the number on someone’s licence plate #I saw it everything would be ok. I didn#t see it. That might sound a bit daft, but fear does crazy things to you.Walking into the consultant#s room and finding a nurse waiting there confirmed my worst fears. #It’s a wee cancer,# said Mr Wilson. The words echoing in my head, I couldn’t hear anything after that. I remember taking a deep breath and looking at Frank. I will never, ever forget the look on his face.My only question that day was #am I going to lose my breasts # The answer was no, and thankfully Frank was there to take in what was being said my head was spinning. The question I really wanted to ask was #am I going to die # I was too scared to ask that question.I didn’t cry until I walked out the hospital, then I bawled. Frank was amazing, and he didn’t talk like a budgie on the way home.The journey home was horrendous. I was terried about telling my mum. How do you tell your mum that her only child has cancer  I hadn’t told her anything about finding a lump. I couldn’t cope with worrying about her worrying about me # butit happens again I#d do it dferently and she’ll be the first to know. By the time I got home I had no more tears left.The relief telling mum was a huge weight off my shoulders. What ensued after my initial diagnosis was two weeks of crying every day. Telling the girls at work was so emotional, and in fact I was exhausted with it all.Once surgery and treatment plans were in place I was in a better place. Time to get the head down and get on with it, and that#s what I did. I was full of positivity and determination, and I think my sense of humour helped enormously.The treatment was bad, but it was necessary. The ongoing treatment is bad but it#s necessary. I’m alive and that’s what matters. My le has changed forever, nothing will be the same. My le has been ided into Before Cancer and After Cancer  I now have a new #normal#.I don’t know what the future holds, who does, but I intend to live my le happily, positively and most definitely to the fullest!I will never forget the support, both physically and emotionally that I received from my nearest and dearest, and of course from the whole community. The strength you have given me continues, and for that I am truly grateful.Please, pleaseyou find an abnormality or you just feel something isn’t quite right, act upon it and seek attention.I know it’s a dficult time with this horrid virus but it’s important to remember that early detection saves lives.Stay safe and take care.Yvie Young, Lochgilphead"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures june 26 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAvril Lockhart from Cairnbaan sent us this week#s photograph.Taken at Bellanoch, the photo shows the bike that Avril, as a key worker, has been lent by Alec Ohnstad of the Ardrishaig Bothy.

The noise is constant and intrusive for  –  hours in a day, the decibel level in excess of  dB where sounds above  dB are harmful to hearing.This is a serious issue for residents who cannot open their doors and windows, cannot use their gardens, pets are terried, it is often impossible to have a conversation, or a phone call. The noise from hundreds of bikes is explosive and destructive.The speeds are terrying, they travel in intimidating packs, the noise is threatening and the bikers have no respect for the communities they are speeding through. They pass multiple residential entrances with limited sight lines with no care for risk. The offensive noise seems to come from two actions modying motorbike exhausts and extreme acceleration in legal bikes.If a car made a similar noise, spewed out the same polluting omissions, or did the same ridiculous speeds they would be pulled over by the police, but bikers appear above the law.As technology reduces the noise pollution of cars, planes and other forms of transport, it seems motorbikes are exempt. Bikers claim #loud pipes save lives# but is safety really the motivation for deliberately creating excessive noise Noise counts as a statutory nuisance it either unreasaonably and substantially interferes with the user or enjoyment of a home or other premises or is likely to injure health.The problem on A is known to all the statutory agencies, but nothing is done.If this is a national problem, what action needs to be taken Concerned Loch Fyne-side resident Sir,I am not qualied to judge economic competence, but considering the party he represents, I think that Councillor Redman might find it advisable to be wary of the phrase #colossal mismanagement# .For my part, I would consider a degree of incompetence to be preferable to the great damage caused over the last decade to  per cent of the UK’s people, as well as to its institutions and its reputation by the cruel, self-serving, xenophobic, elitist, dishonestregime currently in Westminster.Name supplied, LochgilpheadSir,Our charity#s support for blind and partially sighted people affected by the coronavirus lockdown has received a £, boost from the Scottish Government#s Wellbeing Fund.With this extra funding we will be able to support an additional  people and respond to the increased demand for more in-depth, one-to-one emotional support.The practical and psychological effects of losing your sight can have a signicant impact on people’s well-being, and this current situation has exacerbated the anxiety and isolation felt by many.Access to essential services such as food and medicines is more dficult as is social distancing, vital information on staying safe isn#t always in accessible formats, and many of our older members aren#t always confident about using new technology to stay in touch with others.Everyone accessing RNIB#s confidential counselling service will receive eight weekly sessions with an accredited counsellor, delivered via telephone and online, with each session normally lasting an hour.The funding will enable us to reduce the waiting list for emergency mental health sessions and also let existing clients access additional sessions.The RNIB helpline is available on   .James Adams, RNIB Scotland directorSir,Every pub across Scotland should be allowed to stock and sell beer from local independent brewers, to help them recover post-lockdown.CAMRA, the Campaign for Real Ale has launched the #Cheers for Choice# campaign.The campaign wants these arrangements to be relaxed, and MSPs are also being urged to support the Tied Pubs Bill being put forward in the Scottish Parliament by Labour MSP Neil Bibby. The legislation would give tied pub tenants protections in law, including a right to be able to sell guest beers in their pubs.Allowing small and independent brewers to sell into all pubs will also improve consumer choice and allow pub-goers to support local brewing businesses.It also makes business sense, with  per cent of pub-goers saying they would be less likely to go back to a pubit doesn’t have a range of brews from small and independent producers.Sarah Crawford, CAMRA Director for Scotland, Kirkcaldy"},{"url":null,"title":"could a two way conversation transform scotlands health","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSome of us have learned in lockdown the importance of other people, and have been longing for these first personal contacts.There have been surprises in discovering just what is important in le, and the comfort of knowing you are not alone in your likes, as your favourite brand of chocolate is again sold out.We have also been made aware that the way we behave makes a dference to the future. It has taken a national emergency to get the government to acknowledge that it needs our compliance and, for that, must give us the information we need.Suddenly the choices we make are seen as vitally important, and we have a part to play in achieving success for ourselves and our community. Can this be a foundation for a future partnership that could transform the health of Scotland and the pressure on our services As a physiotherapist I became aware that there was little that one could do to impose solutions there had to be a relationship that involved two way listening, mutual trust and support to do what was necessary. In this pandemic Nicola Sturgeon has said that we have behaved in a way that saved lives and protected the NHS.When this is over we could be at the beginning of another le-altering journey.It will demand a huge sht in expectations. There is an amazing bias in society towards the idea of decrepitude and dependency in old age, when in fact encouraging dependency increases a slide into that very state. During past months many of these attitudes have been exposed and caused outrage but they are long standing and deep seated.If you have been trying to escape into fiction you might have no better idea of what is possible. Alison Flood interviewed crime writers about their work, and this is what she found.Ian Rankin is now writing about a John Rebus who has health issues, James Lee Burke has his detective Robicheaux meditating on mortality in his early s and Mark Billingham has slowed his Tom Thorne down a bit because he is in his s. Michael Connelly does not believe that it is credible to have his Harry Bosch with a badge and gun and still working for the LAPD, this in a country where the President is  and one of the presidential hopefuls .Worst of all, Sara Paretsky created a feisty, strong woman for her books, only to succumb to popular misconceptions and stop her age at  because she didn#t #want Vi to be helpless#.These fictional creations battle the evils they see in their society.

Perhaps for the first time in their lives they have heard the bark of deer or spotted something in nature that is totally new to them. And many will have seen footage of the animals and creatures that tentatively stepped into urban settings whilst humankind remained under lockdown.But that is changing as we ease back into a new normality.Economics and peoples’ livelihoods are, of course, firmly entwined with modern day living, human survival and wellbeing it is extremely important that we find a route to recovery and many are suffering deeply. But what we do not want to do is fall back into the same old traps that were so detrimental to the wildle, nature and ecosystems of our planet. Finding a way forward and a new balance is not just crucial for other species but for that of our own children and future generations too.Many will have been shocked at the sudden increase in fly tipping during lockdown plus the thoughtless parking and abandonment of picnic rubbish, disposable barbecues and indiscriminate toileting as lockdown eased. All have grave consequences for wildle and nature.The result is the burning, choking, strangling, trapping or poisoning of animals, birds, plants and aquatic le.Taking care of our surroundings and appreciating nature is a real joy.

It is now one of the most beautul drives in the place, and as a drive it would be destroyed.#The line from Glasgow to Oban took  years to build and finally opened in , proving extremely popular with holidaymakers for many years. The proposed branch line from Dalmally to Inveraray was never built, despite plans to #hide# the railway from the duke’s view. A plan from  shows a proposed tunnel to carry the line through the duke’s policies near to the castle. This proposal, like many others, was defeated in the House of Lords.Instead, provision was made at Dalmally for a waiting room, the #Duke’s Room#, at Dalmally Station where visitors arriving by train could await the arrival of a carriage in comfort.This is just one of innumerable fascinating stories stored within the Argyll Papers, the family and estate archive of the Campbell family, dukes of Argyll.The Friends of the Argyll Papers was established to support the development of the archive and to promote its use and enjoyment by a wide audience.It has been described as one of the most important private archives in Britain, offering a rich resource for Scottish and British history from the th to the st centuries.

Without action and proper investment from central government vital public services will be at risk.This news of huge strain on local authority budgets comes as the SNP is delaying in opening up Scotland’s hospitality and tourism industry. Instead of following other parts of the UK and opening the sector on July , the separatists are forcing businesses to wait until July .This delay will cost businesses millions at a time when thousands of jobs are already on the line.The SNP is risking people#s livelihoods. It needs to accept responsibility for that and take action now.Councillor Alastair Redman,Sir,People occasionally ignore the elephant in the room to support their point of view, but in his latest letter, Councillor Alastair Redman has ignored an entire herd in his living room.In his latest rant he states that the SNP is failing councils as the cost of coronavirus could hit more than £ million, but surely these costs would be the same no matter who was in power He also suggests that #essential local services have been underfunded for years# yet fails to mention the years of needless austerity cuts, actioned by his party and their collaborators, to bail out the greedy and risky practices of the banks, which reduced funding to a devastatingly low level in general. It is worth noting that the Scottish Government has put a greater percentage of their curtailed income into NHS Scotland than any part part of the UK. This has helped NHS Scotland to outperform all of the others, in the UK, for the past five years. This is paying idends now.He s to his familiar attempt to insult by referring to citizens who want to take responsibility for making and managing decisions and working to make their country prosper within the priorities set by its citizens as #separatists#. I’m glad to be described as a separatist because the alternative is to be an apologist for an unrepresentative government in Westminster and to abdicate decision making to that same out-of-touch group.It is Councillor Redman’s final point, however, that demonstrates his blinkered sycophancy. His suggestion that the Scottish Government should follow the example of other parts of the UK. Could he really be saying that we should follow the chaotic shambles and incompetence that has emanated from his chums at Westminster  Does he seriously think that any sensible person, irrespective of their own political affiliation and from any of the devolved nations, would swap what their government#s have done for the Westminster model Sadly, nowhere in his missive does Councillor Redman take time to mention the health and safety of our citizens.It is this, together with scientic advice and without political point scoring, that is driving the Scottish Government#s response to this tragic pandemic.Kevin MacKaveney, TarbertSir,Following reports of littering around Argyll and Bute, including the Isle of Islay, the issue was discussed at a recent meeting of Islay Community Council where community councillors heard that items like rubber gloves have been found dumped in ditches.It is always very disappointing to hear about littering and fly-tipping but doubly so in an area like Islay where residents take such an understandable pride in their environment.We also need to bear in mind that items like disposable gloves can pose a threat to livestock. As well as being profoundly antisocial, this kind of behaviour can be positively harmful.Those acting irresponsibly should remember that there can be serious consequences to their thoughtlessness.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSPSir,We all have a role to play in the recovery of the country’s tourism industry after its reopening on July .Scots could help by taking a trip, visiting an attraction or experience, shopping locally, dining out and booking a staycation.Scottish tourism is facing its biggest challenge in a generation and will need financial support for some time to come to help it recover. The Scottish public has a crucial part to play in helping this happen.It#s easy to not think of yourself as a tourist in your own country but many of the experiences that we often enjoy with loved ones, such as holidays, shopping or eating out, all contribute to our visitor economy.July  marked a new era for the industry as we start to welcome back visitors and take our first steps on the road to a safe and responsible recovery. However, reopening won’t be the same for all businesses, many are still adapting to this #new normal#, so it#s important that we recognise that as we move forward to try and restore our industry.We look forward to helping Scots rediscover their own country in a way that is safe for everyone # visitors, residents and those working within the industry.

Walking and cycling infrastructure needs to be improved, trees can be planted, and renewable energy can be expanded and made more efficient.Transport and food are the most obvious areas for behavioural change in Argyll. We need to be promoting the benefits of electric cars and making them preferable to petrol or diesel cars.We can easily bring food production and consumption closer together by shopping and eating more locally and more naturally. Farming in Argyll is generally quite low impact, but does not have the capacity to feed everyone in the area, meaning that we have to buy in meat which is less sustainably farmed to make up the dference. If everyone ate only the meat that is produced locally, we could dramatically reduce the emissions caused from the transport of imported meat, as well as supporting our local market and ensuring that it remains natural and sustainable. Reducing food waste is also an easy behavioural change.Acting on climate change is all about thinking of others. Across the globe, the people who see the most adverse effects of climate change so far are those who are already marginalised and vulnerable.Kindness and common decency indicate that we must act with the needs of these people in mind, with the knowledge thatwe do not act, ‘these people’ will soon become us and our children.One thing that I think would make a huge dference would bewe all took #our whole selves# to work with us.Whatworld leaders were constantly thinking: #what would my children say about my role in this decision # This kind of moral thinking would make a huge dference in the future of industry and politics, and the more we educate the next generation, the more influence they will have on their parents.Everyone can make changes such as cutting down on their meat and dairy consumption, shopping locally, re-using plastic containers, recycling, composting, reducing food waste, buying fewer new things, using a renewable energy supplier, and cutting down or cutting out air travel.At the Paris Agreement in ,  nations decided to take measures to limit the global temperature increase to . degrees above pre-industrial levels. Our current behaviour will not allow for this.A rise of  degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels will mean that large areas of land around the equator will be uninhabitable, resulting in huge numbers of refugees fleeing for their survival. Sea level rise caused by the rapid melting of the ice caps will mean that small island states such as Kiribati and Tuvalu will be submerged. The combination of the loss of arable land and ocean acidication due to temperature increase will mean global food shortages, such that we have never seen before.The rich will still be able to buy food, but those who are already marginalised and vulnerable will find it increasingly dficult to access basic amenities like food and clean water, further stretching the inequality gap.It’s not too late to make changes, but it soon will be.We all need to have climate change in the forefront of our minds when making any kind of decision, be it personal or business. It is an omnipresent issue and every decision, however big or small, will have an effect."},{"url":null,"title":"science matters are aircraft vapour trails harmful","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAlthough much reduced by the Coronavirus pandemic, everyone has seen the vapour trails produced by high-flying aircraft as they streak across the sky. But what are they  and are they harmful Officially called contrails , these ephemeral, cloud-like structures are primarily made of ice crystals. They form at altitudes over , metres from water vapour in the aircraft’s engine exhaust as it freezes almost instantaneously at temperatures below minus  degrees celsius. There are, however, plenty of other volatiles and solid components in engine exhaust, including soot particles that often act as a nucleus around which the ice crystals form.Official figures show that air traffic contributes around five per cent of greenhouse gases. Yet these estimates only account for CO emissions. They do not include the effect of contrails, which can persist for hours and even expand into cirrus clouds several miles wide. These clouds, which are most abundant over North America and Europe, trap heat within Earth’s atmosphere, so do they improve our climate or contribute to global warming Air traffic has been steadily increasing year-on-year, so, assuming the coronavirus effect is a temporary one, estimates suggest that the distance flown by passengers will double every  years, and that air traffic will quadruple by . Therefore, it is imperative to determine how the increase in clouds created by contrails might affect us.In a recent study*, scientists used a climate model to analyse the future impact of contrails on climate change, taking into account their predicted increase balanced against any likely changes in engine soot emissions.The results show a three-fold increase in contrail cirrus coverage by , despite a  per cent reduction in soot emissions due to improved fuel and engine efficiency. These predictions cover all major air traffic routes and are mostly due to increased air traffic volume, although a sht to flying at higher altitudes also contributes. The area with the greatest increase will be Eastern Asia, where the largest rise in air traffic is expected.This previously unaccounted for, non-CO, climate impact of air traffic is now reckoned to have a more damaging effect on climate change than all the CO emitted from aircraft engines.*Atmos.

Instead, they were directed at some national policies and how they impacted on rural development.Argyll and Bute Council had been #more than helpful# to local businesses in the recovery from lockdown, the company added.Mr MacLeod also suggested Scottish Water should be encouraged to allow small developments to be served by inidual septic tanks or bio-discs.In addition, the provision of water and electricity to remote rural locations should be subsidised by the Scottish Government, he added, which would help make projects more affordable.Furthermore, the cost of #impact studies# should not fall on the developer, he said.Another issue was the requirement of registered social landlords that housing is built to extremely high specications, he said.Mr MacLeod said: #That high standard does, of course, ensure the houses are well insulated and easily maintained. The standard, however, drives costs up dramatically and can make small, rural developments unaffordable.Careful planning of the specication could reduce building costs but still produce warm, highly insulated and comfortable homes.#While there is Scottish Government funding for affordable housing and funding through the Highlands and Islands Enterprise Agency for workshop units, there is no funding for #combined# units which incorporate a home and a workspace.This would allow young entrepreneurs to acquire a starter home or a home worker to relocate.Argyll and Bute Council has one of the highest approval rates for new planning applications in Scotland.It said: #Masterplans are rarely implemented in Argyll and Bute but they are used occasionally to enable the partial development of larger areas of land.#Infrastructure costs make up a signicant proportion of the cost of new build housing particularly in smaller scale developments.#"},{"url":null,"title":"a welcome awaits at kilmartin church","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsServices are scheduled to re-start at Glassary, Kilmartin and Ford Parish Church early next month.Trustees hope to open the modern and welcoming church building at Barr Mhor, Kilmartin, for worship from Sunday August , starting at am.Social distancing will allow for up to  people to attend and everyone is expected to wear a face covering.

Taking a holiday in the United Kingdom offers people the chance to uncover some stunning scenery, wonderful attractions and superb accommodation without having to jump on a plane. Here, we take a look at the type of places you can stay, the rules you need to follow and how to enjoy a great staycation.Scotland’s colourful countryside, breathtaking beaches and glorious gardens are ready to welcome visitors this summer.Many locations are reopening, but have restricted visitor numbers and pre-booked time slots, so we recommend looking at the official websites for attractions and organisations before you travel, so that you’re in the know before you go.The national tourist organisations of Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland have launched a UK-wide industry standard and ‘We’re Good to Go’ mark. The mark means businesses can demonstrate that they are adhering to the respective government and public health guidance, ensuring they can welcome visitors back with confidence.Do remember that our four nations have dferent guidelines, advice and timescales for reopening tourism. Please respect government guidance on social distancing and also any regional lockdown measures that are provided by the respective nation.Summer is here and Britain is beginning to reopen, providing everyone with the opportunity to start dreaming about a holiday. And this year a staycation could give you some much needed rest and recuperation, while also helping get the holiday industry back up and running. Hotels, campsites, bed and breakfast accommodation and other places to stay are now openingthey can follow the guidelines relevant to their locality to ensure that their guests will be safe to stay and spend days wandering our award-winning coastlines, exploring our green spaces and getting inspired in our cities. Each accommodation provider is unique and those that have reopened have had to adapt depending on the nature of their business, including the size and type of accommodation.But these changes mean it is safe for visitors to come and enjoy a change of scenery. But even when we are away from home, we still need to follow the guidelines.Speaking earlier this month, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: “As lockdown eases, we should focus on supporting the livelihoods of business owners and their employees up and down the country – all of whom are opening their doors for the first time in more than three months.“They are our local restaurants, hairdressers, libraries, museums, cinemas, and yes, pubs. They are also hotels, BBs, indeed much of our tourism industry.“All these businesses and their workers have put in a heroic effort to prepare their venues for this reopening, to work out a way to trade in a way that keeps their customers safe.“But the success of these businesses, the livelihoods of those who rely on them, and ultimately the economic health of the whole country is dependent on every single one of us acting responsibly. We must not let them down.”Mr Johnson emphasised that evenwe are now allowed to spend nights away from our own homes, we must still follow social distancing rules. When out and about, we need to remember to look after ourselves, one another and the environment around us. To make sure we’re all doing our bit to travel responsibly, just follow a few simple steps.When planning your trip, check that important facilities like toilets and car parks are open before you travel.  If you have an attraction in mind, check online to seeyou need to pre-book.Some places may be extremely popular, so get off the beaten track and discover a hidden gem.Stay socially distanced apart from anyone outside your household while walking, running, cycling, sitting and sunbathing.  Wear your face covering at all times when on public transport.  Make sure you have a bank card many outlets are currently only accepting cashless payments. Take hand sanitiser with you. Leave the car behind where possible and visit nearby attractions by walking, cycling or public transport.Heidi and Stuart Cordner have reopened their self-catering property on the shores of Loch Lomond and their family-run passenger cruise business, Cruise Loch Lomond.The -person rental property is set in self-contained grounds on the shore of the lake, and the Cordners hope guests will contribute to the local economy while being respectful.They have implemented virus prevention measures in both the property and on the boats, including increased cleaning and social distancing procedures.They have also invested in additional cleaning equipment and training for cleaning staff.Passengers are asked to wear face coverings and book in advance, and capacity has been reduced to allow for social distancing.“We live in a small community but we’re fortunate that there’s a lot of space and our main business is an outdoor activity,” said Mr Cordner.Cool Camping is a curated website of small, independently-run camping and glamping sites across Wales and beyond.  Marketing manager James Warner Smith said: “Having campfires, spreading yourself out, being able to chat with the owner of the business who’ll be able to recommend a local pub – they’re all big parts of the appeal of camping.“You’re much more likely to be pitching your tent among shrubs and long grass with a lot of space between you and your neighbours.” The company has been working closely with campsites in Wales to ensure safety guidelines are met. At the moment, only self-contained accommodation can open, so the website only allows those types of sites to be booked.  They’ve introduced a new feature on the website where each business can indicate what new safety measures they’ve put in place.  Among the most popular places among potential visitors is Pembrokeshire, with secluded spots outside of national parks all proving popular.·         Wales is open for camping from  July.Northumberland’s oldest castle hotel, Langley Castle near Hexham, has reopened to visitors, with all the appropriate “defences” in place. The castle, which has survived attacks by Border Reivers and a fire that left it as a ruin for centuries, has again been buzzing with guests who have been impressed by the sanitary and social distancing measures that Langley has already put in place. The management team makes many arrangements upfront, such as menu choices and payments, as part of the social distancing procedures that are required. Other changes affect check-in and check-out times, to enable the housekeeping team to carry out deep cleans.

But it has also been a time of positive change and reflection, prompting people to be more creative. Writing, be it poetry, song writing or short stories, for example, has given many a way of making sense of this time, of sharing their feelings and looking after their mental health.For those who have found it dficult to know where to begin, Seil author Kenneth Steven offers this advice to help you start your creative writing journey.For me, there are two essential ingredients when it comes to setting out as a creative writer: time and space. By creative writing I mean poetry, short stories, novels and children’s writing: everything involving the use of the imagination.When someone claims they don’t have time to write, I don’t believe them as it’s a question of making time.PD James started writing when nursing a dying husband: he needed care all through the day. There was a part of the night when finally he went to sleep and she had the chance to put pen to paper, so that was what she did. If we are serious about wanting to write, we will make time.For many years I lived in Dunkeld, close to the entrance to the cathedral. When friends heard my address they would roll their eyes and say: ‘What a place to be. And you’re lucky enough to be a writer.’Except it wasn’t that easy. The truth is the modern world invaded even that idyllic corner of Scotland.First, there were thousands of pilgrim feet and voices. I was driven mad by not being able to find sufficient quiet. My former we watched a great deal of television. It was a tiny flat and the distant murmur of low voices maddened me because I couldn’t concentrate.It was she who suggested # probably to stop the grumbling # that I should have a cabin built in my mother’s garden in Aberfeldy, a place where I could hide away to write. After considering the idea for a few days, I realised she was right.When finally I sat down to start working in that simple shed among the trees, the words poured from the pen. I will never forget those first days. Poem after poem appeared as though by magic on the page. For me # and after many years of leading creative writing sessions, I would suggest for the vast majority of others too # finding real quiet makes all the dference.But it doesn’t have to be a hideaway in a garden it can be a living room or a bedroom or an attic – just at a time when others in the household are asleep or absent.There are few rules for creative writers, but one I have discovered is that we are all larks or owls. We’re either attracted to early morning or late evening.I have yet to meet anyone who has said they’re drawn to the mid-afternoon # what I term # hammock time, though that’s when I wrote in the Aberfeldy cabin. I’ve come to believe strongly you will use the time you are given. If that’s what you have, you will adapt to that rhythm.But I quickly came to realise in my cabin that I couldn’t simply turn on good writing like a tap. We go into our creative space weighed down by the modern world. We live lives beset by emails, phone calls and text messages. We are all expected to respond quickly.I think creative writers are generally poor when it comes to practice writing. The creative lives of visual artists, actors, singers and musicians are dominated by practice. Why should it be dferent for those from the writing community What do I mean by practice writing  Describing the view out of the window going back into memory to capture a moment as evocatively as possible imagining a dialogue between two characters. There’s no end to the possibilities. What practice writing provides is creative grounding. It brings us from being all over the place in our minds to give us creative focus.What this practice allows us to do is to start, then to pour ourselves into what I like to call deep writing. It creates a kind of doorway so the real writing can begin.Kenneth Steven is best-known as a poet. Sixteen of his collections have been published and he writes and presents poetry-related programmes for BBC Radio. He is also a Scottish novelist and children’s author. He’s written two handbooks on writing and led workshops and worked as writer in residence at home and abroad. www.kennethsteven"},{"url":null,"title":"surge for ferry tickets expected today","story":"Ellis ButcherUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsCalMac has today opened up bookings into October but has warned customers its telephone and websites will be #very busy#.Following discussions with Transport Scotland, the ferry company opened bookings at am for the period up to and including October .It said customer reservations made before bookings closed earlier this year are already in the system.But with the implementation of the latest physical distancing guidelines, capacity on ferries will still be less than it would be in normal circumstances, the company said.The company said: #Access to our website will be managed by a queue system, which is in place during periods of high demand to provide an improved booking experience.#When in the queue, customers will automatically be directed to our website when it#s their turn.

There are a lot of young people for whom the real world is more amazing than anything you could make up.\"Again, thats another thing were born with that gets beaten out of us, and we start using the word ordinary ndash and theres nothing ordinary.\"Were surrounded by magic. You think Harry Potters magic  Just look around you.\"That curiosity is our biggest asset because thats how we learn to adapt, thats how we learn to survive, thats how we learn to cope with the world around us as it changes.\"Lloyd, who previously worked as a Sunday Timesjournalist, was inspired to begin a career as a childrens author after seeing the joy his children experienced when they learnt new things during their years in home-schooling.Particularly that of one of his daughters who was astonished to learn all about Antarctica ndash home of her then favourite animal, the penguin.\"I believe fundamentally, especially now having done thousands of talks in schools and festivals over the last  years, that humans generally reach peak curiosity at the age of nine or ,\" Lloyd said.\"Then things start to get in the way, like puberty and your friendship groups change and going from primary to secondary school.\"But at the age of nine or  youve got that purity of curiosity where youre old enough to know that you have an identity and youre curious enough to want to know where you fit in.\"Theres nothing you cant talk to a nine or -year-old about ndash provided you dont patronise them, provided you dont have an expectation of them that they cant meet.\"If you can meet them as fellow kindred spirits on this rock travelling around the sun, in this incredible galaxy,

Credit: Jevelin Getty ImagesAnything that rubs against your face for hours on end is bound to cause some irritationmdashand face masks are no dferent. lsquoWhen it comes to cloth or surgical masks, we are primarily seeing mild skin irritation, mild comedones , and reactions to the fabric itselfrsquo, Allie McAllister, BSN, FNP-C, DCNP, explains. lsquoWhile just wearing a mask can cause friction which can be irritating to the skin, the types of materials, dyes, and detergents in the mask can also cause irritation and rashesrsquo.Besides rashes and chafing, face masks can also lead to breakouts. It makes sense when you think about itmdashyour mask is creating a moist, warm environment against your skin, which is perfect for bacteria to thrive. lsquoBreakouts can occur from sweat, dirt, and moisture being trapped under the maskrsquo, McAllister says.How to protect your skin from your face maskAlways start with a clean face. Credit: Getty ImagesFor starters, McAllister says you should always thoroughly wash your face before you put on your mask and after you take it off Cerave Hydrating Facial Cleanser in particular because its gentle and non-irritating. Then, McAllister recommends, lsquoIf you know yoursquoll be wearing your mask for a long period of time I would suggest applying a thin layer of Aquaphor Healing Ointment to the areas that will come in direct contact with the mask.rsquoYou can also try an anti-chafing balm, like Body Glide which is is a favourite of Reviewed staffers who run. Apply it on areas where your mask typically rubs against your skin, like the nose, cheeks, chin, or ears.Keep in mind, too you should wash your face mask regularly in the laundrymdashand McAllister agrees. She suggests using a detergent specically for sensitive skin thats free of any dyes or perfumes.Bonus: If you have the luxury of picking and choosing your mask , McAllister says the type of fabric can make a big dference in your masks comfort. She recommends a soft cotton fabric thats more breathable than other alternatives.McAllister says once again to start with Aquaphoryou notice any irritation or discomfort. However, she advises that you speak to a dermatologistthe irritation is more severe or does not resolve with Aquaphor.And as for breakouts, our lestyle writer and beauty guru Jessica Kasparian has a few products she swears by. lsquoIf a blemish pops up, I love the Mario Badescu Drying Lotion, which uses isopropyl alcohol to dry up pimples and calamine lotion to soothersquo, she says, adding, lsquoI also love hydrocolloid patches like the CosRX Acne Pimple Master Patch set. Theyre clear dots that extract impurities while also creating a protective layer over the pimple so nothing  can irritate itrsquo.

Irsquom also ready to accept some fundamental political realities.Letrsquos face it, wersquore all just guinea pigs now, part of a radical public health experiment the likes of which has never been attempted before. This experiment is reaching its most dficult phase yet, the bit where the Government has to somehow let people start doing normal things ndash like going back to work and spending money to keep the economy going ndash while simultaneously reminding us that we wersquore not out of the woods yet. They have to encourage people to go out, while keeping them scared.Many ndash including me ndash have criticised politicians for their missteps and mixed messages over the last few months. But I also recognise a number of basic truths that itrsquos better to get onersquos head around sooner rather than later, regardless of party politics.The first is that until coronavirus has been completely eradicated around the world, risk is going to play a part in our lives for the foreseeable future. The second is closely related: the state cannot tell us exactly how to manage this risk in every single circumstance. We may get health advice and government guidance, but ultimately we have to navigate this new, more precarious world on our own.How we do this, and, crucially, how we feel about doing it, depends on many dferent things, of course, not least our age and underlying health, our financial situation and, to a signicant extent, our personality.I know there are some who believe that through lting lockdown restrictions politicians in Westminster and Holyrood are very deliberately handing over responsibility ndash and thus blame ndash to the public for what comes next. And there may be some truth to this. But come on, letrsquos get real.Accusations of ldquomaking it up as they go along are thrown around asthis was an insult rather than simply a fact describing the predicament governments everywhere find themselves in. How could it be otherwise given the extraordinary events of the last six months  And whatrsquos the alternative to us being public health guinea pigs  Staying at home forever Community levels of the virus in Scotland are now low and falling. Our hospitals lie empty. We have a test and trace system in place to ndash hopefully ndash crack down on infections. Meanwhile, wellbeing continues to suffer under the restrictions and hundreds of thousands of jobs hang in the balance. All of these things mean we can and should lt the lockdown. And lting restrictions means the vast majority of folkmust decide for themselves what level of risk they are comfortable contending with, taking into consideration how it might affect their family and community as well as their own personal circumstances.We can help ourselves along the way. Firstly by staying up to date ndash through trusted, legitimate scientic and public information sources ndash about how the virus is transmitted and the best ways to stay safe.We can also resist the temptation to judge others for their decisions. Frankly, Irsquom sick of the army of armchair virologists spouting their culture war vitriol on social media. On one side you have those who seem to relish the lockdown, the class swots who shout too loudly about how they follow every part of the guidanceand seem to revel in the idea of a second wave. On the other side, you have the virus deniers. Both groups peddle fear and misinformation, whether that is their intention or not.At the end of the day none of us, not even the scientists, know whether and when there will be another wave of the virus. Uncertainty permeates through every part of our lives now, and we must find ways to live with and even embrace thiswe are to make it through the tough months ahead.

Those that belong to the pea and bean familyfor example, in summer, can store nitrogen in their roots,that can be ploughed back into the earth.Which crops make good green manures At this time of year they include mustard, fodder radish, fenugreek, buckwheat and phacelia, which can be slotted in in six to eight week gaps when the ground is cleared between crops. Some sown in early autumn, including winter beans, grazing rye and winter tares, will last through the winter and can be dug into the soil when it warms up in spring.How long do they take to grow Some, such as mustard, are fast-germinating. Two weeks after sowing youll find the ground covered with small seedlings, and after six weeks, these can be chopped and folded into the soil to add nutrients.Fenugreek is another nitrogen-fixer for summer, really fast growing and its bushy plants are great for suppressing weeds. It can be planted in late spring or summer and grown for up to three months.When do I cut them down Chop the fast-growing ones when you need the ground back. Just dig them up, chopping up the leaves and stems as you go to speed up decomposition. Leave them a few days to wilt and then dig them into the soil.Longer term crops such as alfalfa, red clover and trefoil can be left in the ground for a year and clipped from time to time to stop them from going woody. They are ideal for soil thats been overused and needs to rest.What benefits do they provide Clover, fenugreek, winter beans and alfalfa are good nitrogen-fixers, storing nitrogen in their roots, while clover and phacelia flowers are a magnet for beneficial insects, which can help pollinate crops, so leave some to flower. Italian ryegrass and buckwheat have root systems that will help break up heavy ground.When can I plant crops in the space again A few weeks after youve dug in your green manure, you can sow late crops such as onion and garlic.WhatI want to wait If you have no crops to fill the space, cover the green manure-treated bed with cardboard or landscape fabric to keep the nutrients from the green manure in, which will give you a great seedbed to sow seeds in come spring.What  can I grow to help my crops Try growing comfrey, which absorbs nutrients and minerals and can be made into a liquid feed. Just cut it down to the ground, fill a bucket with the leaves and stems of the plant, packing them in tightly and then filling the bucket with water.Set it aside for three weeks , then strain off the liquid into a container with a tight lid. When you want to feed your plants, dilute the liquid with water at a ratio of around : and feed your plants weekly into autumn."},{"url":null,"title":"gardening-10-best-gardens-visit-summer","story":"Still short of things to do during summer holidays  Why not visit some of our most glorious gardens, which have reopened to the public.They all detail the Covid- safety measures theyve put in place on their websites.

He saw it dferently, calling her interventions ldquointolerable.The Thatcher-Major tussle was something of an exception, with most past leaders taking care not to criticise from the sidelines. Yet the rules, as well as being unwritten, are fluid. Mr Major himself threatened to take Boris Johnson to court for proroguing parliament.Tony Blair has fast become the past premier most likely to pop up with ldquohelpful advice, as he showed on Sky Newsrsquos Ridge on Sunday.With the BBC Sunday programmes now on their summer hols, presenter Sophy Ridge made the most of being the only show in town, breezing straight in on the dayrsquos big story ndash the sudden imposition of a fortnightrsquos quarantine for holidaymakers ing from Spain. Among those caught out by the rule change was Englandrsquos Transport Secretary, Grant Shapps.Jon Ashworth, Shadow Health Secretary, called the Governmentrsquos performance ldquoshambolic.\"There are holidaymakers in Spain at the moment confused and distressed, there are people about to go on holiday to Spain and the islands like Tenere who are confused, and they dont know whether their employers will allow them to take two weeks quarantine. The Government is just saying, We hope that employers co-operate. I hope I win the lottery on Saturday but that doesnt mean it is going to happen.Dominic Raab, the Foreign Secretary, was a hasty addition to the line-up. On a typical Sunday, Ridge has to make do with grabbing pavement interviews with Ministers when they are on their way to The Andrew Marr Show. This time, Mr Raab was live in the studio, at the requisite two metre social distance.No worker following quarantine guidance should be penalised by employers, he said, including by being put onto sick pay.\"If someone is following the law in relation to quarantine and self-isolating the way they should, they cant have penalties taken against them.\"As for his ministerial colleague Mr Shapps being caught on the hop, the Foreign Secretary said it showed the risks for everyone.Mr Raab could not guarantee other countries would follow Spain and be taken off the ldquosafe list.\"All we can say is weve got this Joint Biosecurity Centre, we monitor the risk in real time, we take decisive swt action and so there is an element of uncertainty this summerpeople go abroad.

The latter seems unlikely given how busy he seems to be with the modestly titled Tony Blair Institute for Global Change.

You can read what he had to say in full where in the paper, but in summary: Boris Johnson was uselessScottish Labour had been uselessand current Labour leader Keir Starmer was proving usefulIt was fairly predictable stuff for the former Prime Minister, except for the end when Ridge asked why he could not seem to wrench himself away from politics.

Therersquos a general acceptance that, rather than sharing culpability with previous generations, we are the ones at whose door it can be laid. Obviously there is a lot of truth in that, as we continue to consume oceans of gas and oil, and despoil the seas with plastic. Yet the culprits for harming nature and tipping it out of kilter can be found in centuries past as well as in the international departure lounges of our airports. We should not shoulder all the blame.Irsquom thinking, as one example in my own backyard, of James V. For all his qualities as a leader he was never as impressive as his father James IV, or even his daughter Mary Queen of Scots. Quite apart from his military deficiencies at the Battle of Solway Moss, James V is the man who introduced , sheep into the Ettrick Valley, to raise money for his ambitious plans. In so doing, he destroyed the ancient Ettrick Forest, in which he and other royals had hunted and killed stags by the barrowload. The kingrsquos flocks arrived a some point after , and it did not take them long to strip the valley of its trees. By our own times, all that was left of this magnicent haven for wildle was a handful of thorn trees and birches. The rest is empty scrubland.I learned about this vandalous act in a newly published collection of essays called A Journey in Landscape Restoration: Carrran Wildwood and Beyond, edited by the biologists Philip and Myrtle Ashmole. Unlike most of the books I read this is not about the past, but about the future. There are almost as many photos as words, but the ones that most vividly illustrate the tale are those taken of the Carrran Valley, in the hills near Moffat.At the end of last century, this was a bleak expanse of severely depleted upland, grazed almost to extinction. A winter photo from  shows it as a dreary unrelieved desert: think of a chocolate brownie and yoursquod be close, though dusted with snow rather than icing sugar. Now, after  years of dedicated work by volunteers, it is growing lush once more. Swathes of native woodland clothe the hillsides, and its increasingly rich undergrowth is attracting an abundance of birds, insects, flowers, fungi and amphibians. The range of moths alone is heart-warming. As before and after images go, the dference could hardly be more striking.Previously you would have been lucky to hear much more than a grouse cackling, or watch a buzzard circling overhead now it is like the RSNO, as a sorts of birdle, from meadow pippits to willow warblers, wrens and winchats, strike up from the branches of native trees: birch, aspen, ash, oak, willow, rowan, hazel, Scots pine and juniper.In a series of pithy pieces,  of those who helped bring about this transformation describe how they went about it. Philip Ashmole originally had the idea to recreate an area of woodland in the Borders that replicated how it would have been before humans arrived. Out of this notion the Wildwood Group was established, which later formed itself into the Borders Forest Trust. On Millennium Day, the trust took ownership of the Carrran Valley, and set to work on creating a wildwood.In subsequent years, other ecological restoration schemes were also begun, at Corehead and Devilrsquos Beef Tub, and Talla and Gameshope. Together these groundbreaking ventures began to restore an area they have named The Wild Heart of Southern Scotland. Inspired by their example, others are now following their lead across the country.Living as I do in one of the great medieval sheep rearing districts of the Borders, in the vicinity of Melrose Abbey, itrsquos not hard to see the effect  and more years of grazing have had on the landscape. As one of the contributors to this book writes, sheep are engrained in our economy and culture, and they are the main reason, along with other herbivores such as voles, deer, goats and rabbits, why native woodland planting is rare: ldquoItrsquos no mystery: sheep eat trees. As flocks expanded, their predators ndash wolves and lynx ndash were killed, so that today other grazers, and especially deer, roam and breed without any natural check.The Borders Forest Trustrsquos vision was aided by bodies like the Forestry Commission and Scottish Natural Heritage, but its core remained a motivated army of volunteers. Many of these came with scientic credentials ndash geographers, botanists, ornithologists, ecologists and such like. Others were simply determined to help re-establish wilderness in barren terrain. One weekend last autumn,  members of the Glasgow branch of Extinction Rebellion arrived at Gameshope, and in two days helped plant , trees. In the words of Anna Craigen, the trustrsquos work would been impossible without volunteers: ldquoThey are our muscles, brains, eyes, dirty hands and the true heart of the Wild Heart.What is so uplting about this story is not just the determination and imagination of those who have made all this happen, but the tangible evidence of the regeneration they have promoted. Page after page of A Journey in Landscape Restoration is filled with photos of wildle now thriving in Carrran.Amid the bad news headlines about climate change, and images of bush fires, floods and landslides, it is good to be reminded of the things being done to turn the tide. Work such as that in Carrran Wildwood not only restores nature to its rightful state, but gives a terric boost to our own depleted sense of hope.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

The film has been more-or-less finished for almost a year, but like many films such as the latest Bond, it has been pushed back due to the coronavirus pandemic. Originally scheduled for July , the film has been delayed three times and even briefly taken off the roster entirely, triggering worried chatter from film fans.But now itrsquos finally coming out The filmrsquos producersrsquo Warner Bros. have announced Tenet will be releasing in  countries, a list that notably includes South Korea, Germany and the UK, but not the United States. The odds are in favour of the film debuting in Scotlandrsquos cinemas on August  as the producers have likely already lost signicant sums due to repeated postponements.Whatrsquos it all about Under Nolanrsquos all-seeing-eye, the cast and crew have taken a vow of silence on the inner workings of the film. Piecing together clues from trailers and marketing packages, the basic outline of the film appears to centre around the protagonist, played by John David Washington , who works for a shady organisation called Tenet. Washington is tasked with preventing global catastrophe by securing a device that seems able to reverse the flow of time: for example, the trailer features a car crash occurring in reverse, and a building littered in bullet holes from a shoot-out that hasnrsquot yet occurred. For those familiar with Nolanrsquos work, time-meddling will come as no surprise.Time-meddling  Can you be more specic Nolan is famous for fiddling with the flow of time in unconventional ways in many of his movies. Interstellar uses Einsteinrsquos theory of Relativity to show Matthew McConaugheyrsquos character, aboard a super-fast spaceship, experience a slower rate of time than his family back home on Earth, as McConaughey is tragically forced to watch decades pass for his family within the space of a few hours.Inception is infamously indecipherable due to its complicated concept of lsquodreams within dreamsrsquo, where the flow of time slows throughout each new lsquolayerrsquo of dreams. His early work, Memento, throws the concept of watchability almost out the window with the scenes arranged lsquoback-to-frontrsquo and the plot occurring in reverse.So itrsquos going to be totally incomprehensible then Probably not. Most of Nolanrsquos blockbusters are very accessible such as his last big release, Dunkirk, or his acclaimed Dark Knight Batman trilogy. Though his films sometimes contain confusing concepts, they are still an enjoyable experience, especially in the distraction-free cinema environment.Is it worth going to see then If you enjoy Nolanrsquos previous work or the action or thriller genres, itrsquos the film for you. And of course, the film features the biggest and best of Hollywoodrsquos blockbuster glitz, glamour, soundtrack and special effects.

They are also being reminded that there is local support available to them should they find themselves to be the victims of the issue.NFU Scotland Orkney#s regional policy advisor Kerry Omand said: “If anyone finds themselves to be in this unfortunate position there are key steps that they need to take and responsibilities that livestock owners have. I believe that the public are very aware of their rights and responsibilities as dog owners, and our members need to have the same knowledge and confidence in dealing with these situations.”The legislation relating to this is the DogsAct  and #worrying# is defined as attacking livestock, chasing livestock in such a way as may reasonably be expected to cause injury or suffering to the livestock or abortion as well as being at large, not otherwise under close control or on a lead, in a field or enclosure where there are livestock.Kerry highlighted: “There is often an assumption that an attack or incident must be physical for it to be taken seriously, and that is simply not the case as signicant harm can be caused to animals without any direct contact occurring.”If farmers come across an incident of livestock worrying they should contact the police on the incident is ongoing, or dial  to report the incident, try to contain the dogpossible and gather their livestock for treatment and or retain any dead livestock as evidence. Finally, a dog must only be shot as a last resortthey cannot be contained and this should be reported to the police within  hours.Kerry added: “I completely empathise with members who find themselves in this situation, having been the victim of livestock worrying myself. This was a few years ago now, but from that experience I would encourage farmers to gather evidencethey can, in the form of photos or videos of the incident occurring. That may seem like an unnatural thing to do when you are wanting to put an end to the incident as quickly as possible, but it also crucial to have this evidence to hand.”Mark Evans, animal welfare officer with Orkney Islands Council wants to remind dog owners to ensure that their dogs are always under control and avoid going into fields where livestock are grazing.He said“If a dog worries livestock on any agricultural land then the owner and or the person in charge of the dog, is guilty of a criminal offence.”Mark reiterates “Farmers should make every effort to catch the dogit is worrying livestock and it is only as a last resort to shoot the dogit is not able to be caught. This needs to be reported to the Police and to the Councils Trading Standards Service.”Orkney preventions and interventions officer with Police Scotland, Constable Simon Hay said: “The worrying of livestock can have devastating consequences for farm animals and has an obvious financial and emotional impact on farmers and their businesses.“The advice to dog owners or anyone walking and exercising their dogs in the countryside is to ensure they are under control at all times and avoid going into fields where livestock is grazing. The Scottish Outdoor Access Code says dogs should not be taken into fields where there are lambs or other young farm animals.#Police Scotland will enforce the existing legislation robustly, ensuring all reported cases of sheep worrying are thoroughly investigated and offenders reported to the Procurator Fiscal. Farmers and those who use the countryside are urged to report all incidents of livestock worrying to police on  or  in an emergency.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

According to NHS Orkney#s interim chief executive, Michael Dickson, this is because the new positive test was conducted by an industrial lab which had not been validated by the NHS.The inidual, who is not currently in Orkney — but has been in the county during the past week — has been asked to self-isolated. This person will be immediately re-tested by the nearest NHS veried lab — the Lighthouse Lab in Glasgow.  In the meantime, NHS Orkney will be tracing iniduals that the person in question has come into signicant contact with.It should be confirmed within the next three days whether this is indeed a new test-positive case — the tenth for Orkney,so.Mr Dickson said: #A number of industries use labs to undertake COVID swab tests and this labs are not validated by the NHS.#We can#t be confident that,the same test had been done in an NHS lab, it would have achieved the same result.#The interim chief executive, who is the permanent chief executive for NHS Shetland, explained that there had been a similar issue with a possible case within his home board. He added that, like in Shetland, he would be working to see whether some industries which have been testing their staff for the virus could do so through an NHS veried lab.#What we do is presume the person is positive,# Mr Dickson continued.#We kick in all the our well-rehearsed contact-tracing mechanisms and we instruct the person to self-isolate where they are.#When this happened in Shetland, the second test came back negative. It#s dficult, but we have to err by the side of caution.#Mr Dickson said that he understood that there would be an element of anxiety around this new possible case, and advised that all those who have come into signicant contact with the inidual in question will be contacted and asked to self-isolate for  days. If a contact is in a high risk category, a decision may be taken to immediately test them for coronavirus.#If you do not receive a call from our contact tracing team, then basically you#ve not been in signicant contact with this inidual,# the interim chief executive said.It is not knownthis case will be included in NHS Orkney’s positive COVID cases as the original lab is not an NHS facility.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

We must be willing to react to the first signs of trouble.He added: ldquoWe cannot be complacent and I wonrsquot stand by and allow this virus to threaten to cause more pain and more heartache in our country.He said that, with numbers rising, ldquoour assessment is that we should squeeze that brake pedal in order to keep the virus under control.Meanwhile on Friday:ndash The ONS reported an increase in the number of people testing positive for coronavirus in England, with Mr Johnson saying the prevalence of the virus in the community is likely to be rising for the first time since May. vw,vw,px, px\"ndash Data released on Friday showed the R value for the UK is between . to ., a slight rise from . to ..ndash It was confirmed sports events such as the snooker World Championships in Sheffield and the horseracing at Glorious Goodwood in West Sussex this weekend will now go ahead without fans.ndash The decision to postpone plans to allow indoor performances was described as a ldquobitter blow for the music industry.ndash Scotlandrsquos First Minister Nicola Sturgeon advised people not to travel across the border to those parts of northern England affected by a spike in coronavirus cases, while she said those ing should minimise contact with people from outside their household for  days.ndash Muslim leaders criticised the Government for the ldquoshockingly short notice of the new restrictions in parts of northern England, announced the night before the Islamic festival of Eid.On Thursday evening it was announced that people from dferent households in Greater Manchester, parts of east Lancashire and West Yorkshire would no longer be allowed to meet each other inside their homes or in gardens.The new rules, which came into effect from midnight, also ban members of two dferent households from mixing in pubs, restaurants and other hospitality venues, but these businesses will remain open for those visiting inidually or from the same household.Prof Whitty told the briefing: ldquoIf we wish to do more things in the future, we may have to do less of some other things.ldquoAnd these will be dficult trade-offs, some of which will be decisions for Government and some of which are for all of us as citizens to do.ldquoBut we have to be realistic about this. The idea that we can open up everything and keep the virus under control is clearly wrong.Other things which will not go ahead as planned across England on Saturday include indoor performances, reopening conference centres, and close-contact services such as facials and make-up application.PM @BorisJohnson has announced today that some of the proposed changes to the rules in August will be postponed for at least a fortnight.This is to keep the virus under control. Read his full statement here: https:t.co JMjgCppF pic TUYrWtlTgmdash UK Prime MinisterJuly , Despite the delay to the Governmentrsquos road map on reopening, Mr Johnson said he encouraged people ldquostill to think of wonderful staycations here in the UK.Mr Johnson said that, while most people are following the rules, there will be a ldquogreater police presence to ensure the public is adhering to requirements around face coverings and stressed that local authorities can close down premises and cancel events which are not following the guidance.Shielding advice ndash other than in affected parts of northern England ndashwill still be paused as planned on Saturday and the move to allow more discretion for employers with regard to staff ing to work will also go ahead, the Prime Minister said.Accepting that Fridayrsquos announcement would be a ldquoreal blow to people who had wedding plans or those who can no longer celebrate Eid as they had hoped, Mr Johnson said ldquowe simply cannot take the risk but vowed to open up more fully ldquoas soon as we possibly can.copy -.

DaoineNow there is much within the machinations that occupy the precious time of our Comhairle officers that could well be regarded as relatively ‘trivial’, although I will fully concede that even the most improbable deliberations might well form the centre of somebody’s entire universe.But when we, as a community, or section of that community, continue to press for answers and resolutions to a subject that has already been explained fully to us, then we should ask ourselves one important question: “Are we doing this for the greater good, or because we are trying to promote our own agenda ”. about some of the material that was included in the Scottish Government’s RSHPguidelines and how I felt that some of it was completely over the top for inclusion in any classroom.Several concerned parents had written to me, asking what on earth was going on.I enquired of both the Director and Chair of Education and Children’s Services as to the validity of these concerns.I was happy to note that the ‘plot’ wasn’t as sinister as had been portrayed by some ‘concerned’ groups both within the counciland on anti-social media.Some alleged that the Comhairle were somehow, through the back-door and under the cover of the Covid- crisis , trying to sneak through an agenda which went against the “moral values of this community”.An inflammatory accusation, one that was sure to ignite passions and ring yet another Pavlovian bell.Except that, far from being subject matter that was about to get rammed down our children’s throats, not just ‘promoted’ it was simply an extreme example of what was included for reference, should anyone wish to avail themselves of it.Yes, some of it was fairly graphic stuff and, as I’ve said before, I was hugely alarmed that it was even considered for anything to be found in our classrooms.But, as is the case with material which has been taught in our schools for at least a couple of centuries the devil is in the detail .Luckily we have seen teachers, historically, opt to use the message of love, forgiveness, compassion and mutual understanding from this particular tome ignoring the more sinister aspects where death, retribution, punishment and all kinds of nastiness are very much front and centre.Choosing your testaments wisely is what this is primarily about.We are lucky to have an educational framework where common sense prevails, otherwise there could be very many distractions in the subjects of Biology, Geology and quite possibly Physics.I attempted to be amusing about a topic which has very legitimate, obvious, and serious, implications for our most impressionableyoung people.I hoped I was taking a cue from people who think that a banana dipped into a jar of Nutella is a suitable metaphor for something.Possibly the obesity crisis I think a jar of Bovril might have been funnier.If people wish to identy as a Unicorn and have sex with the pavement, then that’s fine too, but not surely for inclusion in ‘guidance’ material.Yes, I have to admit that I also jumped onto the bandwagon, until I had the situation clearly explained to me and was told to trust the teacher’.They will be given the ultimate discretion and they know best what’s appropriate for their young audience.We do ‘much ado’ well here.When ‘Ironside’ and ‘Bob the Budget Builder’ steered the Comhairle and helped many local businesses through the worst of the effects of the ongoing pandemic, we turned inward and focused on upholstery.With Bernie, Angus and the Education Department, all under immense pressure to get a hugely problematic school year underway on time, we are more focused on what won’tbe getting taught, rather than what will, and how.Andour kids come home from school with a penchant for strange combinations of fruit and nut sandwiches, then it will have been discussed with the Head Teacher and Parent Council first.A lot of the contentious issues which occupy us here in the Western Islesare perceived to exist somewhere between a conservative, culturally protective, radically Christian, ‘right’, and a somewhat more progressive, more liberal, secular, bunch of left-wing snowflakes.Most of us are somewhere, far more certainly and squarely, in the middle trying to make sense of it all.If we cannot empower and trust our teachers to do what’s best for the most vulnerable amongst us, then we will have failed both.The man of the week, last week, certainly in the northern half of this county, was the irrepressible David Black.Three rounds crammed into  hours saw him claim the Thompson Bruce Trophy at Stornoway and take an early lead in Scarista’s  ‘Blue-Riband’ event.Rounds of +  around Lady Lever Park on Friday and Saturday saw him edge out Eddie Rogers,  +  by just a single shot over  holes.A further shot adrt saw Murdo ‘Griddy’ MacLeod,  +  in third slot.Iain ‘Juke Box’ MacKay won the handicap trophy with two excellent rounds of nett  for a  total.In between his Thompson Bruce exploits, Davie also posted the leading score in the, two-round, Harris G.C. Club Championship.His  was  shots ahead of nearest challengers, Billy Fraser and Cal Robertson, both on .Starting with six straight pars, he succumbed to bogies at the ‘amen’ of corners, the deadly-deceiving brace of par-s at   .Naturally he bounced straight back birdies at the new th, and the th brought him back to level.He swapped a birdie for a bogey at  and  to see him home safely.Only a sht in plate tectonics will see him throw away this lead.Midweek at Stornoway saw the Glennie Trophy claimed by Iain Moir on  Stableford Points. Starting his opening four holes, five-over par, couldn’t have been good for his confidence.He was just one-over for the next .In the Junior section, Calum Gbounced back from his recent humblings at the hands of brother, Geordie H in the Par Bogey competition.Six ahead of the course, he demolished the rest of the field by  clear shots.In the Scarista midweek competition, Billy Fraser kept up his, season-long, decent form, partnering Chris Sutton to a fine win in the Pairs Greensomes.Their  was two ahead of Russell Tennant and Alan Gunn’s, .Benbecula’s finest continue to battle it out for their season-long Order of Merit, Dami Steele ing a semblance of normality, bouncing back from a week out of the top spots to consolidate his lead at the top.His round wasn’t, however, good enough to claim the full points last Tuesday evening, Domhnall MacKay storming to a -pointer and the maximum Point haul.Apparently Donald has been keeping his powderdry and intends, after a decent sabbatical, to make a strong charge over the coming weeks."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3221834.jpg--.jpg?1594293881000\n","title":"patricia ready to steer inner wheel","story":"BALLYMENA’S Patricia Perry, has been appointed as all Ireland Chairman of the Inner Wheel Organisation.

Both creations have been made by the hands of very talented local Cullybackey people.Shellinghill Park in Cullybackey has for some time been the focus of the ‘CCP In Bloom’ team. Colourful flower beds and neatly mown grass has been the focus of their attention - until now.  Following permission from the Mid and East Antrim Council, the park has just acquired a beautully sculpted horse made entirely from horse shoes. This is a unique piece of art which has given the village something to appreciate and be proud of. The creator of this horse is Bertie McNeilly, who is a leading member of the village Bloom team. He is a self taught sculptor who created this le size sculpture using nothing but recycled horseshoes. The shoes were supplied by a local farrier. This specially designed sculpture is something which has added another dimension to their in bloom activities and, being made from horse shoes, might even bring us good luck in any future competitions!Bertie said he had this challenging task in his mind for some time.“We, in the Cullybackey Community Partnership, are always looking for something which will enhance the village and will also appeal to our “In Bloom” judges.

Cullybackey Community Partnership are very grateful to Bertie for his generosity in letting them have the benefit of his undoubted skills.They also thank Council for allowing them to use their ground to displaytheir latest acquisition.Knitted flowers displayMeanwhile, CCP have also been working on a knitted crocheted display of flowers in the last few weeks in honour of the NHS and to those who have supported them throughout this crisis. They are all made by people living in and around the Cullybackey area and each have their unique style.  This display can be seen in the Maine Business Centre window . The idea came from local lady Barbara Montgomery who assisted CCP Margaret Murphy to put together this amazing display.Margaret said as well as taking the opportunity to recognise the NHS and all support workers, she would like to thank the Cullybackey people who have taken time to knit or crochet hundreds of flowers to enable them to “put on this amazing display.”CCP have continued throughout this lockdown period to enhance the village with numerous floral displays which has resulted in the village looking amazing!

The industry reacted with disappointment to the UK government#s decision to impose a -day quarantine on tourists ing from Spain due to its growing level of coronavirus cases. The quarantine also covers Spain#s Canary and Balaeric Islands.TUI, the UK#s biggest tour operator, announced it is shutting around one third of its total of  stores.The decision was made following changes in customer behaviour, the firm said in a statement. Around  retail stores will remain following the closures. However, it would not comment on which Northern Ireland stores were at risk as a consultation is taking place.Tory MPs are putting pressure on Prime Minister Boris Johnson to introduce coronavirus testing at airports to cut the -day quarantine.And a group of  airlines, airports and tourism leaders - including Belfast International Airport chief executive Graham Keddie - have also called on the Prime Minister to introduce virus tests for those arriving in the UK. TUI said stores which are have reopened since the pandemic are not at risk of closure. But only one of its  Northern Ireland stores - a branch at Waterloo Place in Londonderry - have so far reopened. The shutters remain down at branches in Armagh, Coleraine, Lisburn, Newtownards, Ballymena, Craigavon, Omagh, Dungannon and Newry - as well as two branches in Belfast#s CastleCourt Shopping Centre and on Bloomfield Avenue.The chain has  stores in the Republic and is based in Germany.Andrew Flintham, managing director of TUI UK and Ireland, said: We want to be in the best position to provide excellent customer service, whether it#s in a high street store, over the telephone or online, and will continue to put the customer at the heart of what we do. It is therefore imperative that we make these dficult cost decisions, look after our colleagues during such unprecedented uncertainty and also offer a modern customer service.TUI is the latest high street chain after bakery chain Greggs and bookseller Eason to indicate that it won#t reopen at least some of its shops following lockdown.Greggs is closing three of its  stores - while Eason has shut all seven of its remaining Northern Ireland stores.Glyn Roberts, the chief executive of Retail NI, hoped TUI would provide clarication on which stores will be affected by the closure plans.It#s fair to say that this was a company which was facing a signicant challenge before Covid- due to the growth in online holiday bookings, he said.And in other businesses such as Eason which have also faced troubles before Covid, Covid- has now almost finished them off.There are not just the effects from the numbers of jobs lost in retailers, but closures like TUI and Eason also had a knock-on effect as footfall into the area is diminished.The pandemic and lockdown have had a catastrophic effect on demand for overseas holidays, with many bookings cancelled after quarantine was introduced. Yesterday easyJet cancelled a number of its flights.In a letter to Mr Johnson, the bosses of British Airways, easyJet and Jet demanded a more nuanced policy than the -day quarantine.They called for the introduction of regional travel corridors to replace the blanket requirement of -day quarantine for anyone ing from an at-risk country.Transport Secretary Grant Schapps cut his family holiday in Spain short as a result. As he ed to the UK, he defended the UK government#s decision.I very much understand, it obviously had an impact on me and my family, and I#m very, very sorry and upset for the thousands of Brits who are either away or perhaps even haven#t managed to go away this summer as well to Spain, he said.But it#s absolutely essential we acted when we did, it#s why all four nations of the UK acted together and the figures since have turned out to justy that action.We have to, I think, have a clear message and make sure we act by adding entire countries to that list for the time being.People who test positive for coronavirus or display symptoms must now self-isolate for  days as Health Secretary Matt Hancock warned of a second wave starting to roll across Europe.The UK#s chief medical officers said on Thursday that the period must increase from the current rule of seven days because of the risk iniduals may still be able to spread Covid-.In a joint statement, they said the change for those who experience the key symptoms of a new continuous cough, high temperature or loss of taste or smell is needed because of the low but real possibility of infectiousness up to  days.Their move came as official analysis said England had the highest levels of excess mortality in Europe across the first half of .Belfast Related ContentNorthern Ireland PremiumReliance on nursing temps could jeopardise patient safety in Northern Ireland: reportPatient safety could be compromised by a reliance on temporary staff to plug gaps in Northern Ireland#s nursing and midwery sector, a report has warned.Northern Ireland PremiumBelfast#s #Breastival# in plagiarism rowThe organisers of an annual Belfast festival celebrating all things breastfeeding have expressed anger after their name was used by a well-known baby brand to promote a similar event.

Lavey Parish pooled their energies to raise almost pound, to contribute to the recent work on St Mary’s Church of Our Lady of Mercy. Parish priest Fr Eamon Graham was delighted to see the community coming together. “Weve just come to end of a very extraordinary week in our parish and community,” he said. “Ive certainly been overwhelmed - I think we all have - by the level of generosity, but I think something even more important was that so many aspects of our community pulled together. googletag.cmd.push “You know, we enjoyed it, enjoyed it very much. At the end of the lockdown period I think we were all, kind of, looking for a lt of some kind and it certainly gave us all a great lt. “I want to say a sincere thanks to everybody who was involved - everybody who was at the organising end of it, and particularly to the groups that took part.” The fundraiser received huge community support, with local sports clubs in the area all taking on a specic challenge to help with the chapel’s restoration. Erin’s Own GAA’s underage footballers and hurlers ran km each, while their senior counterparts ran a collective km. googletag.cmd.push Termoneeny Hill Walking Club had originally pledged to walk a collective km, but upped their target to ,km during the course of their challenge. Termoneeny Cycling Club members each cycled km, while the Erin’s Own camogie players each clocked up at least km. -year-old Harry Boyle’s remarkable contribution saw him cycling around all the townlands in the parish, while Fr Graham and his parochial team got involved by running in their Lavey gear. The challenge was not just limited to Lavey, though, and their diaspora throughout the world got involved via social media, sharing photos of them completing their contribution. The club have raised almost pound, to date and donations can still be made via the Lavey Parish Just Giving page.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The public health crisis has also delayed a number of projects that were expected to open in this spring and summer. Construction of a -star,  bed resort hotel with spa and leisure facilities overlooking Ebrington Square was set to start in May . It has been delayed for at least seven months due to both the health and economic implications of COVID-. Works are now planned to start in early . Grade A offices next to the Waterside Roundabout were due to open in mid-. googletag.cmd.push It has the potential to accommodate up to  staff. The developer Heron Property Limited received planning approval from the Department for Infrastructure in September . Construction works started last December but ceased in March due to COVID-. Works are programmed to start in the coming days and the building now has a revised opening date of February . On a positive note, the Kevin Watson Group moved into a building on the site in February. Residential, commercial office space, childcare and creative industries space are nearing completion with the first tenant due to take up occupation in late September . googletag.cmd.push However, plans for the opening of a cafeacute and bike hire business have been postponed until January . Other planned openings including a licensed restaurant and bar and a convenience store will take place next year. The lack of development at the site has been heavily criticised in the past. The former military base was gted to the city in  by the Ministry of Defence. Urban regeneration company, Ilex, was established to undertake development of the site but it was shut down in . At present there is a creative industries hub, the Walled City Brewery, Stables Inn coffee house and bistro, small-medium enterprises in a building and Glen Caring occupies a small unit.

On July , , Ray Cossum set off from France to swim across the English Channel. He completed the journey non-stop in a time of  hours  minutes. In doing so, he became the first Irishman to officially swim across the channel. It had been a long-held ambition for Ray. Born in Folkestone on the south coast of England in , he grew up hearing stories of people who had swam across the channel. It was an ambition he would come back to later in his adventurous le. googletag.cmd.push Ray served in the Royal Nay for eight years, five of which were in the submarine service as an escape instructor. While he was in the Navy, he was based in Derry where he met and married Bridie Loughrey, before the couple set up home and raised a family in Creggan. His love of long-distance swimming was developed and honed in the waters of Lough Swilly in Donegal where he regularly swam between Buncrana and Rathmullan. After much preparation, he decided to take his efforts to another level by attempting the channel swim he had heard so much about when growing up. googletag.cmd.push However, it was not an easy thing to achieve. He tried unsuccessfully twice to complete the swim. However, he finally realised his dream in the summer of . Almost  hours after leaving France, on July , , Ray made it back on to land near his home town of Folkstone. “I had tried to so the swim a couple of times before and on one of those times I was just a couple of miles from finishing it when I had to stop because of gale force winds,” he said. “So it was great to finally manage to swim across the channel and it was a big relief after all the training I had put in.” As a result of his success in , the local man became involved in the Channel Swimming Association which is the official body which regulates channel swims. He later went on to become vice president of the association. He remains proud of his achievement  years ago and the special relationship he has with the Englisn Channel. “I can say that I have worked as a er on the bottom of the English Channel, I have swum the channel, I was vice president of the Channel Swimming Association, I have passed through the channel in submarines, I have been through the Channel Tunnel, I have flown over the channel and passed over the channel on ships,” he said. “So I can say that I have see the channel from every angle possible.” Ray is also well-known locally for his deep-sea ing exploits. In , he bought the rights to the wreck of the SS Laurentic which sank on January ,  after striking a mine at the mouth of Lough Swilly. There were  passengers on-board the ship. Of these,  people died and only  survived. After the Laurentic sank, the Royal Navy organised a huge amount of es over subsequent decades to recover a large number of gold bars which were worth an estimated poundm in . Since buying the rights to the wreck, Ray has organised a large number of es to what remains of the vessel and had also been heavily in preserving artefacts which have been salvaged from it.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Desertmartin and Craigbane have dropped from intermediate, to be paired with  junior champions Magilligan. Also in the mix are Moneymore and Drum, who have lost the last two junior deciders. In an interesting subplot, Derry senior captain Chrissy McKaigue and County Chairman Stephen Barker will be in opposing camps. Ballerin have been paired in the other section with Doire Colmcille, Ardmore and Sean Dolans who have struggled to find any kind of form in recent seasons. Craigbane v MagilliganFriday– BanagherRef: Emmet McShane James McGrath s as Craigbane boss, but points to a lack of action in what he describes as a trying season for the players. googletag.cmd.push They learnt a tough lesson against Tyrone side Naomh Eoghan, an amalgamation of Dregish and Newtownstewart. It was their first game since February . Lee Moore ed from Australia but transferred to Dublin club Thomas Davis to train. He is back with his native Craigbane but is on the injured list. He is joined by Bliain Gormley, who made had initially made it back from a gruelling injury. John Kerlin has ed from Australia, but like the rest of the squad is lacking game time. Craigbane have brought through underage talent in recent seasons. Fergal Mortimer in attack is an important player and will be joined this year by Jude Oacuteg Moore and Jude McLaughlin, who has been their main man in attack. googletag.cmd.push Brian Rainey remains as as experienced player, who has coached many of the players coming up through the ranks. In defence Naoise Oacute Mianaacutein, Oisin McCloskey and Conor McLaughlin have made it though and will line out in front of goalkeeper Conor McGuinness. They face Magilligan this weekend, who have former Derry underage player Shane Kealey from Faughanvale in charge, with another Vale man Kevin Morrow and Eamon McLaughlin. Kealey hails the quality of the , while he lamented how small it is. It looks like they will be without Colly Mullan who ended up on crutches after an injury at training. A knee injury has also kept Ciaran OHare out this season. After a good preseason, Kealey has struggled to get challenge games and the latest lockdown after the recent Covid- cases in the local Limavady area hampered their progress further. The Joe Brolly Cup wont be won or lost on Friday night, but the loser will be on the back foot as one team from the group will drop out the race. There shouldnt be much in it, but Craigbane should come through. VERDICT: Craigbane Desertmartin v MoneymoreFriday– LoupRef: Cathal Doherty There is a local derby on Friday night, with Desertmartin and Moneymore crossing paths. Both clubs have new managers. Cookstowns Jason Quinn is at the helm in Moneymore, with clubmate Daire Cummings along with him. They were dealt a blow with goalkeeper Liam Macinnes sustaining a broken leg in training, leaving Derry Chairman Stephen Barker and Padraig Donaghy vying for the number one jersey. Rory Young hasnt committed this season and while Paudie ONeill is back out helping with training, its uncertainhe willto the action on the pitch. Quinn reckons their team this weekend could have  or  players under the age of . Oisin ONeill, Cian ONeill and Abban McCloy have broken into the team in recent years. This season Deaglan Mallon and Lee Colville have joined the . Desertmartin brought in Slaughtneil duo Kevin ONeill and Chrissy McKaigue as their managers, who are assisted by Danny Murray and Ciaran Higgins. The Saffrons have dropped down from the intermediate grade and outside of Ronan McGuckins serious ankle injury sustained early in the season, ONeill report a clean bill of health including Enda McGuckin who has had injury problems. Gavin Donnelly and Eunan McElhennon made their debut last season, with Callum Ormsby coming into the fold this year. In a group where one team will drop out of the championship, there will be a certain bite to all the games. Desertmartin should come through this one.

Adrian McGilligan is joined in the Glack management team by Willie Canning and former Doire Colmcille boss Simon Doherty. McGilligan feels the championship is somewhat of a lottery with the lack of preparation and player welfare needs to come first. googletag.cmd.push Back in the fold this year is Tommy OKane who s from a knee injury.

They will lament not adding an intermediate championship since. Had they not finished with  men in the final against Newbridge, they wouldve asked more questions and last year, after pinning Foreglen down, failed to hold them on the canvass.

OKane is struggling with a back injury and would be a huge loss. Aaron Cassidys hip has curtailed his preparation and Gray doesnt expect to see Eunan Murray until later in the season. Eoghan Carlin is once again in charge of Doire Trasna, who travel to John McLaughlin Park this weekend.

Eoghan Quigg was a huge addition to the  last year, to help carry the scoring burden. Trasna have established themselves as an intermediate side and with their new grounds on the horizon, the next step has to be a another move upwards to challenge for the title. It wont define their season, but it is a tough start and the form of Faughanvale in their recent game with Ballinascreen should help them come through this one.

They will lament not adding an intermediate championship since. Had they not finished with  men in the final against Newbridge, they wouldve asked more questions and last year, after pinning Foreglen down, failed to hold them on the canvass. After a distinguished career and great service, Stevie King wont be part of Grays plans after persistent injuries forced him to hang up the boots after last season. googletag.cmd.push Eoin McElhinney, Michael Sweeney and Paddy OKane represent the new wave of players who played Grade A at underage, getting to finals at U and U level. OKane is struggling with a back injury and would be a huge loss. Aaron Cassidys hip has curtailed his preparation and Gray doesnt expect to see Eunan Murray until later in the season. Eoghan Carlin is once again in charge of Doire Trasna, who travel to John McLaughlin Park this weekend. It it much the same squad as in recent seasons, with Tomaacutes McCrossan, Paul Quigley, Caolan Doyle, Colin Murray and the McNaughts – Sean and Micheaacutel – forming their spine. googletag.cmd.push Cormac Carlin is in England and wont figure, while Poacutel Brown sustained the dreaded cruciate ligament injury. They have signed Mark Healey, goalkeeper Aidan Campbell from Doire Colmcille, former Ardmore player Damien McGee and Ballyhaunis man Darren Coyne, while David Officer has moved up from underage. Eoghan Quigg was a huge addition to the  last year, to help carry the scoring burden. Trasna have established themselves as an intermediate side and with their new grounds on the horizon, the next step has to be a another move upwards to challenge for the title. It wont define their season, but it is a tough start and the form of Faughanvale in their recent game with Ballinascreen should help them come through this one.

One Big Field Party is being held this Sunday on a large green area beside Creggans Linsfort Drive. The event is free to attend, but donations will be collected for local musicians who have performed for free throughout lockdown to raise money for local charities and people in need. Local charity fundraisers Gavin Gallagher and Steven Gallagher have organised virtual gigs and street parties throughout lockdown with the help of local entertainers which have raised pound, for local good causes. googletag.cmd.push We always wanted to do something like this to say thank you to the local acts who have done so much during lockdown, but we had to wait until the rules had relaxed a bit, explained Gavin Gallagher. Some people have said to us that there have been a few reported cases of coronavirus recently andthat spike continues we will cancel the event. But at the minute we are taking every precaution to make sure everyone is safe, including using  security staff and a team of litter pickers, Mr Gallagher asked those attending the concert to observe social distancing rules. googletag.cmd.push We want people to come and to have a good time but we would ask that they abide by the rules. We are only here to entertain. If everyone does as the security people ask then everyone can have a good time. Lockdown has proved very challenging for Derrys entertainment community, with many losing all their income overnight. I would say about % of the musicians I know do it as their full time job and they lost everything, said Mr Gallagher. Many of those that were eligible for government support got so little that it was hardly worth their while. Despite this, they continued to gig online to keep peoples spirits up and raise money for charity. We hosted street parties across the city that made a really big dference to people in those areas. There was one wee woman of  who stood at her window crying and waving out because she was so happy and then she sent her son out with a donation of pound. Another time we heard about a woman who was turning  and we had singers up performing at her doorstep for an hour.One Big Field Party will take place on Sunday from pm to pm at Linsfort Drive.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Former Foyle College pupil Katie Smith landed her dream job at innovative Belgravia eaterie Wild by Tart last year at just -years-old. But after seven months in her new position, the restaurant had to shut for lockdown and Katie had to to leave her glamorous London le behind and move back in with her parents on the Limavady Road. Katie always had ambitions to work in the food industry and went to study at the prestigious Ballymaloe private cookery school in Cork straight after leaving school at . googletag.cmd.push My parents were really supportive of my decision, but my twin sister Abbie took a dferent route and went to Edinburgh University to study French and Spanish so in a way I can see the le I might have had, she explained. Having a trained pastry chef in the house definitely has its advantages. Im the resident chef in the house and Im doing most of the lunches and dinners, but thankfully not the breakfasts, laughed Katie. Coming from a high pressure job to being temporarily out of work was a big change of pace for Katie and she decided to launch a cookery e-book to fill her time. googletag.cmd.push I loved my job and I was learning so much from the people I was working with and then all of a sudden Boris told people not to go to restaurants and the bookings just dried up, she recalled. I remember on the Wednesday we had to close and on the Thursday I came home. I didnt expect to be home as long as this to be honest, and I like to keep busy so I decided to do something dferent. I was doing recipe testing so I decided to make a recipe ebook with my sister and donate % of the profits to a social enterprise charity Luminary Bakery for disadvantaged women in London. After the success of the ebook Katie decided to launch a pop up bakery from her parents kitchen offering brownies, cookies and pastries for pick up or delivery. As much as I love being at home Im looking forward to when things go back to normal and I can progress my career, she added. Katies recipe ebook is available at www.brilliantbake To order from her pop up bakery email katie@gmail or visit her Brilliant Bake page on Facebook.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

An Air Corps maritime patrol aircraft was dispatched and two Irish naval ships placed on standby after the skipper of the Killybegs-based fishing vessel, the Marliona, reported that a UK frigate ordered him to leave the area where he was fishing  miles off the Irish coast. It is understood that HMS Lancaster hailed the fishing vessel on Tuesday morning, informing the skipper they were commencing a joint operation with a submarine which would continue over the next three days. A maritime aircraft was sent to monitor the area where the UK warship was operating and two Irish naval vessels were redeployed. googletag.cmd.push The Marliona has since resumed fishing in the area which is west off Tory Island. Sinn Feacutein spokesperson on Foreign Affairs and Defence John Brady accused the British Navy of arrogance of the highest order and of once again endangering Irish fishing vessels. Deputy Brady said: “On one level, we have the outrageous scenario of a foreign power ordering an Irish vessel out of Irish waters. On the other, we have a situation where a British warship was engaged in a joint operation with a British submarine. The disregard for Irish sovereignty is arrogance of the highest order. But, alongside this we have the endangerment of Irish fishing vessels and their crews by a British submarine. googletag.cmd.push I thought that we had left this carry-on behind with the Cold War. For decades, British submarines have infringed on Irish sovereign waters, leading to tragedy and loss of le when submarines have got caught up in fishing nets and pulled trawlers under. It is staggering and unacceptable that this flagrant disregard for the safety of Irish fishing crews is continuing. This cannot be allowed to stand. I will ensure that this incident will not be allowed to be swept under the carpet.We need answers as to why this has been allowed to happen. I understand that the Department of Foreign Affairs has launched an investigation into the incident, and I will be in contact with the Minister to ensure that the governments response reflects the seriousness of the matter.  I also want to commend the response of the Irish Navy, which ordered Irish vessels to the area to ensure the safety of the fishing vessel in question. This incident underlines theneed to end the running down of the country’s defence forces and naval service by government.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The test centre was set up at the Judges Road home of City of Derry Rugby Club in April. However, as revealed recently by Derry Now - https:bit.ly DiqvOu-with the rugby club planning toto sporting action soon, a new base has to be found for the testing centre. The test site has now moved to the Lycra car rarkin Maydown. Initially testing was restricted to health and social care workers, it then accepted key workers and their families who had symptoms and more recently any member of the public with symptoms. googletag.cmd.push These tests can be booked via the Public Health Agency website. Many medical and disease control experts have said that testing and contact tracing is key to tackling the spread of COVID-. The Department has developed a COVID- ‘Test, Trace and Protect’ Strategy which sets out the public health approach to minimising COVID- transmission in the community in Northern Ireland. The key elements of the strategy are testing all people with symptoms of COVID-, contact tracing, providing information and advice on self-isolation, and support to enable people to self-isolate. It says for ‘Test, Trace and Protect’ to work, each citizen in Northern Ireland has a very important role to play. googletag.cmd.push “We must all prepare for the possibility of having to self-isolate and prepare to be tested in order to protect ourselves, our families and our communities. “Symptomatic members of the public are therefore encouraged to get tested early - this will be crucial in controlling the spread of the virus,” a spokesperson added.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Moville resident Enda Craig has urged local representatives to wake up and finally end all confusion over the Lough. Mr Craig made the comments following a motion at last weeks monthly meeting of Donegal County Council, where the issue of unregulated oyster fishing was raised. At the meeting in Letterkenny, local councillor Terry Crossan highlighted the environmental and visual impact an estimated , oyster trestles is having on the Lough. The Muff-based councillor asked council officials to contact the Marine Minister to engage with his British counterparts to seek to resolve the jurisdictional issues. googletag.cmd.push However Mr Craig stated that there are no jurisdictional issues between Britain and Ireland as the Crown Estate owns the seabed of Lough Foyle. The lough has been a disputed area between Britain and Ireland since the formation of the Irish Free State in . “You cant claim jurisdiction over something you dont own, its that simple,” he told the Inish Times. The Crown Estate is a collection of lands and holdings within the UK belonging to the British monarch as a corporation. Mr Craig said that the issue of jurisdiction has been settled and that local representatives should recognise that fact. googletag.cmd.push “I know that local representatives deal with numerous issues on a daily basis so they may not understand fully that Ireland has no jurisdiction over the lough at all, but it is time that they waken up and stop claiming jurisdiction over something that they dont own.” He also highlighted the feeling of unequal treatment that traditional oyster fishermen have received over the ongoing unregulated farms dotted along the Lough Foyle coast. “The traditional wild oyster fishermen look on as oysters are being harvested in large numbers on trestles on the shoreline of Lough Foyle by fishermen who are not burdened with a licence fee.” He added: “Any attempt to resolve the issue of licensing on the sea-bed of Lough Foyle without firstly taking into account its ownership by the Crown Estates is putting the cart before the horse and is doomed to failure.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Mid Ulster Christian Helpline is listed in the Councils directory as a prayer line and last month distributed literature in the Magherafelt area branding homosexuality detestable onto God. The leaflet also called on those who participate in such immorality to repent and turn from their evil ways and included contact details for people to get in touch. Independent councillors Dan Kerr and Barry Monteith have also written to council management to ask that the listing be removed because it may promote conversion therapy. googletag.cmd.push The incident is under investigation by the PSNI. A spokesperson for the council said the directory listings had been temporarily removed. The online directory offers local business and services a listing opportunity and any inclusion should not be considered as an endorsement by the Council for any goods or services provided by any organisation, they said. However, given the issue which has now arisen, the directory section where community and voluntary organisations have registered their details, has been temporarily removed to allow us to undertake a review of the provision of the service in line with our equality commitments, and to take advice as required. googletag.cmd.push  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Last weekend, Devines  European Rally Championship campaign got off to a frustrating start with an early retirement from Rally di Roma Capitale. Devine and co-driver Brian Hoy had shown promise early on with eighth fastest time in Friday qualying as well as being the quickest Hyundai i R, outpacing works Hyundai driver Craig Breen and fellow Hyundai Motorsport Customer Racing Junior Driver Greacutegoire Munster. On Saturday morning, Devine was running on the fringes of the top  and despite not being fully committed to his pacenotes, was outpacing Hyundai Rally Team Italia driver, and former Italian Champion, Umberto Scandola. googletag.cmd.push “We were slightly disappointed with our start and knew we had much more in us”, said Callum after the event. “We were just starting to get into a flow on stage three and building up speed. To try and be on the pace on these events you have to cut where you can and carry as much speed as possible. There was a fast corner through a dip which we cut and there was a bang as we went over some stones. We didn’t think much of it as it’s not unusual to hear noises like that while cutting a corner. But slowly the engine began to lose oil and then the oil pressure light came on  metres from the finish of the stage, he added. googletag.cmd.push We stopped the engine and coasted over the finish but that was game over. It turned out that in the compression a stone punched through the sumpguard and holed the sump, causing the engine to lose all its oil. I could probably take that corner  times and it would never happen again, it was just a freak thing but when you’re trying that card is always in the deck I suppose. I’m really disappointed for the whole team after all the effort that went into the weekend, I know we would have been in contention for a decent result.” His next European Rally Championship event in Latvia in mid-August and Devine has another chance to show his speed on Italian tarmac this weekend at Rally di Alba, where he joins Kilreas Josh McErlean, the current Young Irish Driver of the Year. Rally di Alba will take place on Sunday, August  with the crews taking on three stages repeated three times with the total competitive mileage of the event coming in at just over km. Following the event Callum and Brian willhome to prepare for Rally Liepāja, the second round of the ERC. “Latvia is a loose surface event andthe year had gone to plan, I would have liked a little more loose surface experience in the Hyundai before this stage of the year but it is what it is”, added Devine. “After a non-score in Rome and the championship having less rounds this year, we’ll need to take points away from Latvia.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Just nine days after this birthday, McErlean travelled to Italy last weekend for the European Championships to support Callum Devine, who will also race in Sundays event, and get his bearings ahead of this weekends action. Last year McErlean won the British Championship and picked up the Billy Coleman award for Irish Young Driver of the Year “This years British Championship was cancelled in June, so our plans were dashed and we had to come up with a plan B,” Josh told the County Derry Post. googletag.cmd.push In stepped Hyundai and the Motorsport Ireland Rally Academy to give him the opportunity in an event with a signicant Hyundai over it. “There are  other Hyundai R cars going, so there is a lot of competition, but it is great to get it,” add McErlean, who will be driving the same car used by Callum Devine in Rally Rome at the weekend. “It is great for the both of us winning the Billy Coleman award, from the same area and it shows you how far you can go with the backing of the Academy.” McErlean will again have the support of co-driver Keaton Williams and Junior British Rally Champion will take on one of the biggest challenges of his career so far, across nine stages on the roads of South West Italy. googletag.cmd.push Rally di Alba begins on Saturday with pre-event reconnaissance and a short shakedown stage near San Martino. The following day, nine stages lie ahead, three repeated, totalling just over  kilometres of special stage action before ing to Alba for the finish ceremony. “It will be a big step up from what I am used to,” Josh admits of this weekends Italian date. “It is something I am not that familiar with and it will be great to see what it is all about. “Callum is a good benchmark, he is from here but he has a few more years experience than me...it will be good to judge my pace off. If I can get close to his times, but we will have to build our pace throughout the rally and see how it goes.” McErlean was only able to complete one round of the series, thanks to the outbreak of the Covid- pandemic which halted motorsport across the UK and Ireland. “It gave me the opportunity to look at things in more detail and see what I would improve on, so maybe it was a good thing,” Josh pointed out. In Decemberraced in Italy, but in a dferent discipline at the Monza Rally Show. “There is some dference in racing around a track and going up a mountain road, but at least it gave me the experience of travelling the country,” McErlean pointed out. This time it is going to dferent. As well as Devine, World Rally Championship stars Ott Taumlnak and Thierry Neuville will be tough nuts to crack. “Im delighted to be able to get back to rallying again and this is such an amazing opportunity for me to be heading to Italy in the Hyundai i R” he added. Tuesday is a day of testing, before a day or recce on Friday to suss out the course for Saturdays shakedown. “Then we have the rally on Sunday, so it is a good format,” Josh feels. “A podium place would be a dream,” he adds, but is realistic. “There is a big entry list, there are three World Rally Drivers doing it so it is nearly a World Championship level event. “Monza aside, I have limited asphalt experience of the Hyundai, so I really need to be realistic about my expectations on a result. The focus is to get back into the groove again, six months out of the car is certainly not ideal but it will be pretty much the same for everyone. “I realise that gaining European experience is unbelievably valuable so we will have a clear goal on the pace we want to be at and try to stick at it throughout the day. It is a real honour to be competing out there and Im very thankful for the amazing support around us”. Andrew Johns, Hyundai Motorsport Customer Racing Operations Leader, is hopeful for McErlean. “The opportunity for Josh to run at the Rally di Alba gives him a chance to compete against some of the best drivers in Europe, while continuing to develop his career and gain crucial mileage on tarmac stages,” John stated. “He will able to call on support from our customer support engineers at the rally, and hopefully come away with a good result and some valuable experience.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Oakleaf Lions will be only the second such club in Ulster, following the Titanic Tigers formation last year. “We are a group of Special Olympic volunteers and parents who are establishing a new Special Olympics club in the Oakleaf county delivering the Young Athlete programme,” read a statement on the clubs Facebook page. “It is all dependent on Covid-, but we are hoping to get a taster day between September and Christmas,” said Brian McGuigan, who has been working with Liam Oacuteg Hinphey on the venture. googletag.cmd.push “Then in the new year, we aim to have an hour session every week. At the minute, we are getting the word out there and are looking for athletes.” The programme is a play and sport activity for children from four to eight years of age with an intellectual disability. It introduces children to a wide iety of play activities in a familiar, supportive and fun environment where everyone has the opportunity to succeed. It provides a flexible framework and versatile programme which can be successfully offered in a iety of settings from inidual family home, to classrooms to community club settings - all designed as an introduction to fundamental movement skills. googletag.cmd.push The benefits of physical activity and play go beyond sports. The programme helps children interact with each other and develop communication, learning and self-help skills. It also introduces children to the Special Olympics programme and their family members to a network of support as well as preparing children for future membership into Special Olympics clubs. One of the long-term benefit of the programme is the opportunity to involve children with intellectual disabilities before they reach the age of eight. This will foster future involvement and hopefully participation in lelong sport and physical activity.

The figure was outlined in a detailed consultants report commissioned to undertake an in-depth feasibility study to look at potential developments for the local harbour.While the key issue the consultants focused on was deepening the harbour to facilitate larger vessels, they also examined improving harbour conditions, berthing pontoons for smaller vessels and increased berthing facilities.The consultants also undertook a comprehensive review of possible harbour layouts, historic document research, topographic and bathymetric harbour surveys, quay wall inspection above and below the waterline and computer modelling.Ardglass has the only all-weather harbour between Howth and Bangor and has three primary areas, including the fish dock within the southpier.

He said the business has been in existence since , with the amount of birds at the site remaining the same.Mr Shields said the proposal is for a ldquomodern, environmentally friendly unit and explained that he finds himself in the ldquoridiculous situation where he is trying to reduce emissions from his site by  per cent.He said this is a figure which the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs agrees with, but planners are recommending that his proposal is refused, even though it is a government target to reduce emissions.ldquoWe are looking to create efficiencies on our farm so that we will be ableto market all our eggs locally, rather than rely on the wholesale market in England where the majority of our eggs are sent, he said in the letter to planners.ldquoThis new system would give signicant benefits locally in both environmental and economic terms. Ammonia levels would be reduced by up to  percent and we would be looking to employ extra people to help with the grading of eggs and deliver them locally.Mr Shields said that he can continue with the older system which will emit a lot more ammonia, which is something that the government is trying to reduce..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd July 2020 Brexit ad.jpg","title":"Shrigley children’s sports pitches due for repair scheme  ","story":"CHILDRENrsquoS sports pitches in Shrigley are to be upgraded.Confirmation that Newry, Mourne and Down Council has agreed to carry out the work has been welcomed by Rowallane councillor Patrick Brown.He has been lobbying for the upgrade in response to residentsrsquo concerns and is pleased that the football pitches used by young people who live in the village will be improved.Cllr Brown said that an existing boundary fence will be increased in height alongside the provision of additional netting to prevents stray footballs from ending up in neighbouring gardens.ldquoGoalposts will be painted and holes in the ground fixed as part of a general revamp to improve playing conditions, he said.ldquoFurthermore, no ball games will be allowed in the play park itself and new signage will be erected to reflect this.Cllr Brown said he was pleased that the local authority is open to improving the conditions of the pitch and also the additional measures to protect local houses.ldquoEspecially over summer, it is important for the younger members of our community to have adequate outdoor facilities where they can take part in sporting activities, he said.The Rowallane councillor added: ldquoI hope that the improved fence offers residents peace of mind as their properties and cars will no longer be subject to stray footballs.

Wersquore very lucky to have it and should make every effort to keep it going.Another resident described confirmation that the facility will not reopen this summer as ldquosuch a shame.She added: ldquoAs the only al open air sea pool left in Northern Ireland the Rock Pool ought to be celebrated and included in Discover Northern Irelandrsquos tourism landmark buildings and locations information. It should also be publicised in the Outdoor Swimmer Magazine.A council spokeswoman confirmed that the council took a decision to close all seasonal facilities in Newcastle, including both outdoor pools, due to Covid-.She said the decision was considered in the councilrsquos emergency business plan tabled at the local authorityrsquos Active and Healthy Communities Committee meeting on June  and ratied at the full council meeting last month.In relation to the reopening of the indoor swimming pool at the Down Leisure Centre, the spokeswoman said the local authority was currently considering recent announcements by the Northern Ireland Executive on the reopening of pools and health suites and in relation to spectators at outdoor facilities.She added: ldquoAt present, these facilities remain closed until further notice.ldquoThe council is taking a phased approach to the reopening of its leisure facilities to ensure the safety of both staff and customers.

I was either three or four. My brother Garrett is a year younger than me. We moved from Strangford to Downpatrick when I was four-and-a-half and it was before that.My father had taken the two of us to watch a football match. Other than my mother, perhaps his five favourite things in le were reading, the crossword, conversation, a cup of tea and watching a game.What he wasnrsquot always great at was keeping a close eye on children in his charge. Between watching his old club play and chatting to a couple of the other men on the sideline, he didnrsquot notice Garrett and I making a sprint on to the pitch, looking for a go with the ball.It could well be that memory through the efflux of time has us causing greater disruption that night than actually was the case. In some ways I hope that our presence wasnrsquot even noticed by the players. It would be awful were that to have been the biggest influence that I ever had on a football match, although there is every chance that my high point was that warm evening in Kilclief.Unfortunately my enthusiasm for sport was not matched by aptitude. On one visit to his cousins in Listowel I was being encouraged to eat up my black pudding with the Kerry exhortation that I wouldnrsquot play football for Down without a good diet of black pudding.If only it had been that easy. The biggest problem was an unreliability and inconsistency in a ballrsquos direction of flight after it had been propelled by my foot, hand or implement. Allied to being short-sighted before my teens and having a slight frame, the portents werenrsquot good.Football was the game in the Red High and there were plenty of good footballers about. Kevan Owens, Ciaran McCabe and Patrick Kielty were in my year. Brian Burns the year behind. John Kielty the year ahead with Conor Deegan, Barry Breen, Mark McCartan and John Kelly a few years ahead.The recently-deceased Bro Charles was teaching in the school until my fourth year and every day hersquod put out a tea chest of hurleys for a lunchtime puck-about, which I often took advantage of. Bro Charles also coached a Downpatrick team and under his patient tutelage, and presumably need for numbers, I reached my sporting apogee with an East Down U-frac medal.What I did get from my father was the love of watching sport and going to matches. He brought me to Croke Park for the first time when I was six. It was the  football final. I was mesmerised by the colour and the noise. I know that Dublin beat Armagh that day but I honestly donrsquot remember that.What I do remember is that, for my only time, our seats were in the Ard Comhairle box. And they were soft seats. And I remember Down winning the minor match and them being given a big silver cup and I remember Daddy holding me up in his arms so that I could see it and it being so close that I tried to reach out and touch it.But it wasnrsquot all glamour. I still have yet to feel as baltic as I did one winter Sunday standing on a grass bank in the Marshes at about the age of eight or nine with the cold spreading from the frozen turf through the soles of my shoes and up my legs and Daddy talking and talking and talking as I futilely tried to will him back to the car and the warmth of home.Happier times included a spring and summer of going to watch club hurling matches. He was a member, along with Paddy OrsquoDonoghue I think, of a commission on the future of hurling in Down for the County Board and there were many trips to games, particularly to the Ards.As much as he loved football, in truth hurling was his real passion. Due maybe to a Waterford father. As a young man he had hurled for Kilclief and the county. Nothing better than a good game of hurling, hersquod say. Particularly one played in fair conditions on a firm pitch. He never got to the Munster final as often as he would have liked, but that was considered one of the great highlights of any sporting year.What we did get to and what from a young age what I was lucky enough to have as a highlight were the September trips to Croke Park for the hurling and football finals. Particularly the football finals. I got to see the great Kerry-Dublin battles, Kerryrsquos four-in-a-row, Kerryrsquos three-in-a-row.With a Kerry grandmother I felt some affinity to that great team. The Spillanes, Jack OrsquoShea, Paacuteidiacute Oacute Seacute, Mikey Sheehy, Bomber Liston, Ogie Moran, Charlie Nelligan. Great men. As magnicent as the modern Croke Park is, part of me will always miss the old wooden benches of the Hogan Stand.But there were green shoots beginning to appear with Downrsquos Minor All-Ireland in  followed by a narrow loss to Meath, my county of residence these last  years and more, in the  National League final. Preludes of course to theof the good old days and Downrsquos second era of greatness.I have never been at a more momentous sporting occasion than the  final.  comes close obviously, but doesnrsquot match it for the sheer joy, relief and euphoria.That match in Celtic Park is another contender. I suspect that had I been in Istanbul in  it might also have come close. I was in Cardf when Leinster came back from the dead with  unanswered second half points to win their second Heineken Cup. That too was an extraordinary day. But rsquo was in a league of its own.Those men of Kerry were heroes. But heroes in the same way as Kenny Dalglish, Alan Hansen and John Barnes were heroes. Itrsquos a very dferent thing when the heroes are your own people. The excitement building for weeks before. My father calling in favours from all over the country to secure extra tickets. He could nearly have opened a ticket agency.My seat that day was near the back of the Upper Cusack, two seats along from Paddy Doherty. Afterwards we made our way across the pitch and out on to Jonesrsquos Road to meet up with everyone  for the chat. At some ungodly hour on the Monday night the bus finally arrived into Downpatrick and the great Pete McGrath said that we beat the team that couldnrsquot be beaten.The last time that I went to Croke Park with my father was his last visit, three-and-a-half months before he died. It was the hurling final between his fatherrsquos county of Waterford and Galway.He had been there in  and  when they had won their two All-Irelands. He had spent childhood holidays with cousins near Dungarvan, which is where he had learnt to speak Irish. In  he had a lt by horse and cart into Tramore for the train to Dublin to watch the match.His lungs werenrsquot great at that point and I think he had greater clarity than the rest of us about how long was left. He had said to me one evening in France the month before, ldquoYou know that this is going to do for me. I knew it was, but I thought there was still a good bit leftto go.It was  years since he had brought me that first time to Croke Park when we saw Down win an All-Ireland. It would have been nice symmetry had Waterford won on his last visit but it wasnrsquot to be. The day still finished with him standing chatting to friends on Jonesrsquos Road for as long as he was able. I was happy to have been with him on that last trip.At some point in the lsquos my father stopped driving. He was probably happier with the greater opportunity for the crossword or the newspaper. My mother drove him about, but often therersquod be a lt to a match, usually with Joe Leonard. I think he went to more matches with Joe in his last couple of decades than with everyone  combined.We had started going on holidays to France in the lsquos and by the mid lsquos, by which time he had retired as Ombudsman , he and my mother were spending most of the summer there. They loved itbut,there was one downside, he missed a lot of football and hurling.Initially he relied on match reports by telephone from any of us still in Ireland. The urgency of the reports eased as his access to the internet grew but he still appreciated a call at some point to be told how the match had actually gone.The real salvation though was when their great friends, the McQuaids from Dungannon, started to come on holidays to the next town. That in itself was a good thing, but the real boon was Jimrsquos technical wizardry and ability to use a satellite dish to get RTEacute. Thereafter Jim and Maurice spent many Saturday evenings and Sunday afternoons watching Jimrsquos television.I donrsquot know when I first knew of the great feats of the lsquos. I donrsquot ever remember not knowing. Whether it was the flag that my mother kept in the house with ldquoUp Down stitched across it that she had made for one of her brothers in  that my brothers and I loved to take out and wave in the garden.Or my fatherrsquos watch that had been given to him by Brian McCartan and Charlie Carr, which was engraved ldquoTo Maurice Hayes, Secretary of the Down All Ireland Football Team . From B. and C., which fascinated us as children. A watch he wore for the rest of his le and which I am wearing now as I write this.That watch made it clear that this had been something of very great import. I often think of James McCartanrsquos story of meeting his father on Jonesrsquos Road after the  final. His father was in floods of tears and said to him, ldquoYou kept your promise.The names were as familiar as our own. The McCartans and the OrsquoNeills. Paddy Doherty, Joe Lennon, Kevin Mussen, Jarlath Carey, Leo Murphy, Eddie McKay, Tony Hadden, George Lavery, Breen Morgan, Pat Rice, Patsy OrsquoHagan, PJ McElroy, John Smith and Kieran Denvir along with names like John Murphy, Peter Rooney, Larry Powell, Danny Kelly, Ray McConville, Jim Milligan and the great Colm McAlarney from later in the decade.As a boy, when people heard that I was a Hayes, Irsquod at times be askedI was Mauricersquos son and then told that Down wouldnrsquot have won an All-Ireland but for him. And when Irsquod ask him about it hersquod say that Down wouldnrsquot have won an All-Ireland without the players, that hersquod never kicked a ball.He spent the best part of six decades holding those men in the highest esteem, as footballers, as people, and as friends. His view was that every one of them had lived constructive lives in which they had contributed to their families, their communities and to society.And for all their achievements, they were modest men. Paddy Doherty recently selected his best Down team of all time for the Down Recorder. He didnrsquot pick himself. Paddy lsquoMorsquo is the only person in the entire country that wouldnrsquot have Paddy lsquoMorsquo on that team.Above all, he loved their company. He loved meeting up with them over the years at matches and ious s. Usually wearing his Club Down tie. Part of the pleasure of going to a match was the half-time cup of tea and the chat with friends afterwards, whether on Jonesrsquos Road, in Newry or whatever ground the match was in.There are two photographs from the GAA Congress in Newcastle ten years ago that show it well. One is a formal photograph with President McAleese and ious dignitaries. Hersquos sitting at the bottom left deep in conversation with Kevin Mussen.In the other, therersquos a group standing on a set of steps. Hersquos at the back having a chat with James McCartan. I think that Bobbie Hanvey was one of the only people that could get him to look into a camera.A third photograph from that Congress showed him standing in front of the huge poster of the  team calling them ldquoThe History Makers. That photograph was used on his memorial card. When it came to his funeral, he was buried in his Club Down tie. Nothing  would have been appropriate.His last visitor before he died was Dr Walsh, who held his hand and chatted to him. Their last words together were, ldquoWe had good times. They certainly did.This article was originally published on the Club Down website..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/11385995.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

At five miles long, it is a fraction of the proposed -mile NI-Scotland bridge but there are such bridges, including Hong Kong-Zhuhai-MacauBack in  the notion of a bridge was used as satire to lampoon then Prime Minister William Pitt the Younger over the failure of the Union Bill. Pitt, of course, had the last laugh with the passage into law the following year of the Act of Union.Almost a century passed before formal plans for such bridges came into being.  \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...Shane Greer, who describes himself as an entrepreneur, investor and political commentator, is originally from Northern Ireland, now living in Washington DC. © Jessica YurinkoAt least five dferent potential routes have been proposed, debated, rejected, or otherwise left to wither on the vine since then. But just as technological progress advances endlessly to make the once fantastical seem achievable, so too do the impediments to such a bridge recede in the face of that progress.Nevertheless, mockery of the very idea of a physical transport connection between Northern Ireland and Great Britain is indulged with every bit as much enthusiasm as those anti-Union publishers who set their sights on Pitt. And like those publishers, their modern-day contemporaries remind us that the act of mocking is much easier than the act of manesting that which they mock. In Pitt’s case, the Union, in our case a bridge. Yes, there are impediments. Some even verge on the comical, like reckoning with the million-plus tonnes of conventional and chemical weapons dumped in a submarine trench, Beaufort’s Dyke, last century. One can almost imagine the originator of the weapons dumping scheme having one final meeting in a windowless Whitehall conference room before giving the green light. “Anyone foresee any potential problems with dumping all these munitions in the Irish Sea  Jenkins ” “None sir. Seems like a spfing idea.”But let’s dispense with easy mockery and instead engage in thoughtful discussion. First, those with expertise in this area, like Wanda Lewis, Emeritus Professor of Civil Engineering at the University of Warwick, do not see even such issues as the presence of wartime munitions in Beaufort’s Dyke as a factor rendering a bridge impossible. She contends that it’s more a question of whether the cost of crossing the Dyke would render other bridge routes more cost-effective. In other words, yes there are signicant challenges, but we have the capability and the capacity to study them, work out the cost of overcoming them, and reach evidence-based decisions on viability.Second, we need only look around us to witness marvels of infrastructure that stand as a testament to our remarkable ability to overcome astonishing engineering challenges. Relatively close to home, there’s the Öresund Bridge connecting Sweden and Denmark. Proposals for a tunnel or bridge crossing the Öresund strait date back almost as far as those for a bridge between Great Britain and Ireland. Twenty years on from Öresund’s completion, we are reminded of our capacity to surmount the once insurmountable.Before anyone retorts that the Öresund Bridge spans a mere fraction of the distance the Irish Sea bridge would be required to cross, I would direct their attention to the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau bridge, which at around  miles is about the distance as the crow flies between Belfast and Cookstown. Distance, like depth and other environmental conditions, are just challenges to be met and overcome.Thirdly, let us remember how transformative it is to be able to get easily from one place to another. Just as it is easy to forget how the ready availability of light at the flick of a switch has transformed human le, so too do we forget how dferent our lives would be without the M, A, or the Ballywhatever Road you take to get the groceries, visit family or commute to work. Gray and black roads like these are the arteries through which our lives flow. Casting all  aside, just consider how remarkable it would be to get into your car and drive to Glasgow, Manchester or London.Fourthly, and perhaps most important of all, we need to dispense with that most tiresome of character traits, the desire to shoot others down and shoot their ideas down. Seats in the peanut gallery are cheap, but they add nothing but distraction to actual events being played out on the stage. It is a tiresome trait that holds Northern Ireland back in so many ways. The notion that that will never work, that engaging in a new venture is too risky, that things are the way they are for a reason, that you should not rock the boat, are not worthy of a people whose capacity to overcome adversity is legend. So let’s dispense with the lazy criticism and support a proper feasibility study. Let facts lead the decision-making process, not untested aspersions. None of this is to say that a bridge to Scotland is an infrastructure proposal of singular importance. As Ben Lowry pointed on these pages last week ‘The Boris bridge to Scotland plan is a nice dream but a distant one and a distraction from other priorities for unionism and infrastructure,’ see link below,a bridge is to be built it will be decades before the first vehicle travels across it. Instead, it must be viewed as one substantial piece of a much more ambitious project to improve connectivity within and without Northern Ireland. With that in mind, and as Robert Park argued here yesterday ‘A bridge to Scotland is not just a unionist umbilical project, but a strategic bridge to Europe and to the world,’ see link below, a bridge shouldn’t be thought of as a “‘unionist umbilical’ project,” but as part of a “massive, strategic investment that willsecurity to us on energy, connectivity, water and jobs.”As a people who have spent decades now building metaphorical bridges between erstwhile detached communities in Northern Ireland, we can do better than trying without empirical merit to prevent the construction of physical ones. • Shane Greer is an entrepreneur, investor and political commentator based in Washington DC• Ben Lowry: ‘The Boris bridge to Scotland plan is a nice dream but a distant one and a distraction from other priorities for unionism and infrastructure’• Robert Park: ‘A bridge to Scotland is not just a unionist umbilical project, but a strategic bridge to Europe and to the world’——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

They aren’t open yet, so that’s why we have decided to go with the outdoor theme.”Lauren admitted she was disappointed when her original plans fell through, but the pair are hoping to have another celebration next year. “it was disappointing knowing we weren’t going to have our guests there, that was the biggest disappointment.”Instead the couple will have their wedding ceremony in her grandad Gordon Bell’s garden and will say ‘I do’ in front of Pastor Gareth Bell, who is no relation. “We are actually live streaming our ceremony from the garden. A friend volunteered to do that, which is amazing, and that way we include guests and family members who are overseas that was really important to us,” said Lauren. Due to coronavirus the young couple have also had to change their honeymoon plans. “We were due to go to Thailand, but that had to be cancelled, so we are now going to Fermanagh for the weekend and then up to the North Coast.”Then she’ll be back to teaching and is looking forward to seeing her pupils. “During lockdown one of their online tasks was to design my wedding dress. Some of them have submitted wee pictures of me on cards, which is lovely.”And Lauren confessed there are compensations to having to postpone her original wedding date. “We are planning next July to go ahead with our reception so we can have everybody there and have a big party. So, I’ll have two weddings. What bride gets to wear her dress twice  - I will!.” A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Itrsquos a vast improvement now, but even cleaned up itrsquos still a mess.Jean Webber, who lives nearby on Llwyn Derwen, said she has witnessed a lot of fly-tippers dumping rubbish at the bridge, like fridges, freezers and buildersrsquo rubbish. She said: ldquoI think this end of Dinas has been forgotten. [The council] seems to concentrate on the other end.ldquoI walk past here every day. It wouldnrsquot be so badthey just walled it off. I never complain, but this is just appalling.The council has now promised work will begin to remove the bridge next month, and blamed coronavirus for the most recent delay. The new timetable is to finish the job by this October.A Vale of Glamorgan council spokesperson said: ldquoUnfortunately, the contractor originally appointed to remove the bridge withdrew from the project after agreement couldnrsquot be reached on a claim for additional costs due to the coronavirus pandemic.ldquoThat meant a new contractor had to be found, a process that added to the delay caused by the pandemic itself, which for a period prevented work of this type being carried out.ldquoThe council has now successfully appointed a new contractor and received an indication that work is expected to start in mid-August. It is anticipated the work will be completed by the end of October.But both Cllr Franks and Ms Webber raised doubts about the new timetable.

Box Two is to recycle foil paper and boxes, food and drinks cans, aerosols and cartons such as milk containers and plastics also. Box Three is for cardboard, glass bottles and jars.Bryson Recycling saysadopted it could mean a jobs boost for the area as well as making recycling easier. The firm already has a link with the council, collecting recycling from homes in the Armagh area.Eric Randall, Director at Bryson Recycling says: “We are delighted that the Council is considering the Wheelie Box option. Collected weekly, the latest Wheelie Box model will offer % more capacity than a standard green recycling bin.This is an image of what can be put in the Wheelie Boxes.“Wheelie Boxes are a very much enhanced version of the kerbside boxes which are already in use in the Armagh area. The boxes have a lockable hinged lid and are integrated onto a trolley with wheels, which makes them secure and very easy to use and move.“As well as providing more space for recycling, Wheelie Boxes will also mean good news for local jobs because % of what we collect using this approach is recycled in Northern Ireland. This compares to typically around % using green bins.”Wheelie Boxes are not new, , households in Northern Ireland already use them.Bryson Recycling also pointed out that two firms based in the borough, Huhtamaki and Cherry Pipes, used recyclable materials.A number of dferent systems are currently in operation across the Borough and the consultation aims to introduce a single, streamlined recycling system from next year.Eric adds: “The Wheelie Box option means local households can increase the amount they recycle every week instead of fortnightly, protect local jobs, boost the economy and play an important role in creating a local, sustainable environment for all.”To voice your opinion, check out the link on the ABC Council website here https:www.armaghbanbridgecraigavon.gov.uk green-bin-or-wheelie-box-choose-which-to-use "},{"url":null,"title":"autumn date set opening new south lake leisure centre ","story":"Manwho died suddenly on Sunday was father of a little girl‘He wore his great big heart openly on his sleeve’ mourners told at funeral of ‘legend’ Gary McConaghyNewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisCoronavirusSportFootballOther SportWhats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyleCarsHomes and GardensNewsPeopleAutumn date set for opening of new South Lake Leisure CentreA date has been set for the opening of the new south lake leisure centre in Craigavon with the multi-million-pound facility to open its doors on November .By The NewsroomTuesday, th July , : pmUpdated Tuesday, th July , : pm\"\"The largest capital project to date undertaken by ABC Council, and among the largest in Northern Ireland, the new multi-use sports and leisure complex is described by the council as a major new flagship health and wellbeing destination.Work on the facility was halted by the coronavirus outbreak.
