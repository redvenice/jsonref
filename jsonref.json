That\u0027s what we are all aiming at and working hard to achieve.\u0027  Emma Walmsley, CEO of GlaxoSmithKline, said: \u0027I want to reinforce how important it is that we have ideally more than one vaccine....we need multiple billion doses as fast as we can collectively.\u0027This is, in multiple ways, a collective rival against an unprecedented virus.\u0027 The big four companies have agreed to initially sell their \u0027not for profit\u0027 vaccines to countries for the price it costs to make the jab.But prices will soar when the World Health Organization (WHO) brings the global alert down from the level of pandemic.The news that multiple vaccines could be ready by the autumn raises hopes of millions of people worldwide longing for an end to the pandemic.     But a leading member of the Oxford University trial said the study has only a 50 per cent chance of being successfully completed.Lower transmission of the coronavirus in the community means it will be harder for trial participants to catch the virus, and for scientists to see if the vaccine is protective.   Oxford University\u0027s Jenner Institute and the Oxford Vaccine Group began development on a vaccine in January, using a virus taken from chimpanzees.Following an initial phase of testing on 160 healthy volunteers between 18 and 55, the study is now set to progress to phases two and three.It will involve increasing the testing to up to 10,260 people and expanding the age range of volunteers to include children and the elderly.Professor Adrian Hill, director of Oxford University\u0027s Jenner Institute, said he expected fewer than 50 of those to catch the virus. The results could be deemed useless if fewer than 20 test positive.\u0027We said earlier in the year that there was an 80 per cent chance of developing an effective vaccine by September,\u0027 he told The Sunday Telegraph.\u0027But at the moment, there\u0027s a 50 per cent chance that we get no result at all.\u0027We\u0027re in the bizarre position of wanting Covid to stay, at least for a little while. But cases are declining.\u0027If SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the disease COVID-19, is not spreading in the community, volunteers will find it difficult to catch, meaning scientists can\u0027t prove whether the vaccine actually makes any difference.AstraZeneca has announced a deal with the US to produce 400million doses of the vaccine - which is still not proven - and 100million for the UK. Britain has agreed to pay for up the doses \u0027as early as possible\u0027 - with ministers hoping for a third of those to be ready for September if proven effective. The vaccine is made from a weakened version of a common cold virus (adenovirus) from chimpanzees that has been genetically changed so it is impossible for it to grow in humans.The intellectual rights to its vaccine are owned by the University of Oxford and a spin-out company called Vaccitech. Clinical teams at the Oxford University\u0027s Jenner Institute and Oxford Vaccine Group began developing the vaccine in January.  It\u0027s a type of immunisation known as a recombinant viral vector vaccine. Researchers place genetic material from the coronavirus into another virus that’s been modified. They will then inject the virus into a human, hoping to produce an immune response against SARS-CoV-2. This virus, weakened by genetic engineering, is a type of virus called an adenovirus, the same as those which cause common colds, that has been taken from chimpanzees. If the vaccines can successfully mimic the spikes inside a person\u0027s bloodstream, and stimulate the immune system to create special antibodies to attack it, this could train the body to destroy the real coronavirus if they get infected with it in future.It was developed so rapidly by Sarah Gilbert, a professor of vaccinology, and her team because they already had a base vaccine for similar coronaviruses. The team have gone through stages of vaccine development that usually take five years in just four months.  However, Professor Gilbert said that none of the normal safety steps had been missed out.  "},{"url":null,"title":"Nearly 20 UK council areas NOT seen coronavirus peaks","story":"Share this article Other areas are Preston, Lancashire Richmondshire, North Yorkshire Rother, East Sussex Selby, North Yorkshire South Norfolk Tonbridge and Malling, Kent Wrexham, North Wales and Wyre, Lancashire.   It comes as the Prime Minister tonight gave the green light to the first limited socialising since lockdown, revealing that up to six people can now meet outdoors and in private gardens for barbecues - as long as they stay six feet away from each other.Mr Johnson revealed that the restrictions are being eased slightly from next week, as he formally reduced the country\u0027s Covid \u0027alert\u0027 status from four to three.Despite warnings from chief scientific adviser Patrick Vallance that 8,000 new infections are still happening every day and admitting making the rules more nuanced will create \u0027anomalies and inconsistencies\u0027, Mr Johnson unveiled a series of changes to take effect in England from Monday.Up to six people from different households will be allowed to mix, opening the prospect of reunions for family and friends - although they will still be told to obey social distancing rules.

Here, he tells Sophie Goddard how he’s keeping not only his pub afloat, but is helping out the people – and animals – around him, too ...For thousands of small business owners, the global pandemic has flung their futures – and those of their staff – into uncertainty. That’s certainly true for Graham Blaikie, and his pub the Mercat Grill in Whitecraig, Scotland. “I’d been watching the news about Covid-19 since December and luckily we’d prepared,” he explains. “Even before we closed, we had contactless hand sanitisers and I was always wiping down handles and menus. I’d also removed items from tables, so there weren’t as many touch points.” But when Boris Johnson’s March announcement saw pubs and restaurants close to the public, the business that had taken Blaikie nine years to build was suddenly forced to adapt for survival.The first step was ensuring customers could still enjoy the food they loved. “Prior to the shutdown, we’d been talking about what our strategy would be – I bought containers and had our takeaway menu prepped, so we were ahead of the game”, he says of being ready for business the next day. “We had a lot of fresh food in the pub, so on the Saturday we started the takeaway system.” But it wasn’t without its problems. “It’s not as easy as you think doing takeaway food, especially restaurant-style. When people order with us they’re having haggis cigars, patties, fish and chips, pepper beef with rice and my mum’s desserts ... that’s six different containers at least. We spent about £2,000 on takeaway boxes initially, that’s a lot of money. But it’s hopefully keeping us going.”With the government support package now in place – and extended until October – Blaikie has turned his attention to helping local people. Launching his Soup(er) Hero campaign in April, he is now making soup and sandwiches for those in need. With help from the community council, a community hub – where food is dropped off and distributed by local volunteers – was born. The feedback keeps him going. “There’s an older couple and the wife’s got cancer and every day they get their soup and sandwich,” he says. “They have the soup at 12 o’clock, then the man drives his wife to the hospital for her treatment and when they come back, they enjoy the sandwich. That’s what makes it worthwhile.”It’s not just people benefiting, either – residents of Edinburgh zoo are also tucking into the pub’s surplus wares. “I had a massive box of bananas left over and my mum said: ‘You should take this to the zoo.’ So I got hold of all my leftover fruit and knocked on the zoo door – and that’s been it ever since.” Now Blaikie’s weekly deliveries of fruit, vegetables and fish help to feed the animals at a time when visitors – the zoo’s main form of income – have come to a standstill. “You’d probably choose not to eat some of the bananas, for example, because they don’t look as good, but they’re perfectly fine for the animals. When we’re making sandwiches, not everybody likes the heels of the bread either, so I freeze them and take them along – nothing’s getting wasted. And if I see something for a good price at the wholesalers – apples, cabbages, broccoli - I’ll pick that up, too. We need to keep zoos going, they’re all under a lot of pressure.”While it’s difficult to ascertain when exactly businesses such as Blaikie’s will open again, for now, he is focusing on adapting the way they work to ensure business is possible. “We have an isolated table in the front vestibule area, so people can come in and collect food safely, using contactless on the card machines for takeaways. We have separate areas for drivers to sit in too, so we’re doing everything we can.” And plans are already afoot for when pubs are finally allowed to reopen. “I’m looking at adding an area to the outside, so people can sit there the whole year round and I’m hoping to put in a little microbrewerydistillery, so I could eventually make hand sanitiser further down the line.”Why focus on helping others when keeping his own business afloat requires such effort? “I believe in helping people. I know this virus is a horrible thing, but it’s bringing out a lot of good in people as well. Neighbours are looking after neighbours, people are helping others with shopping or taking dogs for a walk. For so long, I didn’t like the way the world was going ...”What does Blaikie hope will come out of this situation? He pauses, then says: “That people start to work together a bit more, being more thoughtful of what’s going on around them. And of course, that they come to the Mercat for a meal.”This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

Only a handful of premium, luxury and sports cars were manufactured, with some smaller factories able to put minor finishing touches on the vehicles.It was the second consecutive month of historically low production. In March 78,767 cars rolled off the production lines, down more than 47,000 on a year earlier.Jaguar Land Rover, Nissan and BMW were among the major manufacturers that shut plants in March after the UK lockdown was imposed, faced with the prospect of parts shortages and difficulties protecting workers.The first large plants reopened at the start of May, although others, including Nissan’s Sunderland factory, the largest in the UK, will not open until next week.As well as the difficulties of sourcing parts, carmakers have also had to plan for significantly lower demand.Car dealers are among the non-essential retail businesses that can reopen on Monday with new physical distancing rules in place, with the industry hopeful demand for new vehicles will return relatively quickly, as happened after China lifted its lockdown.Mike Hawes, SMMT chief executive,\u0026nbspsaid: “With the UK’s car plants mothballed in April, these figures aren’t surprising but they do highlight the tremendous challenge the industry faces, with revenues effectively slashed to zero last month.“Manufacturers are starting to emerge from prolonged shutdown into a very uncertain world and ramping up production will be a gradual process, so we need government to work with us to accelerate this fundamentally strong sector’s recovery, stimulate investment and safeguard jobs.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e8378ccc5dfee13fd9ae64d1707362af1db0621/0_88_5014_3009/master/5014.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=110df1a6853ef7b63e096146dd96229b","title":"bbc impartiality emily maitliss owen jones","story":"The row over Emily Maitlis could have been avoided if the corporation aspired to greater editorial independence Impartiality is a concept that is frequently lauded but rarely defined. It has long been hailed as a sacred guiding principle behind news reporting for the BBC. Impartiality is extolled not simply as a gold standard, but a religion. “The BBC is committed to achieving due impartiality in all its output,” declare the corporation’s editorial guidelines.The problem with impartiality as a standard for journalism is not simply that it eludes precise definition: hoisting it as your only standard sets a trap that is easily exploited by bad-faith critics who regard the reporting of unwelcome facts as self-evident proof of bias. What would constitute an “impartial” account of the government’s response to this pandemic? Does it mean that every report of Britain’s “world-beating” death toll must be accompanied by a reminder that ministers insist it is too soon to judge their record? Would it have been “partisan” to double-check Matt Hancock’s maths when he falsely claimed the government had achieved its testing target at the end of April?\u0026nbsp Unwelcome challenges to the BBC’s “impartiality” are inevitable. The test of the corporation’s leaders is how ably they deflect and manage it.\u0026nbspA month ago, Kamal Ahmed, the editorial director of BBC News, sent an email to senior BBC editors responsible for the corporation’s political coverage. Referring to a study by the Reuters Institute into media coverage of the pandemic, Ahmed noted “strong support for the BBC”, though warned of political polarisation among the audience. “May have an impact on our impartiality and trust scores if we appear either too soft on the government or too condemnatory,” wrote Ahmed. “That delicate middle ground is where we need to be.”\u0026nbspBut this is nobody’s definition of “impartiality”: the term may in fact be meaningless, but it definitely does not mean “halfway between the government and its critics”.\u0026nbspIndeed, if you were a government minister, you would be profoundly reassured by Ahmed’s directions. After all, Britain has the highest death toll in Europe. According to new analysis by the\u0026nbspFinancial Times, Britain has the second-highest excess death rate on Earth, after Spain.\u0026nbspIt would be journalistic malpractice to relay these facts without the context that helps explain how we have fared so badly: both the government’s\u0026nbspvery\u0026nbsplate imposition of lockdown and its failure to place a \u0026nbspcordon sanitaire\u0026nbsparound care homes. Which brings us to the furore over Newsnight\u0026nbsppresenter Emily Maitlis. In her now famous opening salvo in Tuesday night’s broadcast, she declared: “Dominic Cummings broke the rules – the country can see that and it’s shocked the government cannot. The longer ministers and the prime minister tell us he worked within them, the more the angry response to this scandal is likely to be … He made those who struggled to keep to the rules feel like fools, and has allowed many more to assume they can now flout them.”\u0026nbspThis may not be “impartial” – but it does faithfully reflect a wide public consensus:\u0026nbspmore than two thirds agree Cummings broke the rules, including most Conservative and leave supporters. Public anger is reflected in collapsing ratings for the Conservatives and Boris Johnson. Yet Downing Street complained directly to BBC top brass –\u0026nbspwhich rushed out a statement chastising Maitlis for failing “our standards of due impartiality”. It is highly unusual for\u0026nbspsuch an adjudication to be so swiftly delivered.\u0026nbspSome of the Newsnight team are incandescent. “When faced with a very clear choice between yielding to government pressure or serving viewers by telling them the truth, BBC management, shamefully, chose the former,” says one\u0026nbspNewsnight\u0026nbspsource. “BBC bosses believe this helps preserve the organisation. All it will really do is sign its death warrant.”\u0026nbspImpartiality is an absurd standard for journalism, which aspires to describe the world in a way that corresponds to reality – not in a way that finds a happy middle ground between competing perceptions of a given matter. If\u0026nbspthe heavens open and I declare it is raining, and you claim it is not, an argument between us is unlikely to illuminate the situation for viewers wanting to know the weather.It is difficult not to look at the Maitlis saga and refer back to the Ahmed email: while facts may have underpinned her introduction, they were sufficiently damning to look “too condemnatory”. In response to my question, a BBC spokesperson said the email had\u0026nbsp“no bearing” on yesterday’s statement on Newsnight, and that their news editorial guidelines “make clear our commitment to impartiality, establishing the truth, and providing fair and accurate coverage”, and they “reviewed\u0026nbspNewsnight\u0026nbspagainst these principles, and not as a result of any political pressure”.But the BBC’s position seems to suggest that it doesn’t matter if No 10 insistence that Cummings did not break the rules is at odds with the views of the rest of the country, a significant chunk of the parliamentary Conservative party, Durham police or any commonsense reading of the rules. Does anyone truly believe that if someone else had been the subject of an unflattering\u0026nbspNewsnight\u0026nbspintroduction, and they had phoned the BBC’s editors to complain, such a ruling would have been issued within hours?\u0026nbspIf impartiality is your stated aim, it is those with the greatest power and influence who are able to claim there have been breaches and to demand they are rectified. The government controls the BBC’s funding taps and renews its annual charter. As a result, the BBC will always be bogged down in futile debates about impartiality – when the real standard of journalism should be independence."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f3fa9b74dc62e4c72ea4bc30890b99c2546d806b/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0ce059d7e9445243105e2874afcfe4c1","title":"dominic cummings democracy laws truth consequences","story":"Why should we keep faith with democracy when our leaders bend laws and distort truth?There is a moment in all British political scandals when a prickly sensation creeps up the spine: “He’s going to get away with it, isn’t he?” It isn’t provoked by Dominic Cummings alone. I felt the same watching Michael Gove’s exchange with Nick Ferrari on LBC: Gove first starting to claim that he too took the occasional miles-long drive to test his vision before rowing back, perhaps dazzled by the scale of the lie. Smirks were exchanged. The same when Matt Hancock stared down the camera on 30 April and celebrated “achieving” his testing target the reflux came two days ago, when revised testing figures revealed the target had, in fact, never been hit.It is not a sensation produced merely by lies, or the stench of hypocrisy in high places. It is the smirk, the assured belief that consequences are for little people, and that, in any case, anyone who really matters is in on the act. These people are open about it: to accept it is a mark of urbanity, to be disgusted by it is gauche.We have become used to being badly governed, and inured to lying. The prime minister’s laziness and mendacity are proverbial, but it is the mediocrity at the pinnacle of power that is more startling: the self-impressed dilettante and crank who whispers in his ear, or the toy-town thug - complete with pet tarantula - now in charge of the nation’s schools, or the conspiracy theorist “at war with cultural Marxism” now its most senior law officer, merrily dismissing the universality of law. The problem extends beyond politicians’ inidual deficiencies, severe though they are, and one might point to multiple sources of institutional rot to explain it, from the sycophancy of party bureaucracy to the evaporation of the civic bodies on which the great parties once drew. But there is also another, simpler explanation: politicians are increasingly insulated from the consequences of lying.The UK institutionalises its corruption, with peerages regularly doled out to party patrons. Even British politicians realise that allowing donors to purchase a permanent seat in the legislature looks bad so, formally at least, it is illegal.\u0026nbspDespite this, donors still acquire peerages\u0026nbspwith appalling regularity as this is a useful source of patronage, all the major parties simply look the other way.\u0026nbspBut this is emblematic of a wider institutional rot. Now Tory fundraisers, eyeing a Covid-19 collapse in cash, brief journalists that the party’s billionaire donors are cooling on Johnson for his failure to deliver them the peerages they expected. Such open entitlement ought to be a scandal itself, signalling a willingness to further dilute the UK’s already weak institutional safeguards instead it is greeted with jejune sophistication by commentators, proud to know that this is simply how the game works.Why are we so badly governed, to the point that we scarcely notice it? Stories of national decline are a cottage industry in Britain, and laments for a decaying polity are common in times of upheaval.\u0026nbsp“Where is now the soul of god-like Cato that durst be good” asked one stage character in the fag-end days of Elizabethan England, “when Caesar durst be evil?” That play itself – Ben Jonson’s\u0026nbsp1603 Sejanus\u0026nbsp– drew on Tacitus’s ancient laments about the corruption of imperial Rome, and landed its author a trial for treason. It is instructive not only because it reminds us that this anxiety is historically common, but because the villain’s fall sees him replaced only with another\u0026nbspvillain, equally violent and cruel.Like many conservative “declinists” since,\u0026nbspJonson’s Romans laid the blame for the weakening and corruption of the state on the decay of virtue among the citizenry.\u0026nbspModern culprits for decline might range as widely as the doctrine of equality or political correctness, or moral laxity, or the degradation of our capacity to think as independent citizens. Liberal variations impute more fault to institutions, concentrating on the corrupting influence of cash, our archaic forms of government, or erosion of sacrosanct political norms.Such permeating cynicism arises above all from depoliticisation: the claim, advanced over the past few decades, that ideological difference is dead, markets ought to be insulated from political contestation, and politics is merely a set of technical quibbles between administrators. Depoliticisation has produced a more professionalised politics with narrower routes of entry, and constrained what is agreed to be politically possible: thus the sad post-Thatcherite trawl of crumbling PFI schools, underfunded hospitals and outsourced public services. If the possibility of significant political change is denied, popular revulsion becomes increasingly anti-political, rejecting the legitimacy of democratic deliberation.That is why the Cummings scandal matters. His recurrent motif is that liberal democracy is a con: that deliberation and debate are simply excuses by elites to stifle the popular will all you should expect from politics is the occasional authorising vote for a champion you hope will wreck the joint in the way you prefer. The law, in turn, is for little people who can’t find a way round it, and protests about its universality are another elite sham.It might be that Cummings has overestimated public indifference, and the wave of popular anger washes him from office. But perhaps perversely, prime ministerial backing strengthens, rather than weakens, the cynicism on which he feeds. Had it not involved him, Cummings would have used this episode as a teaching moment.Democracies are more resilient than some expect. But they are still fragile achievements. If the link between actions and consequences in politics is severed, why should the young or disenfranchised keep faith with democracy at all? The pandemic has reminded us that we are not isolated iniduals, and our choices impact profoundly on others.Perhaps it also implies other unfashionable truths: politics matters. Laws should not have get-out clauses for the rich. State power is immense, rather than weak, and no one is entitled to it by rank or wealth. There are deceptions that should see you drummed out of public life altogether.\u0026nbspIf the tawdry spectacle of ministers bending the law and distorting the truth to defend an unelected aide teaches us anything, it’s this: consequences matter.•\u0026nbspJames Butler is co-founder of Novara Media and a regular contributor to the London Review of Books"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fcc5f5f52e40c0ccc8481fb286c557d386603b17/0_359_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=9c0617294d87890ec5a0093c781b40c9","title":"the guardian view on easing the lockdown putting politics before people","story":"Boris Johnson wants to lift the Covid-19 restrictions because of ideology and self-interest. The people deserve a more careful, evidence-based approach The United Kingdom went into the Covid-19 crisis as one nation. It seems likely to exit from the pandemic as several. At the outset, the UK’s different governments took similar approaches. Lockdown rules were observed by citizens in all parts of the country, with some infamous inidual exceptions like Dominic Cummings. As the onslaught starts to slacken, however, differential approaches are likely to become more important. These differences have now been embodied in the radically contrasted announcements made in London and in Edinburgh this week about the next stage.In England, the government has always been keener to lift the lockdown early. The case for this has never been easy to accept. The virus has not been a lighter scourge in England. The driving force has been a volatile mix of ideology and window dressing. Boris Johnson and his ministers have announced arbitrary goals – often under short-term pressure – and have then battled, generally unsuccessfully and at human cost, to meet them. The approach has never been comprehensive, well explained or effective. Among the most shocking examples have been shortages of personal protective equipment, testing failures for nursing homes and the refusal to test at ports and airports.This week’s virus tracing measures in England are the latest example of this shambolic approach. Mr Johnson said on 20 May that a “world beating” system to test and trace for coronavirus would be in place by 1 June. Easing the lockdown is umbilically linked to the need for such a system. Without it the dangers of a second wave of cases are very real. Yet it is now clear that the tracing system in England will be much more muddled, modest and incomplete than Mr Johnson claimed. A much trumpeted app does not yet exist. It will not be ready before late June. A slower, less efficient and more labour-intensive tracing system is now starting to come into operation, but there are numerous teething problems.Nevertheless the UK government is pushing ahead. Mr Johnson set the ball rolling in his botched broadcast on 10 May now, right on cue, he has managed to get scientific cover for the move from Sage, though other scientists have different views. He has also brought forward other measures from July to mid-June and been followed by the ever greedy Premier League. This is chaos waiting to happen. Mr Johnson’s eagerness is driven not just by his generally slapdash approach but also by his desperation to drown out the Cummings scandal. It seems all too likely that he will fail on both fronts, combining a mismanaged easing, which risks causing a spike in Covid-19 cases, with a stupid and damaging attempt to keep Mr Cummings in post.Meanwhile in Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon’s government has proceeded in an altogether more cautious, logical and planned manner. Mark Drakeford in Wales and Arlene Foster in Northern Ireland have done the same, but Scotland’s first minister has now committed to some easing from the end of this week. Many of these measures have been permitted in England for nearly three weeks, but Ms Sturgeon’s message remains a more careful one and she has done nothing to encourage reckless headlines of the kind that Mr Johnson ignited so stupidly earlier in May. Travelling more than six miles in Scotland to take exercise will remain discouraged, for example. In England, one can travel 260 miles or more.Scotland’s approach is far closer to public opinion in all parts of the UK, England included. One of the great lessons of the pandemic has been that governments that trust their publics, level with them, and prepare and explain their next moves properly, are the ones that enjoy public confidence for their handling. Ms Sturgeon, Mr Drakeford and Ms Foster continue to do that. Mr Johnson, as this week has underscored, sometimes seems to barely care. The people of England deserve so much better."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d3883493c16b5467422dc22ddbea18182f188ecb/0_169_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=96e32a726cacecc90d48bcfdc563d81d","title":"reopening english schools on monday could lead to new surge","story":"Independent scientists sound alarm over government plans to restart classes from 1 JuneOpening schools to more children from Monday could lead to a new surge of infections of Covid-19 in the community, a group of independent scientists has warned.The\u0026nbspreport, by the\u0026nbspIndependent Sage\u0026nbspgroup, suggested that plans for whole classes to return to school in England on 1 June could increase the R-value of infections by 0.3 – potentially enough to put the country back on an ever increasing trajectory of infections.The committee accused the government of not listening to its own scientific advice.“This is just too early,” said Sir David King, a former government chief scientific adviser and the chairman of Independent Sage. “We know that … opening up schools has the potential to raise R by up to 0.3. So we are really concerned that the level of infectivity across the country as a whole is too high to open schools.”King established the Independent Sage group to look at how the UK could work its way out of coronavirus lockdown after the government’s official panel of scientific advisers, Sage (the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies) faced criticism over a perceived lack of transparency.Delaying school openings by two weeks could halve the risk of infection, the report estimates, while waiting until September would reduce the risk further. The governments in Scotland and Northern Ireland have already announced that schools will not reopen to more pupils until after the August holidays, while Wales has said its schools will not do so on 1 June.A delay would give more time for infections in communities to fall – but also for the track and trace system, launched on Thursday, to be more extensively tested before being relied on to keep new infections in check.Prof Karl Friston, a computational modeller at University College London and a member of the Independent Sage committee said that opening schools without more robust surveillance could mean that new outbreaks would initially go unnoticed. “You will only know in your region several weeks or months after you have made a mistake, hence the importance of real-time data,” he said.The government’s most recent estimates puts the R-value at between 0.7 and 0.9. Once R exceeds 1, the number of infections increases exponentially, while an R below 1 will lead to a decline.The government’s official Sage committee has modelled the impact of seven ways schools could reopen, which all result in\u0026nbspthe R value\u0026nbspincreasing, with some scenarios increasing it only marginally. However, estimates at the upper end suggest it could increase by between 0.35 and 0.5. The Independent Sage report states that in the case where there are ongoing new infections within the community, evidence suggests that reopening schools could increase R “by up to 0.3”.“The school reopening scenario chosen by the government is not one of those modelled by Sage, making the potential impact of reopening even more uncertain,” the Independent Sage report said. “Robust testing systems are not in place everywhere.”Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said the independent report cast further doubt over the government’s efforts to press ahead with the wider reopening of primary schools in England.“The government’s primary duty should be to protect its people, but in England – unlike the rest of the UK – we are hurtling towards the further opening of schools before the scientific evidence says it is safe to do so,” Bousted said.The report also urges authorities to consider outdoor teaching – in marquees and playgrounds – and to also run summer camps, with community playing fields and sports clubs requisitioned for teaching purposes, to help pupils catch up on their education during the summer holidays.It also raises the prospect that asymptomatic children could become “institutional amplifiers”, spreading the virus unnoticed into the community and that there is heightened risk of the effects of the disease for families with children living in intergenerational households, or who come from a BAME or disadvantaged background."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5dbcac3b6c6a50ac88d5c22f4a798279615911b9/453_589_3497_2099/master/3497.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bfc017bfe7ffe4c96742260ff4062ff8","title":"share your photos of butterflies in the uk","story":"We want to see your photos of butterflies you have spotted around the country during the sunny weather Due to a combination of warmth and sunshine across the UK, butterflies have been spotted enjoying the good weather.If you have seen any near you, we’d like to see your photos.You can get in touch by filling in the form below.

It sets a high standard for other nations, using the rebuilding of coronavirus-ravaged economies to tackle the even greater threat of the climate emergency, in principle at least.With the world fast approaching the point when climate chaos becomes inevitable, how the trillions of recovery dollars – or euros – are spent is a use-it-or-lose-it moment, so what the EU does really matters. Climate change is a global crisis, meaning all nations must act and some must lead the way.Under Donald Trump, the US is slashing green protections while the biggest polluter, China, is sending mixed messages by backing coal power stations as part of its recovery. The UK, host of the next critical UN summit, has been all but silent.At least a million green jobs will be created, with workers in polluting industries helped into new roles, a critical part of the plan. Increasing the Just Transition Fund more than fivefold to €40bn minimises the risk of protests against green measures, especially in states with the heaviest coal use such as Poland, Germany and Romania, which will be among the biggest recipients. This is politically necessary, despite investment in the green economy already being a no-brainer.The EU plan may even have a direct impact on the rest of the world, with a border tax on carbon-intensive industrial imports from other nations potentially raising up to €14bn.\u0026nbspBut despite the European commission saying “public investments in the recovery should respect the green oath to ‘do no harm’”, critics worry there are no hard guarantees against the money seeping into dirty projects. The Covid-19 crisis has seen polluters lobbying hard for bailouts.The Just Transition Fund will be routed through the European Investment Bank, but campaigners say its climate criteria allow the backing of gas projects that would lock in emissions for years. Another key fund, the €150bn React EU programme, allows member states to decide how to spend the money – most of the almost €2tn in coronavirus rescue funds spent by EU nations so far has had no green guarantees.The commission rejects these criticisms, saying the “objective of the green economy is present throughout the whole management of the funds”. Whether this oversight proves effective will be the critical test.Nonetheless, green-leaning business and investor groups have welcomed the recovery package, calling it bold and substantive. To turn it into reality, there will now be weeks of wrangling between EU countries to finalise the deal.\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2732b0615cfe2a5d7a10189125134fc47a94509f/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6281237371ef34c8dc632e68b7e21bf3","title":"hair today the rise and stay of the lockdown fringe","story":"If ‘haircut’ has been the most Googled beauty treatment in lockdown, it is the fringe that has had the most attention. From Normal People to Angela Rayner, DIY bangs are the new normalAs our contact with the outside world shrinks to the size of a screen, once-private things have been pushed to the fore.Our bookshelves, formerly unseen by our co-workers, have become pregnant with meaning. Our tired faces, once optimised for the workplace with concealer and a fancy neckline, are beginning to crack after one too many Zoom meetings. For those of us working from home, headshots are the new hemlines.Then there is our hair: our rubbish, 10-week too-long hair that we can’t really improve without breaking the law – or at least a headband (although according to the Freelance Association of Hairdressers, clients are trying, “offering thousands of pounds” for an illicit trim). There has recently been further uproar over Dominic Raab’s plans to not open salons until July.Like so many successful things in 2020, the lockdown fringe began on social media and, also like so many things, was consolidated in Britain by the TV adaptation of Normal People. Connell’s silver chain might have spawned its own social media account and be “comparable to what James Dean did for the simple white T-shirt” (according to its costume designer), but so, too, has Marianne’s evolving fringe, which came with its own story arc – choppy when young, flourishing during her sexual prime, and so on – and now its own Instagram account, @Mariannesbangs, with 5,000 followers and counting. Earlier this month, Vanity Fair even published an essay in homage, called Fringe Watch. Sandra Kelly, the show’s hair designer, describes the online reaction to Marianne’s bangs as “Fringemania”.Still, a sharp, face-framing fringe on Zoom has become yet another impossible beauty standard to add to the list, and one that reflects self-improvement over pandemic restriction. While Bella Hadid cut hers in lockdown to match Audrey Hepburn in Roman Holiday with surprising deftness, and Anna Wintour seems to have a live-in hairdresser, it appears deputy Labour leader Angela Rayner has chosen not to touch hers in her last television appearance on The Andrew Marr show, she had swept it artfully to one side.If hair has become a talking point of lockdown – and further proof that personal grooming is key to our welfare regardless of what is happening in the outside world (the re-opening of beauty salons in Italy this month allegedly outranked restaurants and shops in demand) – then DIY fringe cuts are a distillation of this new normal. Lengths vary, but the sentiment remains – a good fringe is proof that the wheels of professionalism are working nicely, even if they are coming off.We’re now 10 weeks into lockdown and well past the sweet spot of a recommended trim – “which is absolutely six to eight weeks”, according to Northwood, the man who coined and cultivated The Alexa (Chung) and The Claudia (Winkelman). As for the fringe, “it generally has a four-week shelf life. So if you went into lockdown with one, chances are you will have given yourself one trim already”. Northwood has been guiding clients such as Winkelman into cutting hers at home, using clips, point cutting and texturising scissors, videos of which have been uploaded on to social media. He says most of his work right now is on YouTube.“Cutting your hair now is mostly born out of necessity, and yes definitely a way to feel like you are in control, that you are not losing yourself,” says Rachael Gibson, a hair historian. To many people, the thought of going to a hair salon represents a return to normality after a long, destabilising period – in lieu of this, cutting our hair is as close as we can get.In these screen-focused times, and with mask-wearing soon possibly to be mandatory, could we be on the cusp of a Fringe Index?The pandemic has plunged us into deep uncertainty. The twist, says Northwood, is that people are also after fringes when salons re-open in July. “It seems that cutting your hair is one thing, but focusing on the fringe is more like a mood change, something that marks a new beginning.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/206d83106360cfb8f1b5b3dfc36c017017556401/18_165_4127_2476/master/4127.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=29e69038c483106da776839ffaabe282","title":"ruben neves good sensations football premier league back wolves","story":"Wolves midfielder excited to be training properly alongside his teammates with the Premier League return finally in sightNews of the Premier League’s return is music to the ears of Rúben Neves, even if it means the guitar lessons he started during lockdown may have to fade into the background. The midfielder had just completed Wolves’ first contact training session in more than two months on Thursday when news broke that his team could return to match action on the weekend starting 19 June.Neves can already envisage repeating his pre-match routine. “Coldplay are my favourite band and that’s the kind of music I always listen to before a game,” the 23-year-old said. “Normally the last song I listen to before I take off my headphones is Fix You. I like the words and it helps me to get concentrated for the match.”That seems a rather plaintive tune to use as stimulus for a Premier League showdown, but the lyrics are about resisting despair, carrying on despite heartache. So maybe it will sound particularly fitting when the season resumes in a country still tormented by Covid-19. Safety permitting, Neves believes the return of football will help to provide a dose of light relief. “It’s always good to have back the sensations of football, the emotions, the goals, everything. It’s really important for football to come back.”On Thursday Neves and his teammates took a major step towards that return. “We are really excited – even more so after that training session because we could finally play proper football. So far we had only trained inidually or in small groups without contact.”The manager, Nuno Espírito Santo, had to be vigilant to ensure a combination of rustiness and enthusiasm did not lead to clumsy tackles. “The gaffer made sure everything would go right in the first training session,” Neves said.Wolves have a lot to play for when the season resumes. They were sixth in the table when play was suspended and were also looking good in the Europa League, having scored an away goal while drawing the first leg of their last-16 tie at Olympiakos. Owing to coronavirus that match was played behind closed doors, offering Wolves an experience of what the atmosphere will be like when the Premier League returns in empty stadiums.“It is really strange, you don’t have the adrenaline of the fans,” Neves said. “We are used to playing in loud places, but unfortunately the situation is bad and we don’t know when things will get back to normal so we just have to get used to it.Other thoughts Neves says he and his fellow players are good at banishing are the ones about a thrilling Wolves team being picked apart whenever transfer activity is reignited. The one downside of their success as far as their fans are concerned is that many of their players have attracted the attention of more established powers. Neves is said to be coveted by Manchester City and many others.“There has always been speculation since I’ve got here about our team,” says the player whose arrival at Molineux in 2017 was a big factor in the club’s triumphant drive for promotion from the Championship. “But we don’t think about it. We want to be together for as much time as we can but it’s football, the speculation will always be there. Our job is to play and leave this for the people who need to take care of it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9a79babf6e87c9c7a7cfaf5825cf6791ef86de2d/0_30_2384_1431/master/2384.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=755d66ec014642bf481ee72ab4fdf2de","title":"grandparents coronavirus miss out seeing grandchild","story":"Coronavirus is keeping grandparents away from their newborn grandchildren for months, or more if a vaccine is not found“I hate it!” says Jim Clinton jocularly of the lockdown. “I hate not being able to see the grandchildren … not being able to see a newborn baby is one of those things as a grandparent you don’t really contemplate happening. You can’t imagine you won’t be there to experience those early days up close and personal.”Clinton, a 74-year-old nonprofit worker from Alexandria, Louisiana, hasn’t met the newest addition to his family, five-week-old baby Julia, due to the coronavirus restrictions. His son Ryan and daughter-in-law Sarah had baby Julia on 23 April. Julia is their third child, and under normal circumstances Clinton and his wife Susan would have visited as soon as possible after the birth.But that wasn’t going to be possible: the family lives in Austin, Texas, and it wouldn’t be responsible to visit, even if only to see the baby from a distance. “The process of getting to Julia, being exposed to the gas stations and convenience stores … it just wasn’t possible,” says Clinton. “We agonize over it, we grieve over it, but at the end of the day, we know it’s the right thing to do.”Clinton is one of the many grandparents across the world missing out on those precious early months of their grandchildren’s lives. This is a challenging time for them: they are grateful that their grandchildren have arrived safe and healthy in the face of a frightening virus – doctors are not yet sure of Covid-19’s effect in pregnancy – and yet that relief is tempered with sadness at the knowledge that they may not see these babies for months, or possibly more if a vaccine is not found.“We have to keep it in perspective,” says Liz Griffiths, 63, a retiree from Surrey, UK. Her first grandchild, Max, was born on 29 March to Griffiths’ daughter, Bekki. “He’s safe, we’re safe, Bekki is safe, and this hopefully won’t last forever.” But of course, missing the birth of your first grandchild is a challenging experience. Griffiths and her husband had cleared their schedule so that they could visit after Max’s birth and help with childcare. After Boris Johnson announced a nationwide lockdown on 23 March, they realised that would be impossible.There is the emotional side of the coronavirus lockdown: the anguished realisation that you won’t be there for your grandchildren’s first weeks in the world. But there are also practical considerations. In those early months, grandparents often look after older children, help keep the house tidy and prepare meals, and watch the baby whie the parents sleep. Without that support, new parents can feel overwhelmed.“It’s been so stressful,” sighs 31-year-old stay-at-home mom Katelyn Cousins from St Petersburg, Florida. Katelyn gave birth to her second child with her husband Will three weeks ago. In addition to baby Meadow, Katelyn has an 18-month old daughter, Margot. When we speak, Katelyn sounds tired – I can hear the baby crying in the background. “I’m about an eight out of 10 for exhaustion right now,” she admits.The difference between Meadow and Margot’s births feels stark. When Margot was born, Will’s parents stayed with them for two weeks, before Katelyn’s mom took over. During those weeks, the grandparents helped with childcare and gave them parenting tips. “They showed us different methods for calming the baby when it’s crying, how to ease gas, that kind of thing,” she says. “I definitely look up to my mom and her parenting style, so it was nice to have that comfort there, and my husband doesn’t always know the right thing to do when both of them are crying.”Now, with Will working from home due to the coronavirus restrictions, the burden of almost all the childcare falls on Katelyn. “My husband is a hard sleeper, so night duty is basically me,” she says. “He’s super-helpful when he can be, but with him having to work, it’s hard. I definitely feel like I’m in zombie mode all the time.”When you’re sacrificing the ability to see your grandchildren to obey the rules, watching others flout lockdown rules can be hugely chagrinning. “I get very annoyed,” says Paul Hawkins, 64, a retiree from Warwickshire. “I haven’t seen my grandchild yet, and you see other people living nearby whose grandchildren are coming around every day.” Hawkins’ son Neil and his wife, Ellen, gave birth to their second child, son Chester, on 17 April. Even when the lockdown restrictions are eased, Hawkins probably won’t meet Chester for a while – his mother-in-law Peggy lives with him, and as she’s 97, she’s extremely vulnerable to coronavirus.Griffiths is the only grandparent to have caught a glimpse of the baby: tragically, her mother-in-law Dorothy died the week after baby Max was born. At the small, socially distanced funeral, Griffiths saw baby Max from a distance, in the car park. “We stayed a safe distance away,” she says. “It’s bizarre, meeting your grandson at a funeral. It was very difficult.” One small blessing – Griffiths was able to show Dorothy pictures of Max before she died. “She was in frail health by then, but she smiled,” Griffiths remembers. “We think she did understand who he was.”All the grandparents I speak with have been keeping in touch through FaceTime and Zoom. It’s nice, but no substitute for being able to hold the newborns or sing them to sleep. Griffiths has attended online baby classes on Zoom, for parents and grandparents.“We’ve seen him a lot on screen,” Hawkins says of baby Chester, “but it’s not the same as holding him or being there, I suppose.” Watching a baby’s first weeks on Earth digitally can be jarring: you notice their growth more acutely than you would in real life. “In such a short time,” Hawkins says, “you really see how he’s grown and changed. It’s sad to know you’ve missed that first month.”Clinton relishes the photos and videos Ryan and Sarah send him of baby Julia. “We are taking advantage of the technology, which makes things so much better than they would have been if we were living through the 1918 flu pandemic, and relying on letters for news,” he says. Ryan sent pictures of baby Julia from the delivery room, shortly after she was born. “I was in my office and got the text and ran to the other part of the house to show Susan,” Clinton remembers. “We hugged.”Watching Julia grow up online is a bittersweet joy. “Each new set of pictures is great on one level, but on another level it underscores the distance and makes you want to get on a highway, throw the rules out, behave how you’d never behave, and just go.” He sighs.“But then your better angels prevail, and you do the right thing.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d2d23fef4bf608f7033363987efe75da2659e72a/0_265_4799_2879/master/4799.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a607d69e5f4fc78b501df58b8c0c7c02","title":"start slow wear what you like watch out for zombies a beginners guide to running","story":"There’s a replacement to your pre-lockdown workout right outside your door. Experienced runners explain how to get startedThe gyms, pools and squash courts are shut. Joe Wicks is showing you how to get fit in your living room, but really all you want to do is get out of your living room. Now is the time to go for a run.If you are worried you’re not a running type, don’t be. I wasn’t either until I decided that I didn’t feel safe going to the gym in mid-March. Eight weeks later, I finished my first half-hour run, covering an apparently respectable 4.83km in the process. Almost anyone can be a runner, it turns out. So why not give it a try?The great thing about running is that you don’t need membership of a fancy club, expensive equipment or a qualified coach. But you do have to get some stuff: a good pair of shoes is non-negotiable, as is a sports bra if you need one.You don’t need to go wild for these things: yes, £200 will get you the pair of shoes that helped Eliud Kipchoge run the first sub-two-hour marathon, but beginners can settle for something much cheaper. But do resist the urge to just whack on the pair of throwback Nikes you bought for fashion purposes last year.“For people who are starting out, it’s important not to get bogged down in the kit, and actually think about the action of running,” says Anna Harding, the host of YouTube’s the Running Channel. “But I would suggest investing in a new pair of specific running trainers, and, for women, a sports bra. You don’t know the state of your old shoes, and it’s important to take care of your feet and knees. Other than that, though, wear what you feel good in.”When you first hit the road, you need to run slowly. Really slowly. So slowly you feel silly because of how slowly you are running. Slow enough that you’re pretty sure you could overtake yourself at a brisk walk.The point of running is endurance, and the most important thing to do is to make sure that you keep your heart rate elevated for the entire period of every training run. That means, especially at the beginning, erring on the side of caution: if you run slowly and find yourself barely breaking a sweat 20 minutes in, then you can speed up, but if you go too fast at the start, those last five minutes are going to be tough.“Start slow” also applies to how you should build up stamina over the first few weeks and months of your run. Thankfully, there is a best-in-class option here: the Couch to 5k programme, originally created by Josh Clark, an American software designer, in 1996. The idea is simple: run three times a week for eight weeks, beginning with sessions that involve more walking than actual running, and ending with 30 minutes of non-stop jogging.Your first session sees you running for a minute then walking for 90 seconds, and repeating the pattern eight times – enough to get an elevated heart rate for 20 minutes, and to get a solid eight minutes of actual running in. Four weeks later, the running has increased to three sets of five minutes, separated by three minutes of walking. And at the end of week five, the training wheels come off, and you run for a full 20 minutes non-stop.When I first tried to become a runner, in 2009, I would manually create those routines, booting up GarageBand on an old laptop and recording myself saying “run” and “walk” over the top of whatever I wanted to listen to, then loading it on to an iPod Shuffle. No wonder I didn’t stick with it. These days, it’s easier: the NHS has produced a podcast and app that automatically coaches you through the first nine weeks of your run.Some people think I’m daft for running to podcasts, wondering how on earth I can get into a good rhythm while catching up on Today in Focus. Sometimes, I think they’re nuts for running to music: no matter how good a tune is, it’s not distracting enough to save me from getting a bit bored 20 minutes in.If you want something more active still, you could try Zombies, Run! The app, which first launched eight years ago, lets you play through audio adventures timed to encourage and motivate you throughout a workout. A stand-alone couch-to-5k version can accompany you right from the start.“I started running when I was 20 or 21, and when we started Zombies, Run!, I was 28 or 29. Now I’m 37,” says Adrian Hon, the app’s co-creator. “I was a runner at that point, but I intensely remember the experience of not being a good runner. It came to me hard.”No one cares how sweaty you are, whether the top you run in is too bright or how fast or slow you’re going. So don’t worry about it. “A lot of the advertising, marketing and branding around running is incredibly unhelpful,” Hon says, “because it makes people think that a runner is some athletic supercharged person in Nike gear who doesn’t sweat. People get really self-conscious about that, and they get embarrassed. But no one gives a shit. Really: no one gives a shit what you look like.”Pavement space is at a bit of a premium right now, and in some places, that has led to hard feelings between runners, walkers and cyclists – not to mention the drivers who still get the majority of the road.“It has certainly become more of an obstacle course as we try to maintain the two-metre distance,” Harding says. “And I think as runners we are getting a little bit of side-eye from pedestrians, perhaps because of some reports suggesting that runners aren’t adhering to physical distancing.”It isn’t all negative, says Hon. “Obviously, there are more people running. Which is nice in some ways – you feel like you’ve got company. But it’s also tricky you’re having to weave in between people.“It’s a bit of a game: how do I maintain physical distancing while running? But there’s a happy medium, and there can occasionally just be too many people trying to share one fairly thin pavement. You’ve got to be very forgiving. It’s hard – sometimes I get annoyed when people run close to me. But risk is, I think, not as high as many other activities.”There are an awful lot of services that will track your stats, engage in virtual races or let you join a global community of runners. But before you jump in, remember why you’re running. It’s probably not to be the fastest among your friends, and if you’re not careful, such features can be more dispiriting than motivating.“People react to this stuff differently. In general, it is quite motivating to see yourself get faster, and to see yourself run further,” says Hon. “But when you have this social-media stuff … I think people are just too different. It becomes hard for it to be interesting or useful. Some people may like it, but the problem is that for most people, unless all their friends are runners, their range of abilities are all over the place.”Harding agrees: “The first thing to overcome is pride. For a lot of people, they’ll either compare themselves with where they used to be or to their friends who are running, or have been running a while.”“Motivation is something that will hit you during your early stages of running,” Harding says, “and continue to hit you after your running journey. And so that first day of ‘I really don’t fancy it today’ is one to overcome. But to steal a slogan from a well-known brand … just do it. You will genuinely feel better. I have never gone for a run and regretted it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/25273b6341cfb9e538ae6f0d6ee78737016b41ec/0_344_5120_3073/master/5120.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=23053d736e73513a3a09d40fe490c6ba","title":"walk this way how to optimise your stride and focus your mind to get the most from your daily stroll","story":"Lockdown has reminded us of the pleasures of walking. But making small changes can boost its benefits to our health, mood and creativity, tooAs a form of physical activity, it is easy to dismiss walking as, well, pedestrian. But now its benefits, both physical and mental, are being appreciated once again. Under lockdown, daily walks became sacred. Now they are the safest way to commute, and, for those stuck at home, there is little place else to go other than to wander the streets, forests, towpaths, cemeteries and eerily deserted business quarters.We have become nosy tourists in our own neighbourhoods. We seek out less-travelled backwaters, eyeing curiously the fragments of human and animal lives that we pass, gazing on seasonal changes like besotted new parents. But are we walking to the best of our abilities? Possibly not. Sports scientist Joanna Hall has dedicated her career to coaching people in how to walk the way their bodies were designed to, which no longer comes easily in this sedentary, screen-based era.“I approach this as you would do if you wanted to get better at tennis,” she says. She developed her Walk Active programme to enable people to ease their aches and pains as they exercise, rather than exacerbate them. Lifestyle, ageing and injuries mean that when we put one foot in front of the other, the way we use our muscles may be, she says, “suboptimal for improving our posture, or reducing joint strain and getting the most out of walking”.According to Hall, there are four common aspects we get wrong, and each has knock-on effects on the body. Firstly, instead of propelling ourselves forwards by pushing off with the back foot, like an ice-skater, we try to use our stepping foot to power us along. This is because sitting down too much has made our hip flexor muscles short and tight. Hall describes the necessary adjustment as the subtle difference between stepping into a space (wrong) and pushing off from a space, which will recruit the right muscles up the backs of your legs. “You use your glutes and you open up the core,” says Hall.The second problem is what Hall calls a passive foot strike. The movement provided by the joints in our feet offers suspension and balance but we often plod along flatly instead, leaving us compromised. “That’s what causes knee discomfort,” says Hall. “It can create slight misalignment of the back, stiffness of the shoulders.”The third thing to watch out for is letting your head hang forwards. Screens, reading and desk work have made this the default position, which is a bit of a disaster. “When the head is slightly forward,” says Hall, “the muscles of the upper back and the shoulders have to contract to hold it there. The shoulders come forward and can stiffen. Back mobility becomes restricted and you will not be able to rotate your spine from the hips.” Try lifting your head before looking over your shoulder and you may discover, as I did, that you can turn your head much further all of a sudden.Finally, our arms tend to hang awkwardly or we force them into tense, power-walk movements, when what they want is to dangle freely. If you get steps one to three right, this should happen naturally. Hall has devised various drills to help correct these bad habits, such as measuring with your hand the gap between your bottom rib and your hip, and between your collarbone and your earlobe, and then adjusting your posture to lengthen those gaps. Walking with her tips in mind has made me feel lighter more gazelle than galumph.Now that lockdown rules have eased, we can get some desperately needed time with friends or family members. Yes, not being allowed to hug is painful, but physically distanced walking together is the next best thing. This is because when two people walk together, they unconsciously fall into step. As a 2012 study by US and Japanese researchers found, when people move in sync together, their neural activity synchronises too. The more in sync we are, the deeper our social connection, so walking in step is pretty much a physically distanced hug.Walking has long been hailed as an aid to creativity, too, by big thinkers from Aristotle to Wordsworth to Stanford University behavioural scientist Marily Ann Oppezzo. In 2018, Oppezzo and her colleagues, who study creativity, published research that set out to demonstrate this lightbulb effect. Participants who brainstormed while walking thought of significantly more valid ideas than those who tried to do the same while sitting.So if you have to attend a (socially-distanced) brainstorming meeting, says Oppezzo, “go think about ideas beforehand while walking.” Brainstorming in groups, she says, is far less productive.If you need to maximise the potential of a creative walk – perhaps you are finally starting that novel while quarantining – she suggests picking a problem or topic beforehand and thinking about potential new perspectives on it while you walk. Rather than taking a “deep e”, she says, walking is great for taking a stroll around a subject, seeing it from different sides and coming up with new ideas.She recommends travelling at a comfortable pace, so your physical exertion needs minimal attention, and coming up with as many ideas as you can, rather than trying to lock on to the first one you have. And if the ideas aren’t flowing, don’t force it. Come back to it another time.Crucially, in the study, she had participants record their ideas, rather than write them down, “because the idea of writing something down is already a filter – is this good enough to write down? You can put your headphones on and record through your phone.” And if you are feeling self-conscious, the headphones allow you to pretend to passers-by that you’re having a phone conversation.As well as percolating the cerebral juices, there are powerful mental-health benefits to be gained from walking. Half an hour of walking per day has been found to be as helpful as more intense 20-minute workouts in treating depression. Hugh O’Donovan, a psychologist based in Cork, wrote about the beneficial effects in his 2015 book Mindful Walking: Walk Your Way to Mental and Physical Well-Being. Walking provides what he calls “natural meds”, and there are no rules. Do you want to walk alone or with others? Do you listen to music or the outside world? Right now, enjoying the variety of options is key. “You have different locations and different routes,” says O’Donovan. “You can pick up the pace when you like, or you can slow down and be a bit more mindful. It doesn’t really matter. It’s just the fact that you’re doing it.”To reinforce the positive effects, he suggests “experimenting with noticing how you’re feeling. Is it lifting my mood? Am I meeting people and socialising a little?” However you prefer to walk, he invites you to “come to your senses. This is profoundly important because much of the time we’re on autopilot. We’re unconscious, unaware of what’s going on around us. There’s magic all around us all the time but we’re too busy.” Coronavirus has slowed life down, perhaps making it a little easier to pay attention. “What are you seeing, smelling, tasting?” he asks. “The world looks like a completely different place when you bring this quality of curiosity to everything you do. People underestimate its value.”While walking helps oil the cogs of the mind, and can help you get perspective if you’re struggling with something seismic such as grief, a job loss or the uncertainty of life under Covid-19, it pays to be aware of the risks of rumination. Namely, says O’Donovan, “the error and bias that’s associated with thinking, which lead us down a slippery slope into catastrophising and predicting the future negatively.” How can you avoid repeating the unhelpful and yet perfectly natural response, “why me?” or “why this?” Ask instead, says O’Donovan, “what now?” Walking can help with this. “The world opens up in a different way when we lift our mood, when we don’t fall into the hole.“Your best chance to stay in contention, as I call it, is to be mindful about what’s going on in the world,” he continues. “It might seem like it’s very dark at the moment, but there’s lots of good stuff going on too. Focus on what kind of a story you choose to tell. And, by getting out, moving and keeping your energy up, you have the possibility of telling a more positive story.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5907b4dbbf77ceee55e58958f38575584287ba48/1164_1063_3388_2033/master/3388.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=995bc22d8609f3df2589f3b3a247f144","title":"zoom shabbat unexpected joy","story":"Shabbat for me used to mean a break from screens, but as I drop into synagogues all over North America, I’m reminded we’re all in this together Before the pandemic, Shabbat for me meant a break from screens. My synagogue, housed in a century-old building on a residential street in a quiet Toronto neighbourhood, observes the ancient laws that prohibit the use of technology on the Sabbath. A few Saturdays a month, I used to dress up, walk to shul (synagogue), and leave the frenetic demands of the secular, wired world behind. Since the pandemic shut the doors to my synagogue, I reluctantly turned to online shul to fill the void. Shabbat by Zoom, it turns out, is unexpectedly nourishing. Last month, the leaders of the conservative movement of Judaism gave rabbis the green light to livestream on Shabbat. Thousands of Jews around the world are just now discovering the joy of virtual worship, known to more liberal Jews for years. In fact, Zoom Shabbat has some distinct advantages over in-real-life congregation. If a sermon is boring, I’ll hop over to a different one. If I don’t like the voice of one cantor, I’ll close the tab and find another. Attendance is anonymous. No one notices if you show up late or leave early. I’ve dropped into synagogues all over North America.Virtual shul helps me mark the passing of time. Because I no longer drop my kids off to school or ride the subway to work, the days tend blend into each other. Virtual shul helps make Shabbat morning feel special. On Saturdays, we sleep in. My husband works on a cryptic crossword. Mid-morning, I recite Shabbat prayers with other people, just like before the pandemic, only now I don’t dress up or leave the house. I open my laptop at my kitchen table in my yoga pants, or sometimes in bed. My seven-year-old daughter colours beside me, and the two of us sing along to familiar melodies.Something else I like about livestream shul: it can be more intimate than in real life. You’re invited inside the private living rooms and offices of clergy where you can see their art, bookshelves and furniture. When the cantor Julia Cadrain, from Central Synagogue on the Upper East Side in Manhattan, sings from her apartment with a guitar on her lap in front of a wall of hanging plants, I feel like her personal guest. Sometimes her toddler joins her.I avoid the congregations that require Zoom password, which can lead to awkward situations. On a recent Saturday morning, I logged into a service held by Romemu, a progressive congregation on the Upper West Side, and in one of the little Zoom boxes, I saw the face of an old high school friend I hadn’t seen for over 20 years. I wondered if he’d seen me, if my hair looked OK, if I should follow up with an email. Flummoxed, I quickly logged off.If I’m lucky, I’ll stumble upon the bar or bat mitzvah of a stranger. Bar or bat mitzvahs are my preferred genre of reality television in the age of Covid-19. Inevitably, I cry from start to finish. I admire how, in the face of a disappointment, the kid, wearing fancy clothes, in the company of just immediate family, with a scroll placed on a dining room table, found a way to create a meaningful ritual. If she can do that, I think, maybe I can survive this, too. Sometimes the faces of the grandparents are Zoomed in from Florida, their knickknacks proudly displayed on shelves behind them. Captured on the screen is the sadness of the pandemic, the forced separation of grandparents from their grandkids, but it’s also an act of hope: despite the circumstances, the Jewish tradition is being passed from one generation to the next.When this is over, will I go back to attending synagogue in real life, or will my new virtual habit satisfy my needs? I’m not sure. Thousands of years ago, when Judaism shifted from being a temple-based religion to a bunch of communities spread out across the diaspora, synagogue ritual was invented as a kind of placeholder, until the temple in Jerusalem can be rebuilt. What we’re witnessing now is another great adaptation.I still miss my old synagogue. I miss the sound of voices singing together in spontaneous harmony. I miss the drama of the wrapped-up Torah scroll processing up and down the aisle and I miss the warm, wood-walled room that holds many happy memories. But Zoom Shabbat will do until the real thing comes back. Shabbat gives the week a rhythm. There’s a crescendo leading to Shabbat and a bittersweet denouement when it’s over. Without it, I’d be lost. Even though we can’t congregate, even though we can’t meet, Zoom shul reminds me that we’re all in this together."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d999d78c367891690c375cd67573f8726a9916e/33_122_2455_1474/master/2455.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b811ae0839abcedc3ff8d13874c11bc7","title":"anywhere but westminster online covid 19 uk","story":"In lockdown, our series is using footage sent in from around the UK to tell the story of the world outside the political bubbleThe day after the 2019 general election we were on an early-morning train from Stoke-on-Trent to London, feeling as if a long and messy chapter of recent British history had at last come to some kind of full stop. Brexit was a certainty, the Conservatives had won a big parliamentary majority, and the Labour party was more estranged than ever from its old heartlands. Having covered a country in mounting political ferment since 2010, we thought we could at least put Anywhere but Westminster on pause.But in March, everything changed once again. As the Covid-19 crisis reached the decisive point of lockdown, we decided the series had to be reawakened. But if we were as subject to the new restrictions as anyone else, and just as scared of the virus, how could we do it?The answer has defined our experience of the past two months. Instead of travelling to places, we have issued call-outs for information about what people are living through, and footage of their lives, usually shot on their phones. In addition, often using contacts we have acquired over the past 10 years, we have approached old and new sources, and asked them to participate. A mountain of video has arrived, which we and our team have spent long days and nights combining with our own material and turning into finished films. The result, by a mixture of accident and design, has been an ongoing series of videos that tells the story of this crisis from the core of people’s actual experience.We’ve chronicled the lives of a 26-year-old man whose arthritis medication suppresses his immune system, meaning he has to live in complete isolation, and an intensive care nurse who facilitates people saying their last goodbyes via Zoom. We’ve spoken to families whose experience of lockdown is light years away from any “bake cakes and learn Spanish” cliches, and people who have spoken movingly about losing loved ones. Crucially, we have also gone out of our way to explore how communities have come together, and provided new kinds of support to friends and neighbours.Unintentionally, it feels like what we’re doing is true to most people’s experience of the crisis – and, in particular, the mixture of an often lonely world suddenly mediated via the internet, and an unexpected sense of common purpose and togetherness. It sometimes feels as if encouraging people to document their own experiences is sparking a change in the way we feel about our journalism, and presenting us with a new challenge we will have to face when the crisis recedes: how to push even further beyond the standard approaches of the media, and give an even more authentic sense of where the country is going.For now, one thing seems particularly clear. The convulsive political events of the past 10 years were at least partly about rising inequality and insecurity, and people’s sense that power was too distant. Covid-19 has highlighted those things to the point that they are even more inescapable than before – which, for us, means that the work has to go on.Stay at home, keep your distance from people and don’t mix with anyone outside of your circle: the rules of lockdown are almost the polar opposite of the rules of Anywhere but Westminster.Our process has been to get out there to places the media doesn’t normally visit, get close to people, and talk to those outside our bubble. Seeing a political media that was too socially distant, we wanted to counteract it with a kind of journalistic gap-closing.Through the ruptures of Corbynism, Brexit, and the rise of populism, the idea that there was a gap between the way politics was presented in the news and lived in the world became accepted, and even a cliche. After 10 years, I sometimes felt like one of an ageing pair of small-time bank robbers, always coming back for one last job.But coronavirus and the resulting lockdown brought us new purpose – or a new version of our old purpose. Once again, the news was dominated by images from government briefings from Westminster and political journalists trying to hold them to account – this time over Zoom. There was also a blizzard of figures: infection rates, deaths, jobs lost, workers in furlough. We wanted to give more space to ordinary people to speak – putting human stories to those numbers and policies, but also capturing the ways in which communities were coming together to help each other.Same old problem, then: the difference is that we are working from our bedrooms and putting the films together using footage sent to us by people around Britain. Like everything else about this moment, it’s been a journey of discovery, with highs and lows. I will not miss wrestling with hundreds of clips shot in different formats, sent to me along with a constant stream of messages, questions, and pinging alerts. But I have also found moments of emotion in the footage that it would be hard to match in anything I shot myself.A paradox has become clear: while the issues we cover have always been bottom-up, the process of making a film that has a narrative viewers will watch and engage with is a very top-down process, requiring lots of control in the hands of the person filming and editing. Normally we videographers film with great attention to detail, trying to get each shot just right, and capturing every aspect of a scene in sequences of shots. Now I’m in collaboration with people who don’t even hold the camera the right way round (hint: it’s not vertical). But what they lack in technical skills they have made up for in authenticity.So, in many ways, this has been a process of letting go – of the old standards that we thought were so important, and of the visual “grammar” we have taken for granted. Instead we have found value in a new kind of intimacy and sincerity that comes from people having filmed their own stories, and the greater sense of control they have in the process. And we have tried to lay open the process to the viewers. In some ways this version of Anywhere but Westminster is the most true to its original vision. Hopefully it will open up new ways of thinking about how we do our video journalism and share power with the people we report on, and at the same time encourage people to see the power in capturing and documenting these times in video for themselves."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e60efe287d1477c1d28411ae3f6dc099a6841771/83_0_3405_2043/master/3405.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5f18b0acf514602c15e6b0036683204a","title":"what are your experiences of debt during the coronavirus pandemic","story":"We’d like to hear from people about how they are managing existing debts during the coronavirus pandemicSince the lockdown thousands of people have found themselves grappling with significantly reduced finances.

It will start at 11.30am rather than 2.30pm to debate a government motion on how to proceed.In a letter to MPs the Speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, said he had agreed to the government plan: “Now that I have agreed to a recall on Tuesday, it is for the government to decide what proposal for voting it wishes to put forward.“I have been clear to the government and to opposition parties that I would prefer cross-party agreement to be reached about the way in which the house should conduct its proceedings when the house returns, including on how isions should take place.”Hoyle said the PHE advice on voting had changed, and it was clear that “the house simply cannot conduct isions safely via the lobbies”.He wrote: “There are pinch points in the lobbies where MPs are recorded by clerks and counted by tellers where it would be difficult to maintain social distancing, even though perspex booths were prepared for two of the ision desks.” Such votes would also risk taking longer than allowed under parliamentary proceedings, he added.Hoyle said that if the government and opposition were unable to agree a way forward, he would allow amendments to the government motion for new procedures.Valerie Vaz, the shadow Commons leader, said it was the “latest example of the government in chaos”. She said: “Jacob Rees-Mogg tried to abolish the hybrid remote parliament, which allowed all MPs to take part regardless of their personal circumstances, without any prior notice and against all advice on the last day parliament met.\u0026nbsp“He has bungled it and is now forcing parliament to return early solely to correct his earlier discriminatory move.”Pete Wishart, the Cabinet Office spokesman for the SNP, tweeted: “The government wants us to come back to a parliament that can’t work. An absolute joke.”The Public and Commercial Services union, which represents many security, catering and other support staff in parliament, has also raised concerns about the full return of MPs. The union’s general secretary, Mark Serwotka, said the part-virtual system had worked well, and said it was “strange why the government is in a rush to change course when a second covid spike is such a strong possibility”.A Commons debate on resuming physical sittings before the recess heard concerns from a series of MPs. The former Conservative minister Robert Halfon said the proposals would discriminate and threaten the lives of some MPs.“Is it really morally just to say in effect to MPs, because you are not Tarzan-like and able to swing through the chamber, beating your chest shouting to your constituents: ‘Look, I am here!’ that you are effectively euthanised from the Commons?” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c5cf1323b58a223a480885a82a17e2959c2fb115/0_1_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f54a6c521ca91084f2866035f687cc0c","title":"view from barnard castle dominic cummings hes made a mockery of us","story":"Residents criticise police decision not to take action against PM’s aide for trip to beauty spotAt Barnard Castle there has been angry condemnation about the police decision not to take action against Dominic Cummings, the prime minister’s most senior aide, after his 52-mile round trip to the beauty spot on 12 April, apparently to test his eyesight.Dan Goldsmith, 43, said: “To come here from Durham isn’t a short journey and it wasn’t an essential journey by any means. It’s clear to everyone that what he did was wrong – it was a breach – and if the police accept that they should be taking actions against him.“It seems to me to be – again – one rule for ordinary people and another for influential people. It’s a sham. The man is an arse and he should have been prosecuted and treated the same way as anyone else would have been in those circumstances.”Hyleen Wood, 58, and Stuart Wood, 55, from Chester-le-Street near Durham, said the whole episode made a mockery of the lockdown.“It is very frustrating and his reasons make very little sense – it was quite clear what we were asked to do. We have all obeyed the rules and he has flouted it in front of us, making a mockery of what we are doing,” she said.Her husband, Stuart, on his first day out since lockdown began after being furloughed from his job at a recycling plant, said Cummings needs to apologise and tell the truth. “I was furloughed on 21 March and I haven’t left my local area since then, apart from to take the dog for a walk.“Cummings should have apologised and Boris Johnson is desperately trying to brush this under the carpet. We were all expected to do our bit, yet he doesn’t appear to have done that and then that whole story about his eyesight – he totally tripped himself up there,” he said.Emily Davies, 26, is 18 weeks’ pregnant and this week had her latest scan, which her partner, Luke Stebbens, 26, was unable to attend.Davies said: “This is our first baby and it’s an important time for us, it’s a time when I’d like him to be present for everything, especially to see the scan, but under the restrictions he can’t be.“And at the same time Dominic Cummings can drive here apparently to test his eyesight. Who drives a car to see whether they can see well enough to drive a car?“If he committed an offence, he should have been prosecuted. If it had been an ordinary member of the public, they’d have been done for it, he should have been treated the same.”Stebbens added: “A friend of mine was fined driving to work. He didn’t realise his workplace wasn’t open but he was still stopped and fined by Durham police. And Cummings goes for a drive apparently to find out if he can see properly and gets away with it. How is that fair?”Dennis Richards, 58, said: “I think people in Barnard Castle have had enough of this issue now and I do feel that it’s a distraction from more important matters when the health of so many people is at risk.“But that said, I think Dominic Cummings should have accepted that what he did was wrong, because it was, and that he should have gone from government one way or another.“It wasn’t a major crime by any means but if you’ve done wrong you should be accountable for it and he hasn’t been.”Meanwhile, Ann-Marie Davies, 55, from Barnard Castle, said: “It is just one of those things and hindsight is a great thing but an apology would have been good. If he had just said: ‘I did it for the best interests of my family’ – it would have been better.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d193cafe03cb28e7d6b0afb142d84d7e5a1e2ecc/0_20_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=da5a25c53e848dd3e8915b1f8ddcedf6","title":"lgbtq community how have you been affected by the lockdown","story":"We would like to hear from LGBTQ+ people about their experiences during the pandemicWhile the pandemic lockdown has raised significant concerns for everyone, we want to know whether it has brought additional difficulties for the LGBTQ+ community.Being able to embrace your sexuality or gender identity has a positive impact on wellbeing and resilience.

The calendar has been wiped out since 8 March because of the coronavirus pandemic but a return date has now been set, with the British Masters at Close House near Newcastle the opening tournament in July.With the season to run through until December, all tournaments will be played behind closed doors and subject to strict safety and testing protocols.Other events in the British swing are a revived English Open at Forest of Arden, the English Championship at Hanbury Manor, back-to-back tournaments at Celtic Manor – the Celtic Classic and the Wales Open – and the UK Championship at the Belfry. They are all subject to the lifting of the two-week quarantine by the government.Four Rolex Series events have also been announced, with the Scottish Open and PGA Championship in back-to-back weeks in October, while the Nedbank Golf Challenge and the World Tour Championship will take place in December.Keith Pelley, the European Tour chief executive, said: “We have consistently said that safety is our absolute priority and that is why today we are announcing our resumption in two months’ time supported by a comprehensive health strategy which has been led by our medical team. Without question we have had to think differently about the remainder of our 2020 season which is reflected in today’s announcement. As golf’s global tour, ersity is ordinarily one of our biggest strengths, but in this instance it has become one of our biggest challenges.“Initially, therefore, based on the expert guidance we received, playing in clusters, in one territory, is the best option in terms of testing, travel and accommodation.”While the Race To Dubai will still name a champion in December, the European Tour’s committee has decided that no player will lose his card this year, nor will there be any formal graduations from the Challenge Tour."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e44c90d3399484974b3524e91d14ed72eb1fa08/0_189_5153_3092/master/5153.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8a30bb6daed37af78c29afbc2b5a6b6b","title":"running with deer in park helped dina asher smith to stay in shape","story":"Dina Asher-Smith has described how running with deer has kept her fit during the Covid-19 lockdown, also admitting she felt relieved when the Olympics were postponed because of the near-impossibility of training sufficiently.If the Tokyo Games take place next year, Asher-Smith will be highly favoured to build on her 200m gold medal from the 2019 world championships. But that could hardly have felt a more remote prospect when the first British woman to win a global sprint title found herself making do with a complete change of rhythm, and surroundings, over longer distances in a deer park in recent weeks.“The sprinters always joke that we don’t understand how the longer‑distance people go on those long runs,” the 24-year-old said. “When the scenery is so pretty I was starting to understand it. Running in a park among deer is definitely not what I would normally be doing. My normal training programme consists of a lot of gym, a lot of short, sharp and powerful things. It was strange but it was a peaceful change.”The Olympics were postponed on 24 March, a day after the UK lockdown began. Had the Games proceeded as scheduled from 24 July, Asher-Smith and her peers would have faced a monumental task to keep in peak condition over the following four months.“On the day it was announced it was cancelled, I remember feeling relieved in a way. I think it had become unfeasible in the situation we were in at the time. I remember thinking: ‘How am I meant to do Olympic standard training and keep up the shape I need and want to be in for the Olympics from training in my flat? “Before that, I went through a period like a lot of athletes did of disbelief, thinking: ‘No, don’t be silly. It won’t be cancelled.’ Then, as everything got worse, I thought: ‘I don’t know how tenable this is.’ Then gradually I was accepting: ‘Yeah, this is pretty unlikely.’”Asher-Smith was speaking, along with fellow British athletes Katerina Johnson-Thompson and Adam Gemili, on How Dina and Kat Struck World Gold, which will be aired on BBC One on Sunday.Johnson-Thompson, who beat the Olympic champion Nafi Thiam to win the world title in Qatar, said she took the Tokyo 2020 postponement well but found the delay of the world indoor championships, which will now take place next year in Nanjing, harder to take. “Then I didn’t have any focus to train for,” she said.Johnson-Thompson made the difficult decision to return to Liverpool from her base in Montpellier, after being confined to her apartment for training. “It was a lot easier than being in France. I have been able to keep up fitness quite well. But what has been lacking is technical work I am missing from my coach.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4d7f327a0ba71d550ba487b335eac0700de77255/537_600_2710_1627/master/2710.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9128a75ffa0c2f57a020f36281a313ee","title":"silverstone set to host back to back f1 races in august","story":"The British Grand Prix is expected to be confirmed for August as part on the Formula One calendar next week. F1 is to shortly announce the opening eight European meetings of the season, of which Silverstone will host two back-to-back races behind closed doors, set for 2 and 9 August.It is understood the calendar is ready to be confirmed subject to the government providing clarity on travel restrictions for the teams. The season is due to begin with two back-to-back races in Austria, the first on 5 July. Silverstone was to follow with two meetings but the 14-day quarantine on entry into the UK forced F1 to reschedule their plans.Seven of the 10 F1 teams are based in the UK and the sport is still in discussion with the government over gaining exemptions from the quarantine. The proposed races at Silverstone, one of which will be the British Grand Prix, will still be subject to whether the quarantine rules are to be lifted or F1 being granted an exemption.The Silverstone chief executive, Stuart Pringle, said this week that the circuit was flexible in the dates it could hold the meetings and that it was considering August as part of a potential timeframe. Two days ago the Silverstone Classic meeting which was set to take place on the weekend of 31 July to 2 August was cancelled, freeing up the venue for F1.Hungary is now expected to host the third race in an opening triple-header after Austria on 19 July. Spain is set for 16 August, to follow immediately after Silverstone. Belgium and Italy will conclude Europe’s meetings on 30 August and 6 September, the dates they held on the original calendar.

As a result, she vacates her body in spirit, becoming alienated from her needs and desires even as her male partners satisfy theirs. The show, directed by Matt Peover and available online from Soho theatre, describes GG’s existential odyssey to return to her body and to define herself from inside rather than out.Filmed at the Old Red Lion theatre in 2017 and coinciding with\u0026nbspthe #MeToo campaign, Good Girl chimes with that movement but extends beyond it, too. From the repeated refrain for little girls to be “good” to\u0026nbspthe pornographic ideal of the hairless female body, its themes seem to have been around long before and yet still fester today.The performance takes on the feel of a standup show as Sheldon stands in darkness, telling her story to the room. Childhood nostalgia and comic whimsy is combined with vignettes about masturbation and sex toys, and it is entertaining but not all of it sounds new: the comic tone to the study of her vagina and the pre-pubescent discussion of orgasms are familiar, and the 90s soundtrack of Madonna and Michael Jackson that marks the years feels a little formatted.But it hits plenty of original notes –\u0026nbspand dark ones too, from the dissociation she feels during sex to the everyday despair that grows out of it. There are some woozy moments – she feels like her body’s borders are blurred, porous and “leaky” as a girl –\u0026nbspwhich are intriguing but might have been further developed.\u0026nbspThe end offers a happy outcome that is too quick and under-explained, but by then Sheldon has won us over with her characterful portrait of millennial becoming and unbecoming.•\u0026nbspGood Girl is streaming at Soho Theatre On Demand until 28 August."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/085b0f9e284e01edbc98b28bf7f1e68f8a5a4291/0_67_4095_2457/master/4095.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fe83451c4229570db63f4630e7ca7e01","title":"larry kramer life in pictures","story":"The playwright, author and activist Larry Kramer has died aged 84 after a storied life.

It came out in April 2019 to replace the popular Forerunner 235.The Forerunner 245 resembles a round digital watch and is just 42.3mm wide, 12.2mm thick and 38.5g in weight, which by sports watch standards is tiny, comparing favourably with the likes of Samsung’s Galaxy Watch Active 2 and the Apple Watch Series 5. It takes standard universal 20mm watch bands and comes with an excellent traditional silicone strap that fits wrists between 127mm and 204mm in circumference: in other words most wrists.The colour transflective LCD display – which is not a touchscreen – can be seen in direct sunlight without the need for a backlight, although there is one for the night. The display is clear and easily readable at a glance, but is pretty basic compared with the flashy OLED screens on smartwatches. Think of it more like an advanced colour digital watch and you will get the idea.There are quite a few watch faces to choose from, including digital and analogue options, plus many more available from third parties via Garmin’s Connect IQ store.The up, down and back buttons take you around the interface. The startstop button doubles as a select button and the light button powers the watch on and accesses quick settings. Press and hold the down button to access music controls or the up button to quickly jump to the full settings menus.From the watch face you can also access a long list of customisable widgets using the up and down buttons, including smartphone notifications, calendar, the weather, health stats, stress levels, your heart rate, previous runs and many others.The Forerunner 245 fully charges in two hours via a short snap-in USB cable that plugs into the back of the watch and can connect to Garmin’s desktop Express software on Windows or Mac.The watch connects to your Android or iPhone via Bluetooth and the Garmin Connect app, which handles syncing data, updates, smart notifications and other bits. The separate Garmin Connect IQ app handles installing apps, including watch faces, widgets and music services.The Forerunner 245 Music also has wifi for syncing your activities straight to the cloud, downloading music and software updates.The Garmin Connect app is extremely comprehensive, able to display an almost bewildering amount of information, with analysis often reserved for pay-for subscriptions elsewhere, such as how effective your training is. Recent updates have made the app a lot more beginner-friendly, particularly for day-to-day health tracking.The Forerunner 245 is generally repairable, but Garmin typically replaces damaged devices with refurbished units for a fee. The battery is not user replaceable, but straps are. The screen is covered in Corning’s Gorilla Glass 3, similar to a smartphone.The Forerunner 245 tracks lots of sports but excels for running with practically every feature you can think of, whether that’s on a treadmill, track, trail or road. The battery lasts up to 24 hours tracking with GPS, and just under six hours playing music.The GPS trails are the most accurate I’ve tested in suburban London, matching distance and routes with very little deviation from maps and race lengths. The time it takes to get a GPS lock, and the strength of that lock, has been drastically improved with a recent software update too, getting a lock within 20 seconds of stepping outdoors most of the time.Garmin’s third-generation heart rate sensor is about as accurate as optical scanners can be too, and for the majority of people will be more than accurate enough for training purposes. If you need better you can connect a chest strap via Bluetooth.During a run you have a series of customisable screens with a varying number of fields and stats on display. The screens are well designed and easy to understand with just a quick glance mid-run.You can get the watch to beep and vibrate when you’ve hit certain milestones, such as laps or distance, and speak things like your average pace every three minutes through Bluetooth headphones. You can also set a target based on distance, time or pace, which is extremely handy for running a 5K without a running track.Alongside VO2 Max estimates, used as an overall measure of fitness, the Garmin can measure performance and tell you if you have worked hard enough. Between six and 20 minutes into your run the watch will beep and give you a positive or negative score, which is either a kick to run harder or confirmation that you’re on track. I find it extremely useful.The Forerunner 245 can track workouts such as interval training too. The watch has a built-in coach with adaptive plans for beginners to intermediates with a 5K time over 21 minutes.But you can easily programme your own or download sessions, based on pace, distance, heart rate zone or other metrics. Running at a pace, for instance, the watch beeps a countdown to the start of the interval.During the sprint the watch beeps when you are over or under your target pace alongside a glanceable dial on screen. It works really well and means you do not need a track, a set place to run or someone with a timer to do effective interval training.The only thing missing is a barometer. You’ll still get elevation data from maps, but if you look to train using elevation this might be a deal-breaker.The Forerunner 245 does a good job of tracking most of the basic cycling stats similar to running (pace, distance, heart rate etc) and can be paired with various external sensors for speed and cadence, plus Garmin’s smart lights.Swimming, including heart rate, lengths, distance, stroke type and count, calories and other bits can be tracked in the pool too. Plus gym workouts and a handful of other activities profiles, such as walking, yoga, rowing and weights.Overall health tracking is also extensive, covering all the usual suspects such as steps, calories, distance, intensity, heart rate, move notifications, menstrual tracking and stress.Garmin’s body battery attempts to track your energy levels during the day to show when best to exercise or rest. The watch tracks sleep, including cycles, heart rate and estimates blood oxygen saturation, and it can alert you when if heart rate spikes when not active. The only thing missing compared to the very best fitness trackers on the market is ECG measurements for your heart.Both versions of the Forerunner 245 can control music playback on a smartphone, but only the Forerunner 245 Music can download tracks and play them without a phone, with a capacity for 3.5GB or 500 tracks.Music in MP3 or AAC format can be transferred via USB cable from the computer using Garmin Express. If you’re a Spotify Premium, Deezer or Amazon Music user, you can install the associated app on your watch and sync music and podcasts directly to the watch via wifi. The Spotify app works really well, although downloading large playlists takes quite some time. Playing Spotify on runs without a phone is a killer feature but reduces the battery life to six hours.Alongside health tracking, the Forerunner 245 has basic smartwatch features, vibrating when you get a text, notification or call on your phone. You can scroll through the text of a notification and clear it, reject a call and that sort of thing.The battery lasts about a week with the screen on, notifications and health-tracking active, including heart rate, which is significantly longer than most smartwatches that only manage up to two days.The smartwatch functions work with both Android and an iPhone. They will not match a true smartwatch, but if you are looking for alerts on your wrist the Garmin does the job.The Garmin Forerunner 245 Music is a runner’s best friend, and sets a new bar by which most other running watches will be measured.The watch is small, slim and light. The display is very clear and easy to read. It has practically every stat and aid necessary to track, measure and help with running and training, and comprehensive analysis and export of data to many popular services, including Strava.Much of the information will be overkill for casual runners, but for those looking for a tool that works reliably with real buttons and helps them analyse their runs, do intervals and train better, the Garmin ticks practically every box. Seven days’ battery as a watch or 24 hours’ tracking runs doesn’t hurt either. Buy the one with music and free yourself from your phone for motivational tunes or podcasts, including offline Spotify support.It also does a great job of tracking a lot of other activities and features comprehensive general health monitoring too, including sleep, stress and heart rate alerts. Its smartwatch-like features get the basics right without trying to do too much, plus it has a fair few watch faces available and easy-to-swap standard straps.It’s not the cheapest, but the Garmin Forerunner 245 Music is a truly great running and fitness watch that is easy to live with on a daily basis.Cons: expensive, no barometer, no touchscreen as well as buttons, interface can be a bit clunky, screen fairly basic compared with smartwatches This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

They cook whatever comes in from the family boat and it is stunningly good – and stunningly good value. A massive plate of flour-and-salt-dusted anchovies for €6 was a standout but pretty much everything is worth a go. A cold Peroni, the freshest fish perfectly cooked, and the sun going down over the sea. A cliche perhaps but of such restaurants are cliches made. No booking, so choose your time carefully or you’ll be waiting – but it is worth it. • On FacebookDerek HillLamb with lentils – the smoky dregs of a huge pot hung over the fire – with flatbreads hot off the stones beside the fire, at dusk in a roadside truck stop in the Chitral Valley. It was the day my brother and I rode mountain bikes down from the Shandur Pass in northern Pakistan – we’d taken our time and were too late to look for somewhere to camp, so the truck stop provided bed and board. Total price about £2, including paratha and green tea for breakfast. No precise location and definitely no website. But the memory lives on as one of the best meals of my life.Fiona NeallWe found Cervecería Varadero in Tarifa – it’s listed as a fishmonger rather than a restaurant on Google – while on a whale-watching holiday. It looks very ordinary from the outside, but the fish is just incredible. It only opens at lunchtime and appears to be staffed by the fishermen who’ve caught that day’s offerings. It’s where I had, for the first time, deep-fried ortigas de mar (sea anemones) and tortillitas de camarones – the most amazing little shrimp fritters, a local speciality (pictured). There’s usually a queue but it’s so worth the wait. This is the place I’ve been looking for on every holiday I’ve been on, and I can’t wait to go back. AlisonWe were recommended a seafood restaurant in an octagonal building at the port, where the trawlers unloaded. After we’d tried about 15 types of seafood, a massive storm struck and the plastic coverings were lowered. After about 30 minutes of downpour, with water pouring through the ceiling, the waiter (who’d been drinking out of his own bottle) brought over another bottle of wine and said, “It’s free until the rain stops.” An hour and another eight types of seafood later, he brought us another bottle and said, “Nobody’s going home tonight.” This sounded a bit ominous at the time, but three hours later the rain eased up, we tipped generously and finally left. Marvellous!Will RoscoeOur ryokan hosts in Kyoto recommended Shoraian to us. Having navigated a bamboo grove and monkey forest, we arrived at a picture-perfect tiny restaurant beside the Katsura river. Removing our shoes, we were led to our own private dining room and seated on the floor. The restaurant specialises in tofu and we were presented with a succession of exquisitely presented courses on an array of different crockery: creamed, gratinated, chilled, steamed, grilled and boiled tofu. The only break from the seemingly endless stream of delicious soy curd was a stunning wagyu course, the beef marbled and truly melt-in-your-mouth. Such a memorable experience! • shoraian, about £60 a headPaulIgnoring for a second the idyllic riverside location, with the breeze cutting through the humidity of night, the lamb peka at Konavoski Dvori restaurant, 20 miles south of Dubrovnik, was quite simply the most delicious lamb I’ve ever eaten. It’s like a Sunday roast where the meat has spent the past two years doing nothing but lifting weights and eating avocados. It’s cooked with potatoes (which absorb the lamb fat in a most agreeable manner) in a charcoal fire-pit, covered by a large, bell-shaped iron lid. You have to order it in advance, but my lord it’s the sort of thing to remember and get emotional about. • esculaprestaurantsJames McPhunKuching, Borneo. Fried banana slices covered in thick batter with shredded cheese melting on top – served in a little red plastic basket lined with a thin napkin. We screw up our faces at the sight of it before shrugging and ing in with little pink plastic forks, creating unsaid margins for our own sections. It’s crunchy and soft. Sweet and savoury. Salty and creamy. All at the same damn time. The humidity is causing my hair to curl around my face as I chew, the riverside breeze sweeping across my collarbone as I reach in for more. The unfamiliar chatter of the locals surrounds us as we gabble in English about how much we adore this. I close my eyes to savour each sensation. “We’re ordering another one, right?”MaryThe sign at the multicoloured roadside shack outside the town of Sagua la Grande said, “Best Pina Coladas in the World.” We were cycling and stopped: “Two of your finest please.” With a flourish, the gnarly old proprietor, cigar stogie in his mouth, put a coconut, a pineapple, a bucket of ice and a bottle of rum on to his makeshift counter. He handed me a massive machete and with a tobacco-stained grin said “Help yourself!” We smoked cigars and drank with Carlos all day … and returned to Colón late, our bikes balanced on the back of his rusty old pick-up. Simon TobinThis week, six readers tipped this place! Ed. Travelling around Scotland by campervan, we came to the small village of Balnakeil, on the northern tip of the British mainland, close to the sea. Actually it felt a bit like the (most beautiful) end of the world. Fields, sheep, narrow roads and a cold wind, though sunny. And in this middle of nowhere, we found these chocolate makers called Cocoa Mountain. I will never forget this unbelievably creamy, sweet hot chocolate, which I sipped from a big mug on their porch. I have never had a better hot chocolate in my life. And I’m over 50. I took some chocolate powder home, and some of their delicious truffles. I would travel all the way from Germany again just for them, especially the chilli lemongrass ones!StephanieMy favourite food memory was on the journey back from the Spiti Valley in the Indian Himalayas. My boyfriend and I had been motorbiking around India for several months and had experienced many pitfalls. On our way down this mountain the only road was blocked by landslides. Trucks had been gridlocked for days. A group of truckers saw us and invited us over to eat with them. Using a portable stove they made a meal from the supplies they were transporting. We ate the most delicious tarka dal and rice, followed by handfuls of fresh snow peas from the truck. They even provided rum!Tabitha WardOne of the best meals I ever had was in a restaurant in Sanaa, the largest city in Yemen. It was incredibly simple, a large fish suspended in one of the tandoor ovens they use for baking bread until the outside was charred and the flesh perfectly cooked.

It’s an opportunity for everyone from tourist boards to tour operators to reset and to look at how things can be better – for the planet, for local communities and for travellers.”In Venice – one of the most overtouristed cities, with an estimated 25 million foreign visitors a year – officials are using the pause to rethink “an entire Venice system”, with sustainability and quality tourism at its core, said Paola Mar, the city’s councillor for tourism. Part of the plan is to lure locals back to live permanently in the city. The mayor is in discussions with universities, aiming to offer tourist rentals to students, and old buildings are being restored for social housing. Measures to control visitor numbers – including a tax on day trippers, which was due to be introduced in July – will go ahead next year, while the debate around cruise ships continues.“Our goal is to trigger a renaissance of the city,” said Mar. “We want to attract visitors for longer stays and encourage a ‘slower’ type of tourism. Things can’t go back to how they were.”City authorities in Amsterdam – which was struggling to cope with an estimated 18.3 million overnight tourist stays in 2019 – are also quietly hopeful that the pandemic will be a catalyst for change. Last week the mayor urged extreme caution in reopening to tourists, while nonprofit group Amsterdam\u0026ampPartners believes the tourist hiatus pushes to the top of the agenda plans to cut numbers, give Amsterdam back to locals and attract the “right” kind of visitor, and has launched a sustainability taskforce to map the way forward.“We are working with partners to discuss how we can restart in a more sustainable and responsible way,” said Amsterdam\u0026ampPartners spokeswoman Heleen Jansen. “The main focus is that we want a sustainable visitor economy that doesn’t harm the livability of our city. If you have the right balance between living, working and visiting, you can have the right visitor economy. That’s what went wrong in the last years in the old city centre, and we have to entice locals to discover their city centre again.”Meanwhile, the suddenly empty streets of Barcelona have made local businesses and the tourist board re-evaluate their priorities too. “While we couldn’t continue at the speed things were, this is showing us that no tourists is no good either – there needs to be a more moderate way,” said Mateo Asensioof the Barcelona tourist board. “Our first task is getting locals back out into the city, then the domestic market and our neighbours. When the international market returns, we’ll focus more on specific sectors. It’s an opportunity to change the rules.”With the world’s “new normal” including social distancing, an increased fear of crowds and busy places – and the future of airlines in the balance – over-tourism may not be a pressing issue for some time.Other changes in cities around the world include  reshaping in favour of cyclists and pedestrians: Athens is accelerating plans for a car-free historic centre, Berlin is introducing 14 miles of new bike lanes, and Paris is also significantly increasing its bike lanes, to ease potential overcrowding.Destinations likely to see the first surge in visitor numbers are remote coastal and rural areas, places seen as “safe”, said Patricia Yates, acting CEO of Visit BritainVisit England. It will be longer before cities bounce back.“Our weekly consumer sentiment surveys show that the domestic market is very nervous – so we will be focusing initially on reassurance,” she said. “But beyond that we will be looking at promoting areas outside the honeypots. What is needed is destination management to rebuild tourism more slowly and keep residents, visitors and businesses that depend on tourists happy – it’s quite a balancing act.”Some of the progress made on sustainable tourism is likely to go into reverse at first, she added – with people eschewing public transport in favour of car travel and infection control measures leading to more single-use plastic.Many tour operators, however, believe the pandemic could engender a positive change in client behaviour. Intrepid Travel CEO James Thornton said: “During this hibernation period we’ve seen the benefit to nature and the climate – fish spotted in Venice’s clearer canal water, the Himalayas visible in India – and people have had time to reflect. I think customers will be more aware of the impact of travel on the environment and the communities they visit, and make more considered choices.”A renewed focus on slower travel, including train journeys and cycling, as well as keeping experiences as local as possible and offering more off-season departures are part of Intrepid’s post-Covid plans, with wilderness and wellness trips tipped to be of most interest.Launching new adventures in even more remote destinations to assist with economic recovery is on the agenda for Much Better Adventures when tourism opens up again. “The crisis has shown just how much communities in less-developed parts of the world rely on tourism,” said Sam Bruce. “We will look to spread tourism to areas that would genuinely benefit. But it has to be done in the right way. We risk a flood to remote places that aren’t prepared and could be taken advantage of.“I’m hopeful that a new, slower tourism will emerge – but the recovery needs to be slow enough for the industry to make the right decisions as it rises from the ashes.”G Adventures founder Bruce Poon Tip – who has just published Unlearn: The Year the Earth Stood Still, an e-book looking at the impact of the pandemic on tourism – believes the industry can emerge as a stronger force for good.“People will travel again. We don’t yet know when, but we know that they will. I want to challenge everyone who travels to ‘unlearn’ what they think they know. We have the opportunity to use this reset to be more conscious about how we can improve, as iniduals and as a wider travel community.”With the pause likely to be temporary, campaigners from Greenpeace to Flight Free are demanding that airline bailouts come with strict conditions on their future climate impact and say Covid should be the catalyst for greening the world’s airlines.But in a race for economic recovery, rebuilding the industry quickly could sideline climate change and aviation issues, said Justin Francis of Responsible Travel, who is calling for a “green flying duty”, with more regulation and tax revenues invested in renewable fuels.The cost of flights is likely to rise in the long term, he added. “Short term, the where and how we travel has had to change. But new, more entrenched, norms could form from that. Many people were hooked on frequent short breaks, but key to more sustainable tourism is taking far fewer flights – we may now see a return to longer, less frequent holidays, with more time spent getting to know a place, and a rise in slower forms of travel.”Whatever happens, it’s unlikely travel will ever be the same as in pre-Covid days. An industry known for its resilience will find a new way forward, adapting to an unknown global market, but whether sustainability can be at the heart of a new model of tourism is hard to predict.“Tourism will be smaller, and so more sustainable per se. Fewer flights means less C02, fewer guests means less waste, and there will be much more focus on localism, at least initially,” said Graham Miller, professor of sustainability in business at the University of Surrey.“How the nature of the product changes, however, remains to be seen. There are huge vested interests to contend with – like the cruise industry in Venice and big businesses – but it feels like the moment we have been waiting for. If we are going to redesign tourism, this is about the best chance we can wish for.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b001ce65f476a5455e9aa40a35cdcefe14117239/146_108_4192_2516/master/4192.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8682a6857bb16955cc24f6cf415d53a5","title":"the first team review a football sitcom fit for relegation","story":"This new comedy from the writers of The Inbetweeners boasts Will Arnett and trademark ‘banter’ – but there’s only so long you can watch bored footballers playing FifaAs the new sitcom from the creators of The Inbetweeners, The First Team (BBC Two) comes with the weight of expectation on its shoulders. In this case, its dopey leads are a little older – in their early 20s, in fact – and they are peripheral players at a struggling Premier League football club. As a potential parking space for the banter bus, you would be hard pressed to find anything better than the dressing room of a football club. Plus, it has Will Arnett playing the club’s gruesome chairman, although his appearance is disappointingly brief.\u0026nbspThe First Team gets off to a slow start, though even the strongest sitcoms rarely find greatness in their early episodes. It inhabits a strange middle ground, as if it’s being stretched between all-out slapstick and the kind of earnest comedies that balance gags with wanting to make an important point. As you might expect from the talent behind it, penis jokes and toilet humour dominate the tone. There’s a running gag about an elongated foreskin. “Is that funny?” says the owner of said foreskin, the monstrous boiling pot of rage, Petey, though the answer appears to be that it definitely is, as we return to the punchline again and again.\u0026nbspOur heroes, if we can call them that, are Mattie, who, fresh from a mediocre stint at a US team, has been signed for reasons that nobody can fathom Benji, an academy player from London who loves women, fast cars and lives with his mum and Jack, the most sympathetic of the three, a man so completely baffled by his fame and fortune that it’s a wonder he is able to remember his own name. Mattie is the Will of the ensemble, an overexplainer who tries to sort things out with pious bossiness, while actually digging everyone into even deeper holes. Benji is broadly content, while Jack wanders around his empty mansion, unable to buy himself toilet paper, in case fans spot that he has to wipe his backside like everyone else. In a different context, Jack would be a tragedy, but here, his ineptitude is played for sweetness. His self-consciousness about shopping for personal items leads to a caper at a cash and carry involving a lifetime’s supply of loo roll. You can tell that it was written before the recent great panic-buying shortage of 2020, but it certainly makes the argument for stocking up in case of emergencies even stronger.\u0026nbspThe issue is that its three leads, while entertaining enough, have to work hard to gain the empathy that’s necessary to turn their blandness into a winning everyman appeal. The key point is that they are wealthy and successful (at least, successful enough to play football professionally, if not personally successful, or able to win any matches), yet the main struggles they face are the wrath of irate fans and boredom. Writer Iain Morris has said that the idea came to him in part because of a chance meeting with an ex-player who filled him in on the banal reality of this life. It’s brave to try to write a comedy that leans heavily on a relatively repetitive existence and this never quite transcends that problem. There’s only so long you can watch people sitting around talking and playing Fifa because there’s nothing else to do, even if a number of Twitch stars’ revenues would suggest otherwise.It has moments of inspiration. I loved the mysterious Cesare, a note-taking intellectual of a manager who drinks red wine and speaks in semi-comprehensible platitudes, though the reasons for this are soon explained, which makes me wonder where they will go next with his character. Arnett doesn’t so much steal the scenes he has as fold them up, stuff them in his suitcase and jump on the next plane out of there. Petey is a monster of pent-up rage and aggression whose quest for practical jokes knows no limits and brings out the show’s crude, lewd instincts, which are more convincing than its more sober moments. The “constructive criticism” doled out to the players allows for some creative insults, as well as a summary of what they are up against: “Massive wages, easy life, not bothered.”Still, I finished the first two episodes of The First Team suspecting that I wasn’t the target audience, that I had missed something crucial. In some ways, I felt the same about The Inbetweeners, but the difference with that was that I wanted to watch it anyway. At one point, Petey picks Mattie up by the throat and holds him against the wall, screaming: “Is this banter?” I’m wondering the same thing.\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c04ba12e9eb982bcfd25b22727fa425c3212747/0_142_3400_2040/master/3400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=06fedc59e0896a5e77f118ddf8019f4f","title":"new york summer coronavirus covid in pictures","story":"Photographer Jordan Gale was curious to see how New Yorkers would adapt to a post Covid-19 summer.

He also stressed the importance of the new test-and-trace system working effectively, to keep the pandemic under control.Johnson said: “We will now allow people to meet in gardens, and other private outdoor spaces. These changes mean that friends and family can start to see their loved ones: perhaps seeing both parents at once, or both grandparents at once.”“I know that for many people this will be a long-awaited and joyful moment,” he added. Those from different households will have to maintain physical distancing.Separately, a letter sent to dental practices by the chief dental officer said: “We support the full resumption of routine dental care, in a way that is safe, operationally deliverable and allows dental practices flexibility to do what is best for patients and their teams.”It comes after thousands of people complained of toothache and other problems during lockdown.Johnson confirmed that outdoor retail, such as markets and car showrooms, will be allowed to open from Monday, and other non-essential shops a fortnight later, provided they abide by Covid-secure guidelines.He said the government had met all five tests ministers set themselves for deciding when lockdown restrictions could be loosened. These included a sustained fall in the daily death rate, sufficient testing capacity and sufficient personal protective equipment (PPE). “We are confident that we have moved beyond the peak,” he said.The prime minister said the changes were modest. “I cannot, and will not, throw away all the gains we have made together – and so the changes we have made are limited and cautious,” he said.Ministers hope the move to allow outdoor meetings with friends and family will help to assuage public frustration at the lockdown, which has now been in place for nine weeks.When the government announced its coronavirus “roadmap” this month, it said it was examining a plan for “bubbles”, which would see two or more households allowed to in effect combine for social purposes. But that has been rejected in favour of a simpler approach, which will allow meetings with iniduals from different households, as long as they take place outdoors.Previously it was only permitted for people to meet one to one – and only in parks, not private gardens. Families will now be able to have barbecues with relatives.The chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, confirmed at the briefing that it would be acceptable for them to go inside to use the toilet – as long as they washed their hands thoroughly and wiped down surfaces afterwards.There will be no respite for those most vulnerable to the virus, who will continue to be asked to “shield” themselves by remaining at home.“I do understand how difficult his has been for you especially and I want to thank you to all the efforts you have gone to, because your efforts have helped the NHS to cope,” Johnson said.Although primary schools in England\u0026nbspopening their doors to more pupils from 1 June has been widely trailed, the official confirmation gives headteachers just three days of half-term\u0026nbspholiday to make final preparations and reach out to parents.Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: “It is important to understand that many primary schools will not be open to all eligible pupils on Monday morning, and that they will be phasing in these children over a period of time, while putting in place limits on class sizes and implementing other safety measures.”Nurseries and childcare providers in England are also being told they can reopen from 1 June. But Neil Leitch, chief executive of the Early Years Alliance, warned:\u0026nbsp“Many parents will be understandably hesitant about sending their children to a childcare provider reopening on Monday and as such it is very likely that nurseries, pre-schools and childminders will see a significant drop in demand for places in the short-term, which will result in a loss of income.”Whitty said the government’s advisers hope to “plot a path” out of shielding, as the infection rate in the community declines further – suggesting it would happen in stages.Johnson met the first ministers of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to discuss the changes earlier on Thursday. Nicola Sturgeon announced similar easing measures for Scotland earlier on Thursday.The prime minister said: “Although all parts of the UK are moving in the same direction, it is important to note health is devolved and different parts of the UK are quite properly all moving at different speeds.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e4c036d2997f2dab051c1e0427c637822e81aa5/0_198_3010_1806/master/3010.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=49dac4d36d491f294b647c2c93019d28","title":"hong kong what are the implications of china sedition laws national security beijing","story":"‘National security’ laws seen as Beijing signalling intention to put city firmly under its controlChina’s unprecedented plans to impose sweeping anti-sedition laws on Hong Kong have prompted mass protests and international condemnation.Beijing says the legislation is meant to stop subversion, terrorism and secessionism as well as foreign interference that could endanger national security. In the aftermath of the increasingly violent mass protests last year, China’s government has said such laws are urgently needed to plug Hong Kong’s “national security loophole”. The legislation will be written in Beijing and directly added into Hong Kong’s de facto constitution, known as the basic law.Critics say the move signals Beijing’s intention to place Hong Kong firmly under its control and sounds the death knell for the city’s existing rights and freedoms.For years, Hongkongers have used the phrase “cooking a frog in tepid water” to describe the gradual erosion of freedoms and rights in their city under Chinese rule since its handover from the British in 1997. The new security laws represent a dramatic and swift escalation of that process.Residents, legal experts and human rights advocates are worried that regulations used in mainland China to suppress and punish dissent will be applied in Hong Kong, where authorities ultimately answer to Beijing.Specifically, residents are worried about their right to free speech and assembly, an important channel of political expression for Hongkongers who do not get to elect their government’s highest office.“Given how broadly defined the terms of ‘national security’ and ‘subversion’ are, every protest that criticises the Hong Kong and Chinese government can be construed as violating the law, thus banned and their participants arrested,” said Phil Robertson, deputy director of Human Rights Watch’s Asia ision.\u0026nbspMore fundamentally, the basis of Hong Kong’s legal system, its independent judiciary, and vaunted values of rule of law are under threat. One of the most concerning element of the laws, according to draft legislation released last week, is that they enable China’s national security organs to establish “agencies” in Hong Kong “when needed”.This could come in the form of security forces, secret police, intelligence agencies, or a separate court established to hear related cases. One Hong Kong delegate to the National People’s Congress (NPC), China’s largely rubber-stamp parliament, proposed a “national security court” in which only Chinese judges would hear such cases.In mainland China, national security agents regularly harass and intimidate dissidents, journalists and residents who voice criticism against their government or otherwise are accused of undermining public order by “picking quarrels”. The national security laws and stationing of mainland agents in Hong Kong raise questions over how involved these agents will be in the efforts to “prevent, stop and punish” security threats.\u0026nbspBy including the reference to foreign interference in the legislation, the laws could allow Chinese authorities to ban international NGOs and human rights groups that operate out of Hong Kong. NGOs critical of the Chinese government have already been feeling pressure from Beijing over the years. The measure could also target pro-democracy activists who raise support and awareness internationally and work with groups overseas.The standing committee of the NPC will now draft the new security laws. Bills usually go through three readings by the committee before approval but can be adopted after just two sessions if a consensus is reached. The committee, which meets every two months, is scheduled to next meet in late June but special sessions can be called.According to the NPC observer blog, if no special sessions are called and normal procedure is followed the laws could be passed by the committee in August. But Chinese officials have called for the laws to be enacted “without delay” while state media have said legislation has already been mostly drafted and could be signed into a law “as early as the coming weeks”.After it is approved in the NPC, the legislation will be listed in Hong Kong’s basic law, under a provision that allows national laws to be implemented in the territory, which is meant to enact and enforce its own laws. It is a legal manoeuvre that allows Beijing to bypass Hong Kong’s legislature where the measures could be blocked by opposition lawmakers and public resistance.The delay leaves an opening for protesters to take to the streets again. Lunchtime protests have been called for Friday and another possible rally at the end of the month. Online some demonstrators have called for people to stage a “100-day war” before the laws are enacted.It is unclear who will enforce the laws. Under Hong Kong’s de facto constitution, Chinese laws should not apply to the city and its own legislature should enact legislation in the common law tradition. Its laws should be enforced by the city’s own law enforcement agencies and be administered by local courts.\u0026nbspWe also do not know how the legislation will define the crimes of subversion, terrorism, separatism and foreign interference – as well as what exactly constitutes “acts and activities” endangering national security.A summary of the decision approved by the NPC on Thursday included slight changes to the previous version, adding “activities” as well as “acts”.Some legal experts believe the language expands the scope of the legislation to include organisations as well as iniduals and others say it may be a way to target more general activities like attending an unauthorised rally."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6babd4d56b44432db25cc1f9021647d25756131/0_63_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d3ff6ba0220700e4beeb78755169b8fd","title":"people scotland can meet groups eight lockdown eased","story":"Other changes from Friday include some sports being allowed and five-mile travel for recreationPeople in Scotland can meet outdoors with another household in groups of up to eight, Nicola Sturgeon said as she proceeded with phase one of the Scottish government’s four-stage plan for moving out of lockdown.Scotland’s first minister insisted a continuing stay-at-home message remained “fundamental” to guidance, warning: “If we all start to go about our daily business too much, then we could see an increase in cases very, very quickly.”The relaxations came as the Scottish government’s own “test and protect” contact-tracing scheme went live on Thursday across all health board areas.Reiterating that her approach to easing restrictions was “careful and cautious” – with the R number (reinfection rate) still in the range of 0.7 to 1 – Sturgeon said that, from Friday, Scots would be able to meet with members of one other household at a time. This must happen outdoors, in a park or private gardens, while observing physical distancing, with a maximum of eight people meeting at one time. There is also a strong recommendation not to meet more than one other household per day.R, or the \u0027effective reproduction number\u0027, is a way of rating a disease’s ability to spread. It’s the average number of people on to whom one infected person will pass the virus. For an R of anything above 1, an epidemic will grow exponentially. Anything below 1 and an outbreak will fizzle out – eventually.At the start of the coronavirus pandemic, the estimated R for coronavirus was between 2 and 3 – higher than the value for seasonal flu, but lower than for measles. That means each person would pass it on to between two and three people on average, before either recovering or dying, and each of those people would pass it on to a further two to three others, causing the total number of cases to snowball over time.The reproduction number is not fixed, though. It depends on the biology of the virus people\u0027s behaviour, such as social distancing\u0026nbspand a population’s immunity. A country may see regional variations in its R number, depending on local factors like population density and transport patterns.She gave the example of those who might want to host picnics or barbecues at the weekend, saying guests from the other household should bring their own food, cutlery, plates and cups.People will be allowed to travel –\u0026nbsppreferably by walking or cycling –\u0026nbspfor recreation,\u0026nbspwith a suggested limit of five miles.\u0026nbspSitting and sunbathing in parks will be permitted, as will\u0026nbspmany\u0026nbspoutdoor non-contact sports\u0026nbspwhere physical distancing is feasible, including\u0026nbspgolf, fishing, tennis and bowls.In terms of business, most outdoor work that has been put on hold can resume and the construction industry can start site preparation.\u0026nbspGarden centres and recycling facilities\u0026nbspare also allowed to\u0026nbspreopen, while takeaway and drive-through food outlets will no longer be discouraged.\u0026nbspFrom Monday, teachers can return to schools to prepare for\u0026nbspthe start of the new school year on 11 August,\u0026nbspwhen pupils begin a “blended” model of at-home and in-school learning.\u0026nbspFrom Wednesday, childminding services and fully outdoor nurseries will begin to reopen.\u0026nbspInsisting that she “trusted the judgment of the Scottish people”, Sturgeon admitted to feeling nervous about making changes, saying: “I worry that the limited changes we are making to these rules – the very careful changes – might lead to much greater change in reality.”In particular, she urged people to change their plans if they arrived at beauty spots to find them crowded with other day-trippers over what is forecast to be a warm and sunny weekend.From Thursday, if people in Scotland develop coronavirus symptoms they must immediately book a test by phone or online and isolate themselves – the aim is for all results to be returned within 24 hours. If the test is positive, the inidual will then hear from a contact tracer who will ask them about recent face-to-face contacts, within their household or less than two metres away for 15 minutes or more."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b367f31e7e58bba68bb452594cca2bc8bcb61475/0_22_3171_1903/master/3171.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=109c3638fcdd7a7c95f5befdb2205430","title":"us funding website spreading covid 19 disinformation","story":"State Department-backed Armenian project to promote democracy instead features false informationThe US government is funding a website in Armenia which is spreading disinformation about the coronavirus pandemic, including warnings that Armenians ought to “refuse” future vaccine programmes.The website, Medmedia.am, was launched with the help of a US State Department grant meant to promote democracy, but instead has been used to promote false information about Covid-19, according to an investigation by the British news website openDemocracy.Among Medmedia’s most popular articles are pieces that have called Covid-19 a “fake pandemic” and falsely reported that a morgue offered to pay hundreds of dollars to a dead patient’s family if they claimed the death had been caused by the coronavirus.The grant was awarded by the State Department to a group called the Armenian Association of Young Doctors, which launched the website last year and is led by a controversial doctor called Gevorg Grigoryan.He has been known for his strong criticism of the government’s health ministry and its vaccine programmes, and has a history of anti-LGBT statements, including remarks posted on Facebook in 2014 in which he called for gay people to be burned.This week, the group’s official Facebook page claimed that the government led by prime minister Nikol Pashinyan, who led a nonviolent reform movement before his election, had “completely failed the fight” against coronavirus. Grigoryan said he was not aligned with a specific political party and denied that Medmedia or the fact-finding project were political fronts aimed at opposing the government.“If we look at everything from a political point of view then we’re not going to go very far,” he said. “But from an expert point of view, the statistics speak for themselves.”Armenia has reported about 7,100 coronavirus cases and a rising rate of infections. The country has also grappled with a drop in childhood vaccine rates, which the health minister, Arsen Torosyan, has blamed on anti-vaccine propaganda.The State Department declined to comment on questions about the size of the grant or its review process.A post on the US embassy’s website in Armenia said grants under the Democracy Commission Small Grants Program – which are worth up to $50,000 – are awarded on a competitive basis to local NGOs and are meant to focus on issues like transparency and accountability in governance, advancing human rights, eliminating corruption, and enhancing economic growth and development.But the openDemocracy investigation found that, while Medmedia had published some news articles, most of its opinion pieces were republished Facebook posts that spread false information.Grigoryan told the  that the US embassy in Armenia had contacted him with “concerns” about op-eds and articles on the site. But, he said: “I am sure I was able to answer all those questions and those concerns disappeared. The site is not an anti-vaccine forum.”He would not say how much money was given to his Armenian Association for Young Doctors by the US embassy, or how much of that was invested in the website. He called it a “small amount” and addressed questions on specifics to the US embassy. The grant period is due to end in several days, he said.A disclaimer on the Medmedia website said the site was US-funded but that its articles “do not necessarily reflect” the views of the US government.Asked specifically about the articles, he said that he didn’t share their opinions but said they would not be taken down. “It’s not fake news,” he said. “It’s the opinion of a specialist, the opinion of a doctor, of the head of an NGO.

The number of cases currently stands at 5,768,908.The true number of infections is likely to be much higher, however, given the vast number of unrecorded and asymptomatic cases.\u0026nbspThousands of people across the UK\u0026nbsptook part in the tenth week of Clap For Carers in what could be the last time the weekly event takes place.Annemarie Plas, the originator of the initiative, said Thursday’s nationwide applause for NHS and key workers should be the last one amid concerns the event has become politicised.Cancer patients with Covid-19 treated with a drug combination promoted by\u0026nbspUS\u0026nbspPresident Donald Trump to counter coronavirus were three times more likely to die within 30 days than those who got either drug alone, a US study found.The preliminary results suggest doctors may want to refrain from prescribing the decades-old malaria treatment hydroxychloroquine with the antibiotic azithromycin for these patients until more study is done, researchers said.Data from Johns Hopkins University shows that the\u0026nbspUnited States has recorded more than 101,000 deaths\u0026nbspfrom Covid-19, moving past a sombre milestone even as many states relax mitigation measures to stop the spread of the novel coronavirus.The US has recorded more deaths from the disease than any other country in the pandemic, and almost three times as many as the second-ranking country, Britain.A travel ban between Turkey’s worst affected cities is being lifted\u0026nbspwhile restaurants, cafes and sports facilities will reopen on 1 June, the country’s president said.Recep Tayyip Erdoğan also said public sector workers, except for those with chronic illnesses, will return to their workplaces on 1 June, while childcare facilities will be allowed to resume their services.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspUp to 20 guests can attend weddings in New South Wales, Australia, and up to 50 people can attend funerals and religious services at places of worship. However, strict social distancing guidelines would continue to apply.Premier\u0026nbspGladys Berejiklian\u0026nbspsaid: “We know how important these services are to iniduals and families but as we ease restrictions further, we must remember to keep one another safe.“It is crucial that worshippers remember to follow health advice.

However, earlier lockdown measures will still be eased in Paris, with parks in the capital due to reopen next week.Philippe said health results have been good so far as the country prepares to enter a second phase in its relaxation of lockdown rules on 2 June."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4265022.1590705599!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus universities plan to limit student access to campuses","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tStudents on the UCD campus before the pandemic. Photograph: Brenda FitzsimonsMost Irish universities are planning to limit access to campus to a few days a week for students and replace most lectures with online tuition in the new academic year.However, colleges say students will still be able to access smaller face-to-face tutorials, laboratory work and other forms of group work on campus.In addition, many are planning that students on campus will work together in “pods” or small groups to minimise physical mixing.The capacity of larger lecture theatres in many colleges cases will have to be reduced by up to 90 per cent in order to comply with 2m social-distancing requirements.University College Dublin, whose academic year is due to begin on September 21st, said it was planning to live-stream lectures, which would be physically attended by a much-reduced number of students.The university’s president, Prof Andrew Deeks, said it would seek to ensure students can use the campus “to the greatest extent possible” and that core modules would have elements delivered in person.“We are committed to delivering the best face-to-face teaching and campus experience possible within whatever restrictions apply at the time,” he said.Physical mixing between students will be minimised, with students encouraged to work in stable groups or pods when on campus.Campus activities with more than 50 people present in the same room will not be undertaken until public health guidelines allow, he added.Trinity plansTrinity College Dublin is due to announce details of the new academic year shortly, but a spokesman confirmed that it would involve moving larger lectures online and facilitating laboratory work and tutorials in small groups on campus.At Technological University Dublin, president Prof David Fitzpatrick told students there would be a a maximum of 30 per cent occupancy in lecture theatres, laboratories and other learning and social spaces. “This will have a significant impact on timetabling and the mode of delivery, and also on how you experience university life in semester one,” he said.Dublin City University said it was planning a “hybrid” of online and face-to-face classes.DCU president Brian MacCraith said while current DCU students would start on October 5th, incoming first years would be brought in two weeks earlier to take part in an orientation programmes.Maynooth University, NUI Galway, University College Cork and University of Limerick are also understood to be planned a “blended learning” approach when college reopens.In a message to students, UL president Dr Des Fitzgerald, said the university was examining the option of allowing groups of students and staff – perhaps 20 per cent – to rotate in periods of on-campus learning with periods of off-campus online delivery.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4265002.1590680154!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"covid 19 student days empty lecture theatres online learning and micro communities","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTrinity is  exploring ways of allowing freshers’ week, along with clubs and societies, to function in line with social distancing requirements.  Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillA few weeks ago. Dublin City University president Brian MacCraith requested experts to advise on how the capacity of its largest lecture theatre would be affected by social-distancing rules.“We have a 500-seat, tiered lecture theatre here,” says MacCraith.”When we measured it, we realised it would only accommodate about 50 people.”Similar restrictions apply to smaller lecture theatres and classrooms right across the campus. It has left college management with a major dilemma: how to accommodate the university’s 16,000 students come September.DCU has decided that most lectures will be replaced with online tuition. Students will most likely have limited access to the campus for a maximum of two days a week for smaller face-to-face tutorials, laboratory work and other small group activity.Many other universities across the State are planning similar measures in the new academic year with an emphasis on “blended learning”, combining online tuition with smaller group work on campus.UCD, for example, is proposing to live-stream lectures, with a reduced number of students physically present, and to organise “flipped classes” where students watch pre-recorded lectures followed by online or small group discussions.It says campus activities will be limited to no more than 50 people in a room until public health guidelines stipulate these are permissible.Trinity College Dublin says it is taking its lead from universities elsewhere in Europe by delivering larger lectures to groups more online, with smaller lectures, seminars and tutorials taking place on campus.Academics say they have been told only 20 per cent of students could be accommodated for lectures on campus.All are keen to emphasise that they are not going down the route of the University of Cambridge, which made headlines last week when it announced it is moving all its lectures and learning activity online.Clubs and societiesBut if most lectures end up behind a screen, and campus social life is dramatically curtailed, how much attraction will the idea of college hold in the new academic year?Clubs and societies and social events have always been an essential part of the university experience.It’s where students form lifelong friendships, discover themselves and find out what they’re really capable of.How, for example, would the storyline of Normal People hold up in an era of social distancing and “physical mixing” limits on campus?And then there’s the dilemma facing students of whether it’s worth their while spending thousands of euro on student accommodation if they end up doing most of their work remotely.UCD president Andrew Deeks says teaching will commence on September 21st and that face-to-face interaction will continue to be a “vital ingredient” in students’ learning journeys.“While the national response to Covid-19 continues to pose significant challenges in maintaining this experience, we will seek to ensure our students commence and continue their education in UCD accessing and using our campuses to the greatest extent possible,” he says.While physical mixing between students from different cohorts will be minimised, he says students will work in “stable groups or pods” when on campus to facilitate contact tracing, if required.The university is also planning to reopen – to the “greatest extent possible” – facilities such as the student centre, sports centre, restaurants, shops and other indoor amenity and study spaces, as well as on-campus student residences and other activities.Social lifeAt DCU, MacCraith says he is acutely aware of the need to ensure college isn’t “experienced behind a screen” and work is under way in scoping how the university’s 140 clubs and societies can continue to function.“I think it will be about creating micro-communities, organising workshops for students . . . if there’s a gig in the Helix, we’re looking at how to stream it elsewhere in the campus. It’s all about being creative and innovative.”He is particularly keen to ensure first-year students get an authentic taste of college life, which is why it has decided they will begin on September 21st – two weeks ahead of other students.University of Limerick has also signalled it will be as “accommodating as possible” for new students, while UCC says the new academic year will begin on September 28th following a “phased and gradual return to work in a safe and controlled environment”.Trinity, which is likely to reopen for undergraduate students on September 28th, has had to cancel on-campus events, but is exploring ways of allowing freshers’ week, along with clubs and societies, to function in line with social distancing requirements.The university’s provost, Patrick Prendergast, said in a recent online video that he is looking forward to walking “through our resurgent campus in the autumn, pulsating again with people and ideas”.If colleges are facing challenges dealing with social distancing requirements, it is nothing compared to the financial black hole facing the sector.Fund shortfallThe latest estimates by the Higher Education Authority are that colleges will have a €500 million shortfall due to a drop in international students and other sources of income.Colleges have also been told there is no additional funding available, at present, for the cost of implementing social distancing or boosting online teaching and learning supports.The same report also warns there is a likelihood the number of college deferrals will rise this year, due to the Covid-19 fallout.While the challenges are daunting, MacCraith says he is hopeful students will still find college to be a stimulating and exciting experience.“What students mainly want is a connection they want to be in a space where they feel they can make friends, feel connected. No student wants their college experience to be through a screen or laptop.“We’re hearing from principals and students themselves that they’re dying to get into university we’re not hearing about deferrals.“That’s why we’re bringing first years back two weeks in advance, so they can learn how to learn online, create connections with staff and tutors and form these micro-communities.”‘It sounds bleak’: Students on returning to socially distanced university\u0026nbspThe prospect of returning to college normally makes Trinity student Luke Fehily feel a tingle of anticipation.“I’ve always been enthused about seeing friends, lecturers and professors . . . but when you strip everything away, I worry that it will be almost like watching a Youtube video,” says Fehily, a final-year nanoscience student. “It all sounds a bit bleak.”The Normal People TV series, he says, now feels like a “time-capsule from another age” of what college used to be like.“It will be held up, rightly or wrongly, as the quintessential Trinity experience, just at a time when we won’t be able to able to experience it . . . It’s a time of personal growth. Lots of people say they grow most in their first few years in university – and it’s not because they’re encountering new material in class.”Christine Ní Mhathúna, who is hoping to begin a masters in human rights law in UCD in September, is concerned about having limited access to the campus.“The thing with online lectures is that you sometimes lose motivation as you don’t have a schedule and can listen to it at any time,” she says.“As I didn’t do my undergraduate in UCD, I hope the situation allows us to start back on campus in September as I want to see my new classmates, the college itself, have access to the library and be able to join societies and clubs.”Ciarán Freeman is a general nursing student in NUI Galway who says he is apprehensive about online learning.“Due to healthcare disciplines requiring instruction in many clinical skills, we will have to physically attend college for skill sessions,” he says.“Accommodation is also going to be exceptionally difficult for students, especially those in nursing and midwifery. Many rely on digs, but some families may be unwilling to house another person now, especially a student who has the risk of contracting Covid-19.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Unthinkable: Conceivable Future is fostering a personal but \u0026lsquodeeply political\u0026rsquo debateRite\u0026ampReason: A healthy planet is a prerequisite for a healthy humanityProtecting wildlife: Local says this is the third year in a row hedgerows cut at wrong time"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Antipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?Greater industry involvement required if bovine TB to be eliminated by 2030 targetMichael Viney: Camera traps are now used as a regular part of hare monitoringMarine life with very specific habitat needs threatened in the face of sweeping changeThree terrapins as pets seems a bit ambitious considering their needsThe list of causes of damage is long, making it hard to know where to startFew, if any, of Ireland\u0026rsquos mammals have evolved the ability to eat venomous creaturesGolden kelp is notably bare of other sea life, so there are concerns over its possible impactLong-term objective is to see how wildflowers are responding to changes in weather patterns and climateTime to restore meadows once full of insects and nectar in summer and spires of seeds in winterA new report shows no let-up in the loss of wildlife in Northern IrelandCorncrakes get major EU funding despite being of \u0026lsquoleast concern\u0026rsquo on Red List criteriaAs top marine predators, dolphins accumulate the most man-made toxic pollutantsGlobal warming presents potentially damaging cascades of impacts, new study finds"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4265195.1590697394!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"thursday was hottest day of year so far with 26 8 degrees recorded in roscommon","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBarbara Miranda and Thalita Quaresha, from Brazil but living in Dublin 8, pictured enjoying the fine weather at Sandycove in Dublin on Thursday afternoon.

Some rain may fall along western coastal fringes on Friday night, but no other rain is forecast for the week.Similar conditions can be expected on Saturday, Sunday and Monday. Tuesday will be slightly cooler and temperatures will fall back to normal on Wednesday next week.There is no sign at the moment of rain which is badly needed in most parts of the country.Restrictions on water will be extended on the Aran Islands from Monday.Night time restrictions have already been in place on Inis Mór and Inis Oirr for a couple of weeks. They will be extended to Inis Meain from Monday.Irish Water has stated that, as the islands’ water supply is exclusively from rain, it will have to maintain the restrictions for the coming weeks.Irish Water’s lead engineer for Galway Tim O’Connor warned that the long-range weather forecast indicates very little rain will fall in the next four weeks and restrictions are currently necessary.DroughtSince the Covid-19 lockdown, seven weather stations have experienced an “absolute drought” which is 15 consecutive days without rain. They are Claremorris, Belmullet, Phoenix Park, Dublin Airport, Newport, Dunsany, Finner Camp and Casement Aerodrome.Drought-like conditions have been most apparent in Dublin where the Phoenix Park had 42 days from March 18th to April 28th in which just 5.8mm of rain fell.Very little rain has fallen this month so far either. Just 9.5mm of rain has fallen to date the average for May in Dublin is 59.5mm. The forecast suggests no rain will fall in the capital for the foreseeable future.Irish Water has asked the public to conserve water. There has been a 20 per cent increase in household usage since the lockdown and the fall off in commercial and industrial use has not compensated for the extra domestic usage.Members of the public have been advised to exercise caution around water safety during the good weather.A five-year-old girl has been airlifted to hospital in Co Kerry on Thursday after floating a mile offshore on an inflatable lilo.The alarm was raised after the child was pulled out to sea off Littor beach on the southern shore of the Shannon estuary in north Co Kerry.A spokesman for Valentia Coast Guard said the Shannon Rescue 115 helicopter was called to the scene at 2.50pm on Thursday. The Kilrush RNLI lifeboat also attended the scene.Gorse firesMeanwhile, the Department of Agriculture has issued a status red warning for gorse fires for the duration of the bank holiday weekend. The warning arises from increased temperatures and low rainfall levels.The Irish Coastguard has reminded the public to exercise caution in the water following two call outs in West Cork on Wednesday. It warned the public that in spite of the high temperatures on land the sea is still cold.Shortly after 2pm emergency services received calls when four teenage boys got in to trouble in the water in Inchydoney.The Rescue 115 Shannon, Courtmacsherry RNLI, gardaí and the ambulance service responded.The teens were taken from the water shortly after. Two of the teenagers were suffering from hypothermia and required medical intervention.Nearly an hour later Union Hall RNLI was tasked by Valentia Coastguard amid reports that two swimmers were missing in Glandore in West Cork.In a statement Union Hall RNLI said they received a report at 3.20pm yesterday that two swimmers were missing in the area.LifeboatThe lifeboat ILB Margaret Bench of Solihull launched with three volunteer crew from Union Hall.The lifeboat commenced a search in Glandore but shortly after the two swimmers arrived into the pier. The volunteer crew were stood down and returned back to the lifeboat station at 4pm. Also on the scene were Toe HeadGlandore Coast Guard Unit.Following the call out Deputy Launch Authority Jim Moloney said it was a “false alarm with good intent.”“If you are going swimming always let someone know where you are going and what time you are due back at, and always respect the water,” he said.Kevin O’Hagan, cancer prevention manger with the Irish Cancer Society, said: “One of the simplest things you can do to protect your skin from UV rays is to stay in the shade particularly between 11am – 3pm, even on cloudy days as much as 90 per cent of UV rays can reach your skin and cause damage that can lead to skin cancer later in life.“When in Ireland wear sunscreen, SPF 30 or higher from April to September to reduce your risk of skin cancer. But remember that using sunscreen alone will not give enough protection against UV rays.“It is important to use shade, clothes and sunglasses too.

Photograph: Getty ImagesSome 800 workplace inspections, including in meat processing plants, have been carried out by the Health and Safety Authority (HSA) since the State began its first phase of reopening the country on May 18th . There had been a “high level of compliance” as part of the return-to-work safety protocol, and employers were taking a “responsible and proactive approach” to health and safety measures during the pandemic, the HSA said on Thursday, based on initial analysis. However, the authority had received seven complaints regarding four different meat processing plants up to May 20th, and was following up on the issues raised. It said it was carrying out “proactive inspections” of other meat processing plants, and that the Department of Agriculture was also checking conditions in plants. Some 103 cases of Covid-19 were reported on meat processing plants as of Tuesday, bringing to 925 the total number of cases in the sector. As a member of the National Outbreak Control Team, the authority is “working to address the issue of outbreaks in meat processing plants, and has input from professionals in public health, environmental health, animal health and ourselves in relation to occupational health and safety”, a HSA spokesman told The . He said the national and local outbreak control teams have been established to recommend steps and measures to ensure current and future outbreaks could be managed and brought under control as quickly as possible. “The authority has no role in carrying out or arranging any diagnostic tests or medical examinations relating to the personal health of iniduals in any workplace. Our role relates only to occupational health and safety in the workplace.”Minister for Agriculture Michael Creed said last week that between 55 per cent and 60 per cent of staff in meat processing plants had returned to work. He said he did not agree mistakes had been made in the sector, and that it was an evolving situation, adding that outbreak control teams had the authority to close down plants if required. Close proximityEmployees at meat plants work in prolonged close proximity to other workers, increasing the risk of transmitting the virus. The rigid production lines, often involving, for example, a conveyor belt of pig carcasses on hooks passing along a factory’s “kill line”, mean that the nature of the work is at close quarters, involving repeated activity by hundreds of staff standing shoulder to shoulder. As an essential industry producing food, meat plants were not closed during the pandemic.Among the precautions taken in meat plants to curb the spread of the virus are reduced production by processing fewer animals, staggered working shifts and staff departures and arrivals, and reconfigured production lines, including installing partitions where possible to ensure workers maintain two-metre physical distancing.The HSA said employers, workers and members of the public could access advice, guidance, templates and checklists relating to health and safety during the pandemic from the authority’s website.

Photograph: Nick BradshawIt seems everyone was in agreement with the Minister, which is unusual in Leinster House.But nobody wanted to admit it in public, which is not unusual in Leinster House.“Wonderful, a politician telling the truth!” laughed a cynical staffer, beaten down by years of having to listen to bombast and waffle. “Never said a truer word.”This praise was not directed at either of the two Ministers who reported for duty for a day of statements and questions on revised estimates for the Social Protection Budget. It was mainly statements and very little questions followed by complaints from the verbose that their questions weren’t being answered.The Ceann Comhairle kept trying to remind them their slots are strictly time-limited and if they rabbit on for too long, they leave no time for the Minister to answer. It made little difference, they can’t help themselves.The session was flagged by the Taoiseach on Wednesday as a run-of-the-mill vote to ensure the continuation of existing Covid-19 payments after June 8th by approving supplementary funds for the Department of Social Protection. As for how long they will continue, that’s a separate but serious bone of contention.“I don’t understand why it will take six hours given that it is a straightforward, no-policy change, Supplementary Estimate,” he told the Dáil.If Leo Varadkar didn’t understand that then he doesn’t understand his fellow politicians, who operate by their own variation of Parkinson’s Law – Talk (instead of work) expands to fill the time available to do it.The sitting was broken into three slabs of two-hour sessions, with Minister for Social Protection Regina Doherty appearing first and last, and Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe piggy in the middle.‘Fair play’But neither of them was the Minister fielding friendly greetings of “Fair play to ya!” in the corridors on Thursday afternoon.That was John Halligan, recently retired TD and reluctant Minister still doing his departmental duties, who cheered the incarcerated unfortunates in Leinster House on the hottest day of the year with radio comments about political collegiality and government formation.“If you want my honest opinion – I’ll be devoured for saying this. I regularly speak to people from Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael and so on. Fianna Fáil can’t stand Fine Gael essentially and Fine Gael can’t stand Fianna Fáil essentially, none of them can stand the Green Party so what’s this all about?” he told RTÉ’s Sarah McInerney.Back in Kildare Street, people silently cheered, and deputies from the two bigger parties laughed when asked about Halligan’s assessment. None disputed it. “Nail. Head. Bang,” smirked one.“He failed to complete the circle - all those in Fianna Fáil who hate each other and all those in Fine Gael who hate each other,” said another.But anything is possible when power is up for grabs, John.Back in the day, sworn enemies Dessie O’Malley, former Fianna Fáil big gun turned Progressive Democrat leader, and Fianna Fáil taoiseach Charlie Haughey did the unthinkable and went into coalition together.Mutual dislike and suspicion is no bar to unlikely political union.Away from the chamber, members of the negotiating teams from the putative government partners flitted in and out, carrying armloads of files and sustenance from the small pop-up takeaway cafe operating in the Oireachtas canteen.Cards are being played very close to chests. Leaking is not happening with the sort of regularity or volume normally enjoyed by attending journalists.How are things progressing? “Constructive and ongoing.” “Ongoing and constructive.”Time is beginning to drag.Overgrown hairstyle competitionAt least there were a lot of exciting entries in the very competitive Most Overgrown Hairstyle of the Day competition.Fianna Fáil’s deputy leader, Dara Calleary, walked away with the honours for his expanding cushion of curls. Such well-defined curls too. He was getting lots of compliments.“I put gel in it this morning,” he sheepishly confessed. “I had to. Somebody told me yesterday I looked like Bernard Durkan.”There was a brief frisson of excitement amid fears Regina Doherty was lost in the space-time continuum while being teleported from the Dáil chamber to a committee room in the basement of the adjoining Leinster House 2000 building. This had to happen because she used up her allotted two hours in the chamber and was barred from entering it for the rest of the day.The Covid rules in the Dáil are on a different level from the ones governing ordinary folk. If somebody were to make a television programme about practising their restrictive regime it would be called “Extreme Distancing” and feature scarily needy people willing to do anything to get on telly.But Regina finally swam into view on the two big screens above the Ceann Comhairle’s head. “We need to get you a little closer to the microphone, Minister,” he told her in a sentence never before spoken to a government minister, or politician of any stripe for that matter.Unelected making decisionsThe Minister, who lost her seat in the election but, as in the case of John Halligan, is constitutionally obliged to continue in office, was informed by a number of Opposition TDs that they didn’t think it right that an unelected inidual should be making policy decisions or addressing them in their hallowed forum. She told them in no uncertain terms she is acting in accordance with the Constitution and will do her job to the best of her ability for as long as required.Áontu’s Peadar Tóibín was one of them. It was nothing personal, he said, before declaring the Dáil had turned into “a democratic twilight zone”.Sinn Féin’s Dessie Ellis was fuming. “With a caretaker government behaving in an almost cavalier manner and with unelected iniduals holding ministerial positions making decisions for us with a minimum of scrutiny and accountability, how can we expect anything but more of the same?” he thundered in a slightly confused manner, roaring at the rows of vacant Fine Gael seats before remembering to look up and roar at the woman smiling down at him from high on the back wall of the chamber.Independent TD Catherine Murphy has been struggling with the over-the-top operational changes.“This is the third time this week I find myself talking to a very nice set of curtains and a couple of television screens and it doesn’t feel any better the more I do it,” she sighed before asking about housing assistance payments and maternity benefit.“I agree that this set-up is weird, but life is a bit weird at the moment. I would be grateful if this were the least of our worries,” replied the Cabinet Minister who isn’t a TD to a sitting of the Dáil while sitting on her own in a room far away.“Minister, you look like you’re about to deliver the votes of the Swedish jury at the Eurovision,” said Labour’s Ged Nash, acknowledging the somewhat surreal nature of the proceedings. “So I hope that Louth gets douze points.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4264754.1590662321!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"the momentum behind calls to ease lockdown may become irresistible for politicians","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Minister for Health Simon Harris at a media breifing. File photograph: Leon FarrellPhotocall IrelandThe pressure to accelerate the reopening of Ireland is growing it is audible on the airwaves, and on the streets, where the hum of traffic grows slowly but steadily louder.It is heard in the highest councils of the land yesterday Dr Tony Holohan, the chief medical adviser to the Government and architect of Ireland’s strict lockdown, heard submissions from Cabinet ministers in a private meeting which suggested he might change his recommendation that social distancing be defined as keeping two metres between persons, rather than one metre, as some favour. He declined.It is heard in the Dáil, where opposition leaders, including Micheál Martin and Alan Kelly, called for aspects of the lockdown to be eased.It is a view that is becoming prevalent in and around Government.It is also a mark of success. In the early phase of the fight against the virus, when the country looked in horror at what was happening in Northern Italy and feared the same would happen here, Minister for Health Simon Harris said repeatedly that politicians would not make the decisions about how Ireland responded – public health experts would. He was widely praised for his approach and that approach, notwithstanding the difficulties in nursing homes, has been successful.But now as people increasingly chafe under the lockdown and impatiently regard the proposed slow and cautious relaxation of the restrictions, as the economy calcifies and the public finances crater, the decision-making matrix is shifting. When the country feared a Bergamo-style fate, public health considerations were the only consideration. That having been avoided, minimising damage to society now requires the inclusion of other considerations, insiders say.That is the job of the Cabinet, which is still, after all, the ultimate decision making forum for the country.They may want Tony Holohan to give them some cover – which he seems, so far, disinclined to do on the two metres anyway – but it is properly the job of ministers acting collectively to weigh up the considerations and consequences and decide whether to ease the lockdown or not. There is a growing sense around government that if the impressive suppression of the virus continues, that accelerating the lockdown is on the way.In another week, the momentum may be irresistible. Either way, it is the Government’s job to decide."},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Move paves way for anti-sedition laws which rights advocates say will threaten city\u0026rsquos freedomsAt least 69 cases this week linked to cluster of infections at logistics facilityThousands take to streets to oppose Beijing-backed laws curtailing city\u0026rsquos freedomsMove to impose security law illustrates Beijing\u0026rsquos increasing tendency to flex its muscleProtesters get ready for more demonstrations against proposed Beijing lawsCommissioner in territory says contentious new security law aimed at \u0026lsquotroublemakers\u0026rsquoPM has made most of her communication skills and the country\u0026rsquos political cultureCian English (19), from Carlow, died following fall from Gold Coast apartmentChina proposes path to imposing rules used against dissidents on the mainlandPolice fire tear gas in popular shopping district as protesters take to the streets\u0026lsquoThere is a political virus spreading in United States,\u0026rsquo says China\u0026rsquos foreign ministerWinds gusting up to 210kmh expected near iron ore producing heartland of the PilbaraInvestigation begins into cause of Pakistan International Airlines crash that killed 97Officials confirm two survivors after PIA aircraft crashes in residential area of KarachiOutrage among pro-democracy legislators at security law put forward at National People\u0026rsquos CongressRescue teams hampered by torn-down power lines and flooding over large tracts of landPro-Beijing politicians are pushing contentious laws in the face of intense oppositionCyclone Amphan moving inland with gusts of up to 185kmh, says India met serviceSuper cyclone Amphan, with winds up to 160kmh, expected to hit India\u0026rsquos coast on WednesdayRules to be relaxed in areas with low numbers of infection, according to governmentStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"Former cabinet minister Saad al-Jabri was strategic architect of Saudi counter-terrorism effortsPrime minister claims allegations are a \u0026lsquodeep-state\u0026rsquo, left-wing political witch-huntLong-serving politician will become first sitting prime minister in Israel\u0026rsquos history to stand trialPA president cites imminent threat of Israeli annexation of parts of the West BankFirebomb attack on home claimed the lives of a couple and their 18-month-old sonWHO forecasts coronavirus will kill 42,000 and infect most of 28 million populationRival Gantz to take over as prime minister of Israeli unity government after 18 monthsAshraf Ghani to lead country as rival Abdullah Abdullah oversees Taliban peace process, sources sayCeremony will end political deadlock that has dragged on for more than 500 daysArab and foreign jihadis ambush military convoys and assassinate officials as Baghdad and Damascus try to contain coronavirusThree men captured west of Caracas are the latest \u0026lsquoterrorists\u0026rsquo arrestedAt least 24 killed by suicide bomber in separate attack in Afghanistan on TuesdayAccident in which 15 wounded takes place during training exercise in Gulf of OmanFormation of coalition to proceed after supreme court clears way for PM to remain in officePolitics and ision facilitate virus in country with just 208 ventilators and scant testingPresident fears country\u0026rsquos 44 cases and three deaths could \u0026lsquosuddenly spike in few days or weeks\u0026rsquoResidents in Mosul, still traumatised by violence, fear a resurgence of the terror groupRuling against Likud chief would likely trigger snap election, the fourth since April 2019Accelerating economic meltdown has left country\u0026rsquos poorest without work and incomeStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com\"/polopoly_fs/1.4192672!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_940/image.jpg","title":"us democratic","story":"The process to choose the Democratic nominee to take on Donald Trump in November’s US presidential election is well under way.States across the country are in the process of choosing\u0026nbsptheir preferred candidate, either through a primary contest or a caucus.

A caucus is a public process which sees voters align publicly with their chosen candidate at caucus sites.Based roughly on their share of the vote in each state - states have different rules -\u0026nbspcandidates are assigned a number of “delegates”, which will be sent to represent each state at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in July.On March 3rd – Super Tuesday – 14 states and one overseas territory voted. After a faltering start to the primaries that almost saw him written off, former vice-president Joe Biden got his campaign firmly on track with victory in nine states.

The final primary contest takes place on June 7th.

Tired of the relentless negativity of the news cycle? Bored of endlessly cynical mainstream broadcasters?Then this is the podcast you’ve been looking for: Planet Normal - because some journalists are normal people too.Yet Pearson and Halligan have much in common. They both boast high-level political access – and lace politics into their writing, although rarely from a “Westminster village” perspective. They both have older children and, unlike so many London-centric journalists, live outside the M25.What unites them, above all, is that Pearson and Halligan are staunchly and proudly “normal” – both hailing from unflashy, proletarian, non-professional backgrounds, the first in their respective families to go to university. That’s one reason they share a reputation for shrewd political analysis and trend-spotting - knowing in their bones, often before the Westminster crowd, how “ordinary people” think.“You know that moment when you’re watching a TV panel discussion and finally – finally! – someone says something you agree with,” says Pearson. “That’s what Planet Normal is all about!”Pearson and Halligan have between them spent almost forty years penning national newspaper columns, winning countless awards for their writing and broadcasting. They both feel strongly that the media is now far less representative of the broader UK population than when they started out.“It’s become much harder in recent years for people from ordinary backgrounds to break into high-end journalism,” says Halligan. “We\u0027ve made progress in terms of gender and ethnic ersity, but there’s now far less ersity in terms of opinion – with much of the broadcast media, in particular, dominated by privileged insiders holding the same approved views”.Planet Normal is a small but spirited attempt to counter that. In their 30-minute weekly podcast, Pearson and Halligan will review the news in the same sharp, irreverent, down-to-earth style they bring to their writing. The emphasis will be on calling out pomposity, lifting the lid on reality and countering political spin.And, on their trips to Planet Normal, Pearson and Halligan will be bringing along fabulous guests for the ride, representing all parts of the news cosmos – from politics to showbiz, from finance to culture – while responding to questions from Planet Normal listeners.Planet Normal - because some journalists are normal people too.To make sure you never miss an episode, subscribe on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Pocket Casts, or search \u0027Planet Normal\u0027 on your podcast app.Join Liam Halligan and Allison Pearson in the comments section of this article at 1pm (BST) today to discuss their new podcast and more.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"shops opening june","story":"Boris Johnson has announced that high-street shops, department stores and shopping centres will be allowed to reopen on June 15 as part of the Government\u0027s three-stage plan to ease lockdown measures. The Prime Minister stressed that this will be \u0027contingent on progress in the fight against coronavirus\u0027, and that retailers will have to demonstrate their premises are \u0027Covid-secure\u0027 before they are allowed to reopen. The June 15 reopening date is dependent on the Government continuing to meet the \u0027five tests\u0027 laid out for easing lockdown - not overwhelming the NHS, a sustained fall in deaths, reducing the rate of infections, ensuring PPE and test supplies can be met, and being confident that adjustments would not risk a second peak.Outdoor markets and car showrooms are permitted to reopen on June 1, with Mr Johnson saying that social distancing is generally easier in these settings because of their more spacious nature.Shops planning to reopen such as Marks \u0026amp Spencer and Ikea have already said that they will impose restrictions on the numbers of customers entering their stores and that close-contact services such as clothes fitting and make-up are to remain suspended until further notice. Hairdressers, nail bars and beauty salons, pubs, clubs and restaurants will, however, remain closed until at least July, because the Government says the risk of transmission is higher because of greater person-to-person contact over longer periods.It is unclear just how many retailers will be opening their doors in June, but this is what we know so far. A: John Lewis stores in Poole and Kingston will be the first to reopen on June 15  followed by another 11 sites later that week. The stores at Bluewater, Cambridge, Cheadle, Cheltenham, High Wycombe, Horsham, Ipswich, Norwich, Nottingham, Solihull and Welwyn will welcome customers back on Thursday 18 June. Debenhams will be reopening  90 of its stores  in England on June 15. A further 40 outlets in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are set to open at a later date. Frasers Group which includes  Sports Direct, Jack Wills, Game and House of Fraser  have indicated they are planning to reopen on June 15 and say they have been  preparing to reopen  as many as 800 UK stores on Monday, June 1.  Currys have already opened 19 of its stores since May 22 on a drive-through, collection only basis. Customers are asked to place their order online before driving and parking at one of the open outlets. Once they have confirmed through email their arrival, a staff member will then load the boot of the car with the purchased product. Ikea is set to open  19 stores on June 1 with outlets in Croydon, Greenwich, Lakeside, Wembley, Tottenham, Norwich collection point, Birmingham, Nottingham, Belfast, Manchester, Warrington, Gateshead, Leeds, Sheffield, Milton Keynes, Reading, Southampton, Bristol and Exeter.Halfords will fully reopen 53 of its outlets  on Friday, May 29 after successfully trialing social-distancing measures on its shop floors. Branches in Gloucester, Huddersfield, Inverness and North Shields are just some of the sites expected to  reopen. Greggs have announced they are hoping to open around 800 of its stores in the middle of June.Waterstones have not indicated whether they will be joining the other retailers on June 15 but have said they will place any books that are touched by browsing customers in a 72 hour quarantine.  Its warehouse is currently operating with a reduced workforce, and click and collect services remain suspended for the time being.Boots will open their beauty counters on June 15. The pharmacy chain has remained open throughout the lockdown due to its status as an essential business, providing medication to people during the pandemic.A: The Government has issued fresh guidance to staff and shop owners for preventative measures that should be in place in stores to reduce the transmission of the virus. Mr Johnson said that non-essential retail would  open on June 15 provided the five tests are still being met, and shops have been made Covid-secure.Shoppers should expect to wait in queues outside as many stores will be limiting the number of entrances they have open and imposing a restriction on the number of customers entering at any one time. John Lewis have said that fitting rooms will remain closed until further notice. Returned stock will be separated from other items for 72 hours - in line with government guidance - and the use of escalators and lifts is also to be restricted. Perspex protective screens at checkouts will be in place at Boots, with counters and tills covered to reduce virus transmission. There will be a triage system in place to meet the different needs of customers, whilst testers and face-to-face beauty consultations will operate via video for the forseeable future to adhere with social distancing.Ikea will initially be operating with reducing opening hours, and wardens will be patrolling aisles in Ikea and Boots to ensure that distances of two metres are being kept to by customers.Other steps that could be taken include virtual queuing, returns drop boxes, and enabling collection of online orders from car parks. A number of retailers will only operate on a click-and-collect basis to begin with.A: Whilst public gatherings of more than two people have been banned, the Government has made an exception for those who live together.This means that parents who are unable to leave children at home whilst they shop for essentials can take them with them to the supermarket.From June 1, the restrictions will change and public gatherings of up to six people will be allowed, although the Prime Minister has stressed that minimising contact with others is still the best way to avoid transmission of the virus.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"absurd blame dominic cummings fact lockdown fraying","story":"I am sure that David Jamieson, West Midlands Police and Crime Commissioner, is telling the truth when he says that gobby party-goers, street-racers and the like are trying to excuse their breaches of lockdown by telling officers: “If it’s okay for Cummings it’s okay for us.” It is a natural reaction for anyone who has been caught red-handed to cling to whatever defence they can, however desperate.But no, it doesn’t mean that Cummings’s 260 mile drive to Durham has precipitated a collapse in lockdown. Lockdown was fraying anyway, and for good reason.Covid-19 cases and deaths are in sharp retreat. People can see that, and they can see, too, that the rest of Europe is relaxing its rules. The sun is shining, as it has done for much of the past 10 weeks when people have been cooped up in small, gardenless flats.People are starting to feel that they have done their bit. They cannot see for the life of them why they haven’t been allowed to meet friends and relatives more than one at a time, even if they observe a distance of two metres. They cannot understand why virtually every other European country has its shops open and we do not, why bars are opening elsewhere but have not done so here.They may also remember how the Chief Medical Officer, right at the beginning of this crisis, said that if lockdown measures had to be introduced, it would be for the shortest period possible – because if they were introduced too soon people would tire of them before they had done their work. It is plain that lockdown rules have done their work (or quite possibly that the epidemic has declined of its own accord), and yet we have a Government which has been dragging its heels over every minor relaxation.Shops were possibly going to reopen from June 1 now it’s June 15. Schools, too, were supposed to reopen next Monday now, it seems, many will stay shut. In three months, our Government has gone from being the most entrepreneurial-minded in Europe, the one which turned its nose up at the EU’s precautionary principle, to the most nervy, lily-livered administration on the continent. So it is hardly surprising that people are beginning to drift back to their normal lives. The Government followed public opinion into lockdown and now it is following it out.All through the Covid-19 crisis the public has had an ambivalent attitude towards the rules. True, there have been many people who have stuck to them religiously – the people, indeed, who are now most upset with Cummings’s behaviour. But the rest of us?Earlier this month, a market research company, Decision Technology, had the crafty idea of polling two sets of people with the question: have you left the house over the past two weeks for non-essential purposes? In the first group, who were each asked to give their name, just 3 per cent said yes. But in the other group, which was asked anonymously, it swelled to 29 per cent.So if Cummings broke the rules, he is in good company. We have become a nation of moralists, happy to snitch on others for breaking the rules, but prepared to interpret those rules rather more loosely when it comes to ourselves.Another survey suggested that one in five people have broken lockdown to have sex with someone in a household other than their own – a far more blatant potential breach than travelling in search of childcare or for a walk in a riverside town. Were they all inspired by Neil Ferguson? I doubt it – I suspect most were doing it before his assignment was revealed.People will clap for the NHS, but they are a lot more ambivalent when it comes to making their own sacrifices. Doctors in Sheffield have been piloting their own track and trace scheme for the past few weeks – but have found that two thirds of people who were asked to self-isolate after coming into contact with an infected person failed to do so.But hey, let’s all blame someone else for that sneaky picnic we had with our old friends or for popping down to our weekend cottage. We were law-abiding until Cummings corrupted us, honest guv. Or rather, he is a very convenient punchbag when we feel embarrassed about own failures to live up to the rules.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"britain leads international condemnation new hong kong security","story":"The British government has led international condemnation of China’s imposition of a national security law on Hong Kong and said that if China presses ahead with putting the law in place, the UK would change the status of British National Overseas (BNO) passport holders to allow them to come to the UK for longer than 6 months, creating a pathway to citizenship.Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the law undermines the principles of ‘two countries one system’ and threatens human rights.“In relation to BNO passport holders, currently they only have the right to come to the UK for six months,” he said. “If China continues down this path and implements this national security legislation, we will change that status. And we will remove that six-month limit and allow those BNO passport holders to come to the UK and to apply to work and study for extendable periods of 12 months and that will itself provide a pathway to future citizenship.”Mr Raab joined his Australian, Canadian and US counterparts in issuing a joint statement on Thursday strongly criticising Beijing’s decision.But the statement stopped short of calling for any concrete measures to be taken against China by the international community.It came after China’s parliament approved the new security law, making it a crime to undermine Beijing’s authority in the territory. Hong Kong activists fear it will end the city’s special autonomy and freedoms, paving the way for officials to suppress dissent under the guise of national security.Chris Patten, Britain’s last governor in Hong Kong, told the  that the UK needs to “get real” about “aggressive, bullying, wicked” China and review every aspect of its political, economic and cultural relations with the Communist state.He said: “In my judgement I hope that the British Government - Boris Johnson and Dominic Raab - press for the outrageous assault on Hong Kong’s freedom and breach of Chinese obligations are put on the agenda when the G7 meets in June.“And I hope that they will associate themselves with attempts by the US to get the issue of Hong Kong’s treatment raised in the security council. The Chinese state wants to destroy liberal democracy. President Xi Jinping has been clear from the beginning that he wants to make Chinese communism dominant around the world.”In their joint statement Mr Raab, Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne, Canadian Foreign Minister François-Philippe Champagne, and United States Secretary of State Michael Pompeo, said the new legislation “would curtail the Hong Kong people’s liberties” and “dramatically erode Hong Kong’s autonomy and the system that made it so prosperous”.The statement added: “China’s decision . . . lies in direct conflict with its international obligations under the principles of the legally-binding, UN-registered Sino-British Joint Declaration. The proposed law would undermine the One Country, Two Systems framework. It also raises the prospect of prosecution in Hong Kong for political crimes, and undermines existing commitments to protect the rights of Hong Kong people.”Asked what action the British government might take Mr Raab later added: “We want to wait and see the details of the legislation. In the meantime we urge China to step back from the brink and live up to its responsibilities as a leading member of the international community. And we’ll obviously be in close contact with all of our international partners around the world about what steps to take next.”He also said Britain would give British passport holders in Hong Kong more rights to live and work in the UK, in case they had to flee.“If China continues down this path and implements this national security legislation we will . . .  allow those BNO passport holders to come to the UK and to apply to work and study for extendable periods of 12 months and that would itself provide a pathway to future citizenship,” he said.Britain, Australia, Canada and the US also accused China’s actions of threatening to undermine the international efforts to tackle the coronavirus pandemic by opening up rifts within the international community.The four governments called on China to work with the government and people of Hong Kong to find “a mutually acceptable accommodation that will honour China’s international obligations”.The approval of the national security law sparked a new wave of anti-mainland protests in Hong Kong this week, with police firing pepper ball rounds, using water cannons and arresting hundreds of demonstrators. “It is quite clear that Hong Kong’s autonomy and freedom is dead and gone,” said Ted Hui Chi-fung, a pro-democracy politician in Hong Kong. “I personally expect more arbitrary arrest of dissidents, longer detention of protesters before trial, criminalisation of any foreign contact from Hong Kong democrats and activists.”The joint statement came a day after Mr Pompeo announced that Hong Kong would no longer be treated as autonomous from mainland China under US law, a provision that has given it a special trade relationship allowing it to flourish into a global financial centre. Beijing\u0027s move has led to growing calls in the UK for the government to take a much tougher approach on China.“The West needs to wake up and realise Hong Kong is just a stepping stone in a much more aggressive foreign policy for China, whether it’s through China’s alliances or its high tech infrastructure investment around the world,” said former defence minister Tobias Ellwood MP. “This is just a prelude to more to come, with a dominant China flouting international law.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"cannot leave childrens safety hands mark zuckerberg","story":"In 2017 a change in the law came into force that gave police the tools to frustrate groomers and act to protect children online. Following an NSPCC campaign, the offence of Sexual Communication with a Child made it illegal for an adult to send a sexual message to a child. Data released today shows there were over 10,000 of these grooming crimes in the first two and a half years of the law being in place. Over half of these involved Facebook-owned apps.The picture is sadly very clear. Groomers are able to exploit the poor design choices of tech firms to target children with sexual messages. They are being coerced into sharing nude images and videos or sometimes to appear on livestreams with offenders watching. Images created by this grooming process are often shared online and make up a significant number of child abuse images in circulation.The risk of abuse online – like the risk of abuse and neglect in the home – has been exacerbated by the pandemic. We are seeing a perfect storm. Increasing numbers of children isolated and lonely and spending more time online, are being exposed to harmful content and being targeted by abusers.  The National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children released data showing that online child abuse reports were 400 per cent higher in April than the same month last year. The Internet Watch Foundation reported there were at least 8.8 million attempts to access Child Sexual Abuse Imagery during a single four-week period.These aren’t new issues. Covid-19 has exposed once and for all, the years of industry inaction and failure to design basic child protection into their platforms. This is a child protection crisis fuelled by a public health emergency, but caused by the failure of self-regulation. Last week at a virtual Hidden Harms roundtable, I shared my fears about the preventable harm children face online with the Prime Minister. I shared the words of a mother whose 12-year-old Freya was subject to online abuse through sexual messages and videos: “Our children should be safe in their bedrooms, but they’re not. They should be safe from messages from strangers if their accounts are on private, but they’re not.”I also asked the Prime Minister to get on with delivering a world-leading Online Harms Bill. This would enforce a Duty of Care on platforms to keep children safe, requiring tough consequences if they fail, to deliver on his Government’s promise to make our country the safest place in the world for young people to be online. If we needed a further reminder of industry indifference to child safety, just this week Facebook took another step closer to rolling out end-to-end encryption of its messaging services. This despite a rebellion from shareholders and warnings from child protection organisations and experts across the globe that encryption without guaranteed safeguards will engineer away the ability to prevent grooming and child abuse images being shared. Mark Zuckerberg himself admitted that end-to-end encryption would allow bad people to do bad things on his sites. On Instagram, for example, which so many of our children enjoy. If his cavalier disregard for preventing child abuse and harmful content tells us anything it’s that we can’t leave our children’s safety in the hands of Silicon Valley. That’s why I’m calling on the Prime Minister today to commit to having an Online Harms Bill on the statute book within 18 months. I was greatly encouraged by his support for tough new regulation last week. Now is the time to get regulation done and hold the tech giants financially and criminally accountable to UK law.  More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"emily maitlis overstepped mark says bbc new statement cummings","story":"The BBC has doubled down on its censure of Emily Maitlis by saying she had “overstepped the mark” in her Newsnight monologue, after the corporation was flooded with complaints about her treatment.Initially, the BBC released a short statement saying the presenter had breached impartiality rules. The public reprimand left Ms Maitis so upset that she asked to be dropped from Wednesday night’s programme.By Thursday afternoon, at least 20,000 people had contacted the BBC to complain. Some were objecting to Ms Maitlis’s speech, but the majority are thought to have been criticising the BBC’s handling of the affair. Supporters had circulated a link on social media to the BBC complaints website.Colleague of Ms Maitlis were also in “uproar” over the reprimand.In a response that threatens to inflame the situation further, the BBC released a lengthy explanation for its actions. The broadcaster said: “Our editorial guidelines allow us to make professional judgments but not to express opinion.“The iding line can be fine, but we aim to say so if we think we have overstepped the mark.It said Ms Maitlis’s introduction “risked giving the perception that the BBC was taking sides and expressing an opinion, rather than being impartial.”Ms Maitlis had asserted that: “Dominic Cummings broke the rules. The country can see that and it’s shocked the Government cannot.” She added that people who had stuck to the rules now felt like “fools”.The BBC said: “But there are some who do not share this opinion, nor think that the issue is a ‘scandal’ or the Prime Minister has displayed ‘blind loyalty’.“By presenting a matter of public and political debate as if the country was unanimous in its view, we consider Newsnight risked giving the perception that the BBC was taking sides. It added: “Our audiences hold the BBC in high trust, not least because we hold ourselves to exacting standards, and we do not want to forfeit this by ignoring our own rules.”The statement insisted that “this is not a question of apportioning blame to anyone”. But it is likely to infuriate Newsnight colleagues who believe Ms Maitlis was vindicated by the police statement on Mr Cummings’ trip to Barnard Castle.The matter will now be investigated formally by the BBC’s executive complaints unit - raising the possibility that Ms Maitlis may end up being cleared of a rule breach.Maitlis confirmed that she had “asked for the night off” from Wednesday’s programme, dismissing reports that the BBC had replaced her with another presenter.Sources within the BBC said there is a great deal of anger over the decision by the BBC News department, led by Fran Unsworth, to issue the statement.They argued that Newsnight is not a straight news programme in the mould of the Six O’Clock or 10 O’Clock bulletins but falls in the greyer area of current affairs and discussion, and that Andrew Neil was allowed to deliver provocative monologues on his political shows.John Sweeney, who reported for Newsnight and Panorama before leaving the BBC last year, said that the BBC’s new director-general must “end the chasm” between current affairs and news.One Conservative MP, Daniel Kawczynski, said Maitls’s “aggressive” interviewing style meant Newsnight would struggle to book Tory MPs and ministers in future.Daniel Kawczynski said he had declined to appear on Tuesday’s edition of the show and likened appearing on Newsnight to “entering a bullring”, with interviews akin to a “bloodsport”.On Twitter, he described Maitlis as “extraordinarily aggressive, unnecessarily rude, biased and confrontational to the point of intimidation”.He later told the : “Colleagues will not go on to news channels like Newsnight where it’s more of a theatrical bloodsport than the sensible exchange of views.“This programme, I hope and expect, will wither on the vine because as they fail to get guests more and more people will turn off. If you’re a backbench MP you also have your constituents to think about.

In Malta, they were arrested upon arrival and subsequently released without charge.Another of those involved is Andy Furness, a former RAF crewman who spent 26 years in the military before, serving until 2011.Mr. Furness is now CEO of Amber Tiger, an aviation company based in Cheltenham.

Just 21 per cent reported symptoms on the actual day of testing.Likewise for people who reported a symptom on the day of the swab test, only 2.6 per cent were actually found to have coronavirus.  Latest government testing figures also show that just 1.5 per cent of people are currently testing positive for the virus even though most are reporting symptoms.The findings suggest that the government’s test, track and trace policy will fail to pick up at least seven in 10 cases and most people who suffer symptoms will not actually have the virus.Commenting on the new figures, Prof Kevin McConway, Emeritus Professor of Applied Statistics, The Open University, said:  “Most people who tested positive, about 70 per cent of them, did not report any symptoms at all. “There here are potential implications for the effectiveness of tracking and tracing the contacts of people with symptoms, if high numbers of infected people don’t actually have symptoms anyway, or if many people with symptoms don’t actually have the infection.”The results are based on the 885 iniduals who took part in the ongoing Covid-19 Infection Survey run by the ONS and University of Oxford. Peter Benton, Director of Population and Public Policy Operations at the ONS said, that it was crucial to continue social distancing if so many people are infected without realising.“We don’t know what that means about whether they are infectious, but my advice would be that if it is the case that 70 per cent of people who test positive are asymptomatic then it’s important to continue social distancing.”The new results also show that 6.78 per cent of the population has tested positive for the virus, suggesting one in 15 people has been infected in England and Wales or nearly 3.8 million people.It means that infection has around a one per cent average mortality rate, which is close to the 0.9 per cent estimated by Imperial College in March. Separate ONS testing from 10,000 households suggests that between May 11 and May 24 an average of 133,000 people had coronavirus at any given time. The number of new infections is currently at 54,000 a week or nearly 8,000 a day meaning that one in 1,000 people will be infected every seven days. Prof Daniel Altmann, Professor of Immunology, Imperial College London, said: “The level of infections in the community continues to rumble along at a low level. “In terms of assessing your behaviour and risk-management as we shift out of lockdown, this means that, on average, every time you’re in a crowd of 400-500 people (such as a rush-hour tube platform), one person may be unknowingly shedding virus. “You may want to keep some distance in case they’re the person pressed right up next to you.”Experts said the new results showed that there had not been a hidden iceberg of infections, and certainly not enough in the community to build herd immunity without a vaccine. However Sir Patrick Vallance warned that there was still a risk of infection in the community and that the country should be prepared for local outbreaks. “Numbers are coming down at the moment but they are not coming down fast,” he told the daily press briefing.  “We are in a fragile state.“It’s worth remembering that we still have a significant burden of infection, we are still seeing new infections everyday.“There is not a lot of room to do things and things need to be done cautiously step by step and monitored and the test and trace system needs to be effective to manage that.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"20 minute test offers britons hope summer holidays abroad","story":"Britons could have to take 20-minute coronavirus tests before arriving at the airport under proposals being considered by ministers as part of a bid to enable holidays abroad this summer. An expert committee of scientists, ministers, civil servants and aviation chiefs is considering tests that would enable travellers to sidestep quarantine and could be used to replace travel restrictions.They are also working on “travel corridors” to link the UK to low-risk destinations by air, land and sea as the most immediate way to lift the 14-day quarantines for holidays before the end of the summer.The 14-day quarantine for all international arrivals to the UK - including returning Britons - is due to be introduced on June 8 requiring them to self-isolate for 14 days.It will be reviewed by June 29, which is seen by ministers as a potential first date to open up “air corridors” and trial coronavirus tests, although the aviation industry is pressing for a quicker start.Matt Hancock, the Health Secretary, said he was “a little more optimistic” about reviving foreign travel this summer.Asked if people could now hope for a July holiday abroad, he said: “I absolutely wouldn’t rule it out. We’ve got to proceed cautiously… I definitely wouldn’t say no and I know how important it is for so many people.”Greece and Iceland already offer coronavirus tests to arriving travellers with results returned within 24 hours, enabling them to avoid quarantine. Vienna airport offers a similar service for £166 (€190) with test results back in half an hour.A Department for Transport source said: “What is being mooted is a mutually recognised test where a foreign businessman, say, has a test a day before flying that is accredited. It could enable people to travel but maintain public health.”The other option being considered is to screen at the airport before flights although there are concerns about the practicality and potential delays if passenger numbers increase.Emirates, Dubai’s state-owned carrier, trialled a swab test for passengers on one of its flights to Tunisia last month. Their results were returned within 10 minutes, enabling the coronavirus checks to be completed during check-in.The moves come amid growing criticism of quarantine as nearly 80 leading names in the tourist industry and a cross-party group of 40 MPs, including seven former ministers, urged the Government on Wednesday to ditch the “unworkable” plans.The same day Boris Johnson told MPs he wanted to have as sensible a quarantine scheme as possible and to keep flows as generous as we can. The Prime Minister indicated air bridges could be implemented by the end of June, providing the UK reached agreements with countries deemed to be low-risk.“There is certainly a willingness in Government to try to do as much for this summer as is safe,” said a Department for Transport (DfT) source.Greece, Spain, Italy, Portugal and Germany are expected to have lifted border and quarantine restrictions for tourists by mid-June so that most holiday travel could open up in July.A new internationally agreed set of standards for “safe” post-coronavirus travel is being drawn up by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) which would cover the conditions for “travel corridors” or “air bridges” between countries.This would include the transmission rates expected of participating countries,  the defences each country would have to have in place to combat coronavirus infections and the health measures expected during travel to minimise the risk of catching the disease.Karen Dee, chief Executive of the Airport Operators’ Association, said the guidelines offered the chance for the Government to introduce air and travel corridors at the same time as it imposed quarantine on June 8.“Our neighbours and key trading partners are taking steps to lift their blanket travel restrictions such as quarantine requirements towards a science-led, risk-based approach. The UK now needs to do the same as soon as possible, or risk being left behind,” she told The Daily . “With European guidelines ensuring there is a common standard for health measures to protect air passengers and staff, the right conditions are in place to open up air corridors to many of our European neighbours as soon as quarantine restrictions come in place on June 8. “This would benefit not just aviation but also the thousands of businesses and millions of jobs that depend on air connectivity, such as in tourism, manufacturing and the UK food industry.”Henry Smith, chair of the 40-strong group of MPs, said quarantine was “well-intentioned” but “unworkable” and was being implemented at the wrong time when the rest of Europe was opening up.He said air and travel corridors offered the best “short-term” solution with  testing a potential component. “One of the biggest answers to this is getting an international consensus,” he said.“We need to revive aviation before the bulk of the summer travel season, ideally by July 1 but as soon as possible.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"social distancing rules uk family friends","story":"This offers hope to families who have struggled to be apart from their loved-ones while restrictions have been in place. Since May 13, people have only been able to meet with one person from outside of their household, outdoors. Before that they could not meet anyone from outside of their household. People will be able to see their family and friends in groups of no more than six, as long as they have not been instructed to shield by the Government, and should remain outdoors.It is still forbidden to meet friends and family inside a home. People should only enter a home that is not their own if they need to do this to get to the garden.Mr Johnson said: These changes mean that friends and family can start to meet their loved ones, perhaps seeing both parents at once or both grandparents at once, and I know that for many people this will be a long awaited and joyful moment.But I must stress that to control the virus everyone needs to stay alert, act responsibly, strictly observe social distancing rules and stay two metres apart from those you do not live with.Groups of six do not have to be from just two different households, but the Prime Minister said during the announcement that minimising contact with others is still the best way to avoid transmission.He added: You should avoid seeing too many people from different households in quick succession.The rules are set to be relaxed further in line with coronavirus infections across the country continuing to fall.Mr Johnson said that the new changes that are coming into effect from June 1 are limited and cautious, adding that he cannot and will not throw away the progress that has so far been made in limiting the spread of the virus.The most recent changes are based on a scheme trialled in New Zealand where different household bubbles can mix.The same rules are now also in place in Northern Ireland, where groups of up to six people from different households can meet up, as long as they follow social distancing.Before any further changes are introduced, the impact of the newly relaxed restrictions will be assessed.The strategy adds: In addition, the Government is also examining how to enable people to gather in slightly larger groups to better facilitate small weddings.Over the coming weeks, the Government will engage on the nature and timing of the measures in this step, in order to consider the widest possible array of views on how best to balance the health, economic and social effects.For the first seven weeks of lockdown, the UK was told unequivocally that they could only go outside to exercise once a day. Now, however, the Prime Minister is encouraging people to take “more and even unlimited amounts of outdoor exercise”.It is also now allowed to sit in the sun in your local park, drive to other destinations for exercise regardless of distance from your home, and to play sports - but all of this can only be done with up to five other people for socially distant activities such as tennis and golf.Social distancing during exercise should continue between people who do not live together. The restrictions on outdoor exercise have been eased in line with the advice of Sage, the Government\u0027s scientific advisers.Mr Johnson said: Crucially, transmission of the virus is far lower outdoors, so we can confidently allow more interaction outside.He stressed that despite the relaxed measures, people must continue to “obey the rules on social distancing”, and in order to enforce those rules there will be an increase in the fines for the people who break them.The Government will to continue to ensure that people who are more clinically vulnerable to coronavirus than others take precautions and minimise contact with people outside of their households.This group is strongly advised to stay at home at all times and avoid any face-to-face contact, called ‘shielding’. It means not leaving the house or attending gatherings at all, with very limited exceptions.Those identified as vulnerable have been asked to shield until at least June 30, as part of a 12-week time period designed to protect them during the peak of the virus.As a result of this, new rules on seeing more people outside of your household do not apply to all of those who are currently shielding.I am afraid that those who have been asked to shield themselves should continue to do so, the Prime Minister said, adding that the Government will is looking carefully at how to better support those who are shielding.Diabetics could be forced to shield at home against Covid-19 following a review by government scientists after it emerged sufferers are at significantly greater risk of dying if they catch the virus.In his public address on May 10, the Prime Minister urged members of the public to “avoid public transport if at all possible” because of the need to maintain social distancing, and as a result of this, capacity on public transport will therefore be limited. The Prime Minister added that public transport operators will be following “Covid-secure standards”.He also urged those who must go to work to get there by walking or bicycle where possible. The Government will increase funding and provide new statutory guidance to encourage local authorities to widen pavements, create pop-up cycle lanes, and close some roads in cities to traffic (apart from buses) as some councils are already proposing.Social distancing guidance on public transport must be followed rigorously, and passengers are now being encouraged to wear cloth face coverings as a precautionary measure. He said the Government was working with tech firms to develop apps to allow people to “find out what parts of the transport network are overcrowded and avoid them” to maintain social distancing after lockdown. The Government will be managing the risk of transmissions from abroad, in order to keep overall levels of infection down. First, the Government will require all international arrivals to disclose information about their contact and accommodation. They will also be strongly advised to download and use the NHS contact tracing app, which is expected to be rolled out nationally in June.Second, the Government will require all international arrivals not on a short list of exemptions to self-isolate in their accommodation for 14 days on arrival into the UK from June 8 or they could face a £1,000 fine. Where international travellers are unable to demonstrate where they would self-isolate, they will be required to do so in accommodation arranged by the Government.The Government is working closely with the devolved administrations to coordinate implementation across the UK. Small exemptions to these measures will be in place to provide for continued security of supply into the UK.International travel measures will not come into force on May 13 but will be introduced as soon as possible. One of the most significant changes announced by the Prime Minister recently has been who the Government believes should now be going to work. Previously, guidance was that you should work from home if you can, and only go to work if you absolutely must. However, Mr Johnson has now said that anyone who can’t work from home - those working in construction or manufacturing, for instance - should be “actively encouraged to go to work”. Outdoor markets and car showrooms will reopen from June 1, with all other non-essential shops set to reopen on June 15 as part of the biggest easing of lockdown restrictions to date.The Prime Minister has said that in order to ensure workplaces are safe, the Government has been working to establish new guidance for employers to make workplaces “Covid-19 secure”.The Government has been consulting the relevant sectors, unions and authorities, including Public Health England, to develop new safety guidelines that can be adapted for workplaces to operate safely, and will release guidelines this week.It will also include measures that were unlikely to be effective when the virus was so widespread that full stay-at-home measures were required, but that may now have some effect as the public increase the number of social contacts.The Government will need to continue to ask all employers and operators of communal spaces to be innovative in developing novel approaches UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) will welcome grant applications for proposals to develop new technologies and approaches that help the UK mitigate the impact of this virus.Other recommendations include installing plexiglass screens between desks in offices and requiring workers not to sit face-to-face but back-to-back or side-to-side, lifts only being used if half-empty, hot-desking abolished and workers not sharing equipment.Staggered arrival and departure times for employees are also being considered, as well as providing staff with packaged meals to avoid opening canteens.The drafted social distancing guidance remains quite stringent for non-office workers. For example, guidance for couriers and lorry drivers suggests finding alternatives to two-person delivery, and building sites and farms should be separated into “zones” of different worker groups with staggered break times.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/05/28/17/apple-macbook-pro-13-inch-with-retina-display-screen-05042020.jpg","title":"apple macbook pro 13in 2020 review specs price new","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.The keyboard alone is a compelling reason to choose the new MacBook ProThe latest MacBook Pro, just released, means the entire Apple laptop range has now been refreshed with newer processors and, most importantly, the new Magic Keyboard.Apple’s complete range of laptops offer striking design, sumptuous trackpads, excellent performance and gorgeous screens. The MacBook Air was the last to gain a Retina Display in late 2018.But there was one key ingredient which wasn’t working quite as well as it should have been for many users: the keyboard. A few years back, Apple switched its keyboard mechanism from scissor-switch to butterfly. That previous scissor-switch keyboard was widely seen as the best QWERTY ever touched, so the butterfly had a tough act to follow. It was designed the way it was because it meant it could fit into smaller spaces, making the laptop potentially thinner.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBut it proved disappointing. Keys would stick or not register and Apple had to issue extended warranties just for the keyboard. When it worked, the butterfly was effective and pleasant to use, though it didn’t have quite the key travel of the previous system, and it lacked reliability.So, the arrival of the new scissor-switch Magic Keyboard in the 16in MacBook Pro last autumn was greeted with heightened anticipation. Greater key travel, more precision and stability of movement were promised, alongside better backlighting and a gently adjusted key layout.Apple update changes how MacBooks charge to make them live longerAnd the result? An out-and-out success. I’ve been comparing the experience across the older scissor-switch, the butterfly and the new Magic Keyboard, which has now arrived on the new 13in MacBook Pro. Even the older scissor-switch, though still deeply appealing and enjoyable to use, isn’t quite as good as this new one. The new keys have almost the same travel as the classic keyboard (1mm on the new keys, against 1.2mm on the older version). But while the travel is easily enough, this keyboard adds a stability and precision which the earlier version didn’t match.I’d say it’s the best keyboard I’ve ever used. Smooth, comfortable, with subtle shaping to the keys that lets your fingers find them more easily all making for a brilliant experience. On its own, it’s a compelling reason to buy the new MacBook Pro. Not because Apple has fixed a problem but because it’s created something extraordinary.There are several models of the new MacBook Pro 13in. The entry-level models have two USB-C sockets while the higher-level model has four.The most affordable one (£1,299) has the same processor as the previous MacBook Pro 13in, meaning it’s really just a keyboard upgrade. Since the price is the same as the model it replaces, this is still a significant improvement. Actually, there’s another change which is also important, given the fact that the price is the same: the storage in the entry-level model has just doubled from 128GB to 256GB. The next model up also has the same price, same processor as before but comes with the Magic Keyboard and storage which has doubled from its previous 256GB to 512GB.The four-port higher-end model is quite a lot more expensive but it is faster and more powerful.Those extra ports sound negligible but they’re not. Since you can charge your MacBook Pro from any of the four USB-C Thunderbolt 3 sockets, there’s significant extra convenience to be able to plug in on either side, while still having room for three other accessories.Then there are the MacBook Pro features which carry over from last year’s models but set Apple ahead of the rest of the industry. These are details such as the trackpad which is huge and more responsive than pretty much all the competition. There’s the useful fingerprint sensor in the power button which is secure and makes unlocking the MacBook Pro an intimate experience. It can also be used for online purchases, with the fingerprint recognition authorising payments. Then there’s the high-resolution display that looks fantastic, rich and colourful, with neat extras like True Tone which cleverly monitors the ambient light in the room and adjusts the colour temperature onscreen so what you see is faithful to what you should be seeing.The MacBook Pro has the Touch Bar, a touchscreen strip which replaces the function keys and changes its capabilities the instant you change apps. So, in word processing, there are touch-sensitive shortcuts to add formatting, paste something or change the text colour, all without removing your fingers from the keys. Click on to a web browser and the bar immediately changes so that you can see a thumbnail row of previous web pages which you quickly flick between. At all times, functions like muting the speakers or adjusting the brightness are also available, not to mention Siri, the voice assistant, who can be alerted by tapping the icon or simply saying, “Hey, Siri’.But, of course, the main reason to spend £1,799 is the significant uptick in power, especially in graphics power which comes from the tenth-generation Intel chip on board, something that not even the recent 16in MacBook Pro can boast. Mind you, the graphics on the 16in MacBook Pro are still more powerful.If you don’t use apps like video editing, for instance, or other apps with graphic-heavy demands, then the more affordable Pro may suit.Even if you don’t need to edit video, the speed of the MacBook Pro is evident in every action. This is a fast, responsive machine that never dawdles.Virgin Australia bans all Apple MacBooks from checked-in luggageApple MacBook Air Review: The upgrade users have been aching forOverall, the MacBook Pro 13in, in either two-port or four-port version, is likely capable enough for all your needs, but still small enough to throw into a bag easily (and the popularity of the size is one reason why Apple didn’t enlarge the screen to 14 inches, in the way the 15-inch MacBook Pro has just swelled to a 16-inch display).Spare a thought, though, for the MacBook Air, a less expensive laptop (from £999) that does almost as much as the entry-level MacBook Pro 13in. Much of  the standout tech from the Pro is also found on the Air, such as the Magic Keyboard, the Touch ID fingerprint sensor, the large trackpad, two USB-C Thunderbolt 3 ports and the 13in screen size.The Pro display goes brighter, has wide colour instead of the standard colour on the Air. Again, these are details that Pro users need and the rest of us merely enjoy. There’s no Touch Bar on the Air, please note. But the Air is lighter than the Pro, as its name suggests it should be, and it even has battery life a touch longer than the Pro. Though in my experience, battery life is extremely good on all these models. Overall, it makes the MacBook Air a compelling purchase as well, beating the Pro if your needs are not as heavy, though both the entry-level and higher-end MacBook Pro offer more in the way of power, for sure. Really, if the only upgrade to the new MacBook Pro had been the new keyboard, it would make it a great purchase, since the price on both the new models is identical to the last ones. But, for those wanting more power, the four-port MacBook Pro with tenth-generation Intel processor, is a perfect balance of portability and powerBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

As they do, the amount of charge they can hold drops, until they eventually become so short their life is over.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe new feature aims to slow down the rate at which that ageing process happens. It does so by watching how hot it gets and when it tends to be charged.The feature is switched on by default and arrives in the latest update, which is numbered macOS 10.15.5. That update may download automatically, and may already have installed itself on many MacBooks.Apple announces next major event with iPhone and Mac updatesAs it gathers data about how the computer is used, the feature could stop the laptop charging all the way up. By doing so, it reduces strain on the battery by avoiding filling up with charge when that power would not necessarily be needed straight away.As such, the feature could leave some Macs with less charge than might normally be expected. Apple allows users to turn the feature off if they need to ensure they have full charge on their computer.A similar tool is already present in iOS for the iPhone and iPad, where it can also be switched off.Created with Sketch.Gadget and tech news: In pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.125 Gun-toting humanoid robot sent into spaceRussia has launched a humanoid robot into space on a rocket bound for the International Space Station (ISS).

Regular testing of couriers is still not being carried out but those with symptoms are now being tested, TDL said on Thursday.Whether ‘test and trace’ has been rushed or not – it’s a poor launchTDL describes itself as the “largest UK independent provider of highly specialised pathologyclinical laboratory services to clinicians (GPs and specialists), hospitals, community health services, and their patients”.Its network of couriers collect and drop off medical samples such as blood tests from hospitals and surgeries before delivering them to labs for analysis. During the pandemic they have entered hospitals with a high number of Covid-19 patients to pick up testing samples.The Independent Workers’ Union of Great Britain (IWGB), which represents the couriers, says that this potentially puts them at high risk of infection but the company has not engaged with their safety requests. The union wants regular testing and adequate personal protective equipment (PPE), as well as full sick pay for workers who need to self-isolate because they are aged over 60 or have pre-existing medical conditions. It also alleges that TDL has not implemented proper social distancing in the company’s loading bay.The IWGB has filed a trade union and whistleblower victimisation claim against the company at the employment tribunal on behalf of eight of its members, who say they were targeted for redundancy on “bogus” grounds.The eight workers believe the company is attempting to make them redundant because of their involvement in previous disputes over issues including rider safety and pay.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailTDL strongly rejected the IWGB’s allegations. It said only 46 of its 157-strong workforce had voted to strike based on “unfounded” allegations which the company categorically denies. IWGB said that 84 per cent of members who returned their ballots voted in favour of industrial action.A TDL spokesperson added: “It is inconceivable that TDL would deliberately expose any of its workforce, of whom its courier fleet is an important part, to undue risk at any time but especially now. “All TDL’s health and safety protocols, which includes access to Covid-19 testing for those with symptoms, are compliant with current regulations and UK Government guidelines, are kept under constant review by TDL’s director of health and safety, and when they change, TDL’s protocols change with them.”The company said its team of 10 bicycle couriers were being made redundant because of a downturn in the London area where they operate.TDL cycle courier and IWGB couriers and logistics branch chair Alex Marshall said: “I’m incredibly proud of the work we have done during this pandemic. “TDL’s cycle couriers are among the best in the industry, have an impeccable attendance record and in times of tremendous stress have provided a model service to the community. “Instead of rewarding us, management has decided to take away our only means to feed our families in the middle of a pandemic. But the resounding vote in favour of strike action shows that despite management’s attempts to break us, we are more united than ever.”Labour MP and former shadow chancellor John McDonnell tweeted in support of the couriers who he said had been “pushed to the limit” by their employer.Coronavirus: One in 15 people tested show signs of infectionTest and trace system plunged into chaos as NHS staff unable to log inTest and trace ‘won’t be fully operational until end of next month’What it’s like to work as a hospital chaplain on the Covid frontline“This issue needs to be addressed urgently by @MattHancock if the plan for testing \u0026amp tracking is to be effective,” Mr McDonnell wrote. “Sacking these couriers playing a key role in helping tackle the pandemic is completely counterproductive.”The government’s test, track and trace system got off to a stuttering start on Thursday, when an army of 25,000 contact tracers had been due to begin work.The programme’s first day was beset by problems and the government has admitted it will not be “fully operational” until the end of June.Several contact tracers told The Independent that they could not access the website when it launched on Thursday morning, with staff left unable to work.It is hoped track and trace will allow the country to come out of lockdown while still keeping control of coronavirus case numbers but some experts have warned that infection rates in the UK remain too high to implement the system effectively.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The show, which has become a fan favourite, was quickly acquired by Barstool Sports.In April, the podcast uploaded what turned out to be its final episode hosted by both Cooper and Franklyn.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe following weeks saw Cooper, Franklyn, and Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy all share their sides of the story.According to Franklyn, she and Cooper “wanted to consider some other options” than Barstool Sports but nonetheless entered negotiations with Portnoy.Listen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus Podcast9 best kids’ podcasts that inspire young imaginations15 best podcasts to listen to while you’re self-isolating11 soothing podcasts to listen to during self-isolation10 best podcasts for self-improvement while self-isolating“I found out that Alex had gone behind my back and done something,” Franklyn said in a video shared earlier this month. “And I found out it wasn’t the first time. And that’s why we’re here. I trusted Alex. I feel betrayed, but ultimately she was my best friend and that doesn’t change overnight.”A few days later, Cooper shared a video of her own, in which she said that during the first year of their Barstool Sports contract, she got a pay raise “for editing and doing all the social media and doing all the marketing”.“I chose not to share this raise with Sofia, and I chose to do that because Sofia made me feel uncomfortable that I did more work,” Cooper said in her clip.According to Cooper, she and Franklyn eventually began to negotiate for more money from Barstool and, with outside help, put together a “term sheet” which included a number of “outrageous asks”, such as a $1m paycheck.“In a very roundabout way, Dave Portnoy essentially told us to go F ourselves in every single hole possible,” Cooper said. “...It was awful.”At this point, according to Cooper, the negotiations stopped but she and Franklyn continued hosting the podcast.Eventually, Cooper said she and Franklyn decided to have “one more conversation with Dave Portnoy”, but that she and Franklyn had “different opinions on what this meeting meant”.But Cooper said that while the deal left her bursting with excitement, Franklyn didn’t share her position. This is when Call Her Daddy underwent what Cooper called a “ghost period”, during which negotiations escalated.Ultimately, according to Cooper, she and Franklyn had an “infamous two-hour phone call” by the end of which it was clear the two hosts were “on different pages”. Cooper then said she went back to Portnoy to sign her own deal.Cooper ended her video by saying she had “lost a friend” but was looking forward to getting the show back on the air.According to The New York Times, a deal was extended to Franklyn, possibly to host a competing podcast. No follow-up details have been announced as of yet.In his own update, Portnoy defended Barstool’s approach throughout the negotiations, saying he had offered half a million dollars to each of the hosts with bonuses and an increased cut from merch sales, as well as a reduction in their contract duration and the Call Her Daddy intellectual property.Cooper’s solo episode dated 26 May is titled “The Funeral” and includes an announcement that Cooper will feature a fan appearance in almost every new episode over the coming year.The Independent has contacted Portnoy, Franklyn, and Cooper for additional comments.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Regular testing of couriers is still not being carried out but those with symptoms are now being tested, TDL said on Thursday.Whether ‘test and trace’ has been rushed or not – it’s a poor launchTDL describes itself as the “largest UK independent provider of highly specialised pathologyclinical laboratory services to clinicians (GPs and specialists), hospitals, community health services, and their patients”.Its network of couriers collect and drop off medical samples such as blood tests from hospitals and surgeries before delivering them to labs for analysis. During the pandemic they have entered hospitals with a high number of Covid-19 patients to pick up testing samples.The Independent Workers’ Union of Great Britain (IWGB), which represents the couriers, says that this potentially puts them at high risk of infection but the company has not engaged with their safety requests. The union wants regular testing and adequate personal protective equipment (PPE), as well as full sick pay for workers who need to self-isolate because they are aged over 60 or have pre-existing medical conditions. It also alleges that TDL has not implemented proper social distancing in the company’s loading bay.The IWGB has filed a trade union and whistleblower victimisation claim against the company at the employment tribunal on behalf of eight of its members, who say they were targeted for redundancy on “bogus” grounds.The eight workers believe the company is attempting to make them redundant because of their involvement in previous disputes over issues including rider safety and pay.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailTDL strongly rejected the IWGB’s allegations. It said only 46 of its 157-strong workforce had voted to strike based on “unfounded” allegations which the company categorically denies. IWGB said that 84 per cent of members who returned their ballots voted in favour of industrial action.A TDL spokesperson added: “It is inconceivable that TDL would deliberately expose any of its workforce, of whom its courier fleet is an important part, to undue risk at any time but especially now. “All TDL’s health and safety protocols, which includes access to Covid-19 testing for those with symptoms, are compliant with current regulations and UK Government guidelines, are kept under constant review by TDL’s director of health and safety, and when they change, TDL’s protocols change with them.”The company said its team of 10 bicycle couriers were being made redundant because of a downturn in the London area where they operate.TDL cycle courier and IWGB couriers and logistics branch chair Alex Marshall said: “I’m incredibly proud of the work we have done during this pandemic. “TDL’s cycle couriers are among the best in the industry, have an impeccable attendance record and in times of tremendous stress have provided a model service to the community. “Instead of rewarding us, management has decided to take away our only means to feed our families in the middle of a pandemic. But the resounding vote in favour of strike action shows that despite management’s attempts to break us, we are more united than ever.”Labour MP and former shadow chancellor John McDonnell tweeted in support of the couriers who he said had been “pushed to the limit” by their employer.Coronavirus: One in 15 people tested show signs of infectionTest and trace system plunged into chaos as NHS staff unable to log inTest and trace ‘won’t be fully operational until end of next month’What it’s like to work as a hospital chaplain on the Covid frontline“This issue needs to be addressed urgently by @MattHancock if the plan for testing \u0026amp tracking is to be effective,” Mr McDonnell wrote. “Sacking these couriers playing a key role in helping tackle the pandemic is completely counterproductive.”The government’s test, track and trace system got off to a stuttering start on Thursday, when an army of 25,000 contact tracers had been due to begin work.The programme’s first day was beset by problems and the government has admitted it will not be “fully operational” until the end of June.Several contact tracers told The Independent that they could not access the website when it launched on Thursday morning, with staff left unable to work.It is hoped track and trace will allow the country to come out of lockdown while still keeping control of coronavirus case numbers but some experts have warned that infection rates in the UK remain too high to implement the system effectively.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

If it has water and oxygen, it could potentially be home to\u0026nbspalien lifeA planet the size of Earth has been confirmed around the closest star in our solar system, Proxima Centauri, by an international team of scientists.The planet, called ‘Proxima b’, has a mass of 1.17 Earths and is located in the habitable zone of Proxima Centauri, which the planet orbits approximately every 11 days, according to the new paper published in the journal Astronomy \u0026amp Astrophysics.The first indications of the planet’s existence were in 2013 by Mikko Tuomi of the University of Hertfordshire from archival observation data, with continued research following in 2016. It is believed this planet could be “likely” to be able to support alien life forms.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe researchers detected this planet by measuring radial velocity using the Echelle SPectrograph for Rocky Exoplanets and Stable Spectroscopic Observations (ESPRESSO) which is installed on a telescope in Chile. It is three times as accurate as HARPS, another spectrograph which has been used to measure the velocity of Proxima Centauri.Radial velocity, in relation to a given point, is the rate of change of the distance between an object and that point. As a planet orbits a star, its gravitational pull causes a star to move back and forth. This tiny motion shifts the observed light spectrum of the star slightly due to Doppler shift, which can be detected with sensitive instruments.Everything you need to know about SpaceX launchA low disturbance in Proxima Centauri’s speed, detected by ESPRESSO, tipped researchers off to the presence of the planet. Nobel Prize-winning astrophysicist Michel Mayor said that ESPRESSO makes it possible to “measure the mass of the planet with a precision of over one-tenth of the mass of Earth”, which he describes as “completely unheard of.Proxima Centauri is approximately 4.2 light-years from the Sun, but Nasa estimates it would take approximately 73,000 years for us to reach the planet unless new technologies are developed.Ionic propulsion, nuclear thermal propulsion, nuclear pulse propulsion, fusion rockets, and laser sails have all been considered as methods to travel to the planet.Mysterious signals coming from space answer matter puzzle30 years of space wonder began with a vital but underwhelming imageSpace Force launch: Robotic rocket plane blasts off on secret missionAstronomers find \u0027regular rhythms\u0027 coming from distant starsSpace debris from failed rocket misses New York City by minutes“We were already very happy with the performance of HARPS, which has been responsible for discovering hundreds of exoplanets over the last 17 years,” said Francesco Pepe, a professor in the Astronomy Department in UNIGE’s Faculty of Science in a statement. “We’re really pleased that ESPRESSO can produce even better measurements, and it’s gratifying and just reward for the teamwork lasting nearly 10 years.”Alejandro Suarez Mascareño, the article’s main author, said: “Confirming the existence of Proxima b was an important task, and it’s one of the most interesting planets known in the solar neighbourhood.”Although Proxima b is about 20 times closer to its star than the Earth is to the Sun, it receives comparable amounts of energy. If there is liquid form on the planet, it could harbour life, but researchers said there is still much to be done before that can be confirmed. “Is there an atmosphere that protects the planet from these deadly rays?” said Christophe Lovis, a researcher in the University of Geneva’s Astronomy Department, “and if this atmosphere exists, does it contain the chemical elements that promote the development of life?”It is also possible that there could be a second planet orbiting the star, as the research team found evidence of a second signal in the data – but was unable to determine its origins. “If the signal was planetary in origin, this potential other planet accompanying Proxima b would have a mass less than one third of the mass of the Earth. It would then be the smallest planet ever measured using the radial velocity method,” said Professor Pepe.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Building features to combat that would require the company to sacrifice engagement – and by extension, profit – according to a later document from 2018 which described the proposals as “antigrowth” and requiring “a moral stance.”“Our algorithms exploit the human brain’s attraction to isiveness,” a 2018 presentation warned, warning that if action was not taken Facebook would provide users “more and more isive content in an effort to gain user attention \u0026amp increase time on the platform.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAccording to a report from the Wall Street Journal, in 2017 and 2018 Facebook conducted research through newly created “Integrity Teams” to tackle extremist content and a cross-jurisdictional task force dubbed “Common Ground.”The Common Ground team was intended to tackle polarisation directly, said people familiar with the team, although its intentions were “explicitly not going to build products that attempt to change people’s beliefs,” but to create products that increase empathy, understanding, and humanization of the ‘other side’” according to a 2018 document.Trump to sign executive order pursuing social media giantsThe project was particularly concerned about private groups following a 2016 presentation by a Facebook researcher that found extremist content in more than one-third of large German political groups, most of which were private and so their content was not visible to outside members, on the social media site.These groups were disproportionately influenced by a small coterie of hyperactive users, with the presentation stating that the majority of people joining extremist groups were encouraged by Facebook’s algorithm. “Our recommendation systems grow the problem,” the presentation said.While Facebook was dedicated to neutrality, deciding that the social media site should not police users’ opinions or vilify users’ political opponents, according to internal documents, it was suggested that Facebook change its algorithm to suggest a wider range of Facebook groups or adding a feature to create smaller communities within Facebook Groups where political arguments could be held.However, Facebook executives including chief executive and founder Mark Zuckerberg “largely shelved the basic research, according to previously unreported internal documents and people familiar with the effort, and weakened or blocked efforts to apply its conclusions to Facebook products.”Facebook\u0027s vice president of global public policy Joel Kaplan argued that such actions were “paternalistic” at a time when disapproval from Kaplan’s team would dissolve a project, said people familiar with its development.Negative reviews from the policy team reportedly stopped a classification system for hyperpolarising content. Efforts to suppress clickbait about politics were also shut down.Russia interfered in 2016 to back Trump, new Senate report confirmsCarlos Uribe, who led the newsfeed Integrity Team at the time, attempted to push “Sparing Sharing,” which would have reduced the reach of content from hyperactive users – who were usually far more partisan than average users and engaged in behaviour similar to spammers. Uribe did not comment to the Wall Street Journal, but did confirm that he supported the Sparing Sharing proposal. Facebook researchers suggested that it could bolster the platform\u0027s defence against spam and manipulation like that which had allowed interference from Russia during the 2016 presidential election.However, Kaplan and other Facebook executives pushed back on Uribe’s proposal, saying that mitigating the ability of Facebook’s most dedicated users to push content would unfairly affect them – hypothesising about a Girl Scout troop who became super-sharers by promoting cookies as an example.Zuckerberg says Twitter shouldn\u0027t be \u0027arbiter of truth\u0027Facebook announces oversight board to decide free speech controversiesMark Zuckerberg says Facebook ‘slow to understand’ Russian operationsFacebook gives insight into how future workspaces could lookWhat has Facebook done to fix election interference since 2016?While Zuckerberg approved a weakened version of the program, he reportedly said that he was losing interest in the effort to change the platform for the good of its users and asked not to have that subject brought to him again. Smaller changes were made to the platform, including efforts to promote news stories from a large user base and penalties for publishers who shared fake news.Uribe since left the company because of frustration with executives, and said that while proposals in the US would affect conservatives it would affect opposite groups in other countries. The Common Ground team was disbanded, and while the Integrity Teams still exist many senior staffers either left Facebook entirely or moved to Instagram, which is owned by Facebook.In response to the report, Facebook has said in a blog post that the Wall Street Journal wilfully ignored critical facts that undermined its narrative which, the company says, includes changes to the News Feed, limiting the reach of Pages and Groups that breach Facebook\u0027s standards or share fake news, combating hate speech and misinformation, and building a robust Integrity Team.This news comes while Donald Trump is preparing to sign an executive order to target social media sites after Twitter added a fact-checking label to his tweets claming that postal voting would result in a fraudulent election. The president claimed that social media sites are biased against right-wing voices, a topic which is hotly debated.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The four-part documentary features the testimonies of multiple survivors who say they were abused by the disgraced financier.Its first episode focuses in part on an investigation conducted in 2011 by journalist Vicky Ward for Vanity Fair.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAccording to Ward, Epstein became threatening when he found out Ward was working on a piece about him, telling her that if he didn’t “like” it, “it’s going to be bad for you and your family”.19 best limited series for TV commitment-phobesThe best Amazon Prime and Netflix shows to watch while self-isolatingNetflix to automatically cancel ‘hundreds of thousands’ of accountsJeffrey Epstein: Netflix documentary brings to light new allegationsThe journalist goes on to recall a phone call from Carter, in which she says he shared additional concerning news.“He was pretty spooked because he’d found a severed cat head in his garden,” Ward says.“He also found a bullet on his doorstep.”Ward goes on to state that part of her story with testimony from two women who shared allegations against Epstein were ultimately taken out, which she attributed to an editorial decision on the magazine’s part.Carter disputed Ward’s recollection in a statement provided to the documentary and said that parts of Ward’s reporting “did not meet our legal threshold” at the time.

A new launch time of 3.22pm (8.22pm UK time) has been scheduled for Saturday from Nasa\u0027s Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesWeather permitting, it won\u0027t just be those on the east coast of the US that will be able to see the launch. The trajectory of the Crew Dragon capsule means sky gazers in the UK will also be able to view the space craft as it passes overhead.It will look like any other satellite does – a spot moving across the sky in 5 minutes, astrophysicist Dr Darren Baskill, who lectures at the University of Sussex, told The Independent.Everything you need to know about SpaceX launchBecause the spaceship is small, it will be faint – so fine to see with the unaided eyes, but nowhere near as bright as the football-field sized International Space Station. Also, it will be low in the sky, so best seen from the South and the midlands, with a clear southern horizon.The first pass of the spacecraft will take place shortly after take-off, but it will be too light to see in the skies above the UK.A second pass at around 10.15pm will be visible to anyone facing south-west with a clear view of the horizon, so long as the skies stay clear.Several websites offer ways to track the Crew Dragon capsule, as well as the International Space Station (ISS), where it will eventually dock.The site Heavens Above gives specific details about the Crew Dragon craft, while a tool developed by the European Space Agency allows real-time tracking of the ISS.Live streams of the launch will also be hosted on the official Nasa and SpaceX YouTube channels, with close to 2 million people tuning in to the failed first launch.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Researchers found 70 per cent of parents do not have any type of external support in providing care and education for their children.The study, which polled 3,055 working parents in the UK, America, France, Germany, and Italy, found similar gendered patterns in other countries too.Researchers found women with children across these countries now spend an average of 65 hours a week on unpaid labour around the house — with this figure having almost doubled since the Covid-19 crisis. This is almost a third more than fathers, who are doing an average of 50 hours a week.It comes after a study by the London School of Economics recently found coronavirus is exacerbating the gender gap as women bear the brunt of childcare responsibilities and homeschooling during lockdown — whether they’re working or not.I founded the Wages for Housework campaign – little has changed sinceThe report found women are more likely to deal with homeschooling, childcare and chores around the house even if they are juggling this with working at the same time.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Together with the way we are adapting our working lives to cope during the lockdown, this gives me hope that in the long term, a more equal society will emerge.”The report found women are more likely than men to lose their jobs in the forthcoming recession because a larger number work in sectors — such as hospitality, leisure, tourism and the arts — that are forecast to be hardest hit.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

This trend, combined with people\u0027s own changing attitudes toward social events and large gatherings, resulted in travel dropping by more than 50 per cent before the lockdown began, according to requests made on Apple Maps for car and public transport directions.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesRequests on Apple Maps for car directions began to fall on 11 March, while requests for public transport directions began to fall even earlier on 9 March.Many activities and behaviours that were considered normal before coronavirus also remain taboo regardless of the government\u0027s guidelines.The recently relaxed rules mean that cleaners and nannies are now permitted to visit people\u0027s homes, but a recent survey found that the majority of people found this very unacceptable.The poll by Ipsos MORI, which was carried out between 8 and 11 May, also found that having non co-habiting friends, family members or loved ones visit was also considered socially unacceptable.​Public opinion about exercise and driving is more greatly ided, ​though the poll demonstrated that government rules may not be a defining influence on people\u0027s behaviours.Companies\u0027 decisions to keep work from home policies in place show that lockdown measures are not necessarily enforced by government policy decision.The figures also suggest that the impact of coronavirus on travel habits, socialising and other pre-lockdown habits could continue long after lockdown officially ends.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

She did not want to risk a nearly 300-mile drive with our child given how ill I had been.“We agreed that we should go for a short drive to see if I could drive safely, we drove for roughly half an hour and ended up on the outskirts of Barnard Castle town. We did not visit the castle, we did not walk around the town.”Mr Cummings said he had felt a “bit sick” so they had walked about 10 to 15 metres to the riverbank where they sat for about 15 minutes until he felt better.Claimed he had previously warned of coronavirus pandemicMr Cummings used the briefing to insist he, contrary to some reports, had not resisted the introduction of lockdown measures and had in fact previously warned of the dangers of a coronavirus pandemic.“For years, I have warned of the dangers of pandemics. Last year I wrote about the possible threat of coronaviruses and the urgent need for planning,” he said.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

silence at Guy\u0027s HospitalMr Cummings did in fact write an entry on his blog in March 2019, which more specifically examined the possibility of a deadly outbreak being triggered by a coronavirus accidentally released from a laboratory during scientific experiments. However, there have been suggestions that the reference to coronavirus was actually added to the blog in April 2020.Scientists currently believe Sars-CoV-2, the virus which causes Covid-19, jumped from animals to humans as the product of natural evolution.Described his family’s farm as ‘sort of concrete blocks’The PM’s senior adviser insisted that his trip to Durham to isolate was not because the property on his family’s farm was a “nice place to be”.“The point about it was not that it was some nice place to be. If you have been there, you would see that it\u0027s sort of concrete blocks,” he said.“The point about it was not that it was a nice place to be, but that it was the safest place to be in the circumstances – and it meant that I didn\u0027t have to expose other people to risk unless I absolutely had to in a critical emergency.”Didn’t make inquiries about childcare in London before making tripMr Cummings used the briefing to insist the journey had been necessary because he and his wife had no reasonable childcare options in London if they both fell ill with coronavirus.“I suddenly got a call from my wife who was at home looking after our four-year-old child,” he explained in a prepared statement.“She told me she suddenly felt badly ill, she vomited and felt like she might pass out, and there would be nobody to look after our child. None of our usual childcare options were available.”However, in subsequent questioning from journalists, Mr Cummings later admitted he did not make inquiries about potential childcare in London.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Please consider a contribution or subscription.The government has appeared to invite hundreds of thousands of Hong Kong residents to make UK citizenship bids amid concerns over China’s planned national security law, which critics warn would eviscerate the notion of “one country, two systems”.Foreign secretary Dominic Raab said the UK would allow the roughly 300,000 people in Hong Kong who hold British national overseas (BNO) passports to stay in the country for 12 months, instead of the current six, unless China scraps the proposed law.He added that by allowing BNO passport holders to apply to work and study for extendable periods of 12 months, this would “provide a pathway to future citizenship” – stopping short of pledging definite amnesty.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe diplomatic gambit came as Mr Raab and his counterparts in the US, Canada and Australia published a joint statement warning the law “would curtail the Hong Kong people’s liberties, and in doing so, dramatically erode Hong Kong’s autonomy and the system that made it so prosperous”.Noting that “Hong Kong has flourished as a bastion of freedom”, they emphasised their “deep concerns” and warned China’s planned law was “in direct conflict” its obligations under the principles of the Sino-British declaration, agreed when Britain returned the former colony to China in 1997.Created with Sketch.Pro-democracy protesters return to Hong Kong streets Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A pro-democracy protester is detained before being arrested by undercover police during a protest calling for the city\u0027s independence in Mong Kok district on 10 MayJournalists gather round a pro-democracy protester in Hong Kong shopping centre on 10 MayPro-democracy protesters sing songs during a rally at a shopping centre in Hong Kong on 10 MayPolice officers clear a shopping centre of protesters on 10 MayRiot police wearing protective masks stand guard during a demonstration outside a shopping centre in Hong Kong on 10 MayPro-democracy protesters stage a rally at a shopping centre in Hong Kong on 10 MayPolice officers patrol the Tsim Sha Tsui waterfront where protests are scheduled to take place on 10 MayRiot police stand guard in a shopping centre during a pro-democracy protest on 10 MayPro-democracy protesters stage a rally at a shopping centre in Hong Kong on 10 MayA pro-democracy protester is detained by an undercover police officer during a protest calling for the city\u0027s independence in Mong Kok district on 10 MayA pro-democracy protester is detained before being arrested by undercover police during a protest calling for the city\u0027s independence in Mong Kok district on 10 MayJournalists gather round a pro-democracy protester in Hong Kong shopping centre on 10 MayPro-democracy protesters sing songs during a rally at a shopping centre in Hong Kong on 10 MayPolice officers clear a shopping centre of protesters on 10 MayRiot police wearing protective masks stand guard during a demonstration outside a shopping centre in Hong Kong on 10 MayPro-democracy protesters stage a rally at a shopping centre in Hong Kong on 10 MayPolice officers patrol the Tsim Sha Tsui waterfront where protests are scheduled to take place on 10 MayRiot police stand guard in a shopping centre during a pro-democracy protest on 10 MayPro-democracy protesters stage a rally at a shopping centre in Hong Kong on 10 MayA pro-democracy protester is detained by an undercover police officer during a protest calling for the city\u0027s independence in Mong Kok district on 10 MayThe foreign ministers warned the unprecedented move risked undermining trust in Beijing during the coronavirus pandemic, when governments should be striving to enhance it, with Mr Raab adding: “We urge China to step back from the brink.”However, 2,878 members of China’s mostly rubber-stamp parliament voted in favour of the law on Thursday. One delegate voted against, and six abstained.The legislation will make “any act of treason, secession, sedition or subversion” in Hong Kong a criminal offence, and will allow China’s national intelligence agencies to set up bureaux in the city.Communist Party officials will now draft the new legislation and it could be in force before the end of the summer.The violent protests that rocked the city for much of 2019 after a proposed extradition bill quickly reignited with the new proposals, with tear gas once again stinging streets pounded by thousands of masked demonstrators and armed police.​The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I am shaking with anger right now. This is the best they can come up with?“Extending a f***ing worthless document for Hong Kongers (who can pay for themselves to be here for longer than 6 months). They are already here, Raab.“This is a worthless 12 month tourist visa unless he is saying if you live here for a year, UK will give you citizenship.Additional reporting by agenciesShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It really is a social justice issue’The Independent employs over 100 journalists around the world to bring you news you can trust. Please consider a contribution or subscription.Native Americans are cancelling Sun Dances other cultural ceremonies to halt the spread of the coronavirus, as infections amid indigenous communities begin to soar.In the so-called Great Plains states of North and South Dakota, community leaders have put off this year’s planned Sun Dances, days-long gatherings when people come together for collective healing. Elsewhere, Pow wows, or traditional gatherings, have gone online for those with access to the internet.Indigenous leaders say the cancellation of the events, enacted to enforce social distancing, further impacts the well-being of the community, many members of which struggle from mental health challenges. Events such as traditional “sweats”, are no longer possible.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe 173,000-strong Navajo Nation, whose territory includes part of New Mexico, Utah, and Arizona, remains on lockdown, after recording at least 4,800 infections and 150 deaths – the highest per capita infection rate in the country. At the same time, other communities across the country are bracing last week around 80 new infections were reported in the South Dakota town of Rapid City. “The  Native American population is being affected to a greater extent,” Rapid City mayor Steve Allender said in a weekly briefing.

Now, he said, as politicians argued, Native Americans were “dying of neglect”.“I don’t look at Covid-19 as a biomedical issue in Indian communities. It really is a policy issue, and a social justice issue,” he told a briefing, organised by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, which works on health issues.“And as American Indians, we are the only population born with a legal right to health services, and that’s based on treaties and other laws and Supreme Court decisions that show American Indians exchanged land and natural resources for various social services, including housing, education and health care.”Mr Warne, a member of the Oglala Lakota tribe from Pine Ridge, South Dakota, said communities were trying to protect themselves, even as some politicians sought to undermine their efforts.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailEarlier this month, South Dakota governor Kristi Noem threatened to sue two tribes, the Cheyenne River Sioux and Oglala Sioux, who erected a number of roadblocks and check points on routes leading to their reservations. The efforts were part of a broader effort to limit the spread of the virus, but Ms Noem claimed the tribes had broken the law by failing to speak to the authorities about their plans. She is one of around a half-dozen governors who imposed no lockdown measures when the virus struck.“It’s even had some cultural implications. We have ceremonies like the Sun Dance, for example. Most of those have been postponed or cancelled for this year, which is highly unusual,” he said.Dr Warne later said the Sun Dance, which involves a number of dancers and drummers, was just one of the events being put off.“Many of our traditional healers and medicine men are now postponing or just cancelling for this year. A lot of those sacred practices does have cultural implications,” he said“With the Sun Dance people commit to doing that for four years. So there’s many, many people who are supposed to be finishing their four year commitment this year, but because of the pandemic, it’ll get postponed until next year.”Mary Owen, who is also a doctor and who directs the Centre of American Indian and Minority Health at the University of Minnesota, said cultural practices and traditions varied by community. Yet virtually all had been cancelled or else moved online.“Our Pow wows are held by many, many tribes. They’re a meeting, and a celebration of our culture, the time to get community stuff done,” she told The Independent. She said research had shown the relationship between attending such events and positive mental health among community members. “I’ve not looked into this, but I’m guessing you can find something similar for some people with church and religion,” said Ms Owe, who is originally from Alaska and is a member of the Tlingit community.She added: “It’s not just the traditions themselves, but it’s coming together to practise the traditions.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

One son, aged around 15, was allegedly discovered living in the basement after Mr Gray admitted this to authorities. “The house was filled with urine smell, faeces throughout the house, partially flooded basement,” said the Roane County court on Monday. Investigators searched the address over the weekend after someone told police that the youngest child was walking alone near the family home. Whilst his parents were unaware, Roane County authorities located the child who allegedly told them about the basement and the other child buried in the backyard, reported WVLT News. Detectives then arrived at the house to investigate.The couple also admitted that the children had not received medical or dental attention for at least six years prior to the investigation. At the same time, authorities said the children had “stunted growth” and that the parents had withheld food from them as punishment. The couple could face further charges.

So over time, probably over the next six months, we will have a three-week review.She also added that its plausible restrictions could be in place for longer than that.This is the first time the UK and Europe has had to deal with a pandemic on this scale since the outbreak of Spanish Flu in  that killed around  million people and infected  per cent of the world population.Weve had a few close calls with illnesses like swine flu in -, but it wasnt on the same scale as coronavirus.However, the reason we are in lockdown now is that we have a better understanding of how the pathogens work and what we need to do to stop them.China implemented what was then the largest quarantine in human history to try to contain the coronavirus, locking down at least  cities at the end of January.The lockdown on the eight-million-strong city of Wuhan, the epicentre of the virus, ended on April .Wuhan was completely barricaded, with people literally being welded into their homes.Six European countries in Europe - Spain, Italy, Denmark, Austria, Poland, and the Czech Republic - who have previously imposed restrictions are beginning to lt lockdown measures. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Yes, as the chief advisor to the PM he should have known better.But who among the parents who viewed Dominic Cummings’ press conference didn’t feel a stab of recognition when he described the reasons he travelled to his parents home to find a carer for his four-year old son He may hold the reins of power. But Cummings is also a father. Parenting is a great leveller.No matter who you are, or how much power you yield, your child comes first.Haven’t we all felt that desperate panic at trying to juggle work and childcare That and being the right hand man to the Prime Minister in the middle of a pandemic, the most challenging situation this nation has faced since World War Two.As a mum-of-two author of What’s My Child Thinking , I also know that finding childcare for four-year-olds is not easy.They have strong opinions about who they will be left with and find it hard to be separated from their parents.By doing this Cummings had peace of mind that were he and his we to be both hospitalised with the disease, then their four-year-old would be taken care of.He looked tense, scared and panicked by the force of hatred against him.A firing squad looked like it would have been only a mildly easier option.But I wonderthe polarisation of this country is now so great that hatred has now blinded us to the fact that public figures are often parents too.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I’m not.Eventhe enforcement is far from being perfect, it will still have a tremendous effect.According to the British Pub Association, four out of ten pubs are likely to cease to exist at the end of the crisis.Unlike many restaurants that can stay afloat selling takeaway food, pubs cannot generate income in lockdown.Anyone who says that short-term rationing of alcohol in pubs is not a price worth paying to get them to open up fast must have had one pint too many.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

No, he hadn’t.“The country can see that and it’s shocked the Government cannot,” she added, before accusing the Prime Minister of “blind loyalty” to Cummings.Then she added, for good measure, that the country had reacted with “fury, contempt and anguish”.I suppose she thought she was speaking for the country with this tendentious, pompous bilge.She was not. She was speaking for herself and those in her North London liberal bubble.The BBC demands that its presenters remain neutral on political matters.Obviously, they don’t. But at least they usually pretend to. Maitlis can’t even manage that. Anyway, the complaints flooded in to Auntie.If this was the first time she’d crossed the line then maybe we might be a little lenient. But it’s not. Far from it.Last September, for example, she managed to force the BBC into that very rarest of things — a public apology, for her appalling behaviour and bias.In an interview she conducted on the programme she was, the BBC concluded, “sneering and bullying”, she was “too persistent and bullying” and “failed to be even-handed”.That was a landmark judgment. I have it framed on the wall of my downstairs khazi. Because the person she had been interviewing was ME.I had turned up to do a debate about Brexit. I was met with a wall of vituperation and abuse that even embarrassed the bloke I was supposed to be debating with, an affable Remainer chap called Tom Baldwin.The BBC warned Newsnight, its hopeless editor and Maitlis that such a breach of neutrality must not happen in the future.It has happened again. So what are they going to do about it  The BBC has admitted Newsnight got it terribly wrong.And will do nothing. Again.Here’s the other thing. I was sacked by the BBC for breaching its code of neutrality. Rightly.I had written an article about how much I hated fox hunting and fox hunters, right at the time the Government was planning to ban the cruel, obnoxious sport.The BBC was right then. But at least I hadn’t broadcast those views on the BBC itself, or allowed them to influence the programme I edited, the Today programme. It was just stuff I wrote in a leftie newspaper.Maitlis broadcasts her idiotic views on her programme!The BBC has to be consistent about this or drop the pretence of neutrality altogether.And for Emily — have some guts, woman.You want a  for your views  Go work for a radio station in the private sector, or get a newspaper column,you can.The BBC has, in the main, behaved well over Covid. But always with the exception of Newsnight.Always with the exception of Maitlis.IF you remember, just before lockdown, it was rumoured that the Spice Girls might get back together.There were gigs planned for next month.“Christ help us,” we all thought. And then we all got down on our knees and thanked Covid for scuppering that idea.Now, however, lockdown looks like it will be eased. Which means they might well fix some new dates. Yikes, etc.I suppose we could tell them the latest scientic news. Singing, apparently, is really bad for spreading the virus everywhere.Choirs and stuff have been banned in some countries. So we could try that line.But then I suppose Sporty and Co might well reply: “You could hardly call what we do singing.”DID you see those hacks questioning the Prime Minister’s adviser, Dominic Cummings on Monday One after another they all stepped up, wreathed in self-importance.And all asked exactly the same question. Over and over again. And therefore got exactly the same response.What the hell is the point of that Did they all think that they would be the only person to ask: “Why is it one law for you and one law for everyone , Mr Cummings ”Did they think they were dead clever coming up with that line Incredible. Thick as a plate of mince, some of us journos.GLORY, glory. Denmark is to open its borders once again.You can travel to the countryyou can prove that you’re dating someone Danish.In my case I think I’d choose one of the models Maja Krag or Terese Pagh Teglgaard – crazy names, crazy girls. I don’t know how I’d prove it to the Danish customs people.Maybe just show them a photoshopped picture of me and Maja out on the town.Anyway, that’syou WANT to visit Denmark.I went there once and was pretty underwhelmed. It was like a middle-class version of Lincolnshire.SO what exactly have YOU accomplished during lockdown A few jigsaw puzzles and watched the entirety of Netflix Listen to this. In  the Bubonic Plague struck London once again.

He also attempted to master Japanese during two seasons at League club Nagoya Grampus Eight.Gary explains why sticking to your mother tongue could be an own goal, both on and off the pitch . . .MASTERING a language is one of the most important things you can do.That became apparent to me when, on arriving in Spain, I decided to buy some furniture.Keen that my bedside cabinets had drawers, I asked the shop assistantthey had two tables “con cojones”.The poor woman burst out laughing and explained that in Spanish, drawers are “cajones” not “cojones” — I’d accidentally asked for two tables with testicles.I couldn’t speak a word of Spanish when I signed for Barcelona but I knew I needed to learn the lingo.I had realised that players at foreign clubs who immerse themselves in the culture do better on the pitch than those who don’t.I looked to greats such as Kevin Keegan, who learned German when he joined Hamburg, and Ray Wilkins, who mastered Italian at AC Milan.Then there were others — who I won’t name — who were lured abroad just for the bigger pay packet back in the day and barely lasted a season.I’d studied a small amount of French and German at school but I was so focused on becoming a footballer I didn’t put the effort in.I had a bit of a wake-up call over my lack of language skills on my first day of training.It’s a shock to the system being in a changing room full of blokes bantering and you have no idea what they are saying.Luckily, the team took me under their wing. On the bus to the training grounds Barcelona keeper Andoni Zubizarreta drew a stick man and woman and taught me all the body parts.To get a firmer grip on the language I avoided the ex-pat nightclubs out there and enrolled in a Spanish language class with my then we Michelle and my team-mate Mark Hughes.Poor Mark was only  and struggled with the classes. I think he dropped out after two or three but Michelle and I stuck with it.For two years, three times a week after training, we’d go to school to learn Spanish.It was tough at first as no English was allowed in the classroom, but looking back it did me a world of good.I started playing football when I was small and the skills came naturally. Learning a language was the opposite. It was really hard work and not something that came easily to me.So I made sure I read Spanish newspapers every day and watched the local TV stations. In two months I could get by. After six months I was getting pretty good and in a year I was speaking pretty much fluently.By the time I left in  I was thinking and dreaming in Spanish.From the get go, I made sure I did my post-match interviews in the local language.EvenI didn’t always make sense, it sent out a strong message to the club that I was there for the long haul.Being able to talk to fans gained me a lot of respect and appreciation when I was over there.And when a match goes badly, the pitch can be a really lonely place. But because I was able to speak to my team-mates, it helped me through some tough times.When I went to play for Nagoya Grampus Eight in  it was a whole other story.I took eight months of Japanese lessons before I went out there, and did classes there too. But it is a very dficult language, with a completely dferent alphabet.I learned enough to get by but I was nowhere near as good at Japanese as I was with Spanish.It’s been more than  years since I lived in Barcelona and I’ll admit my Spanish is a bit rusty.Nowadays when I go there I’ll try to speak the language but Spaniards always want to speak to me in English.So many foreigners speak English that it can seem a pointless exercise trying to pick up another tongue.As a nation, we are not great at learning a second language, we can rest on our laurels slightly.But I would argue that it’s more important now than ever to learn, and at the moment we’ve all got the time to spare.Having a second language opens up so many opportun­ities to you and your kids, whether that’s working abroad or in hospitality in the UK.Travel might be shut at the moment, but that won’t be the case for ever and you’ll be giving your family a leg-up during this downtime.Children’s brains are like sponges, they pick up languages so much faster and better when they are younger.And there are so many online tools and courses that I wish I’d had at my disposal when I was first learning.Although I’d always warn against online translation tools — they give a very literal translation which doesn’t always make sense.For example,you type “it’s raining cats and dogs” into Google Translate it won’t mean anything to a foreigner in their own language.Getting kids to do anything can be tricky, as I’m sure mums and dads who are homeschooling have realised by now.In my Celebrity Supply Teacher episode I teach counting to ten in Spanish by doing keepy-ups.Soyou make it fun, it opens up an exciting new world for youngsters which doesn’t involve sitting at a desk.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

On  April , Mr Cummings drove approximately  miles from his father’s property to Barnard Castle with his we and son. He stated on  May  that the purpose of this drive was to test his resilience to drive to London the following day, including whether his eyesight was sufficiently recovered, his period of self-isolation having ended.Durham Constabulary have examined the circumstances surrounding the journey to Barnard Castleand have concluded that there might have been a minor breach of the Regulations that would have warranted police intervention. Durham Constabulary view this as minor because there was no apparent breach of social distancing.Had a Durham Constabulary police officer stopped Mr Cummings driving to or from Barnard Castle, the officer would have spoken to him, and, having established the facts, likely advised Mr Cummings toto the address in Durham, providing advice on the dangers of travelling during the pandemic crisis. Had this advice been accepted by Mr Cummings, no enforcement action would have been taken.In line with Durham Constabulary’s general approach throughout the pandemic, there is no intention to take retrospective action in respect of the Barnard Castle incident since this would amount to treating Mr Cummings dferently from other members of the public.Durham Constabulary has not taken retrospective action against any other person.By way of further context, Durham Constabulary has followed Government guidance on management of alleged breaches of the regulations with the emphasis on the NPCC and College of Policing Es: Engage, Explain and Encourage before Enforcement.Finally, commentary in the media has suggested that Mr Cummings was in Durham on  April . Mr Cummings denies this and Durham Constabulary have seen insufficient evidence to support this allegation.Therefore Durham Constabulary will take no further action in this matter and has informed Mr Cummings of this decision.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

suggesting they have already had the bug.The ONS Infection Survey offers a snapshot of infections over the period of May  to May .The findings show that . per cent of  people who gave blood samples developed antibodies to the virus - thats around one in  people - or , million in England or .million across the UK.As well as antibody tests, swab tests - that detect who currently has the virus - were carried out.Swabs were taken from , people and found . per cent had coronavirus at the time of being tested, between May  and May  - thats equivalent to , people nationwide.There were around , new infections per week during this period - meaning the outbreak is still relatively stable, according to the ONS.The figures only cover private households and dont include those in hospitals, care homes or other institutional settings where infection rates are expected to be higher.The findings also showed of those who tested positive for Covid- over the study period,  per cent reported suffering symptoms on the day of their test.Peter Benton, from ONS, said it means there could be people who are infectious but do not know it, because they dont have the tell-tale signs.The study suggests that almost  per cent of people may have been asymptomatic, when tested.But the experts who carried out the survey, which was released today, said that this is figure is likely to be closer to  per cent.Prof Sarah Walker, from the Nuffield Department of Medicine at the University of Oxford, told reporters that this may be because people have recovered from symptoms by the time they are tested.Speaking at a media briefing, she said: We can detect the virus before people know, or it may be three or four days before, they had a cough but by the time they had a test the cough was gone.We feel the  per cent is a more reliable answer - not just at that time point but around it -  per cent had symptoms, so  per cent didnt.Mr Benton added: Therefore, social distancing continues to be important.What I have drawn from this is that I potentially could be positive and not know it and I dont want to pass it on to someone  unknowingly.If I am asymptomatic and positive I may not be very infectious but I dont want to take the chance.Based on the results of people tested since the start of the study, which began on April , the ONS estimates that there were . new infections per  people for one week.This is equivalent to an average of , positive cases per week for people living in private-residential households in England.The ONS said that the change in this figure compared with the results from the survey published last week is relatively small.It should be interpreted that the number of new infections in England is relatively stable, the ONS said.The ONS survey also found . per cent of  people tested had developed antibodies to the bug in their blood.Prof Walker said tracking antibody levels through the ongoing study will help to give an idea of how long people might have these antibodies.We hope that the positive tests that we see in the study should translate into future antibody levels coming up, she said.We will see antibody levels rise in those people who have had those swab tests and it will be very interesting and important to see how long these levels are raised for.Does that response carry on, is it the case that actually once you have had it you have some degree of immunity for a long period of time or do you have very transient immunity and it drops off That could be one reason why you might be able to get it again.Scientists believe that while the presence of antibodies indicates a level of immunity, it is unclear whether people are completely protected and how long any immunity may last.People were asked whether they had experienced a range of possible symptoms on the day they were tested.Over the course of the study, almost three per cent who said they had experienced one or more symptoms of Covid- tested positive.The percentage of people testing positive for Covid- was higher for those who reported specically having a cough or fever, or loss of taste or smell on the day of testing than for any other symptom.Of those reporting these specic symptoms, . per cent also tested positive for the bug.This compares with an estimate of . per cent of those who did not have the three key coronavirus symptoms.The ONS said it continues to find no evidence of dferences in the proportions of men or women testing positive for Covid-.But it did find there were stark dferences when it came to whether people were working at home or roles out in the community.Patient-facing healthcare workers and resident-facing social care workers were found to have higher rates of positive tests than people not working in these roles.While those working outside the home had higher rates of positive tests than those who work from home, the data found.It also revealed that while those who have symptoms are more likely to test positive than those without symptoms, out of those within the study who have ever tested positive for Covid-,  per cent reported any symptoms on the day of testing.The analysis was produced by the ONS in partnership with the University of Oxford, the University of Manchester, Public Health England and Wellcome Trust.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Mostof the adults had mild symptoms in around one in ten, symptoms were severe, and one person became critically ill.Daily use of disinfectants, window opening, and keeping at least one metre apart were associated with a lower risk of passing on the virus, even in more crowded households.However, in particular, the researchers noted that a face mask worn before symptoms started was  per cent effective, and disinfection  per cent effective, at stopping the virus from being passed on.The authors acknowledge some limitations to their study, which was published in BMJ Global Health, as telephone interviews are subject to recall and the strength of household disinfectants and bleach used wasnt recorded.Despite this, they suggest the findings back universal face mask use, not just in public spaces, but also at home.And the findings may also be relevant for families living with someone in quarantine or in enforced social isolation, and for the families of health workers who may face an ongoing risk of infection, they say.This study confirms the highest risk of household transmission being prior to symptom onset, but that precautionary [non-pharmaceutical interventions], such as mask use, disinfection and social distancing in households can prevent Covid- transmission during the pandemic, independent of household size or crowding, they write.Household transmission is a major driver of epidemic growth, they point out, adding that their findings could be used to inform precautionary guidelines for families to reduce intrafamilial transmission in areas where there is high community transmission or other risk factors for Covid-.Despite this, Professor Trish Greenhalgh, Professor of Primary Health Care Services at the University of Oxford, says the researchers findings must be weighed against the practicalities and the absolute risks involved.She said: In localities where the incidence of Covid- is high, people might feel this measure is worth the inconvenience, especiallythere is a vulnerable family member.Where the incidence of the disease is low, the balance between benefits and hassles may lean more towards the latter.Currently, the World Health Organizationhavent endorsed the wearing of face masks indoors or outdoors, on the grounds that theres little good quality evidence to warrant recommending this.Earlier this month, Brits were told to wear face coverings in public to prevent the spread of coronavirus.Boris Johnson said that homemade masks should be worn in enclosed spaces where social distancing isn’t possible or where you may come into contact with people from outside of your household.It includes public transport and in some shops, the Prime Ministers -page roadmap to get the UK out of lockdown revealed.The Department of Health said that after considering the latest scientic advice from Sage, face coverings can help reduce the spread of Covid-.They stressed that the evidence shows face coverings can stop you passing coronavirus on to others,you are asymptomatic or have yet to develop symptoms.Its unlikely they will stop you catching the bug.TfL also said all passengers and staff would need to wear masks on the Underground, and advised people avoided busy times.No  stressed that face coverings could include scarves and homemade masks - and added surgical masks used as vital PPE should be left for NHS and healthcare workers.The guidelines state that children under the age of two should not wear masks, nor should anyone who may find it dficult to manage them safely.

Every day I walked down the corridor of my high school in New Zealand to that sort of abuse. “F***ing faggot.” “You poofter.” “Bum boy.” You can imagine.I became prepared for it and engineered a steely exterior. But each incident made it harder for me to be the person I knew I wanted to be and even more aware I was an outsider in a world where straight men dominate.While attitudes are thankfully changing, they still extend across many industries.One of my early bosses in newspapers told me recently that an editor had resisted hiring “the poof” .Luckily, that boss — a mentor during my career who happens to be straight — held firm and didn’t accept such blatant homophobia.I’m never one to moan about a lack of ersity or embrace identity politics — all minorities have to fight to overcome stereotypes. Taking on a victim mentality doesn’t help, which is why I never have.But it’s far too simplistic to look at Queer Eye, Graham Norton and Tom Daley then declare homophobia doesn’t strangle careers even now.That said, Adrian Chiles’ illuminating interview in The Sun this week with Luke Tuffs, who came out as a teenage player at Camberley Town in Surrey, provides reason for hope.Now manager of Ashford Town, he revealed that when he first told his team-mates in a drunken moment of madness they were “absolutely cool” about his sexuality. Of course, there’s “savage” banter in the “un-PC” dressing rooms but he explained: “I don’t think it comes from malice — it comes from love.”In fact, I’d hazard a guess the banter would be just as brutala player had ginger hair, an overweight girlfriend or a small willy. Banter is a prized part of British le and must not be wiped out by the snowflake brigade. It’s very dferent to abuse.The closeted players should also look to Phillip Schofield’s coming out announcement. What the This Morning host probably believed was going to be a le-changing event, dominating his every waking moment, has now been largely shrugged off. It was a damp squib in the best possible way.Sure, Phillip is gay. But he’s still hosting This Morning with Holly and that’s what people talk about. We don’t care who he is sleeping with.It is, of course, a deeply personal choice, but I would encourage footballers living miserably in the closet to try to change the way they think about coming out. Being the first will give them an opportunity no one  will ever have.While some archaic football fans may not be ready for it, I genuinely believe the vast majority of the country and our culture truly is.The opportunities will be limitless. The love will be overwhelming.Thirty years of fear will be turned on its head. We just need one brave announcement.Andwe’re not careful the red tape and draconian restrictions will kill off an already struggling high street.Take shoe shops, where staff will have to quarantine any footwear tried on for  hours.If you’ve worked in retail you’ll know how damn impractical that is.And,we’re being guided by the science, who the heck has ever contracted coronavirus via their toes while wearing socks Clothes shoppers will not be able to try on items in a changing room. Why not just order on Amazon then Estimates suggest these corona-ready measures will also cost companies. A lot.

The official guidance reads: If people can’t work from home, employers must ensure any self-isolating employee is receiving sick pay and give them the option to use their paid leave daysthey prefer. There are fears that many workers will not be able to afford to isolate becuse statutory sick pay is just £ a week and millions of workers are not eligible for it. TUC general secretary Frances OaposGrady said: We need a testing and tracing programme up and running as soon as possible. But it will not be effectiveworkers are pushed into hardship when they are required to self-isolate. Statutory sick pay is just £ per week - and two million workers arenapost even eligible for that. If workers canapost afford to self-isolate, then they will be forced to keep working. That will put them, their workmates and their local community at risk, and undermine the entire Test and Trace programme.  The Government must extend statutory sick pay to everyone - no matter what theyaposre paid - and raise it to the level of the real Living Wage, £ per week. And the self-employed income support scheme must remain in place as a source of financial support for those forced to self-isolate. Thataposs how to show that we really are all in this together. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth called for enhanced sick pay when he was asked about the new system and people being expected to self-isolate for  dayscontacted.

A spokeswoman for the DWP said: This Government has provided an unprecedented package of support to help people through this pandemic including injecting £. billion into the welfare system, rolling out income protection schemes, mortgage holidays and additional support for renters. Weaposve made sick pay more generous by starting it from day one and will refund employers with up to  staff the cost of up to two weeksapos sick pay.  Employers can, and many do, pay more than the statutory rate - something we encourage. Dame Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said the Government must ensure people do not face a sudden drop in incomethey have to self-isolate under the Test and Trace system. She said: Problems with our system for sick pay are long-standing. Even for those eligible for statutory sick pay, it may not be enough to cover essential living costs. The Government must look to extend statutory sick pay to those who arenapost currently eligible. People need enough to live on so they can self-isolateasked to without fear of being pushed into hardship.

The Prime Minister confirmed that all five tests required for the next phase of restrictions to begin have been met, meaning more pupils canto school and outdoor retail and car showrooms can open from Monday in England. Mr Johnson outlined that people would be able to see both parents at once, or both grandparents at once in what he said would be a long-awaited and joyful moment for many.  Englandaposs primary schools will widen the number of pupils they are taking.The plan will see classrooms reopen in stages, beginning with reception, Year  and Year . Years  to  wouldlater in June. More than two dozen councils with more than , primary schools between them have warned they may not reopen on June . And the government has admitted schools wonapost open in a unorm way across the country. Soyou are in any doubt, you should check in with your childaposs schools about their plans. Secondary pupils in years  and , could go back in some limited form a few weeks later, but secondary schools are not expected to open fully until September. Shops  June Outdoor markets Car showroomsThis will happen from June  onwards, as soon as they are able to meet the COVID- secure guidelines to protect shoppers and workers. June  ALL other non-essential retail can reopen from this date including :Clothes shops Shoe shops Toy shops Furniture shops Bookshops Electronics Tailors Auction houses Photography studios Indoor marketsFriends and family   From Monday, groups of up to six people can meet outside. Those from dferent households must stay two metres apart from each other, in line with social distancing rules. People will also be allowed to meet in gardens and other private outdoor spaces. Boris Johnson said that, to best control the virus, people should avoid seeing people from too many households in quick succession. He also reiterated that people should not be inside the homes of their friends and families, unless it is to access the garden. The Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty said thatpeople needed to use the toilet while in someoneaposs garden then all surfaces shwould be wiped down afterwards.He also warned about the importance of washing hands - especiallypeople are potentially handing items such as during a BBQ.ShieldingJohnson said it was too early for the most vulnerable, who have been asked to shield themselves to avoid infection, to be allowed greater social interactions. He said they were looking at how to make the lives of the clinically vulnerable easier and was hoping to have more to say soon. Chief medical officer for England Professor Chris Whitty offered the prospect at the Downing Street briefing on Thursday that infection levels may be low enough for them to leave home shortly. And we will get to a stage, we hope relatively soon, where the absolute risk of people has gone down to a low enough level it will be possible in stages for people to leave shielding, he said. Prof Whitty stressed that it was number of infections that need to come down rather than the R rate of transmission in order to reduce the risk of infection to the vulnerable.

The current social distancing rules of m make it almost impossible for many of these outlets to operate.Although some have switched to providing take aways.   Despite earlier advice that pubs would have to wait longer than even restaurants and cafes, pubs were thrown a leline last week. Environment Secretary George Eustice said he wanted pubs to tentatively start gradually opening in July with social distancing in place. Meanwhile, scientists have warned some social distancing rules may have to remain until thereaposs a vaccine, making much of pub le impossible. Staycations  The Government do however have hopes holidaymakers might be able to take UK staycations from July.

Seven out of  people want Downing Street lackey Dominic Cummings sacked after flagrantly breaching “stay at home” rules. They’re right, but they don’t go far enough. The real villain is not dastardly Dom. It is Boris Johnson. He put political and class loyalty to his Svengali “special adviser” ahead of the national interest. He has presided over the most chaotic, least successful, campaign against coronavirus in Europe. He scrapped test-and-trace in mid-March, and undermined the policy even before it restarted, confusing the population with mixed messages. Forget the monkey. It’s the organ grinder who is the guilty man. The Prime Minister should go, and take his numpty Cabinet accomplices with him. Weeks ago, I called them second rate. I was wrong. They’re fourth rate. It will not happen, of course, because boastful Bojo is sitting on a big Commons majority and political turkeys – not even wattle-quivering Tory MPs – do not vote for Christmas.

This is an important milestone on the journey back to normal le. It means friends can be reunited and families can once again see relatives they have been separated from. Shops will soon start to reopen and Premier League football is coming back. The fact we have reached this stage is a tribute to the resilience and sacrices by the vast majority of the country. It is a shame the same dedication has not been shown by those in the Government. The UK has the highest death rate of any comparable nation. Boris Johnson promised we would have a world-beating test-and-trace programme in place by June . As it stands, it is unlikely to be fully operational until the end of next month. The missteps and mistakes by ministers stand in contrast to the huge collective effort made by the public. Ruled out If you are a rule maker, you shouldn’t be a rule breaker. That concept is understood by everyone apart from the occupants of No. Dominic Cummings “may” have breached lockdown laws by travelling to Barnard Castle. Anyone with an ounce of dignity would have realised this would be a resignation matter. Any PM who cared about standards in public le would have regarded this as a sackable offence. Yet Cummings is refusing to quit and Johnson is too shameless to sack him. One senior Tory MP fearsthe public take their lead from Cummings, there is a risk lives will be lost. The fact Johnson cannot understand this is as appalling as his failure to recognise right from wrong.

Would it work  Would anyone be there  In a miracle of modern technology now familiar to families across the UK, a smiling face appeared, a little blurred by my wi signal. Raja Khan, a -year-old law student and entrepreneur. A Conservative voter and enthusiastic Leaver, to my Remain-voting, Labour member self. Our conversation began as all video calls must – “can you hear me ” Raja was  miles away in Leicester, living with his mum who had moved in with him so she wouldn’t be alone during lockdown. He was wearing a smart suit, after a day at work via zoom. I was in a t-shirt, full of euphoric relief that the thing had worked. To kick off, we tackled one of the questions set by the Behavioural Insights Team for Britain Connects. Who would we invite to a zoom dinner party and why  Raja went for Napoleon Hill, the Depression era author of ‘Think and Grow Rich’. I went for Nelson Mandela. So far so polarised. But I liked Raja’s second choice, Aldous Huxley. Raja wanted to ask the author what he made of our Brave New World. It’s one of my favourite books, and I’d have been fascinated to meet him. Born in Hong Kong, where some of his ancestors had arrived from India, Raja has a very global perspective.We had a fascinating chat about Brexit. Raja is studying EU law and is passionate about the lack of accountability in the way UK laws were governed from Brussels. He had even campaigned door to door for Leave in his local area. But he shared my concerns about racism during the time of the campaign and had even experienced it, “asthey hadn’t noticed Iaposm not white”. I’ve been as profoundly moved by this year’s project over Whereby – a videocall  – as I was by last year’s Britain Talks, where people were able to meet in person.For Britain Connects, some pairs matched by our  gave us the immense privilege of listening in to their meetings, giving us an extraordinary window through which to view people’s dfering experiences of the coronavirus. All of us are having very dferent experiences of the pandemic – whether we are key workers, working from home, home-schooling, furloughed, unemployed, shielding, young or old, too busy or too isolated. From accountants to zumba teachers, farmers to artists, this was a chance to hear about someone ’s unique experience of the last nine weeks. As Harish Sharma, , said to his match Janina Bacon: “Before this we wouldn’t have got involved in something like this. You don’t know me from Adam, I don’t know you - but here we are. I didn’t know what to expect… and it’s great.”  One of the interesting things about the project has been how many people have been prepared to talk about loneliness, and often not in ways we might expect. The loneliness of the nurse who spends days with intubated unconscious patients. The isolation of the supermarket worker behind glass, or the care-worker trapped behind a mask. And it has been moving to hear from disabled and elderly people, impacted by shielding to such a degree that many have seen no one for almost three months.  Diane Eubanks, , from urban Leeds, met Susan Wilkes,  from a rural village in Oxfordshire through Britain Connects. Diane voted Remain in the  referendum, while Susan voted Leave. Yet both shared very similar experiences of lockdown as shielding disabled women who live alone. Diane asked Susan, when she last felt lonely. “Probably most of the time since lockdown,” Susan said. “I usually meet friends for lunch every day. Recently I started to see a close friend of mine who is blind, so I can drop food items off for him from my own food parcels.” Afterwards Susan said she’d like to give Diane a hug. “I am so glad I have taken part in Britain Connects because I have made a new friend,” Diane said. “Can you hear me ” is the modern zoom phenomenon summed up. But it’s also how we all feel. We need to be heard by each other, and that also involves being able to listen. Of course, Raja and I already had one thing in common. We’d both been prepared to take a leap of faith into the unknown to meet each other. “The coronavirus is changing us,” Raja said. “Look at what we’re doing now. I would never have done this normally. I would love to do lots of these meetings and meet all kinds of people who are experiencing le and lockdown dferently. People need to meet people who are dferent. We need to come together somehow.” "},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus updates live pandemic uk","story":"NewsCoronavirus LIVE updates: New UK lockdown rules to see families meet in gardensBoris Johnson has announced a further easing of the lockdown rules and barbecues may be back on for some, with people allowed to meet up to six people outdoors under certain conditionsShareByJoseph WilkesReporterUpdated:,  MAY Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news politics video boris-johnson-says-up-six-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,evergreenArticle:,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news coronavirus-updates-live-pandemic-uk-\"\" data-chronos-request-url\"https:livecentreps-cdn-prod.tm-awx v live-centre nationals-live \" data-embedded-url-endpoint\"https:www.mirror news uk-news coronavirus-updates-live-pandemic-uk- serviceresponsiveembeddedArticleUrl\" data-chronos-domain\"https:livecentreps-cdn-prod.tm-awx \" data-inview\"true\"The Prime Minister today said outdoor gatherings of up to six people will be permitted - so long as people from dferent households remain two metres away from each other.People will also be allowed to meet in gardens and other private outdoor spaces under certain conditions.

Barbara and Simon Campbell bought the Grade II-listed manor house with  acres of land for £, in . Council bosses are now set to approve proposals for a quarry  yards away to extract a million tons of sand. Barbara, , and Simon, , may be powerless due to planning permission dating back more than  years. The mum and dad said they were not made aware of the authorisation when they bought the derelict building. Barbara said: “Everything has been hunky-dory… We then discovered the field next to us has dormant planning permission for a quarry. We couldn’t believe it. “The whole site has been covered by two planning applications, one dating back to  and the other from . “The fact this was effectively an existing quarry should have been ­available to us at the time we bought the property. It’s the unfairness and the lack of transparency that really galls us.”  The pair, who run an engineering firm and brought up their three kids, Megan and Rosie, both , and Alasdair, , in the house, are trying to stop the development, which they think may dramatically reduce the value of the property. They are also worried about possible health implications, such as cancer, feared to be caused by dust. They painstakingly renovated the six-bedroom home in Grantham, Lincolnshire. The land also has two lakes.

Boris Johnson today told the nation that as of Monday, people will be allowed to meet in groups of six outdoors as long as they maintain the m distance, schools will begin to see a phased , and outdoor markets and car showrooms will open in England. But during the daily press conference this afternoon, a member of the public asked how and when the lockdown would be eased for the extremely vulnerable. Jay, , from Horsham, who is shielding with her -year-old son, also told the Downing Street briefing she felt that people like her had been forgotten. Chief medical officer for England Professor Chris Whitty said it is hoped that relatively soon the number of infections will be low enough to start letting shielded people leave home. But it appears we are not quite there yet. Prof Whitty said the number of infections must come down to reduce the risk for the shielded and vulnerable. And we will get to a stage, we hope relatively soon, where the absolute risk of people has gone down to a low enough level it will be possible in stages for people to leave shielding, he said. In mid-March the Government specied a group of people in England who needed to be aposshieldedapos due to their exceptional vulnerability to Covid-.  There is believed to be .million people in England who are “shielded”.These are the people who were told mid-March to stay indoors for  weeks due to a specic medical condition that makes them vulnerable to coronavirus.They have been told to stay at home at all times, not even leaving for exercise or to pick up essential goods.

Troy House in Monmouth, which dates back to the th century had a guide price of £, - but a last-minute bidding war saw the cost swell to more than six times that figure. As well as the huge number of bedrooms, it also boasts a theatre, chapel and two tennis courts. But bargain hunters had earlier been warned that it would need extensive refurbishment - with shocking pictures showing the level to which it had deteriorated. It was built for the family of the Duke of Beaufort, but was later converted into a school.  Listed by  Allsop, the property has  bedrooms, four dormitories, a principalaposs flat, a staff flat, a caretakeraposs flat, a two storey hostel block, outbuildings and garages.The picturesque setting and grand exterior belie the true scale of the renovation job required, with photos of the interior showing floorboards and structures rotten through, with a huge clearance job needed to clear the abandoned school furniture. The description reads: The property is presented in a poor state of repair and requires extensive works of modernisation and refurbishment. The property may afford possible potential for redevelopment and or a number of alternative uses, subject to obtaining all necessary consents. Itaposs located a short journey from the historic market town of Monmouth, with both Cardf and Bristol city centres also accessible.Richard Adamson, partner and auctioneer at Allsop, said before the auction: Troy House has received a signicant amount of interest with over  enquiries regarding the property, in just over a week of coming to the market. We have seen a mixed-bag of interest from people who could use the property for multiple uses including as a private home, converting into a boutique hotel and spa, or refurbished into luxury apartments, subject to planning.

Attractions such as Camelot theme park were unable to compete with the likes of Alton Towers and Thorpe Park, and had to shut down completey.Since closing, many have been reclaimed by nature while others have made way for new developments, reports the  MEN.One thing each of these places has in common is that they now only exist in memories. This is what happened after the gates closed for the final time. Camelot, Lancashire Based on the King Arthur’s medieval Camelot castle, this theme park welcomed thousands of visitors every year, boasting a ft rollercoaster called the Knightmare. Camelot was also home to a log flume, The Twister, three large water slides and a large caterpillar rollercoaster train which spanned the entireand depth of the park. The park closed in , leaving its sprawling -acre site to fall into disrepair. Many of the rides were sold to parks around Europe, but others - including Knightmare - were left behind. Now abandoned, Camelot has become a playground for urban explorers. Ocean Beach, Rhyl Ocean Beach saw thousands of visitors at the height of the British summer holiday, so popular that it had to relocate in  from Marine Lake to a bigger space at the end of the promenade. The park features rides including the Ghost Train, a s vintage toy set, and Britain’s first ever tubular steel rollercoaster. In its final years there was little investment in new rides or attractions, and Ocean Beach closed for the final time in September . There is nothing left of what was once a popular amusement park, with a new retail park now standing in its place. Frontierland, Lancashire This complex in Morecambe operated for almost  years, rebranding in the s during the height of the theme park era with a western theme. Frontierland was home to several popular rides and attractions, including the famous Polo Tower, a -feet-tall tower sponsored by Polo Minds, a skyride, a log flume and a runaway mine train. However, a decline in visitor numbers led to the park closing in . Most of the rides were demolished, dismantled or sold on. A retail area was built on part of the site, though plans for a full shopping park and leisure complex are still on hold, despite planning permission being granted several years ago. American Adventure, Derbyshire  Once home to several white knuckle rides which featured top rollercoasters like The Missle, Twin Looper and Nightmare Niagara, American Adventure is sorely missed. The park was rebranded in  to cater for younger children but by  it had closed down and many of the rides sold off. What remained of American Adventure was left to rot. Despite a petition to rebuild it, the park has now been demolished and the land is being prepared for building work to start on  homes, a hotel, retirement village, leisure facilities and offices. Belle Vue Zoological Gardens and fairground, Manchester With a  year letime, this park wowed millions with its exotic blend of wild animals, circus freaks and dizzying rollercoasters. Though it started out as a small private collection of birds in , the park blossomed into Manchester’s own theme park. Belle Vue Zoological Gardens and fairground was home to animals such as Asian elephants and chimpanzees, and a range of rides offering great views from the top. Spiralling debt saw the zoo close its gates in  and its attractions were dismantled. What was left of the site was demolished in  and now nothing remains. Blobbyland, Somerset Based on the popular Saturday night TV show Noel’s House Party, which was set in the fictional village of Crinkley Bottom, Blobbyland was opened at Cricket St Thomas in Somerset. In the height of Blobbymania, when the pink spotty sidekick starred in the the show, it featured a range of Mr Blobby themed attractions. Rides included the Animals of Farthing Wood, a safari ride, a deer park and Dubblobbin, Mr Blobby’s house which was painted bright pink with yellow spots and a blue roof. The park closed in  following dwindling attendance figures but in the years that followed many attempted to break into the empty site. Efforts were made by the owners to stop people breaking in, including blocking up an access tunnel, but the site was eventually demolished in . Pleasure Island, Cleethorpes  Once home to Cleethorpes Zoo, Pleasure Island launched in  with a range of family attractions covering the -acre site.

Emma McClarkin, chief executive of the British Beer and Pub Association , warned however thatthe two-metre guidance remains, just one-third could reopen their doors. She said the industry would then face further financial misery and ruin. Miss McClarkin, whose organisation represents about , UK pubs and the majority of brewers, said the required distance should be reduced to at least one metre, as in several European countries and advised by the World Health Organisation . But she said weaposre not asking unless itaposs safe to do. The struggling hospitality sector was given a flicker of hope after Boris Johnson hinted on Wednesday that restaurants, hotels and bars could potentially reopen earlier than planned after he asked scientists to review the two-metre rule.Miss McClarkin said: Weaposre not asking unless itaposs safe to do. It is an internationally recognised standard of one metre, used in France, Italy and Denmark, which allows some kind of normality. Pubs are currently on a very highly tuned Government le-support machine. The longer they remain on it, and with all the other medicines they have to pay for, some wonapost survive. Once pubs close they are very, very hard to resuscitate. Miss McClarkin said polling of BBPA members showed about % could not survive until Septemberthey remained closed, and the pub sector was burning through roughly £ million in cash every month during lockdown. Under current plans, pubs, hotels and restaurants remain closed until at least July . Miss McClarkin, a former Conservative MEP for the East Midlands region, said polling of members also showed just one-third could re-open under two-metre guidelines, with that figure jumping to more than %it is dropped to one metre.  At the Commons Liaison Committee on Wednesday, Mr Johnson told MPs the scientic advisory group for emergencieshad been told to review the guidance. He said: My own hope is that as we make progress in getting the virus down, in reducing the incidence, that we will be able to reduce that distance, which I think will be particularly valuable in transport and clearly the hospitality sector. Mr Johnson said advice from Sage remains that there is a very considerable reduction in risk at two metres.  Public Health Englandaposs medical director, Professor Yvonne Doyle, has said the UK took a cautionary approach to introducing the rule when other countries were using shorter distances. She told the Science and Technology Select Committee: We are aware of the international dferences and I am sure this will be the subject of continued investigation as to whether two metres is actually necessary or whether that can be reduced further. Miss McClarkin said bars have spent lockdown assessing how to keep staff and customers safe, looking at deep cleaning regimes and options including limited bar service to reduce transmission.

Mr Johnson also urged people to avoid seeing too many people from too many households in quick succession, but said further guidance would follow. He also said those who were shielding for health reasons should continue to do so.  Mr Johnson said that the governmentaposs five tests required to ease the lockdown - protecting the NHS, lowering the daily death rate, decreasing the number of new infections, increasing testing capacity, and preventing a second peak - are being met. But he said the easing of lockdown will be limited - and warned thatthere is a rise in infections, strict measures will be brought back in.

As they wait for the green light, pubs are looking at ways of making their premises safe for when they can reopen with measures like screens and one-way systems. For updates on coronavirus, follow our live blog HERE.  Last week, pub giant Wetherspoonaposs said it will spend an initial £ million making its  pubs Covid- secure, ahead of reopening, including screens at bars and tables. The chain said each pub will hire two full-time workers to regularly clean surfaces and touch-points throughout, with more employed in larger pubs. Manchester bar Albert’s Schloss, meanwhile, yesterday revealed the measures it’s putting in place to keep staff, customers and performers safe from Covid- when it is permitted to reopen. This could serve as a further indicator of what pubs and bars across the UK may look like in the coming months.The popular Peter Street venue has installed perspex screens between booths and at the bar, introduced a one-way system, removed tables and cut down its menu, reports the Manchester Evening News. The maximum capacity will be signicantly reduced too in order to ensure safe distancing can occur. Guests will be greeted outside by a sign displaying ’Haus rules’, a marked-out queueing system, and a beer tap-style hand sanitising station. Before being seated or served, customers will also face a temperature screening, which alerts staff to anyone with an elevated temperature. If staff suspect anyone on site is unwell - customer or otherwise - they are likely to be asked to leave and seek medical attention. Albert’s Schloss will reduce and rotate the number of staff working to keep the number of people on site to a minimum, and has appointed a ‘Covid officer’ who will be responsible for ensuring strict hygiene measures are adhered to. The customer experience will be very dferent too - diners can either order and pay for their food through an app, or nominate what Albert’s Schloss is calling a ‘table captain’ who will be given a disposable paper menu and pencil to fill out the party’s orders.  It’s then up to customers to decide how they’d like to receive their food and drinks - at designated collection points around the dining areas, or straight to the table as normal. Utensils and condiments are to be sanitised thoroughly between each customer and staff will undergo thorough hand-washing every  minutes. It comes after trade body UK Hospitalityaposs draft guidance suggested proposals including condiments would not be left on tables, with inidually wrapped sauces and condiments handed out by staff on request. Pubs and restaurants would also need to bring cutlery with customersapos food, rather than leave them on tables or allow customers to help themselves.Tables would be spaced to meet social distancing guidelines and urinals could be separated with screens or removed altogether. And smoking area patrols could be introduced. However there is hope pubs could open sooner than planned as on Wednesday, Mr Johnson told MPs the scientic advisory group for emergencieshad been told to review the guidance about social distancing. Pub trade bodies are currently pleading with the Government to minimise the two metre distancing rule to just one, with many boozers too small to make re-opening worthwhile under current guidelines. This still remains a sticking point, Mr Johnson has admitted, but said work was being done to try and reduce the recommended distance. The internationally recognised standard, used in the likes of Italy, Denmark and France, is to distance at least one metre, as advised by the World Health Organisation- despite Britain abiding by older guidance. Meanwhile, trade body UK Hospitality has put forward potential guidelines in a -page draft document after consulting with multiple industry leaders in an effort to keep customers safe - in the hope of speeding up re-opening venues.The boss of British Beer and Pub Associationhas said more than three-quarters of pubs could reopensocial distancing rules were relaxed to one metre. Chief executive Emma McClarkin warnedthe two-metre guidance remains, just one-third could reopen their doors and many would face further financial misery and ruin, warned.  Miss McClarkin, whose organisation represents about , UK pubs and the majority of brewers, said: Weaposre not asking unless itaposs safe to do. Pubs are currently on a very highly tuned Government le-support machine. The longer they remain on it, and with all the other medicines they have to pay for, some wonapost survive.

Today Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced that from Monday in England, groups of up to six people will be allowed to meet outside - as long as those who live in dferent homes stay at least two metres apart. And he said that inviting people over for a barbecue is allowed as well in a slight easing of lockdown restrictions in place since March . But going inside a home you donapost live in is still not allowed, with two exceptions. One of them is to cut through a home to get to the garden, while the other is using the bathroom. For the latest on the coronavirus pandemic, click here Professor Chris Whitty said at todayaposs daily briefing: If someone was to go into the loo, it is absolutely critical that they wipe everything down, wash their hands all the way through. He said that good hygiene is crucial once people start being more sociable. Speaking at todayaposs daily briefing Mr Johnson said: Itaposs very, very important that people understand the really limited nature of what weaposre saying.  We do want people to be able to see their friends and family, we do want people to see two grandparents at once but itaposs got to be socially distanced, thereaposs got to be a maximum of six people. He added: We donapost want people to stay overnight, we donapost want people to go to other households and stay there, Iaposm just afraid weaposre not at that stage. What you certainly can imagine is there could be meetings of families in a garden, you could even have a barbecue provided you did it in a socially-distanced way, provided everyone washes their hands, provided everybody exercises common sense.

Those two goals were fantastic for us.“It was a turning point in the season for us.

Transformation projects like VA Dundee and Eden Project Scotland are things our area needs, so it is hugely welcome news.“Dundee has been crying out for something like this and it will encourage people to stay for two or three nights because there will be lots of dferent things for them to do.“We should not underestimate the impact this will have on businesses and there will be job opportunities from building and supply.“We will be talking to businesses to see how they can take advantage of having something like this on their doorstep.”After the opening of the original Eden Project in Cornwall in , it has gone on to be a worldwide attraction and generated an estimated £bn for the local economy.Caroline Warburton, regional leadership director for VisitScotland, believes the arrival of Eden Project can only improve the city’s status as a first class visitor attraction.She said: “It is very exciting to hear that a feasibility study will be carried out into a proposed new Eden Project in Dundee.“The city’s Unesco city of design status and the phenomenal success of VA Dundee has helped to put it in the global spotlight.“The possibility of an additional attraction of this calibre would play a signicant role in supporting the city and Scotland’s economic recovery in the future, and play an important role in attracting visitors when the time is right once again.”Eden Project Scotland’s potential arrival has been mooted just two years after the opening of VA Dundee.Philip Long, director of VA Dundee, says it can only improve fortunes for the city as a whole.He said: “The coming of an Eden Project to Dundee would be an extraordinary opportunity for the city and for Scotland, not just for the audiences it would attract but also in the way it could support ever greater understanding of the natural world and the importance of a sustainable future.”Opposition politicians have welcomed the news the Eden Project could set its new home up in Dundee.Bill Bowman, Conservative MSP for the North East, said this could help revitalise some of Dundee’s most deprived areas,“At a time when so many good projects have paused in Dundee, there is another opportunity to show it is a city reinventing itself,# he said.“The Cornwall Eden is a world-leading exhibition of ideas, design and science.“I absolutely welcome these exploratory steps to establish a first for Scotland, here.”Councillor Fraser Macpherson, leader of the Liberal Democrats in Dundee, also said: “I feel there will be cross-party support for working with Eden Project International on this potentially really exciting project for Dundee.”It is hoped the proposed Eden Project could bring in a range of research and environmental opportunities to Dundee.Kevin Frediani, curator of Dundee Botanic Gardens and head of grounds at Dundee University, believes the project will bring a raft of opportunities.He said: “The Eden Project is an eco success story in terms of bringing sustainability into the public eye and all of us will welcome bringing that lens to Dundee.“As a gardener I am looking forward to all the opportunities there will be for the botanic gardens to network with Eden and complement each other, which is fantastic.“I came to Dundee because I believed there was something latent in Dundee I could unlock in the gardens, and having Eden here would allow me to do even more of that.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":null,"title":"hamilton-grammar-schools-tribute-pupil-brandon-rice","story":"THE headteacher of a pupil who collapsed at home and later died has paid touching tribute to the ldquocharismatic teenager."},{"url":null,"title":"skyes-limit-sabhal-mor-ostaig---unique-gaelic-only-college-set-stunning-island-location","story":"AS global interest in Gaelic grows, students from across the world are travelling to Skye to study at Sabhal Mograver Ostaig, the National Centre for Gaelic Language and Culture."},{"url":null,"title":"jiving-gis-glasgows-george-square---ve-day-memories","story":"BONFIRES so hot they cracked tenement windows.

visitors1","story":"National Trust properties could open again soon under Scottish Government plans to ease lockdown restrictions.The grounds of castles and other historic properties owned by the charity were closed down earlier this year due to the coronavirus pandemic.But the trust has now revealed that gardens and free-to-enter and unstaffed countryside properties could open again soon.However, the charity revealed that the sites could only be accessed at this stage by local visitors with restrictions still in place.The move could see popular sites like Fyvie Castle reopening to local visitors.Labour MSP Lewis Macdonald had written to the National Trust Scotland calling for the charity to reopen all its north-east properties to the public as soon as possible.And he urged the charity to abandon plans to make over  staff in Scotland redundant.Writing to chief executive Simon Skinner, Lewis Macdonald warned bosses against embarking on “a downward spiral of reduced public access, falling income and lost jobs.”He asked for staff to be consulted on how to keep the doors open, to talk to government agencies about opportunities for growth, and to give trust members the final say by calling an extraordinary general meeting after the lockdown was lted.Mr Macdonald said: “There is really no excuse for mass redundancies at the National Trust this summer, given that the Job Retention Scheme now extends into October. I am calling for the extended furlough period to be used to protect jobs and plan for future growth.“Keeping places like Castle Fraser, Haddo House and Fyvie Castle closed longer than the lockdown requires will cut the income of the trust, jobs will be lost and local economies in rural areas of the north-east will suffer. The doors must not close on properties like Leith Hall, where local communities have worked so hard to give these places a future.“It would seem far more sensible to plan for the new opportunities that will come after this crisis, and senior management at the National Trust need to consult their staff and their members rather than embark on a downward spiral of cuts and closures”.The National Trust launched a formal consultation with staff and its trade union, in order to make a decision on which of their built heritage properties can be first to reopen.A spokesman for the National Trust for Scotland said: “We are well aware of, and always grateful for, the support of communities in the north-east, as well as the loyalty and expertise of our staff there – but, much as we would like to accede to Mr MacDonald’s wishes, there are signicant challenges both now and in the economic aftermath of the public health crisis.“Our future depends on the support we can obtain from generous donors and members.#We are reducing our costs so far as we can to weather the loss of virtually all of our income and the expectation of reduced income for the next year to  months.#The National Trust said staff may face challenges, due to the fact that the charity does not qualy for ious business and charity support schemes.The spokesman added: #Having already missed our busiest time of year, which is why we are putting so many seasonal staff at risk of redundancy, and having to put in place safe arrangements and infrastructure to accommodate ongoing restrictions, it won’t be viable or practical for us to open more than half of our key built heritage properties this year.“While the furlough scheme and its extension is very welcome, unfortunately it comes nowhere near covering our losses to the extent that we can remain a going concern.#Further, we do not qualy for the ious government business and charity support schemes that are now in place.#We are grateful for the establishment of the Scottish Government’s task group and we have begun working with it to determine potential options that may assist us in our efforts to overcome the crisis we are in through no fault of our own.”For as

lockdown easing begins","story":"Aberdeenshire Council has urged communities to ‘stay local’ during the initial phase of the lockdown being eased.Communities across Aberdeenshire are being asked to follow the latest public health advice following the publication of the Scottish Government’s phased approach this week.The route map gives details of a gradual four-phase move out of the lockdown.Nicola Sturgeon announced today that a number of changes will be in place from tomorrow, giving people more flexibility to meet up with family and friends and greater opportunities for outdoor leisure and activities.One household will be permitted to meet up with another household outdoors, in small numbers of up to eight as a guideline, including in gardens, but with physical distancing in place.People will also be permitted to travel short distances for outdoor leisure and exercise, however the advice is that iniduals should stay within five miles of their local community and to travel on foot or cycle where possible.Non-contact outdoor activities in the area such as golf, hiking, canoeing, outdoor swimming and angling will be allowed. vw, px\"  Councillor Jim Gford is urging residents to stick to the guidelines during the easing of the lockdown.Council Leader, councillor Jim Gford, said: “While the easing of the lockdown arrangements is to be welcomed, it is vital that we ensure we all fully understand the guidelines before we emerge back into our communities.“The route map clearly sets out that residents will be allowed to travel only very short distances for outdoor leisure and exercise purposes – and by means of walking, wheel and cycle wherever feasibly possible.“What we do not want to see is an influx of visitors across the Aberdeenshire countryside causing congestion at our country parks, woodlands, uplands and coastal areas and the wider road network.“Many of these very popular attractions and trails have pinch points which could seriously jeopardise physical-distancing.#Furthermore, with the toilets we operate at many of these outdoor attractions remaining closed and with retail outlets largely doing the same, this could cause many people discomfortthey travel too far from home.”Meanwhile, Aberdeenshire Council’s Outdoor Access teams and Countryside Ranger Service are stressing the need for residents to behave responsiblythey do venture out.They are reminding residents to consider rural communities, popular recreation sites and the health and emergency services by abiding to physical distancing and making responsible choices.Walkers are advised to respect requests and signs to avoid farmyards and fields with pregnant or young livestock, crops and other busy working areas.Dogs must be kept on leads when on farmland and Scottish Government guidance for owners of companion animals and livestock indicates that dogs from self-isolating households should be kept on a lead at all times, avoiding contact with other people or animals.The rights of responsible access to most land in Scotland, including paths, tracks and waterways, continues to apply during this time.Access rights depend on responsible behaviour, both by the public and land managers which is particularly important in the current situation, when many people are accessing new and unfamiliar local areas for their daily outdoor exercise.It has also been stressed that iniduals should not light fires or BBQs in the countryside as there is a high fire risk due to the dry and hot conditions.For further information on rights and responsibilities

Within a couple of days the response was staggering.There were volunteers from all corners of Mid Argyll willing to sew, donate material and give freely of their time. Local businesses were also quick to respond with offers of material, pattern printing and transport for moving stock around.I am overwhelmed by the support and generosity of people in Mid Argyll. They have risen to the challenge and far exceeded my expectations.We have around  stitchers from Cairndow to Ardfern, and villages and towns in between, producing brightly coloured ‘scrubs’ using mainly donated fabric, scrap material and jazzy duvet covers. The first donation of ‘scrubs’ is expected to be handed over to the hospital this week and we are sure they will brighten up the wards.Our crowdfunding page, ‘Let’s Get Scrubbing for Mid Argyll’, was originally set up to buy everything to make the scrubs. It has broken the original £ target and we would love to hit the £, mark so please feel free to donate.I am overwhelmed and humbled by this experience and publicly thank the group team leaders, the volunteer stitchers, those working behind the scenes and the wider community for their support and generosity.My thanks is also extended to the following businesses who have helped in so many ways: MacLeod Construction, Kit-You-Out, Mary’s Meals, Top Designer, West Coast Motors, LG Upholstery, Clock Tower, Tarbert COS Thrt Shop, Premier Laundry, Ian Y McIntyre, Willie Leitch Sailmaker, Owen Sails and the Lithgow Family at Ormsary Estate.Nikki Thompson, Ardrishaig.Sir,The time will come when we are through the turmoil of this pandemic but as we work our way through it, I wanted to share a situation that reflects the actions of many.I was recently collecting shopping in Tarbert for registered vulnerable people and, as I was taking off my gloves before getting into the car, I was aware of another#s presence close by pushing a mobile rubbish bin. It was Damon. He saw me about to put my gloves into the rubbish bag in my own car and said cheerily #You can pop them into this bin here,you like#.I was so taken by that gesture. What an example of initiative, thoughtfulness and kindness. It summed up the incredible work of so many volunteers, co-ordinated by Team Tarbert#s Fiona, with Margaret co-ordinating prescriptions, and many others.Perhaps there is no better time for us all to reaquaint ourselves with Rudyard Kipling#s poem #If#.It seems to perfectly summarise humanity working at its best, in which, during this crisis, thanks to so many, Tarbert can walk tall. Stay safe.Peter Minshall, Tarbert.Sir,I write regarding the Argyllshire Advertiser edition dated Friday April  and the front page heading #Hospital prepares for Pandemic#.The article states: #No figures have been released about the incidence of coronavirus in Argyll and Bute# because the HSCP spokesperson said #we are following national guidance and due to reasons of patient confidentiality we will not be able to make public where in the Highland health board areas the positive cases are#.This statement is complete nonsense and shows either the HSCP in Argyll has not been privy to this information or they are just using the term #national guidance# as a smokescreen and an excuse and or sheer incompetence.No-one was asking them for patients# names and addresses, merely figures of those affected in a given area.The people appointed to positions of responsibility in Argyll and Bute HSCP are hopeless when it comes to joined-up thinking and accountability.All they will do is spin you a line and quote stuff like #national guidelines#, which is code for #I don#t have a clue#.Karl Edwards, LochgilpheadSir,Scottish and Southern Electricity Networksis extending the support it provides to those most vulnerable by expanding the eligibility of its Priority Services Registerto include customers at increased risk of severe illness during the coronavirus pandemic.Nearly , customers already receive additional care and support through SSEN’s PSR – a free, tailored service.In addition to those self-isolating or shielding for  weeks, customers are eligiblethey:Julie Walker, SSEN."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 24 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsMidton has been making the distinctive and coveted awards for the Royal Television Society for the past  years # and this week the company#s resourcefulness in adapting to face shield production was acknowledged by the society.

By adding night-scented plants and soft lighting, along with pale-coloured flowers and foliage that appear to glow in the fading light, your garden will become an enticing ‘room’ to sit in at the end of the day.White flowering plants # like big blooms of hydrangeas # have a lovely glow in the evening garden reflecting the last of the light which makes them appear brighter than other plants.  Pale blues and lilacs also look their best in fading light, so sea holly with its tiny blue flowers that sit in rosettes of silvery-grey bracts is a great addition.Bright foliage also creates an evening glow in the garden. Light-coloured, iegated and silver leaf plants reflect any available light. Lambs Earis a popular ground cover plant that has the most wonderful soft, furry, silver-grey leaves.  It’s fairly drought resistant so a good choice for a dry, sunny border.Many beautul flowers only produce scent at night and often have a stronger aroma than their daytime counterparts.  Fragrance is released from night-scented flowers as the heat of the day lingers into the evening.  Petunias may seem be a strange choice for a night garden, but they are night scented. Some smell during the day, but not to the same intensity of the night scent. Night Scented Stocks do just that and have a pastel colour flower palate.It’s best to plant scented night garden flowers where you’ll brush against them or come close to them. Try planting them around doors and paths.  If you are planting in pots make sure you arrange them round seating areas to provide a heady aroma or position them near doors and windows so that the fragrance drts inside.Even though planting the right night-flowering plants in the right place will give you stunning effects,you want to really enjoy your garden after dark, some form of garden lighting is essential.  Try not to floodlight your entire garden. Instead, pick out specic plants and trees to showcase. Up lighting, either set on spikes or recessed into the ground, showcases plants beautully at night.But it’s not just at night time you want your garden to look good so here are some tips for this month from the Royal Horticultural Society."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor may 15 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,A big thank you to whoever has tidied up Ardrishaig Community Garden, mown the grass and repaired and painted the fences.Such a peaceful place to call into while out exercising.

Mindfulness concentrates your mind on the ‘here and now’ and is a proven way of dealing with mild depression or anxiety.Focus on what the plants feel like – not just their fragrance when touched – from leathery and lacey to soft and smooth. You can also mix plants that are great to touch with tactile hard landscaping elements such as a water feature, smooth polished round pebbles or the glazed ceramics.Some top touching plants and features to considerLeaves # try Stachys byzantina, commonly known as Lamb#s Ear. Its soft, downy, furry silver-grey leaves are a favourite among gardeners who tend to use it for ground cover in rich soil. As a contrast there is Acuba japonicawhich has smooth, glossy leathery leaves.Flowers # who can resist touching a bottlebrush Callistemon cintrinus – bundles of tiny delicate stamen flowers form a brush that’s soft to touch – or the soft paper-thin petals of a poppy Papaver orientale.Grasses # run your hand over the arching, thread-like leaves of feathery Stipa tenuissima also known as Mexican feather grass or the more robust drought proof ornamental Festuca glauca with thread-like blue foliage that forms dense mounds.Bark – tree bark can also provide a tactile experience especially when it’s the stunning flowering cherry Prunus serrulate with mahogany coloured bark that peels away in bands round the trunk.Landscaping – you can easily y the textures in your garden by choosing dferent hard landscaping options. If you have smooth pebbles surrounding a water feature that you can run your hand over and through, you could place lichen-covered rocks in another area of the garden.Our general well-being is intrinsically linked to the natural world which is why Thrive – the gardening for health charity – has developed the Thrive Gardening Club.For fortnightly tips on getting the most out of your garden, whatever your age or ability, and information on how gardening can keep you healthy and feeling good visit www.thrive.org.uk get-involved keep-in-touch subscribe-to-gardening-clubThrive is the UK’s leading provider of social and therapeutic horticulture programmes using gardening to bring about positive changes in the lives of people living with disabilities, ill health or mental health issues, or who are isolated, disadvantaged or vulnerable."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor may 22 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,Mental Health Awareness Week, now in its th year, runs from May  to May .This year, the theme for the week is kindness and across the country, people will be celebrating kindness in digital and creative ways within social distancing restrictions.The last couple of months, with all the uncertainty of the virus and the impact of lockdown, have been an extremely stressful and worrying time for many people across the Highlands and Islands. People who may have previously felt isolated in remote and rural communities may be feeling this even more acutely at this time, so it’s important they know support is available.Across the region, many people have also sadly faced the pain of losing loved ones to the virus or have fallen ill themselves, while others have seen their livelihoods put at risk or incomes reduced. All of this has put additional strain on people’s mental well-being.This year’s Mental Health Awareness Week is putting the focus on kindness as a means of helping people through the pandemic and building a better society as we emerge from it. We see many acts of kindness in the Highlands and Islands all the time, but this week is an opportunity for people to reflect on their interactions with others and how they can try and be a little kinder during this unprecedented time.David Stewart, MSP for Highlands and Islands region.Sir,During Mental Health Awareness Week, sight loss charity RNIB Scotland is highlighting the emotional reassurance and practical help it is offering during the coronavirus lockdown.Our Need to Talk telephone counselling service remains available in Argyll and Bute for anyone diagnosed with sight loss, as well as their families, friends and carers.Losing some or even all your sight can be devastating news to take in, but our trained helpers can support you in coming to terms with your condition and finding the way forward.RNIB is concerned the lockdown might be affecting people who are blind and partially sighted, many of whom are older, particularly hard. The uncertainty over access to basic shopping and medication, to information in accessible formats, the social isolation and barriers to being guided because of social distancing can all add and compound to the mental and emotional stress people are experiencing.As well as our Need to Talk service, the RNIB helpline on    is available for anyone with sight loss and we continue to organise social activities over the phone and social media.We want people with sight loss to know they are not alone and that help is available.James Adams, RNIB Scotland director, Edinburgh.The Scottish Invasive Species Initiativehas launched Alien Detectives – a fun and educational online resource to help the young and not so young  learn more about alien # or non-native – invasive species.Originally designed as a school education pack, the huge array of activities now includes a wide range of fun games and activities that anyone can enjoy at home, in the garden or on local walks during lockdown.Alien Detectives includes crafts, quizzes, worksheets, presentations and puzzles all themed around invasive species and the river environment. Although primarily aimed at young people, anyone with an interest in the environment or invasive species can enjoy them too.Our project team has been busy while homeworking during lockdown to produce these fantastic resources. We hope becoming Alien Detectives will bring many hours of enjoyment to iniduals and families during lockdown, especially at a time when most young people are not in a regular school environment and might be looking for a new challenge or activities to continue their learning.Invasive non-native species might be a new topic to many but it is a really important one. Invasive species can have a major impact on our environment and native wildle and are responsible for signicant bioersity loss in Scotland and across the world. We hope these resources will help raise awareness of the impacts of invasive species and inspire more young people to learn something about them.No prior knowledge is needed and there’s lots to learn and have fun with so become an Alien Detective and help us tackle invasive species today.All of the ‘Alien Detectives’ resources can be found at www.invasivespecies.scot alien-detectives.Callum Sinclair, SISI Project Manager, Newton Stewart.Sir,We may not be able to hold picnics in the usual way just yet, but why not hold the next best thing – a virtual picnic  That way you can invite as many people as you want.National charity Family Action is running its Virtual Family Picnic from May  to May  and everyone is invited.

Here are her words:In the past many couldnrsquot read or write and so our history was rolled into the mind and later unravelled when the wheels stopped rolling and the horses were roped for grazing.Cars and lorries may have replaced the old methods of transport, but the importance of our cultural tales remained the same.Stories for children were about joys and adventures of the fairy folk, goblins and broonies.As they grew older, moral messages were concealed in the stories to teach the young person about moral issues.Respecting the earth and all that lived on her made for some wonderful tales about animals and birds why the snakes see all, who painted the eaglesrsquo feather tips, does a blackbird feel a storm coming at the base of his beak Is it not wise to heed the warning of a dog who does not rise to happily welcome the arrival of its master Our lives revolved around such tales, and their inner meanings. The boy who cried wolf was forever with us do not lie!You see, forests hold more than trees and rocks will whisperyou have an ear to listen.Our entire lives were, and are, stories. In my culture we had a teller in every family.In her books about the lives of traditional travellers, and her personal experience of it, she does not overly romanticise it.It could be a hard le, and one often misunderstood or discriminated against, as indeed it still is.But the legacy of stories, told and re-told over campfires, in caravans and kitchens, passed down from generation to generation is a rich and priceless inheritance.I was honoured that she shared a tale with me, albeit online rather than face to face, as these times demand.I believe it is a tradition we should all honour and can learn from.And so here is the story she shared.It has a Tinkerrsquos Leap in it and, who knows, it could refer to the place so named in Woodhall Dean.I have tried as best I can to keep the resonance of Jessrsquos voice in the telling.So sit round your campfire, real or imagined, for Jessrsquos tale:The story I am going to tell is of the Earl of Hell. Aye well that is how folk called him. Irsquom told he was a relative of the famous Jeannie Gordon.Well, he was a handsome lad, and had a roving eye. He also had a knack of walking into trouble.Well one day he was accused of stealing something. He knew he would get no fair hearing in court, and sure enough he didnrsquot.Soon he found himself before a dour judge, who donned his black cap and pronounced that he will be hanged at the light of dawn.Now the Earl had already escaped death three times. Some say he had the blood of Red Ruth in his veins.This time it seemed, he had met his fate. But this young lad was not ready to meet his maker.The hangman did his deadly job but as the Earl fell through the trap door he began a dance at the end of the rope, in which he dislocated his shoulders, threw his legs up in a circle and managed to free himself.The jailers were aghast, and disbelief momentarily paralysed their responses.This gave the Earl time to scuffle to his feet and flee up the steps. No door was locked, for nobody had expected the need of it.The lad jumped onto a horse and rode at speed. His horsemanship was, of course, a skill honed from childhood and he rode to freedom.However, a guard was likewise a skilled rider and took chase after him.Perhaps the Earl eased up on his horse for a moment, believing he was well away, but soon the sound of galloping told him dferent. The guard was closing in.The Earl made his horse fly like the wind. He headed into the trees, hoping to lose his pursuer, but to no avail.The steep sided burn lay ahead. So he rode like the devil towards the precipice.But at the last moment his horse took understandable fright, and stalled, throwing him to the ground.As the Earl stood, his horse would have no more of it and fled.His pursuer now drew a sword that glinted in the morning sun as he charged perhaps after all the Earl of Hell would die in this dawn light.But his title was well earned.He turned towards the precipice and threw caution to the wind and leapt over the edge.The pursuing guard pulled up his horse and watched as the Earl flew over the ravine and landed like a cat on the other side.The guard fumbled for his pistol, but the Earl vanished into the thicket of the wood in moments.The location became known ever after as Tinkerrsquos Leap.And as for the Earl of Hell himself, he was seen again only through the misty visions of drunk men, and the eyes of his sweetheart who did not tell his story till long after he was dead."},{"url":null,"title":"musselburgh-racecourse-cancels-summer-fixtures","story":"It announced earlier this afternoon that all races scheduled for July and August are now cancelled due to

The Scottish Government has published its four-phase lsquoroute maprsquo aimed at restarting society while suppressing the virus and has confirmed that some restrictions will begin to be eased from the end of this week.ldquoIt is very clear that, as progress remains fragile, the easing of lockdown restrictions must be taken very gradually and incrementally.ldquoThroughout this period we have been following the national advice and will continue to do so. ldquoOn a practical note I, along with many others, will welcome the reopening of the recycling centres and the ability to meet friends and family albeit on a restricted basis. East Lothianrsquos golf courses are being prepared to reopen with changes made to ensure safety for staff and members is a priority.Bill Axon, chief executive of enjoyleisure, which runs golf courses at Musselburgh Old Links and Winterfield, Dunbar, said new policies include sneeze guards, masks and visors for staff and asking for flagsticks to remain in place at all times.Mr Axon said: ldquoFor enjoyleisure, the safety of customers and colleagues come first.ldquoWe have been constantly monitoring the latest Government advice surrounding Covid-, and along with guidance issued by the Scottish Golf and the RA, both courses have been adapted to comply with current social distancing policies.ldquoWe ask all of our customers to adhere to the measures in place, so that we can continue to enjoy golf now and into the future.Indoor sports facilities are not included in the phase one changes but Mr Axon said enjoyleisure, which also oversees the majority of them in the county, would continue to follow government guidance on when they are allowed to reopen.About  per cent of staff with enjoyleisure had been furloughed, with no redundancies made.Mr Axon said there was no alternative work which could be offered and highlighted that the impact of the coronavirus had ldquonot been insignicant in terms of income, with income levels dropping by about pound, per month.Malcolm Duck, who is part of the steering group involved in Scotlandrsquos Golf Coast, said: ldquoWe are waiting for the First Minister to give us the date.ldquoThe impression is it will be Friday but I am not sure that has been confirmed yet. Golf clubs will be able to open and people will be able to get on golf courses.Mr Duck encouraged people to visit the  courses across the county when it was safe to do so.He said: ldquoThe weather is great and it will be great to be able to go out on the golf courses.Billy Mellors, county bowls development officer, said not all bowling clubs in East Lothian would be opening their doors and restrictions would be in place.He said: ldquoDepending on what Nicola Sturgeon says on Thursday, bowling clubs are free to open on Friday with some pretty severe restrictions in place.That will include limiting the number of people allowed on the green at any one time, as well as clubhouses not opening.Brian Whellans, president of Haddington Bowling Club, said club bosses were meeting online todayto discuss a way forward.He said: ldquoThe bowling green is ready to go. Wersquove got a greenkeeper that is paid on a monthly basis.

If at all possible, we are asking that only adult customers visit during this critical time.ldquoAlthough wersquore looking forward to seeing our customers again, I have to confess to being a little nervous about re-opening with these measures in place.ldquoHowever, the safety of customers and staff is our priority and we hope that customers will be patient with us whilst we find our feet and adapt.Under the Scottish Governmentrsquos route map to ease lockdown restrictions, outdoor workplaces can resume with ldquophysical distancing measures in place once guidance is agreed, meaning that garden centres can reopen but not their cafes unless it is for takeaway.County recycling centres are due to open to the public on Monday, with social distancing measures introduced.Phase two of the route out of lockdown, which could be introduced at the next review in three weeksrsquo time, could see theof outdoor markets such as Haddington Farmersrsquo Market and more workplaces open as well as the introduction of more social gatherings.Colin Beattie, MSP for Musselburgh, welcomed the phase one plans.Mr Beattie said: ldquoI am pleased with the cautious approach which the Scottish Government is taking towards releasing lockdown.ldquoThe approach is clear and unambiguous compared to the chaos and contradictions south of the border. The absolute priority is protecting lives.ldquoThe economy is certainly going to be our next priority but we can rebuild the economy while we canrsquot bring back someonersquos mum or dadthey contract a terminal case of Covid-. By and large people have respected the lockdown in Scotland and I am confident that we will all continue to respect the phased release of lockdown.

However, the rules of the council, inexplicably, forbid us from making any comment or statement, evenit is only to clear up factual inaccuracies and glaring errors. That seems absurd and perverse.ldquoHad we been able to speak and to cross-examine officers, I am confident that councillors would never have reached this ridiculous decision and that neither ourselves nor the council would have ended up in court.The retail park, around . miles from the town centre, currently has a number of home and DIY stores on site.However Dutch firm Promontoria Holdings applied for planning permission to extend it and develop a number of other leisure and shopping outlets.The councilrsquos planning committee approved the plans in June last year but Bridges Antonine decided to take the matter further.They claimed that, as the council had failed to carry out a Retail Impact Assessment, officials ldquoacted unreasonably and perversely in concluding that the Westway proposal could be developed without detriment to Cumbernauld Town Centre.Lord Burns agreed and found that the local authority failed to properly assess the impact the proposal would have on Cumbernauld town centre, adding that the centre had problems with ldquoretail contraction and vacancy issues.He also found that councillors were not provided with sufficient information to make their decision.The council could now be forced to pay Bridges Antoninersquos legal costs in the case, as well as paying for their own legal fees at the expense of the taxpayer.This is likely to run to tens of thousands of pounds.It is understood that the guidelines preventing Bridges Antonine from addressing the planning committee were introduced in .Mr Tyler added: ldquoWe consistently attempted to alert the council about errors in the processes but were thwarted. It is vital that the protocols the council follows in future allow proper communication with the committee to avoid future costly failures.ldquoSurely it makes sense for North Lanarkshire issues to be heard in North Lanarkshire and not at the Court of Session in Edinburgh.A spokeswoman for North Lanarkshire Council said: ldquoThe council adheres to Standing Orders in relation to how committees operate. We are reviewing the judgment and will determine our next steps in due course.The court judgment came just months after The Herald revealed the councilrsquos plans to re-imagine its town centres by clearing out traditional shopping streets and to make way for homes and ldquotown hubs ndash complexes which will incorporate multi-school campuses and other public services.North Lanarkshirersquos chief executive Des Murray told of his plans to draw people back to town centres to live, work and study, not just to shop.Detailing the decline of town centres and high streets in recent years, he said: ldquoWhat do we do  Do we step away from it and let it slowly decline.ldquoOr do we step in to that space and do something fundamental to change its future The new vision is planned for eight town centres - and Cumbernauld is one of them."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-whole-lot-not-just-cummings-pay-mistakes","story":"Instead millions flew in with quarantine or testing of just  of them.Germany brought in -day quarantine for people entering the country from March .Sir Patrick Vallancersquos predecessor as Chief Scientic Officer, David King, is quoted in The Sunday Times condemning Sir Patrick and Boris Johnson deciding football matches, festivals, concerts, pubs and clubs wouldnrsquot spread the virus.On February  Mr Johnson made a speech warning of the risks of over-reacting to coronavirus and doing ldquoreal economic damage.

In addition, the fact that he drove to and from Barnard Castle to test his eyesight, which had been giving him problems, again accompanied by his we and child, and drove the  miles back to London, without any mishap occurring, was also more good luck than good judgment.Given that Mr Cummings would appear to trust more to luck than judgment, is he really the kind of man who should be in charge of running the country Ruth Marr, Stirling.WHILST the First Minister has accepted that mistakes have likely been made and ndash when this is over ndash it will be necessary to undertake a review on all aspects of its handling, I have yet to see such contrition or indeed any such constructive comment from the Prime Minister.What is simply not acceptable, as he is currently attempting with his Dominic Cummings dficulty, is to \"move on\" to address other issues in which he is interested ndash EU withdrawal and more.As a member of the public, I am certainly not content with applauding the heroics of the NHS staff and yet see them being deprived of the tools to do their job.This has been an early warning of what might come at a later date.

Wherever the coronavirus has achieved signicant infection rates, grim death rates in care homes have followed, often accounting for  per cent or more of total deaths. On cursory examination England currently appears to be exhibiting a lower rate but when \"excess deaths\" are fully accounted the rate there will not only likely be comparable, as indicated by the recent LSE study, but the overall death rate per head of population looks like it may be the highest in Europe, and possibly the highest in the world, through this first phase of the pandemic.Jackson Carlaw and Richard Leonard have now both decided to point their political fingers at the Scottish Government for embarking on a UK-wide approach of accelerated early discharge from hospitals, especially of the elderly, at a time when hospitals were expected to be overwhelmed with Covid- patients . Following the advice of clinicians some were discharged into care homes subject to Government regulations and guidelines. Certainly at the time none of these politicians was disputing this logical action, but perhaps everyone has been naiumlve about the day-to-day ing of care homes, especially those governed by the aims of private investors. Staff moving in and out of care homes, many of which were not properly prepared for a pandemic and initially not fully supported by their management in the purchase of appropriate PPE, may have been the primary carriers of Covid- into these homes.How many were are in the unenviable position of effectively working under zero-hours-contracts with little or no income should they suspect they may have the virus and feel compelled to work on, especially in situations where residents in their care are already suffering because of reduced staffing numbers and the torture, for some, of isolation Stan Grodynski, Longniddry.I AM in complete agreement with David Stubley .

A Coronavirus Business Hardship Support Grant Scheme was launched earlier this month.The grant and loans schemes were created following engagement with local business representatives.During discussions with a broad range of business sectors, requests were made for the council to establish ways to ease the immediate pressure created by poor cash flow, with the curtailing of all trade in some sectors and severely limited trade in others.The council fund is intended to supplement rather than replace national support measures # and business applicants should first explore whether they are eligible for assistance from the schemes put in place by the Scottish and UK Governments.Before seeking a loan from OIC, businesses will need to have first applied for funding from the national Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme or the Coronavirus Bounce Back Loan Schemes.Councillor Graham Sinclair, chairman of the council’s Development and Infrastructure Committee, said: “We are very aware of the hardship many businesses are facing in these uncertain and challenging times.“I am pleased that the emergency loan scheme, as well as the hardship grant scheme, are now in place and open for applications.“Many local businesses are receiving assistance from the government support schemes – and these should be the first port of call for those affected by the economic effects of the crisis“But we know from our engagement with Orkney’s business sectors that the national schemes won’t help all businesses.“The new loan scheme offers a further option for those that have been unable to secure support where.“If your business is facing this situation I would encourage you to check online to seeit is eligible # and to get in touch with our economic development team or Business Gateway Orkneyyou are unsure or feel it doesn’t quite meet the criteria.”Standard loan terms are for a duration of up to six years, with an initial repayment holiday period of up to a year, followed by up to five years to repay the loan balance in full.

We remain committed to supporting the work of the management group to co-ordinate a range of goose management measures as soon as feasibly possible.”Alan Corrigall, Orkney NFU Scotland chairman said: “We are disappointed that the momentum which had been gathering to find new ways to control the resident geese population has come to a halt.  However, hopefully marksmen shooting later this summer can still go ahead as planned, and the other agreed control measures can be trialled next year.”Land managers can still control greylag geese under the General Licence to prevent agricultural damage, provided they can comply with the Government’s COVID- restriction rules. The General Licence was amended this year so inidual licences to carry out shooting or egg oiling during closed season are no longer required.Greylag goose meat sales have also been consented under a General Licence for Orkney. As a result, land managers on Orkney can now, under food hygiene legislation, sell the greylag goose carcasses they generate,they are satisfied they comply with the COVID- suppression rules. Land managers must ensure work carried out follows the General Licence rules.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

National media reports have suggested that Home Office staff cannot access paperwork held in offices due to inefficient home working procedures.Mr Carmichael said: “EU citizens make a massive positive impact in the Northern Isles and the coronavirus crisis has only made that impact clearer. The pandemic has demonstrated the vital contributions that workers from all over the world make in supporting our economy and keeping the NHS running under severe pressure.“The ongoing legal limbo for over two hundred EU citizens in the isles is unacceptable. Continued confusion and delay caused by administrative problems must be put right. Failing to do so puts people’s futures and lives clouded in uncertainty. They deserve better from a government that promised their right to remain.“This news comes in a week in which the government has seemed blind to the importance of immigrant workers in our health and social care sectors. I am glad that the Prime Minister backed down on plans to charge immigrants working in the NHS but it should never have come that far.

From the inability to spend time with family and friends to the impact on businesses, the effect has been profound and far-reaching.  Thanks to those efforts, however, we have seen a downward trend in new cases of infection that has enabled the Scottish Government to begin easing restrictions.“Despite this initial relaxation of the rules, however, I was pleased to hear the First Minister reiterate that travelling to the islands, other than in exceptional circumstances, is still not possible for now.  It is a dficult message, but absolutely the right one at this time.“We know that many people across the UK, and further afield, look forward to visiting Orkney at this time of year.  However, the safety of our community remains paramount and there is still some way to go before we can begin welcoming visitors again.“The First Minister’s message though is a reminder of the signicant economic impact that the shutdown of the tourism sector has on Orkney.  The grant support provided by the UK and Scottish governments to mitigate this impact has been welcome, but too many local businesses still find they are falling between the cracks.“I will continue to work with Ministers to ensure that gaps in support are closed.  Meantime, I would urge the public to keep following the advice of the government and hopefully it won’t be long before we can look forward to visitors ing to Orkney”.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

One person usually does two or three days in a row at one site, then switches with another operator. “I’m quite confident operating on site alone as I’ve been in the role for a number of years now, but we are well supported and there is always someone at the end of a phonewe need any help. As occasional lone workers, we also have safeguards in place to ensure our safety.“As well as allowing me more time to keep on top of college work, which I’m finding harder now there is no face to face teaching, the single person policy also means we can be more flexible right across the dferent teams on the islands.   “For example,a number of colleagues need to self-isolate, there is now extra flexibility that can be called upon to cover these roles, so it’s good there is that resilience in place.   “I feel very grateful that I’m working for Scottish Water just now. I think we’ve been very well cared for and supported throughout the coronavirus pandemic.”    Sweyn, who joined Scottish Water eight months ago, said: “It’s been a really useful learning experience being on site by myself. This summer I will begin standby duties responding to alarms at our two water treatment sites on the mainland, so I think this time spent working the sites alone will help prepare me for those additional duties.  “I’m getting on with the routine stuff as usual andanything comes up that I need help with, I know there’s always someone at the end of the phone so I’ve got no hesitation calling them in that instance.    “It’s a really good team here, really supportive, which is great. If there have to be two people on site, then we make sure that social distancing is in place. With the implementation of these measures, we’ve been successful in producing the high-quality drinking water our customers expect while maintaining the safety of our team and others.”  Ross, who spends a lot of his time out at jobs requiring more than one person in attendance, has found the new measures harder to implement in some aspects of his role. He said: “It is things like ensuring you are keeping two metres apart when you are both digging a hole # you are so conscious of it but you’re also trying to get on and do your job so it has been a challenge.   “It hasn’t been an issue at all in terms of dealing with customers because we wear our gloves and our masks and make sure that we are well away from themwe need to speak to them, but it does make the physical aspects of our job more challenging.“I’ve been with Scottish Water for around nine months and my days can look completely dferent week to week. I can be heading out in the van to fix a burst or fit a connection, or it can be dealing with a choke on the sewer response side of things. That iety is one of the things that I was looking for: you are never bored, never stuck doing nothing. There’s always something to get on with.”  copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

His house was so large that he could let the legislature use four rooms. He was one of the wealthiest men in the town but he was not the only successful Orcadian businessman there. About a quarter of the men who formed the first Winnipeg Board of Trade, in March , were Orcadians or the sons of Orcadians: John Inkster and his son Colin, William Drever, Robert Tait, James Clouston, William Flett and George Kennedy.Three of the Board of Trade members have had roads named after them: Bannatyne Avenue, Inkster Bouled and Tait Avenue. There are two more named after Orcadian settlers: Mowat Road after Edward Mowat from Orphir and Setter Street after Andrew Setter, or Seatter. It is no surprise that Orcadians played such a prominent part in the early le of Winnipeg because they were there right from the start: in the Red River Valley.All through the th Century Orkney men went to work for the Hudson’s Bay Company. At its peak, in ,  of the  employees were Orcadian. Most of them came home but a good number settled in the Red River Valley: the colony south of Lake Winnipeg founded by the Earl of Selkirk for Highlanders displaced by the Clearances. The HBC had granted the land on condition that their men could retire there.The colony struggled through its early years but things settled down after the union of the HBC with the North-West Company in . Shetland pioneer Issac Cowie wrote:And it was these Orkneymen, with other veterans of the fur trade…, coming in sufficient numbers to defend it, who made permanent the settlement of Red River.”…Douglas Hill, in The Opening of the Canadian West , described the birth of Winnipeg, within the Red River Settlement, when warehouses and stores were built near the HBC#s Upper Fort Garry.#The collection of ramshackle log or frame buildings, with one or two solid houses, was at first called McDermotville after its leading citizen, an Irish settler-turned-trader named Andrew McDermot, who with his son-in-law, A G B Bannatyne, erected Winnipeg#s first buildings. Soon the town#s shops were thriving, and challenging the Fort as the settlement#s focal point#In  the prairie path that had been graced with the name #Main Street# was properly surveyed, graded and furnished with one or two culverts . It was a symptom of the magnicent optimism that prevailed. Yet the optimists were justied: Winnipeg and Manitoba were on the threshold of great things.  vw, px\"  The full version of this article can be found on page  of this week’s edition of The Orcadian. Patricia Long is a local tour guide based in Stenness, with a particular interest in social and family history.

The guidance stresses the need for personal responsibility when travelling and this co-operation is vital as we work to provide a safe transport system that supports the people of Scotland.“The route map offers a path away from the current restrictions, but the virus is still with us,we move too quickly or without appropriate diligence, it could rapidly run out of control again. “The level of physical distancing required as we navigate the phases of the route map will affect the available capacity of public transport. Operators estimate capacity will be between  per cent and  per cent of normal availability even with full services resumed. “A system that previously had . million journeys per day will be signicantly constrained. So today, I am urging employers, operators and the public to embrace these changes and help us all adapt to a new environment which has flexible and remote working at its core, for the immediate future at least, flattens peak travel demand and has a strong focus on active travel.“We are looking to increase the frequency of public transport. But reducing the demand for transport is vitally important. We are urging employers to show leadership and be as flexible as possible to allow earlier or later starting and finishing times for those that have to travel to work.  “Over the coming weeks and working with our local authority partners, the transport transition plan will look to manage demand and increase availability of road space and priority for walking, cycling, wheeling and bus. “We have a real opportunity to secure a positive and lasting change, one which supports sustainable travel habits. I am therefore delighted to confirm that the ‘Spaces for People’ fund for local authorities has proven so popular that it is being increased to £ million.“We all have a personal responsibility to take steps to protect ourselves and others. It is vital that we continue to keep two metres physical distance wherever possible, wash hands regularly and maintain good cough hygiene.  “Even with the measures being put in place by transport operators, it may be dficult for people to maintain physical distancing throughout their journey in some forms of public transport. I know these are real concerns of the travelling public, operators and transport staff. For that reason, people should, and are expected to, wear face coverings as an additional measure when using public transport and as a consideration to staff and fellow passengers.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

THAT shouldn’t be necessary should it  But, in true B J fashion he is resorting to make do and mend bluster. I am mindful of the blind leading the blind.Let decisions be made by scientists not ill equipped dabbling politicians.That little pat on the head should appeal to you !!But never mind Nicola is letting us out exercise twice a day. It is a shame we are all being channelled into the same crowded places, through the same gates and chokepoints whilst the wide-open spaces and beaches of Shetland are closed down to the majority!!In the present serious crisis she is in full agreement with Wales and Ireland but not with England. How fortunate that is.Britain is no longer ruled by England now that devolution has taken place. Boris Johnson claimed to be PM of 🇬🇧 Britain.He surely meant🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 not 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 Scotland or 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿Wales.Westminster is reluctant to let goIt is extraordinary sad news from Care Homes and Care Workers, but not unexpected. It takes months of training and years of experience to Barrier nurse to prevent cross-infection. Even the use of PPE requires extensive training. Our most vulnerable people conjugated into crowded homes was an accident just waiting to happen. Hopefully, next time, our care workers will have extensive professional training cross infection control with qualications and wages to match. Our most vulnerable, not all be herded into care homes but perhaps into a chalet system where separation and quarantine would be so much more effective..What is the R rate for Shetland  Looks like zero The politicians # all of them can #go away# .Do your gardening, go fishing, go for a walk whenever and where ever you want. Get the kids back into school. Get our economy open and people back to work.This is my opinion.Dive, e , e # incoming!!!What do you want  A Country with a minimised death toll but teetering on the brink of bankruptcy, or a country that#s suffered a higher death toll, and while perhaps shaken somewhat financially, is still resilient enough to continue without any great undue hardship for the survivors.England at present seems to be trying to steer an admittedly somewhat shaky course towards the latter, the rest of the UK, unfortunately seem hell bent on taking the direct route straight to the former.You cannot sustain increased Governmental expenditure and decreased Governmental income for any longer than the very short term, it called burning the candle from both ends#. We#ve been doing it now for  weeks### Very soon the time will come when Governmental leaders will have to make decisions on how many deaths are acceptable collateral damage to allow them to provide the services the majority need and keep their country afloat. The longer they leave it to make that decision, the more rushed, and by consequence, less appropriate, it is likely to be.There is no vaccine, there is no #cure#. Unfortunately some are going to have to take a hit for the team.It’s unfortunate that three centuries of free-market capitalism hasn’t generated enough wealth to feed the country for more than three months without going bankrupt but don’t worry Michael. Many people share your concerns about the economy and the government is onto it:A confidential Treasury assessment of the coronavirus crisis leaked to Theargues that it will require measures including a two-year public sector pay freeze in order to “boost investor confidence# in the British economy. So, a round of grateful applause for the NHS Staff, Care Workers, Police and everyone at London Transport.I hope the nurses are enjoying all the clapping and rattling of pots and pans every Thursday because that is all they are going to get.It is reassuring to know that things really are ing to normal.At least a public sector pay freeze will not discriminate. It will apply equally across the board and affect everyone from care home cleaners on minimum wage to the head of health and social care at Labour controlled North Lanarkshire council, salary £,“Some are going to have to take a hit for the team.”Yes Michael, in more ways than one.Well put, Malcolm.Incidentally, there is no freeze on public sector wages. Typical nonsense and  information being leaked, another left-wingPR leak from socialist civil servant perhaps I think it was the the Argntine president when speaking about Covid  said, #you can recover from a drop in GDP, you cannot recover from death#Fernández makes a good point. The Argentine economy is taking a battering and so is our own but we need to see things in perspective:Last month, Morningstar ran an article about the likely effect of the Coronavirus lockdown on share idends to be paid out by U.K. companies listed on the London Stock Exchange.It set out four possible scenarios, best-case, worst-case, and two “realistic” estimates within that range. In the best-case scenario, overall idends fall % to £. billion, and in the worst they more than halve to £. billion.More recent comments in The Financial Times suggest that we are heading towards a midway point between the best-case and worst-case scenarios while Reuterswarned of a possible % drop in idends “ the situation continues to worsen.”If the economy can afford idend payments of £ billion during the lockdown, I suspect that it is strong enough to recover. Of course, the FT and Reuters are known to be simmering cesspits of socialist subversion, so possibly more fake news.p.s.For the avoidance of any unnecessary tantrums:“The Morning Star” is three words with two spaces whereas “Morningstar” is just one word with no spaces.The simple fact is unavoidable this virus is here to stay. One day we will all meet it. The single most important thing is to keep the numbers down, so ICUs are not swamped, learn the best therapies to reduce the death toll as much as is practical and research for treatments and a vaccine. Try and avoid peak outbreaks, especially in winter, when the flu   covid combination will be nasty. Isolate our most vulnerable, maybe for a very long time and leave people to chose. I am approaching  years old and have no intention of isolating forever. In due course, I will get this virus and take my chances. I would instead rather enjoy my time than clamber fearfully into a sterile hole forever!!! As for Sturgeons exercise twice a day, she can stick that where the sun does not shine. The simple fact is being fit is perhaps my and everyone best chance for survival, twice a day exercising and the rest of my time on my sweet derriere is stupid, just as Nicola#s latest dictates!!!Ian#s reply to Malcolm#s well reasoned contribution oddly fails to address it.Why I’m reminded of the proud mother watching her son taking part in the passing out parade at Sandhurst.She noticed that everyone was out of step apart from her son!Oh dear, did I just read #BO JO#s policy actually worked# Thats plainly pants, pure and simple.Briefly, to Michael#s point, it is only recently that we paid off our war debt to the USA, so some financial mechanisms will be found.But I think I heard Portugal went into lockdown straight after their first COVID  death, whereas the UK waited for over a hundred. Plainly things could have been very dferent, very much better, and acting quicker would have been far cheaper, with far less loss of le, and a quickerto a ing economy.But it would have also required people being put before profit right from the start.So it really had been business as usual from the bottom feeding disaster capitalists that run the UK.#BO JO#s policy actually worked# indeed.That would be laughableit wasn#t so tragic.Sadly without vaccines and anti-virals, it is that simple. The fact is it has only just started and will be with us until we are all immune or dead. Let us pray for the former and immunity by vaccination. To coin a cliche, it will be total isolation for the most vulnerable until herd immunity develops, as with every infectious viral disease in human history! Development of immunity and resistance is what will stopCovid  eventually, nothing , as withPolio, Smallpox, Measles, Herpes et alNo. We need to keep as many people alive as possible until vaccine is developed.People are not simply expendable.Effective PPE supplies and speed of sufficient testing is critical to this.The Tory led, Tory delayed UK response has been woeful on these.No scope for argument there.Thousands have died that need not have.No scope for argument there either.It has been an ideologically misled catastrophe. genetic iations from  samples when exactly do you envisage this wonder vaccine that covers all iations to be produced # genetic iations from  samples when exactly do you envisage this wonder vaccine that covers all iations to be produced #But now that you point out about all those genetic iations, we probably ought to phone them and tell them to call of the hunt since they#ve probably not thought of that. Best just let nature take its course and get the economy on track with hundreds of thousands of deaths, a swamped NHS and a profoundly sick and worried population.Bo Jo#s policy was actually endorsed and followed to the letter by all the devolved Governments of the Uk until we got our knickers in a twist about a slogan. I never realised Nicola was a # bottom feeding disaster capitalists # for endorsing Bo Jo#s policy for so long. She only on Sunday became confused and what a fuss out that she made. On the bright side, we may legally exercise twice daily now, what outstanding leadership!Ian your unwavering faith in BoJo the clown, in the absence of any logical rationale or evidence for doing so, is truly astonishing.Robbie, I have no faith in any politician, but I do find Bo-Jo so much better than the other clowns in the circus. I love the way he routed the remoners, destroyed the Socialist horror of Corbyn and so antagonised, confounded and confused his opponents. Most are left with nothing by puerile and infantile comments to make, such as Bo-Jo the Clown. Is that Robbie the level of your wit and argument Again, Tory apologist spin from Tinkler. From mid-Jan through Feb Boris missed  COBRA meetings on COVID  to which Sturgeon was not invited.Yes the UK#s other parliaments fell into line once the Bullingdon Club realised there was to be no Britains Open for Business, herd-immunity-now approach. Elements of that thinking lingered on and are resurfacing now, not the least within the twisted outpouring of local eugenicists.Best information as of   .On that basis I think we need Nicola Sturgeon down here in England as well!Act in haste, repent at leisure seems to sum up such weakness.I am trying very hard toto see things from your perspective, but I cannot ignore the indicators and commentary that indicates that the UK economy will officially be in recession by the end of  Q.GDP has fallen by % in the first quarter of this year and predicted to be possibly as high as % in the second quarter.The Bank of England has tried to put a brave face on things by saying #the impact is likely to be temporary with activity rebounding strongly once social distancing measures are lted#. The question is when will social distancing be lted.Are you advocating that we just wait and see how things pan out, maybe the idea of a V shaped recovery will happen in the rd and th quarters, a vaccine will be developed in time and the world can go back to the #old normal#A simple warning from history # Recession , Depression, War.Recession, depression, war. Exactly. We know that the mortality rate is roughly .%. UK population is approx  million. Let#s say we just let the virus take its course, albeit slowed due to some adjustments to how we work and % of the population catch it. An effective treatment or vaccine is by no means guaranteed. % of  million is . million. .% of that is about , deaths. Then there are the hundreds of millions of working days lost to people off sick with the virus. Then there are the people suffering long term consequences of the virus and the cost of caring for them. How is this a recipe for a healthy economy  How will this level of death and suffering motivate investment or spending  Where does this assumption that we can just get going again like things were before come from  The world has changed. I know it feels good to bury our heads in the sand and think we can just go back to how things were and let a few old folks die. But that is profoundly naive. There is no simple answer. Except Mr. Tinkler#s. Make of that what you will.Ali asks: # genetic iations from  samples when exactly do you envisage this wonder vaccine that covers all iations to be produced #I don#t know Ali.I#m not a dentist.To my understanding there does not need to be an exact genetic match for vaccines to be sufficiently helpful, but as I can#t trace my male line back over countless generations maybe Ali should consult a bard or a sage instead.There is, and has been, something of a medical research race on for understanding of transmission, for patient management treatment and for vaccines.Prompter action would have kept more folk alive longer whilst progress was made. The usual suspects are welcome to argue that and which way they may like, but it won#t change matters.There has been medical research and hard work for years into a reliable vaccine for corona viruses. How are they doing on that front  You don#t need to be a dentist to find that outYes Ali, but you do need to know the dference between a Virus and Venus, RNA and DNA, a vaccine and socialist vacillation, that is where humanists and left-wing ideologues come up a little short!!As I#m not a puller of teeth its a challenge to tell Ali how this virus dfers from the common cold, or why the research may be getting more funding and focus than the industry and government gave previously.You stated that you don’t need to be a dentist to find that out but, to be fair and reasonable about this , someone with medical training is likely to be better equipped than someone without to come up with insights which could be useful. In all probability Ian will not strike gold but how thankful we would behe did !!Fake news  Trump tried to buy Moussa and replace the old stone buildingswith a shiny new tower and Miss Sturgeon will use the proceeds to building a border wall.The deal came unstuck when China claimed Shetland as part of its North Sea and Atlantic territorial waters. It is understood that Miss Sturgeon has been learning Madrin while Scotlandis locked upOwen Jones has denied that he supports Identity politics, woke culture and he is not a social justice warrior.CNNhires Greta Thunberg to appear on a  as an expert on Covid .Best not to bother with why UK has biggest obesity problem in Europe. Such inquiry requires social science, some sociological imagination and a grain of empathy.Much easier to blame those poor plebs who haven#t got a grip.No need to invest on ending intergenerational deprivation and increasing opportunity too.Playgrounds for schools in poorer parts of our cities Why bother.Simples Peter, integrate #Care# for young and old into the NHS. That would include a voucher towards joining a gym or active participation sports club for every citizen irrespective of wealth. Those who chose not to use it, be it on their heads, it is their own health and wellbeing which will suffer. Covid  is ruthless with the obese and unfit,blame and empathy are not part le and death struggle of potentially fatal illness.Ian#s suggestion does nothing to end intergenerational deprivation, aka poverty. Poverty, and other social ills, can result in obesity in ious ways.Obesity simply is not automatically a #lestyle choice#.To suggest so is to indulge in inflammatory victim blaming and victim shaming.Not all single parents on benefits, depending also on whatever the Foodbank might provide, can easily promote healthy lestyles for all of their children.Many are struggling with issues beyond Ian#s limited appreciation.Seven year olds don#t generally make lestyle choices. Fat cells, once over produced in response to whatever unwelcome stimulus, don#t simply disappear. They hang around calling to be filled.Not all parents have time or money to afford Shetland Recreational Trust#s offerings.They dont all have the ability to get their children to the leisure facilities.It is only #simples#you take an uncaring and simplistic approach. Ian knows this intellectually as it has been pointed out more than once. Yet he persists. Odd. A little more fellow feeling might stem his approach.All I am suggesting Peter is an attempt to control excessive eating of Junk foodswith integrating our NHH with free access to all to a gym or active participation sports club for every citizen irrespective of wealth. Just how can that be #to indulge in inflammatory victim blaming and victim shaming. #Where are you getting your figures on childhood obesity in Shetland from Ian  Surely not from the newspaper article you’ve linked below, which is from  and quotes figures for adults from  If Ian imagines free education and access to the NHS has equalled le chances this is going to be a walk in the park.If Ian imagines the Welfare State to be thriving why so many Foodbanks  On another planet does not just describe Boris and Dodgy Dom today.There are also undernourished children in Shetland and across the UK, and parents going without in order that their children can eat. Ian might be interested to research the number of food banks before the era of Conservstive austerity and see how well the number has grown since. Quite an achievement for his #thriving welfare state#. Soon unemployment numbers will be thriving too thanks to the ghastly response to Covid  fromBoris and chumsThirty thousand deaths a year is a pre-covid figure we now have obesity as a % factor in covid  deaths!!If we were talking drug deaths running a food bank would be an offence. Perhaps that is a little tongue-in-cheek but this year obesity will be a factor in about , people dying prematurely. Surely about time for gyms, fitness and participant sports organisationsto be granted by integrated into the NHS with a free or subsidised entry for all.Sorry Peter, Boris and his chums were working with Nicola and her chums on Covid  . All in harmony which must be a first!Covid  was away with the fairies, another socialist ideal.!It is mildly reassuring that Ian Tinkler has #no faith in politicians# presumably including BoJo the Clown. This Government has bungled it#s handling of the Covid- crisis on an industrial scale. Exercise Cygnus in October  highlighted serious shortcomings in the UK#s Emergency Preparedness Resilience and Response Plan to a pandemic. Since then PPE stock levels were run down by %. Being made aware of the virus in December  no preparation was started until March when the herd immunity strategy was quickly jettisoned. Britain refused to participate in the EU procurement scheme for PPE leading to farcical attempts to obtain PPE from some guy in Turkey who made T shirts. Unsurprisingly the PPE was unusable. Rather than get ventilators from established manufacturers The Government ignored their offers of help and went to Tory donors like James Dyson who managed to produce  of the  needed. Flights bringing  people a day into the Uk without test or quarantine only stopped  months after lockdown. People being placed in care homes without being tested. Unbelievably lockdown is being eased in England without test track and trace being implemented. We have the second highest death total in the world.England does not have the highest number of deaths in Europe, and England has a far higher recovery rate than many in European nations.The Care homes in England have about half the death rate of their Scotish counterparts and the Death Rate per capita in England is considerably less than in Scotland. Just to keep you up to date, Nicola has just today,reversed her political decision on lockdown. The statistics are available online however, ferreting the Scotish records is problematic. For some reason, the SG is far less transparent with the Data than the English. Figures below are slightly out of date but show the comparison.The population of England. ,, No of deaths. , Death ratio. .So in summary, the gospel according to Ian Tinkler is that BoJo the clown hasn#t put his size  feet in it at all as the death rate is higher in Scotland than in England.Ian, I think your calculations are the wrong way round and show what you might call a #survival ratio# rather than a death ratio. There#s also a decimal place error but for the purposes of comparison that doesn#t really matter.If you work it out in deaths per million of population you can see that Scotland has a lower death rate.England:  from      per mPlease do not put words in my mouth Robbie. What is happening in Scotland is down to The SG and Nicola, as theFM and former Health Secretary. Trying to make political capital out of people dying is morally reprehensible, obnoxious and malign. Bo-Jo and Nicola have equal responsibility for any mistakes, they both shared and followed the best science they could. For once they were in harmony and agreement. The NHS was not overwhelmed, lives were saved, be thankful for that. Fortunately, the injection of disinfectant, we will leave to a real clown who is now mainlining hydroxychloroquine!!! Perhaps Darwinism will step in soon! God save America.Oh this is too funny to pass by! Mr Tinkler creates his own, entirely , Coronavirusfigures to make a political point and is immediately shot down. He then states that only an idiot would try to use coronavirus figures to make political points. Well, on that we totally agree # only an idiot would.Ray try and understand the dference between political comment and malicious point-scoring.ian seems to be using dferent measurement criteria between scotland and england and even dferent data within scottish figures. on  may he has scottish figure  but on  may it has gone up to .the lower figure is the one for deaths from positive test cases, the higher one is all deaths where covid is mentioned on death certicate.in his original calculation for england he uses positive test figuresthus for accurate comparison he should use the lower scottish figure also. this is what alan leask has done and produced an accurate comparison.The vaccine is focusing on a very small sequence in the S viral protein which enables it to bind to the ACE receptor on human cells in mucosal linings and infect them. There isn’t much room for mutation there without the virus losing its ability to bind to that receptor. Other mutations mentioned, in other parts of the virus, enable “strains” of virus to be tracked. Reproduction is subject to errorand billions upon billions of virus are being produced, so mutations will take place. However the critical site for immunity is probably conserved.I did read it Ian # that’s how I know it’s completely irrelevant. Now you’ve produced aarticle from ! So, just to be straight, your reasoning for easing the Coronavirus lockdown in  is a  year old newspaper article about obesity  I don’t think that’s the real reason is it now  Could it be that you’re putting your political prejudices first again  Not that it matters of course. Now even the FMs most recent slight adjustments to lockdown only allow five-mile car run to a place to exercise. That does not get a Glaswegian far from the centre of Glasgow. It just does exactly the worst thing, concentrates people together in highly populated areas. The counterargument regards spreading the virus into new areas is fallacious. Just in case our FM had not noticed, the virus has already disseminated widely and in the great outdoors of Scotland Social Distancing is a lot easier than in Glasgow or any other city.So, the death ratio in Scotland from Covid , according to the self-proclaimed STE expert is .. That, I believe, is patently incorrect, not to mention entirely absurd, and would mean that . people from  person had died from the disease. As an analogy, based on a notional teeth count,someone had, let’s say, ten teeth and subsequently had one removed then the ratio of teeth removed to those not having been removed would be  , or %. The “survival ratio”, as someone referred to, ie the teeth remaining, is the remainder as a proportion of the whole, in other words  out of , or %, assuming that the dentist extracts within remit. The two equations are not inter-changeable. This, however, from the statistical and other real experts acknowledged in their fields is very interesting: A good point and as always I appreciate a good dental analogy to illustrate the dference between death and survival rates. I know here we like to fight tooth and nail about such things, but it is good to see someone #filling in# the gaps here. And as for Mr. Tinkler, he certainly puts the effort in and even though we may disagree, it keeps things on here lively. He deserves a plaque.Michael Inkster, Try .Decimal point one, not  to  . Actually maths was wrong recalculation above. Simples absurdly so, evenmental arithmetic was a little rusty first time round!!Since it appears to be much more virulent and deadly than flu the future would seem to be less than rosy.In fact, depressingly gloomy and all the statistical information so diligently presented will be consignedto no more than being purely academic and capable of making not a scrap of dference.I am more intrigued into the sources of  major viruses having a global impact from China, and what is the Chinese Government doing about the health and safety of food products and the, apparent, lack of any proper procedures in which to prevent further outbreaks  What is the WHO doing in regards to monitoring potential infections from China and or limiting the movements of live animals in poorly developed hygiene conditions, allegedly We hear the origins of such viruses, but no information regarding preventative measures taking place to restrict and confine such health hazards within an area and to stop this from spreading further afield  Why has there been no ban on the sale and transport of certain foods from China Is the whole process of live animal meat production having to be totally reviewed by the Chinese government or is it a case of waiting until something even greater forces them to act Should we enforce our own standards of Health and Safety onto other countries in terms of a trade agreement or should market forces have a free for all without any restrictions, including Health and Safety  Should this be reviewed JOSEPH NIVEN has hit the nail squarely on the head. The statistics are not clearly put and blaming one UK politician, BoJo or Sturgeon is wrong. The SNP and Torie parties pretty much followed identical policies until last week.If Ian imagines free education has eliminated inequalities of opportunity he is mistaken.inequalities of opportunity frequently come down to ambition. The opportunities are there for all, not everybody wishes to take them.Sure good sound parentage and background help promote ambition, but the old adage you can take a horse to water but!!! If you wish to destroy ambition, try extreme socialism. The good old USSR and present-day Venezuela give good examples.I don#t know where to start with this statement Ian, and I#m not sure it will make any dference to youI do.There are multiple stories on just this very subject, but since you are not a big fan of the arts, you might not have read them, seen them or heard them.You can have ambition, and even a great education, but still be knocked back by the old boy network, or because you are not white or not male. These inequalities still exist.There are statistics to show that Eton boys get the top jobs still, and the only way to get a better leader for this country will be to do away with privilege and try to level the playing field. New Zealand for example have a great leader and it is refreshing to see someone lead who has her role on merit.I know nothing of the countries you mention but I am sure they still have ambitious and educated people despite your partisan viewpoint.Well it’s a surprise to see that the Scottish government aren’t being blamed for poverty and suffering this time # turns out it was the underprivileged’s own fault all along. I’m sure a sharp word will snap them out of it and everyone will be a CEO or a government advisor in no time. Just need to put the effort in old boy what what! I’d always thought the morally bereft who profit from misery and desperation who have a lot to do with keeping the poor poor have a lot to answer for though you know payday lenders, gambling companies, private dentists with a monopoly#Ian might as well say the poor are frequently to blame for their lot. Oil rich Norway does not tolerate UK levels of inequality.Neither do many other poprer countries.Quite what the USSR and Venesuala have got to do with it is likely apparent to Ian.Others will see their inclusion within what passes for his argument as a clear attempt at distraction. The possible impacts of being brought up in poverty by others who have had the same dficulties are many.The opportunities for such children are not easily compared to, say, those enjoyed by the young Boris Johnson.Ian is again indulging himself in victim blaming.UK policy has not set out to create level playing fields for socio-econmic participation. It should, but won#t for as long as #One Nation# English Conservatives like Boris Johnson continue to serve the interests of those of Ian Tinkler#s outlook over those of all. On th of May Ian described intergenerational deprivation as #relevant to Victorian times#.NY pretending ambition alone can help all children born into poverty to escape it Ian is demonstrating Victorian attitudes of his own. Seven year olds brought up in bedsits should choose better parental lestyles.I was unaware Thatcher, Blair, Cummings, Callahan, Wilson et all went to Eton. Mind you, Tony Ben, Sir Antony no less went to Westminster college!!!! Quite what that has to do #With the price of tea in China # rather like your former comments, escapes me!Johan, Ian#s not just a contrarian, compelled to rile others, but does so to share his quite unpleasant world-view. He talks of intergenerational deprivation as being a #very trendy left-wing academic hypothesis, relevant to Victorian times# but it#s a known fact that many a bairn raised in poverty, enjoying few opportinities will go on to live in poverty and have few opportunities. If they become parents, the likelihood of their bairns being able to do better lessens generation by generation without purposeful government action designed to level the playing field.The concept used here is social mobility and many governments globally take pains to increase it. Where those with disadvantageous starts in le go on, on average, to do better than their parents,social mobility is high. Where their lot is likely to be fixed at birth social mobility is low. Scotland has a long running research project to monitor it. In addition to the factors you cite, cards can also firmly stacked against children raised by semi-literate, or drug dependent parents, or in situations of domestic violence or sexual violence as well as other non-lestyle factors. Ian knows obesity can have complex causes, but doesn#t care. Its quite tragic.Poor parenting is really not a class thing whatever are trendy humanist academics may say. Just feeble attempts to justy socialist ideals. However, that has nothing to do with my attempt to deal with excess fat and obesity., #cards can also firmly stacked against children raised by semi-literate, or drug-dependent parents, or in situations of domestic violence or sexual violence. # Well apart from the semi-literate bit that sounds a little bit like an Etonian upbringing, so typical of the Aristocracy!!! I love the bit about #Scotland has a long-running research project to monitor it.# .What a shame it is run by a load of left-wing academics, perhaps that is why Scotland#s performance falls so far short of England#s with regard to social mobility!!

It looks increasingly likely that any exit from lockdown and safe re-opening of tourism and hospitality businesses could be during the low season.#Without financial support to tide them over, that could be the nail in the coffin for many businesses.“In Shetland, like where in Scotland, earnings from tourism during the spring and summer months sustains people through the winter and it is a real worry that coronavirus hit just when the visitor season was starting.#It is clear that a -month plan, at least, is needed to ensure that viable businesses can survive to provide a living for their owners and be ready to safely welcome visitors again when the time is right.”Speaking via video link earlier this week, Mr Carmichael welcomed the Chancellor of the Exchequer#s announced extension to the furlough scheme to protect jobs – but added more was needed to help tourism.“Here in the Northern Isles we particularly see that in the visitor economy, which is crucial to us,# he added.#The assistance for bed and breakfast operators, or operators of self-catering accommodation, leaves too many people without the assistance they need.“A support scheme that finishes at the end of August, or September or whenever it will be, simply will not be adequate in parts of the country such as ours.#Those parts of the country that have seasonal tourism require a -month programme, or  the tourism industry that will be left to be resurrected at the end of this process will be that much weaker, and the rebuilding and recovery that much more dficult.” on Wednesday also heard from struggling tourism businesses.One BB owner said she had been unable to apply for support funds as they required applicants to have paid businesses rates, whereas she paid domestic council tax.Living Lerwick has also raised the plight of small tourism operators.Project manager Emma Miller said that as some did not have a business banking account they had been unable to apply for the Creative or Tourism and Hospitality Enterprises Fund, which opened in Scotland to support the industry. raquo"},{"url":null,"title":"more vessels but aprils gross tonnage is well down on last year ","story":"Lerwick Harbour saw a big reduction in shipping tonnage during April compared with the same month last year – although the number of arrivals was actually up slightly.A total of  vessels called, compared with  in April , but the overall tonnage dropped from , to ,grt.The deficit was partly due to no cruise ships callinglast year, although ferries, live fish carriers and oil traffic were all also down considerably.The April arrivals this year included  fishing boats,  workboats tenders,  ro ro ferries,  live fish carriers, eight oil boats, eight tugs, five tankers, five ferries and three pilot boats.The fishing vessels comprised  Shetland,  British, three Danish, two French and one Norwegian boat.For the first four months of the year the overall number of arrivals at Lerwick holds up reasonably well with  – , as compared to , in .

Whatever is implemented will put the wellbeing of our children at its heart.”Schools closed on th March and since then pupils have been learning at home, through lessons delivered online by teachers.Other pledges made by Mr Swinney included one to expand the school estate, using libraries, community halls, leisure centres, conference venues or taking short-term leases of vacant business accommodation to increase the time children can spend with their teachers.He also suggested that retired teachers couldto school as part of plans to limit class sizes.To support digital home learning, the Scottish Government is to invest £ million for , laptops or tablets – with internet access provided – for disadvantaged childrenMr Swinney added “This is not, however, ato schooling as we knew it # schools are not ing to normal at this stage.“To keep our pupils and staff safe we will implement physical distancing, staggered arrival and departure times, staggered break times, increased hand hygiene, enhanced cleaning regimes and a range of other measures.“That means a new model of teaching, learning and support will have to be delivered. Precise details will y from school to school but for the vast majority, classes are going to be much smaller to allow physical distancing and, as a result, children are likely to spend about half their time learning at home.”The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until st May .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Cummings-1.jpg","title":"s e am beul a labhras ach an gniomh a","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineTha fhios’am gun can cuid gu bheil an dol a-mach aig Dominic Cummings agus aig an fhear a tha os a chionnBoris MacIain dìreach ceangailte ri ‘Bolgan Beag Westminster’ mar a chanas iad, ach tha e fada nas farsainge agus nas doimhne agus nas cudromaiche agus nas cunnartaiche na sin.Oir tha na daoine sin, latha as deoghaidh latha, a’ togail fianais gu bheil aon lagh ann airson uaisleanna dùthcha seo, agus lagh eile ann dha na daoine cumanta – dhutsa agus dhòmhsa.A bharrachd air mar a bha daoine faireachdainn nuair a rinn an Riaghaltasionnsaigh air Iraq air sàilean Seòras Bush, chan fhaca mise daoine cumanta cho crosta agus cho cridhe-briseach agus a tha iad air a bhith le mar a tha An Cuimeanach agus MacIain agus na pupaidean eile anns A’ Chaibineat gan giùlain fhèin.Agus san giùlain sin air mullach, agus ceangailte ris, an droch-làimsheachaidh a tha air a dhèanamh air an galair Covid  le na mìltean mòra nise air air am beatha chall.Tha e doirbh a thuigsinn a bheil na daoine a tha gar riaghladh mar sin a dh’aona-ghnothach, no tro aineolas agus fèinealachd.An dara fear dhiubh sin, saoilidh mi.

The move is vital to secure a stronger future for the business which is urging politicians to support its drive to produce , hydrogen buses in the next four years.The  staff that remain would be more than a ten-fold increase in the number of employees inherited by the management team when it bought Wrightbus out of administration in October , with hopes to grow the workforce to , by the end of .“When we saved Wrightbus from administration last year, there were only about  employees, and since then we have grown the workforce to ,” said Mr Atwal.“The decision has been taken to trim the workforce to the size we believe we will need to see us through to the end of the year.”The redundancies are a necessary measure given the economic slowdown as a result of the current Coronavirus crisis. However, it has not altered the long-term vision of prosperity for the company.“Throughout the COVID- pandemic, while we furloughed a large section of the workforce, we also kept about  engineers, designers and sales staff working to make sure we can take future orders of buses and work on long-term projects, which will provide security and stability for Wrightbus in the coming years,” said Mr Atwal.The Wrightbus factory has created the world’s first hydrogen-electric double-decker bus, which emits only water and there is a great belief that in the coming years this will see a large number of orders come in.There are already strong sales for the delivery of buses in London and Aberdeen this year, with more cities due to follow suit.Mr Atwal said: “We see the future in zero-emission hydrogen and battery-electric transport and have positioned the business accordingly.

The announcement by management is therefore profoundly regrettable.“Management plans to make redundant  employees and to bring forward a phased-process of reducing agency staffing affecting up to  workers. Every job lost is a heavy blow for the inidual concerned, their household, the wider community and economy – especially in the face of the current Covid- pandemic.“Ahead of this announcement being made, I spoke to senior management to call on them to utilise the Coronavirus Jobs Retention Scheme to protect jobs and retain skilled workers the prospect of workers being thrown onto the dole queues at this time is unacceptable.“Management confirmed they will be proceeding to a -day consultative period on their proposals but that they will consider furlough as an option.

Having grown up in the era when the river was dominated by the huge red brick edice of the Braidwater Mill, Rodney points out that its path is more exposed to public view than ever. “When you look back, it was pretty much enclosed space from McNinch Footbridge to Harryville Bridge.  “People had no reason to be in that area unless they were mill workers.“Nowadays we have great views right along this section and I personally feel that there has to be a joined up approach to making full use of this fantastic potential.“With the opening of the retail park it has now opened the area up to everyone and the nature and beauty around the river with wildle such as swans, ducks, otters, kingfishers and other wildle regularly seen on the stretch from Sainsbury’s down to Harryville bridge,” he said. But he acknowledges that not not everyone will see the beauty associated with the area. “There will always be some who will still treat it as a dumping ground and continue to put the wildle and the environment at risk by dumping their refuse into the river. “These people need to be told in no uncertain terms that this will not be lolerated by the local community - we have the ability to impose fines on those who continually flaunt regulations and I would call for such monetary penalties to be used more frequently.”But Rodney beleives the real driving force behind the naural rejuvenation of the area must comes as a united push.“ I feel that the authorities responsible for this area and the retail park owner have to take seriously the issues associated with this stretch of water and listen to the concerns of the community groups and members of the public who regularly use the pathways around the river for daily exercise.“My opinion is that things weren’t thought through properly at the outset and the environmental issues weren’t taken into account when the retail park was being planned. “The aim now should be to preserve the beauty of this stretch of the river Braid and that means taking steps to make sure this happens.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3138061.jpg--.jpg?1590480464000\n","title":"opinion moral necessity to support local business in post virus world","story":"By the Very Rev Dr Norman Hamilton OBEThese last weeks have seen contrasting trends as we battle with coronavirus. On the one hand we have come together in our communityto clap for carers on a Thursday evening, and to make ‘scrubs’ for those in the front line of care in the NHS and in care homes. But with most of our local shops, family businesses and services closed, we have also looked to multinational companies and the big supermarket chains to provide us with what we need . They have done much for which we must be genuinely grateful – perhaps best shown in the huge effort to deliver groceries to homes where people are vulnerable. And many companies have prospered. For example in mid April, Jeff Bezos who is the founder and boss of Amazon, saw his personal wealth swell by pound billionafter soaring demand for online shopping sent the firms share price to a new high. This cemented his position as the worlds richest man with a fortune of well over pound billion. As they say – it is an ill wind that blows no one any good. PATTERNSThese changed patterns of le – evident community spirit and massively increased internet shopping – will bring big moral dilemmas when the pandemic is under control and some degree of normality s. Will community spirit be relegated to the back benches by the need for so many of us to rebuild the patterns of our own everyday lives  And crucially, will we have become so content with buying on-line and having the parcel delivered to our front door, that we will be less committed to buying locally, and supporting local business  I must confess to having real fears on both questions. When the focus moves away from carers and the NHS, what community need will fill the gap  It is very dficult to think of an example which affects every one of us, and to which we can bring such loyalty. And will the obvious convenience of having that parcel delivered to our front door be set aside to go shopping locally on a cold November morning or a wet February afternoon Personally I feel that it is a moral necessity to support our local businesses and shops as best we can – evenit costs a little more to do so. They of course will be well aware of the threat from the big international companies, and must play their part in quality of service and show the ‘personal touch’ that will make it attractive to do business with them in its own right. And there would be a great added bonus that such support on an ongoing basis would be a quite new and important expression of community spirit.I have absolutely no dficulty with the owner of Amazon seeing new opportunities to expand his business. But I have real dficultyordinary citizens like myself in our local area see it as acceptable to give his company so much of our limited income that many of the businesses in our neighbourhood go into serious decline. The Biblical command to ‘love your neighbour as yourself’ has a new and crucially important relevance.

You can choose which of the three peaks you would like to virtually complete by climbing the equivalent number of flights of stairs!The Three Peaks Challenge was set up in  to help raise awareness and essential funds.  So why not ask your workmates, friends or family to sign up and take on the challenge. The Helicopter Emergency Medical Servicehas been tasked , times to serious and le-threatening situations throughout the province and relies on donations to continue operating.Air Ambulance NI, in partnership with Northern Ireland Ambulance Serviceprovides the HEMS for Northern Ireland and requires pound, a day from donations and fund-raising to sustain operations.Kerry Anderson, Head of Fundraising at AANI, said: “The Air Ambulance medical team continue to be tasked out to traumas like Conor’s on average once or twice every day. The le-saving service is there for us every day, and pre-hospital critical care can mean the dference between le and death. Such a crucial service for everyone means that even in these challenging times, fundraising has to continue. “The Three Peaks involved over  people last year, a tremendous effort. That team collectively raised nearly poundk, keeping the team flying for almost three days. So, we’re delighted to be able to offer this again, supported by Boost Drinks. Our supporters are looking forward to walking our beautul peaks after necessary lockdown protocols are eased and our events partner at Le will work with us around any necessary social distancing requirements that are needed. We’re also delighted to have the virtual option available for those who wish to register that way now, orcircumstances mean it’s needed for all,” Kerry added.Air Ambulance NI brings urgent medical assistance to anywhere in the province, operating seven days a week for  hours per day. It can get to anywhere in Northern Ireland in approximately twenty-five minutes. This Doctor   Paramedic service benefits those whose lives are at serious risk following signicant injury or trauma. Effectively the service brings emergency hospital care direct to the casualty.“We are thrilled to help launch the Three Peaks Challenge  in partnership with Air Ambulance NI that will raise funds for a le-saving service available to the Northern Ireland public should they need it,” said Kim Jacks, Boost Drinks’ Consumer Brand Manager.“As our  charity partner we are supporting Air Ambulance NI and encourage people of all abilities to take part and do something very worthwhile. “You can walk at your own pace and spend quality time with friends and family – which I know will be greatly appreciated after a tough start to the year,” continued Kim.The registration fee per location   peak costs pound or pound to register for all three. Participants are asked to fundraise a minimum of pound each to help keep the service operational.

This has been an unprecedented time when faithful Catholics have been unable to receive the Eucharist for months.While many churches have been availing of streaming services via webcams and social media over recent weeks, it#s not the same as being present for Mass.I have a lot of anxious parents whose children haven#t yet been baptised so as soon as it is safe we should be doing that.Fr McCafferty added: Clergy will adapt to the current danger and make things as safe as possible. Older people may be disappointed at not being able toimmediately but we have to consider their safety. The draft plan also envisages confirmation ceremonies taking place in mid-September but advises that such celebrations would be conducted by the parish priest and may have to take place in small groups over successive days.The plan aims to ensure that all preparations are made so that churches are ready to move once the civil authorities in both Northern Ireland and the Republic give approval.Government sources in Dublin have hinted that phase four of its roadmap - when public Masses are due to begin from July  - could be brought forward to the end of Junethe virus continues to be successfully managed.The -point programme, which is expected to be boiled down to key issues in the coming days, also bans choirs and congregational singing when churches re-open.It suggested that dioceses prepare short videos similar to aircraft safety demonstrations to assist parishioners in correct behaviour when ing to Mass.The document says: It is clear that re-opening the pastoral le of the Church will be far more challenging institutionally than anything we have been through in the past few months. Our biggest challenge may be lack of motivation to do all that is required on the part of some, and unbridled enthusiasm to do everything on the part of others.It needs to be clearly understood, however, that churches will only be able to re-open for public liturgy when the proper procedures have been put in place.Earlier this week, Archbishop Eamon Martin said it was sad and disappointing that the Covid- restrictions have lasted throughout the Easter season and congregations are still unable to gather physically.Belfast Most ReadCoronavirus Northern Ireland updates: Executive agrees further easing of lockdown as two further deaths announcedCoronavirus: Northern Ireland shoppers warned a world of change is on the way after lockdownHollywood star Matt Damon leaves Ireland after three-month lockdown but says he’ll ‘absolutely’ be backIreland rugby star Jacob Stockdale uses lockdown time to work on  Mustang motorFurther relaxation of NI#s lockdown proposed: What can be lted, when and why it may not happen,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The Deputy First Minister said there would be no rapid easing of restrictions - for me, it#s about steady as you go.

Paul StaffordThere#s no doubt the salon is going to look and feel dferent. It will be a completely new experience, said Mr Stafford.What people probably don#t fully appreciate until now is the fact that hairdressing is not a service, it#s an experience and there#s a social connection there, a bond and friendships, and some of that might be lost when we reopen. He believes masks, gloves, a reduced menu and longer opening hours will all be part of our new normal.According to the National Hair and Beauty Federation, there are some , hairdressing salons here employing around , staff and generating around £m annually. This does not include self-employed mobile stylists.Our industry in Northern Ireland is up there with the best in world. I#m very proud with the levels of artistry here and what we need now is the whole industry to come together and make sure that we follow the right procedures and aren#t left threatened by people who challenge our businesses by doing things illegally, added Mr Stafford.We are quite efficient and work on a tight schedule but under new guidelines there will be literally no waiting time. It will be a case of making sure clients come in on time and are taken straight through, using an efficient system.At the outset we, personally, will be expanding hours, swapping our normal eight-hour day to  or  hours with staff working shts. That could see us opening from .am and closing at pm.We have a -seater salon and we will be reducing that to four compartments with visors and enough space between.Read More Belfast#s Crossen Engineering sees demand surge for new PPE visorPreparing for such scenarios at beauty-based salons here is manufacturer Crossen Engineering, which is already making visors for the NHS.It is starting to increase its lines to accommodate hair and beauty businesses in the run-up to reopening.We are beginning to see other industries order visors for when they reopen. Places like hospitality establishments, hairdressers and beauty salons, said managing director Paul Crossen.This is all hypothetical and all we can do is plan for every scenario, Mr Stafford is quick to point out.It#s not as simple as ticking all the boxes, this has to be put into practice and it could be a case that it#s just not working, it#s not efficient and that will be problematic.I have spoken to friends in Italy and Germany where there are restrictions and guidelines, but no one is monitoring them. The worst thing that could happen is another spike in October, so I would advise clients now to sit tight. Hair is very important but there is a bigger issue out there. Paul StaffordYes, your hair might look bad and I#ll tell youit looks bad, but stick a hat on, put your hair up, go for a walk and wait until it#s ready. To keep his clients# spirits up during lockdown, Mr Stafford has created a series of #The Virtual Chair# chats with local personalities on his Instagram page.It#s me having conversations with people like Colin Davidson, author Oliver Jeffers, musician Mickey Bradley from The Undertones and broadcaster Pamela Ballantine, he explained. They#re typical of the conversations we would haveI was cutting their hair, and that has brought a great community back together. We#ve had a bit of fun and it shows people that this is what they#re missing. It keeps the brand out there and lets our customers know we are there for them and we#re getting more and more people tuning in.We understand that hair is very important but there is a bigger issue out there this virus is killing people and there have been around  needless deaths here. At our salon no one has been left untouched by it, but we should come through this pandemic in a way that shows empathy.We have been indirectly impacted at the salon and we would like to do this in a respectful way that is safe for everyone.

It#s a  Mustang, and Ireland and Ulster winger Jacob Stockdale couldn#t be happier working on his classic car, with its blue bodywork and two go-faster stripes down its back.The -year-old professional rugby player bought the car on eBay a year ago and the last two months of lockdown in Belfast has given him the luxury of time to pull on his mechanic#s overalls and explore the iconic #first gen# Mustang.Jacob won#t reveal how much he paid for the car which came off the Ford assembly line two years after the first Mustang debuted.It probably was not one of my wisest purchases, but I bought it as a bit of a project car, something to do a bit of work to as a hobby and I love it, said the Lurgan native.Going into lockdown has given me time to tinker away on the car, and I#ve done quite a bit of work on it. I#ve replaced the entire suspension.I re-wired a few things like the horn and the radio because they were both draining the battery.And a year after arriving in Belfast from London, the car still hasn#t a name.No, funnily enough I haven#t given it a name. Nothing comes to mind yet, said Jacob.In terms of its shape, it is my favourite style of Mustang. They ran from  to # or #, so I wanted one from that range.The engine is . litres, so it#s hardly a green machine. It#s quite thirsty, put it that way, said Jacob.And what about speed  Jacob Stockdale is certainly no slouch on the field of play.The GPS which players wear on the back of their jerseys records their speed, travel distance and other stats.I think the fastest I#ve ever been clocked moving is . metres per second, which is around  miles per hour or something like that, said Jacob.He name checks the Mustang Fastbacks, famous for their speed, but Jacob is self-deprecating about his motor. I would say mine is more loud and slow.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseJacob Stockdale is happy to have the time to work on his carPhoto by Kelvin Boyes  Press E FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappJacob Stockdale is happy to have the time to work on his carAnd while he loves the loud sound of the Mustang, his Hungarian Vizsla dog, Layla, isn#t so keen.Purist tendencies means Jacob tries to keep the car looking like it did when it came out of the factory and while his new radio looks old, it has Bluetooth. Just the thing to listen to Johnny Cash, one of his musical favourites, in the car Not so, it seems. He prefers to listen to the sound of the car. Jacob#s first car back in  was his mother#s old  Corsa and his road car is an Audi RS .Yesterday, Jacob took time to promote the Phone a Friend campaign from the mental health charity Aware, which urgently needs to raise funds. Demands on their services are high due to the Covid- pandemic. The campaign is being fronted by Jacob, who is a brand ambassador for Maxol, Aware#s charity partner and runs until June .Jacob said: I had my girlfriend around during lockdown, but I have friends who had to isolate by themselves for  weeks and it can be a struggle and a dficult time, especiallyyou are living with depression or any mental illness.

I wanted to take the pressure off them and do something for the whole denomination, providing some normality perhaps, he said.Uppermost in my mind also was the sense of identity, of being a Presbyterian family who could not meet together. I wanted to give expression to that in the midst of everything.He added: We have all been affected by the pandemic, and my heart goes out to those who have lost loved ones across our island and those who have battled against the virus. They have been in my thoughts and prayers, just as those who continue to go that extra mile in providing daily care for them in our hospitals and care homes. It has been incredible and as a church we thank God for their selfless service and sacrice.The Rev Henry last preached to a church congregation on March . I have been askedI feel that I have been #locked-out# because of the Covid- emergency, he said.We have all had to make adjustments and to live with changed times. As a Moderator your diary is full, you know exactly what you are doing and then suddenly  weeks or more are wiped. However just as in the months before the lockdown, I have been busy and in some ways even busier, but in a dferent way. I have done  weekly pre-recorded services, with the last one going out on Sunday.He admitted that his year in the post had pushed me out of my comfort zone. I am naturally quite shy and reserved and that is not who a Moderator is. You have to get out there, speak up and do the things you are called to do, he said.He said that since the lockdown the Irish church leaders have met more frequently, through video-conferencing, nearly every two weeks.

There will be thousands of job losses, he said.I#ll be proposing that a task force is set up to focus on how best we get the city back up and running. I#d like to see a memorial built to all those who have lost their lives from Covid-.In an exclusive interview with the Belfast , the next Lord Mayor talked about being the first single dad in the job.The SDLP is set to nominate its poll-topping Ardoyne councillor, Paul McCusker, as Deputy Lord Mayor. A nurse in the Mater Hospital, he is a community activist known for his work with the homeless.Covid- will make Monday#s mayoral installation ceremony very dferent from those in previous years. Social distancing means there can#t be a full meeting of all  councillors. Instead, each party will nominate a small number of representatives to attend.The practice of the outgoing Lord Mayor and Deputy Lord Mayor placing the chain of office around the shoulders of their successors will be suspended.Mr McCoubrey succeeds Sinn Fein#s Danny Baker and Mr McCusker takes over from Alliance#s Peter McReynolds.The next Lord Mayor hopes that, despite the restrictions, his mother and five children can watch proceedings from the public gallery in City Hall.Mr McCoubrey will also not have the crowded diary of public engagements that usually awaits new Lord Mayors. It#s very frustrating, he said. Once restrictions ease, I want to be out thanking our NHS and care workers, and those who have been delivering food parcels to the old and vulnerable.Mr McCoubrey, who has been a councillor for  years, said his working-class roots would be to the fore during his mayoralty.I grew up in Springmartin and I still live there. We had nothing. We were no dferent from the people in Springhill across the peace line. I#m a proud unionist but I want to be a Lord Mayor for the people of Springmartin, Springhill and all in this city, whatever their politics.Asked about his attitude to gay marriage, which his party opposes, he said: Same-sex marriage is legal here, and I#ve always taken the approach of live and let live. As Lord Mayor I want everyone to feel welcome in this city regardless of race, religion or sexual orientation.Mr McCoubrey was first elected as a councillor for the Ulster Democratic Party , the UDA#s political wing. He joined the DUP in . When I walked into City Hall in , I was totally overwhelmed. I was the youngest councillor there and the sole UDP one. I went in as a super-Prod from the Shankill, determined to fly the flag high. I#ve learned a lot over the years.In those early days Sinn Fein councillors Fra McCann and Tom Hartley would sit down for a chat. They represented areas with the same problems as mine. Sinn Fein members in City Hall fought tooth and nail for everything they#ve achieved for their communities. Nothing was given to them. I decided to do the same for mine, evenit meant being a thorn in the side of the council establishment.Mr McCoubrey said he#d joined the UDP because the mainstream unionist parties felt remote to someone from my class. He said: I knew it was the political wing of a paramilitary organisation but it was trying to bring peace and stability to the community, and I was up for that.Askedhe was a UDA member andhe condemns its terror campaign, he said: I was never in the UDA. I condemn every murder in Northern Ireland. They were all wrong. None were, or can, be justied.Mr McCoubrey#s term of office as deputy mayor in  was marred when he shared a  with UDA members Johnny Adair and Michael Stone at a loyalist culture day event on the Shankill, which ended with masked men firing shots in the air. He said: Had I known what would happen, I#d not have been on that stage. Things spiralled out of control and I was caught in the middle of it.I remember at the next council meeting, the Sinn Fein group leader got up and said, #I#ve no doubt the deputy lord mayor is a reasonable person but...# and I was bombarded with criticism. Every nationalist councillor wanted me removed.I continued in office but it left a very sour taste for the Catholic community. Had I been able to turn the clock back, I#d have done it in a heartbeat.Mr McCoubreygrew up the eldest in a family of four in Springmartin. His mother was a guide helping on buses taking disabled children to school in west Belfast. His father, who was a fitter in Belfast Gasworks, fell to his death from a roof when Mr McCoubrey was .A lot of responsibility landed on my shoulders, he said. I had just started working as a painter and decorator and I did as much overtime as I could get to help pay the bills. My mum took a second job in the Royal Victoria Hospital laundry as well. Times were tough.Mr McCoubrey has three grown-up children from his first marriage. He has brought up his two sons, Frankand Kyle , as a single dad since his second marriage broke up over a decade ago. It was a steep learning curve for me but I#ve now perfected my cooking, cleaning and ironing skills, he joked.Some times of the year were hard - putting the boys to bed on Christmas Eve and knowing they wouldn#t have two parents there in the morning like most other kids. But summers were always great. I#d a caravan in Portrush and we#d head down there for weekends of fishing, walking on the beach, and Barry#s.The boys are my best friends. I was offered the Lord Mayor#s position four years ago but didn#t take it because they were too young.They don#t need me just as much now. They#re so excited about me becoming Lord Mayor. It#s been a battle getting them to keep it a secret and not tell their mates.Last September, Frank Jnr was the victim of a sectarian hate crime when he was beaten up by nationalist youths as he walked home from school.I was cooking dinner and he walked in, bleeding, bruised and shaking. His jaw was broken. I was devastated. I#ve brought both my boys up to not care about somebody#s religion and I didn#t want this to change them.That night, Arlene [Foster] visited us. She sat with Frank and told him that he must rise above the assault and not let it poison his mind.Mr McCoubrey said the attack had knocked the stuffing out of his son. He played football for Berlin Swts but he hasn#t been back since, and he#s in counselling. But we got phone calls and #get well# cards from right across the community, including from Sinn Fein people, and that was a big help. I want to build on that cross-community spirit as Lord Mayor.

The former Ballinderry Chairman is Ulster GAAs Head of Operations, but has been called onto the GAAs Covid- Advisory Group, chaired by Chairman of Health and Safety group Shay Bannon. “Our work is less than two weeks old,” McGeehan told the County Derry Post, of the group that reports directly to President John Horan and Director General Tom Ryan. “We are there to provide advice and make recommendations. In terms of the decisions, they will be made by the GAAs management committee. googletag.cmd.push “Our remit is a short and sharp piece of work to develop protocols of how and on what basis,it is possible, will it be possible toto training, playing and eventually watching games again.” Professor Mary Horgan, a professor in infectious diseases, has been added to the group. She has previously been advising other world governing bodies of sport. “Her role is crucial in helping voluntary bodies like the GAA,” McGeehan feels. “All of this needs to be medically driven, whether is it is public health advice from the governments or the research around the vaccines and all that might be required in the future.” googletag.cmd.push The committee have, as McGeehan terms it, the easy job, with GAA management having the final call. An initial plan of inter-county action in October and club pencilled in for mid-July, was based on a cut back version. Footballs Tier  championship, the Super s and the qualiers were likely to be shelved, as were the group stages in the hurling championship. In terms of Derry, the senior hurlers had qualied for the NHL promotion play-off. It was initially hoped that games involving relegation and promotion couldve been pencilled into the overall plan, in a bid to provide a clean slate for . “There is no play-book to this and I dont think anyone knowsany of the league games could be played,” was McGeehans opinion on the situation. “At the minute, the focus is on whether activity willat all and what it would require to bring that activity back. No formal decision has been made on the league or the championship.” He also has sympathy for Antrim and Armagh footballers who worked themselves into promising league positions. “That decision will be taken very carefully and on the basis of what space there is. As the weeks go on, I think it becomes less likely that there will be room for them, but I wouldnt rule them out completely.” In terms of club activity, counties have been working away to come up with plans that could be activated once there is a green light. It is likely that club leagues will be scrapped with,there is any action, a series of warm-up games ahead of a knock-out championship. “It would be very important for a lead-in period,” McGeehan feels. “You would want to give club players time to get collective training under their belt, to get them out. Given the timescale, there mightnt be room for many league games. “The window is a moving piste, in that the GAA talked about October and November . In theory, the inter-county programme,bumped into December and into January would allow the clubs a bit more time.” For McGeehan, getting clubs – who he heaped praise onto for their efforts in communities- up and running first is a must. IDEAL “An ideal situation for me would be to get guidance and clarity, to get started back with club football and hurling getting a sizeable window before the inter-county starts back. “Everybody is mad to get out, but only when it is safe to do so. From a safety point of view, it is not about risk elimination, it is about risk reduction.” If the pandemic continues, it could force long term change. In McGeehans opinion, any measures put in place by the GAA may continue into  and beyond. “I think club activity ing is hugely important,” he feels, not just for sporting reasons, There is a a growing epidemic of mental health issues. There are issues over social isolation. I think the first resumption of activity needs to happen at a local level,that is possible.” McGeehan points out the change of language by the government. “Terms such as permanent pandemic surveillance, that type of vocabulary. We are going to have to adjust our lives for Covid- or other strains of a disease like this for the foreseeable. “While it is important to keep peoples thoughts positive, that there might be Gaelic games in , the measure you put in place might carry on into next year and the year after.” The second issue, he feels is becoming clear relates to youths, tied in with theirto school. He asks: “Is there a way, after risk assessments, that you are able to get juvenile activity moving and you are able to get kids out on the pitch again ” “If that is an area of less-risk for the spread of the disease and children have been less affected by it, that presents an opportunity to get them out whenever there is the science to be able to do that.” From the point of view of testing, McGeehan – while pointing out that inter-county players are deemed elite – the GAA is dferent to the Premier League, or indeed the Bundesliga that has two rounds complete since their resumption. “We are dferent,” he begins. “We are neither professional nor semi-professional. From that perspective, the GAA have to look at things dferently. “We have an inter-county game that, like the professional leagues, in theory could work,it was peoples full-time job to be Gaelic footballers or hurlers, but it is not their full-time job.

Last week Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill announced that a Medical School at Magee had been agreed by the Executive with an anticipated September  opening. However, SDLP leader Colum Eastwood amongst others sought further detail saying student intake next year was ‘far from certain’. Speaking at a Stormont debate on the Budget Bill this week, DUP MLA Mervyn Storey - a member of the Northern Ireland Policing Board - challenged the way finances have been distributed. googletag.cmd.push To fulfil the commitment made to police officers in the New Decade, New Approach document would cost poundm per year, he said, which the finance minister has available. He continued: “There are those who would like the Police Service of Northern Ireland to be run into the ground and be so constrained that would be incapable of dealing with public order and the many challenges that it faces.” The North Antrim MLA and former finance minister said poundm was allocated to the new medical facility in Derry. “When anyone looks at the current estimates for the running - the capital and the resource - of that project, the cost will be in excess of pound million. googletag.cmd.push “Some people are hanging their hats on the City Deal providing the additional money, but there is no doubt that it will have recurring costs that have to come back to the Executive,” he added. Ulster University previously told the Derry News that when fully operational with  students per year the medical school will cost approximately poundm per year. Mr Storey went on to say that a ‘deal is a deal’ and in the New Decade, New Approach document there is an agreement to fund a medical school, and, on the opposite page, a commitment to increase police numbers to ,. It leads to the question, he said, what was the process to remove the medical school from the Department for the Economy and the Department of Health and move it to the Executive Office  “Why did that happen, given the fact that responsibility for the delivery of that project lay primarily in those two departments ” TIME RESTRAINTS In responseSinn Feacutein Finance Minister Conor Murphy said: “First, in relation to the PSNI bid and the members view that it was part of a deal. “If it was part of a deal, it is not the responsibility of the Finance Minister to go in and demand that the Justice Minister brings forward a proposition. There is a party leaders forum, which, I think, was set up as a consequence of NDNA in order to discuss issues that might be outside the day-to-day workings of Departments. “If there is an argument that that commitment is not being met, I suggest to the member that that is the area in which to raise it and, hopefully, then secure an agreement. I am more than happy to play my part in that.” With regard to the Magee campus and Ulster University situation, the finance minister said there was a ‘time pressure on agreements’ that needed to be made about matched funding of the inclusive future fund and also about the intake for the graduate-entry medical school. “There was a lack of agreement between both departments on which one would have lead responsibility for that.” He concluded: “In those circumstances, correctly, the Executive Office and the offices of the First Minister and deputy First Minister stepped in to try to arbitrate and find a way through that. “That is how it ended up in that department.” DERRY REPRESENTATIVES During the sitting, SDLP MLA Sinead McLaughlin said she met with senior representatives of Ulster University and left the meeting with the sense that they were in the dark about what happens now in terms of progressing the business case for the medical school. “We need to know what is going on. We need more detail, and we need greater transparency. That applies to the British Governments plan for Brexit, but it also applies to the plans of our Government, the Executive Office and senior officials when it comes to the Magee medical school. “The medical school is due to open its doors in September . “Like every other elected representative and everybody in the city, I was delighted by the announcement, but a lot of work needs to be done for that to take place. It needs to be done very quickly, with a sense of urgency, and I urge the joint First Ministers to proceed at pace.” Sinn Feacutein MLA Karen Mullan commented: “You have two Derry representatives speaking one after another. “Not only are we obviously very passionate about where we come from but we are passionate about delivering the projects that have been worked on for many years. “The recent announcement of match funding for the Derry City and Strabane strategic growth plan and inclusive future fund, alongside the Executive commitment to open the medical school at Magee, are examples of what can and should be done.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In this weeks County Derry Post, a special feature looks into the Derry and Kerry minor teams of recent seasons, as well as a look at the changing landscape on the Oakleafers senior front, where the players are graduating into. Of that total,  have played in the championship, including a  appearance between the posts for then goalkeeping coach Michael Conlan. In all seven goalkeepers have been used, with another goalkeeper coach, Barry Gillis, being listed as an unused sub as cover for another goalkeeping crisis. googletag.cmd.push Conor McAtamney has played most games. Having played in all but one league game under Damian Barton and Damian McErlain, his two stoppage time appearances this season wouldve have amounted to more than three or four minutes. The extended Slaughtneil championship runs left Barton and McErlain preparing a team with both hands tied up their back, such is Shane McGuigans influence up front. Derry also had to patch up a defence that has been without Brendan Rogers and the McKaigue brothers. The fact that a county can be so dependant on one club is a major concern going forward. With a more competitive club championship in recent years, that should change. Even so, there has so be some serious planning into maximising players coming from both intermediate ranks and the city. googletag.cmd.push When you think of Galway being an established Division  county, with Corofin shooting the lights out at club level. With such a revolving door at the entrance to Owenbeg, with players dropping out of  and dferent managers, rightly, having their own ideas on selections, there is no continuity. Without this, how can a kick-out strategy be developed, defined marking alignments or a pattern of play ever be established. During the same time window, Monaghan used  players and Donegal  - in both league and championship. Grab a copy of the paper for the feature in full.

I coached him at U and never saw anyone who could read the game like him at that age. He deservedly got an all-star in  and gave Lavey and Derry many years of great service. Beer rating – .  - Tony Scullion  He would walk onto any team in the land. He didn’t like stretching and once smoked a cigarette while warming up. He didn’t fancy training one bit, yet he was imperious as a defender. This four all-stars tells the tale. He was unlucky not to win a county championship with a very good Ballinascreen team in those years. Beer rating – .   - Paul McFlynn  He played number five after I left the Derry team for many years and was a superb footballer. Paul was a very underrated tackler and always grabbed you a point at the other end. He was unbelievably instrumental in Loups two championship wins and their Ulster triumph. He was quiet but so influential on the pitch.Beer rating – .   - Anthony McGurk  Although, at , he made fleeting and telling impacts for our  team from the bench, I’m going to allow him in here. He is reason why the rest of us played football in the house. We grew up travelling everywhereto watch him. His Derry side wasnt far off the  side in terms of talent. A pure talent, legend, leader and a great influence our family.Beer rating . .  - Joe Irwin  When I came into the Derry team, Joe Irwin was the best player in our county bar none. There was a defiance, strength and ruggedness that yielded him unplayable. Unlucky not to be around in  but was a great player for Derry and a decent Drumsurn team of the ’s. Great lad too. Beer rating – . .  - Anthony Tohill  Anthony was simply the best as an all round player of my time. There was just no one to touch him. He was tall, strong, athletic, skillful, brainy, dedicated and had possessed two good feet. The big man was such a big gentleman as well – there is nothing more to say.Beer rating –  .  - Gregory McCartan . The single most reason why the Down of  regained their levels of . A midfielder who covered serious ground on the pitch and also could kick long range frees. He would always chip in with an odd point from play as well. He was a massive player for Down throughout the s and he could sing nearly as well as he played too! Beer rating –    - Dermot McNicholl  The greatest underage player of all time. I grew up at St Pat’s admiring and living in awe of Spoofer. A great leader in school for me as well as Derry minors. Superbly dedicated footballer who was unlucky not to start in , but made many telling contributions. You couldn’t talk about Derry football without mentioning him.Beer rating –  .  - Brian Conlon  I was a lucky man to play in the same Queen’s team and share a lecture theatre as well. He would have won two All-Ireland’s with Downnot for his serious injury. He had everything as a footballer, with two great feet and saw everything happening around him. He would have been a success at anything, shown by the companyhe grew. RIP Brian.  - Peter Canavan  One of the finest players to grace the pitch. He was unbelievably tricky in finding space and had two super feet. A massive influence for Tyrone in terms of scoring and leadership. The reason that Errigal Ciaran became so successful and why the song ‘oh you’ll never bring the Sam Maguire home’ was but to bed. Beer rating – . .  - Joseph Brolly  Joe was a real corner forward who always got you a handful of points in any game. He flourished in  for Derry and for many years after. One of the best club players I’ve ever played against in a really talented ‘sirs’ team of that era. A joy to play with and socialise with. Always full of the craic in training and games and still is! Beer rating –    - Mickey Linden  I played with him for Ulster in the Railway Cup and was delighted as it was a nightmare to play against him! He was possibly the best forward I have ever marked . A superb speedy corner forward who scored at will. A real gent as well.Beer rating –  .  - Enda Gormley  ‘Edna’ as he was known, was one of the most dedicated footballers I have ever played with. He trained like a professional and got what he deserved. I’ll never forget his days in Maghera Rec on the running machines. A great scorer from play and frees. He was part of a decent Watties side at the turn of the s. He had a fantastic All-Ireland final in , after getting a slap.Beer rating – . . RELATED - The club hurling team of the decade More...

Its fair to say that this crisis has made many of us pause for thought and re-evaluate not just our own behaviour but also many of our previous beliefs. Our new heroes are the cleaners, carers, delivery drivers, shop workers, taxi drivers, bus drivers, nurses and many other professions now commonly described as frontline workers. I was getting a few tyres on my car this week and when I asked the guy had they closed he said no we couldnt as we have a contract with the Ambulance Service and needed to be there to provide help for them and others who needed to go to work.” googletag.cmd.push Without these people putting their own lives at risk the death toll caused by coronavirus would have been off the charts. Prior to all of this, most people took for granted the work done by many of these iniduals. We never really gave it much thought. Now, however, we hail many of them as heroes. We clap for them and we now recognise how much better our society is because of their effort. As I said earlier, a global pandemic has really caused us to pause and reflect and hopefully recalibrate what we as a society should see as important. So, what should we learn from this crisis and what should we build on as a society after it  googletag.cmd.push I used the word recalibrate deliberately because I hope its not a temporary outpouring of sentiment for these many professions followed up by a speedyto the way things were before. Prior to the crisis we saw for example the care sector attract little of our attention or interest. Its a key sector with hundreds of thousands employed right across Ireland and the UK. Salaries are often minimum wage or just above. The work of caring for our loved ones and ensuring they have a good quality of le is often classed as low skilled. Their working conditions and pay never interested many of us or the press media but in this crisis their dedication to care for the most vulnerable members of our society has been astonishing. Their treatment by this government in regard to PPE and testing has cost the lives of hundreds of care workers. Weve clapped for everyone in the NHS and the care workers on many Thursday evenings in March and April. Hopefully after this crisis passes, we will support their right to be paid fairly for the essential frontline work they do. I could say the same for the thousands of cleaners who are on minimum wage and whose efforts kept hospitals and many other facilities open throughout the crisis. Also, think of the hospital porters and canteen staff who are often paid low salaries who risked their own exposure to the virus to care for others. The doctors and consultants are front and centre of this fight and their effort too has been exemplary but the vital effort of many others on the fringe cant be forgotten. And it hasnt just been the workers within the public sector or the low paid within the private sector that have stood out in this crisis. Without a doubt the contribution of charities, community enterprises, social enterprises and co-operatives right across these islands has been remarkable. From delivering vital food parcels to the needy, to making much needed PPE their effort in the midst of this crisis has been remarkable. Thousands of peoplein this city have seen first-hand and benefited first-hand from their efforts. Quite often the support they have given was only possible through thefinancial support from the public sector. This crisis should teach many within the public sector that these partnerships can bring real positive outcomes and should be built on rather than withdrawn after this passes. Many people in broader society see social enterprises often in a bad light. This is partially due to the narrow view of business being solely for profit and TV shows like theDragon’s Den dont help. In reality, Derry has many profitable well runsocial enterprises throughout the city and during this crisis many of them have stood with the community. Hopefully when this crisis is over, we wont allow ourselves to forget the people who kept the economy and society going. We will stand with them and support their calls for better pay and conditions. This week we already seen attempts by the Tories to make migrant NHS workers pay the surcharge be met with a public backlash. It forced the Tories to do a U-turn on the policy. People power does work. We really have to mobilise it more. And its not just me who thinks that this crisis provides the perfect  to build a fairer society. Jamie Dimon, the billionaire CEO of JP Morgan, said last week that the coronavirus pandemic must serve as awake-up call to build a better society. He added: It is my fervent hope that we use this crisis as a catalyst to rebuild an economy that creates and sustains opportunity for dramatically more people, especially those who have been left behind for too long.” Jamie Dimon wrote this in a memo issued before the JP Morgan Annual Shareholders Meeting. He went on to say: The last few months have laid bare the reality that even before the pandemic hit, far too many people were living on the edge.” Mr Dimon is a billionaire banker andJoe Biden wins the US Presidency many believe he will the next Treasury Secretary of the United States. Im not a huge fan of a billionaire banker but I cant disagree with his sentiment. In the US the pandemic showed that the largest economy in the world had far too many workers living from pay cheque to pay cheque. So, as we move forward out of this crisis dont forget who the heroes in the economy were. This will of course mean us putting a higher value on the work that manyof them do.Its a national disgrace how we treat, pay and value the work that carers do. Is it too much to pay them more than pound. per hour to look after our mothers and fathers and grandparents  If you asked  people this question, Im sure the vast majority would agree that care workers are underpaid and undervalued. As a society we need to change this. Im optimisticthat the public sector will see the benefits of real partnerships with the social enterprise sector. The oftenreported public private partnership is not the only option. This crisis has shown that often the private sector is not able toin the same way as a social enterprise can. Finally, I hope that any attempt by politicians to short change or ignore the plight of the workers who held the frontline will be met with a swt backlash from the public. If paying public sector workers more means more taxes, then Im all for that. If increasing the minimum wage to pound per hour means increased prices, then the upside is a fairer society.

It signalled the start of the countys , but on a national level they were nowhere close to toppling Kerry. This week, Michael McMullan trawls back through the record books. The  All-Ireland was the model title. An underage production line, with  clubs represented on Chris Browns starting team brought Tom Markham back north. It was a performance that warmed the cockles of the Derry fans. Expressive football, mixed with Michael McGoldrick, Gerard OKane and Joe Keenan leading a defence that broke the hearts of forward lines across the land. googletag.cmd.push The following year, with six of the team underage, the Oakleafers were tipped for glory again until Damian Daisy McDermotts goal grabbed victory for Tyrone in the first round. It began a tale of woe for Derrys minor grade, which petered off after Magheras  Hogan Cup win and MacLarnon Cup win  months earlier for St Columbs Derry. Like decades before it, school and county minor success drip-fed into the overall pick for senior managers, an addition to the clubs pathway. The county U team didnt push on like it needed to either. The All-Ireland minor final of  was a rare highlight in a -year drought. Aside from that run, the county registered only three other first round wins –  ,  and until Damian McErlains side sparked the current resurgence. googletag.cmd.push At school level, there was also a blip. St Pius Magherafelt and St Pauls Kilrea both won All-Irelands in , but that was the end of the line until Maghera rose from the ashes again. Derry won back to back Buncrana Cups at U level, but were shocked by Fermanagh at minor level in  when it was their minor time, as the rut continued. In the senior ranks, the county were in a strong position. A NFL title came to Derry in , with a run to the final the following year – both against Kerry. There was a run to the Ulster U final. Ballinderry, Greenlough and Lissan all reaching Ulster club finals at their respective grades, with Shamrocks minors picking up a fourth minor title at St Pauls. Not pushing on from here, as a county, was a missed opportunity. Things began to fall away. Three years in Division  followed, before a rise back to the top level and another league final and a hammering by the all-conquering Dubs. Then came a free-fall from the top. Score dference saved Damian Barton from a drop to Division  in  but this was followed by back to back relegations before Damian McErlain steered them back from the basement. Macker has since stepped down, to be replaced by Rory Gallagher, but before Covid- brought sport to a standstill, Derrys chances of ato Division  were unlikely at best. Looking back at Derrys comparison with Kerry, the Kingdom have won two All-Ireland U U titles since Derrys  triumph. Former Kerry senior boss Eacuteamonn Fitzmaurice was on the winning team in  and and lack of silverware at that grade worries him. Fitzmaurice handed  senior debutsto players from the minor teams of  to . Peter Keane, a minor selector under Mickey Ned O Sullivan in  and  before succeeding Jack OConnor as manager for the remainder of the five-in-a-row, took the number to  when appointed as senior boss. Fourteen have played in the championship. In the same time window, playing two and three tiers below Kerry,  Derry players have made it through to senior level. Paul McNeill, Peter Hagan and Danny Tallon played under Richard Ferris in , the rest were part of Damian McErlains minor tenure, with  in all graduating to championship level. The staggering statistic is the contrast with Kerry, in scoring power, from players who have came through. Derrys  minor team was a well-organised unit. Shane McGuigan was the reason they won the Ulster title and he still remains the best forward in the county by some margin. He has scored - in  senior games. With - in  outings, Danny Tallon is a long way back in second place. Paudie McGrogan , Conor Dohertyand Alex Doherty, with -, are next. Compare that to Kerry. Seaacuten OSheas  games brought him a tally of -, David Clfordhas scored -. Killian Spillane, with three of his Templenoe club-mates, bridged the gap from minor to the senior  by playing in the Kerry junior team. Last year, in his debut senior season, Peter Keane handed him a fth championship start in an All-Ireland final and he bagged -. Dara Moynihan, Miceaacutel Burns and defender Tom OSullivan have all contributed to the scoreline. Stats are indicators and dont always tell the full story. Style of play is an influence. Rory Gallagher was slated before a ball was kicked with Derry about his defensive brand of football. From watching games this year and under previous Derry managers, Rory is no dferent. Two men and sometimes one stay up front. There is a link player and everyone  appears briefed with flooding the middle and keeping possession. From watching the teams Derry come up against, what  are you supposed to do. Louth and Tipperary came to the muck and clabber of Celtic Park and parked the bus. Maybe even two or three. Damian McErlain found the same. And every manager before him, struggling to play against the blanket. Remember the  Division  league final  Derry went through a spell of giving the ball away cheaply. Against a Kerry or a Dublin they wouldve got hammered. From talking to Kerrys Eye Sports Editor, Sylvester Hennessy, an analyst under Peter Keane, who is now helping with Limerick. He points out the dference is night and day, once you go down the isions. You still need killer forwards to play attacking football at senior level. Much is talked about youth football, but the Derry club scene isnt coming down with enough candidates. I am thinking of Derrys trip to Paacuteirc Esler. They were squeaky clean in possession. In fact, their setup was spot on. With another steady head and an eye for a score, theyd have beaten both Down and Leitrim. Thats the reality. Organisation and brawn will only take you so far. Finishers win prizes. Even Donegal, who were so negative in the McKenna Cup clash with Derry, are expressive when they head out of Ulster. Hennessy, like Eacuteamonn Fitzmaurice, speaks of the attacking brand of football in Kerry. Fitzmaurice stresses how kids want to be the next Gooch, Clford or Mickey Sheehy. He mentions the way football is played allows forwards to develop their craft. Both men mention the  U Paul McGirr final, a thriller won by Pobalscoil Chorca Dhuibhne after extra-time. Fitzmaurice remembers and asks about the blondie fellaup front for Maghera. Hennessy was covering the game and also enquired of Dohertys progress. Eacuteamonn refers to Magheras impressive Hogan Cup final performance in  and Danny Tallons name comes up in the conversation. Conor Converys nine points in the  semi-final win was enough for Fitzmaurice to have his prize defender Brian Oacute Beaglaoich keep tabs on him in the final. “I would have often have seen a lot of similarities between the Derry style of play and the Kerry style of play,” offers Fitzmaurice of his playing days. “That is dferent over the past couple of years for sure, I wouldve thought in the past that the forward culture wouldnt have been that dferent between the two counties.” Going forward, it has been encouraging to see Paul Cassidy and Matthew Downey at club level in the past year. Cassidys performance to save Derry Us from defeat against Armagh was tantalising. Shane McGuigan is crying out for help. As a trio, it could be a decent foundation. Behind this, schools, club and county coaches must produce more of the same from the wheelie bin type coaching of lockdown. With it, needs to come a pressure to change the outlook. Defensive football is perfect for stabilising a team. Derry and Kerry minors were the perfect example. Niall Keenan marked their  dangerman Conor Geaney out of the game, but up popped the unknown quality of Michael Foley to sink Derry. As for the Kingdoms  and  model, they would just give you nightmares. The elephant in the room, one that cant be ignored is the colossal turnover of players. From the start of Damian Bartons tenure, in , Derry have used  playersin league and championship, with  featuring in the latter. To give the numbers some context, Donegal reached three Ulster finals, winning two, during this same spell, using  players in league and championship. Monaghan have used  players. This is something that Derry are going to have to nail,the current underage development is going to bear any fruit. Between players leaving , managers having dferent opinions and the lure of the US in the summer - its impossible for anything to blossom. There is a culture of expectation to be a starter and when players are not making the cut, pressure comes from club managers about wasting their time with the county. Granted, it is easier for a  player to hang around many of the top counties with the chance of winning silverware and the carrot of maybe a team holiday at the end of the season for getting to a final. Another huge issue is a lack of midfielders. When Down pushed up on Derry in Newry, there was nobody to pluck a ball from the skies. A qualier a few years ago against Laois was the same. There is not much you can do without the leather. Hand in hand with this, comes the debate about AFL. Conor Glass, Callum Brown and Anton Tohill were not the finished article. There is Kealan Friel coming through, a late bolter, as termed by U boss Mickey Donnelly, having not progressed through the county minors. The days of the short kick-out are fading. It does have its place, but without any size at midfield there can be no plan B. Like the lack of scoring forwards, ato producing midfielders needs to figure high up any coaching plan for the future. One that must start now. Unless club, school and county are united, and properly, then little change can be expected. And Gerard OKanes team of  and Derrys  senior team will be as far away as ever.

Granted, it is easier for a  player to hang around many of the top counties with the chance of winning silverware and the carrot of maybe a team holiday at the end of the season for getting to a final. Another huge issue is a lack of midfielders. When Down pushed up on Derry in Newry, there was nobody to pluck a ball from the skies. A qualier a few years ago against Laois was the same. There is not much you can do without the leather. Hand in hand with this, comes the debate about AFL. Conor Glass, Callum Brown and Anton Tohill were not the finished article. There is Kealan Friel coming through, a late bolter, as termed by U boss Mickey Donnelly, having not progressed through the county minors. The days of the short kick-out are fading. It does have its place, but without any size at midfield there can be no plan B. Like the lack of scoring forwards, ato producing midfielders needs to figure high up any coaching plan for the future. One that must start now. Unless club, school and county are united, and properly, then little change can be expected. And Gerard OKanes team of  and Derrys  senior team will be as far away as ever.

He is now in his second year as Principal of Dingles Pobalscoil Chorca Dhuibhne, who he managed to successive Hogan Cups. He handed senior debuts to  players who played minor against Derry. He spoke to Michael McMullan... *** A  minute phone-call to Eacuteamonn Fitzmaurice is time well-spent. The former Kerry boss is as interested as he is interesting. Calm. Concise. A listener and a talker in equal measure. “No problem,” comes the response earlier in the week, to a request for a Kerry angle on an Ulster minor football feature. A peek into the county who know it better than most. A county where football chat ebbs around every corner and silverware is the only currency. googletag.cmd.push Derry went  years without an Ulster minor title. Gradually the wheels of change are beginning to turn. We start our conversation with Kerrys shortfalls. From  until the golden minor generation, Tom Markham didnt set foot inside Kerry. In the senior ranks, by the time Liam Hassett lted Sam, it was  years since  skipper Tommy Doyle carried it into his native Annascaul. A real famine in these parts. As the noughties began, Sam came to visit more often. “There were senior All-Irelands being won and there were no minors being won, so it wasnt as much of a concern,” Fitzmaurice said of the his playing career at the start of the millennium. googletag.cmd.push One or two players coming off a minor production line added to an already strong senior core. Its above that where his concern rests. At U level, a grade where Fitzmaurice, the player, annexed two All-Ireland U medals and found the net in the  win over Laois. “It is a better yardstick for players in terms of making it to senior afterwards,” he adds, looking through the eyes of an ex-senior manager. A sole title since, in , is a concern for him. The minor success was still great, he continues. Of the  players from the winning teams to have already tasted the senior championship, Fitzmaurice and Peter Keane dished out an equal number of debuts. Another eight have played in the league. “I think it is a case by case basis,” Fitzmaurice replies, when prompted about the decision to bring them in. Tom OSullivan, Barry OSullivan and Brian Oacute Beaglaoich, from his Hogan Cup winning team, were first. It is a delicate balancing act, he concedes. Finding the middle ground between giving players exposure and risking long-term prospects. “You have David Clford and the Seaacutenie OShea, they are the exception rather than the norm, who can come through and make an impact straight away,” he points out. Diarmuid OConnor played in the league once he stepped out of minor, just one game. Clford is the only one from the five minor teams to become a fully-fledged Kerry senior in his first year out of underage. “What you find with a lot of the other players, it does take a couple of seasons training with the senior squad,” he added. Five seasons passed before Peter Keane made Shane Ryan the regular senior goalkeeper, reaching an All-Ireland final in . Liam Kearney, minor captain in , wasnt a regular until this season. Another  graduate, Miceaacutel Burns, couldnt nail down a starting berth in the Dr Crokes team that defeated Slaughtneil in , but is now a Kerry regular. Killian Spillane went the scenic route via the All-Ireland junior winning team. “It has probably taken longer than they wouldve anticipated themselves to come through, but it is such a big jump up from minor to senior.” Fitzmaurice chips in with Dublins U success. The politans have won four titles in the last  years and lost last years final. “It takes a couple of seasons to come through and get ready to be at the level where you can really impact...to get used to the level of training, to be physically developed and mentally and emotionally be ready,” he believes. *** Kerrys minor run had to start somewhere. It was a collective, according to Fitzmaurice. Development squads were a big factor, as well as having former Kerry players teaching in the locals schools. The local influence was massive. Jack OConnor is in Colaacuteiste na Sceilge, Liam Hassett is Deputy Principal in St Michaels Listowel. Marc Oacute Seacute is in The Green in Tralee. “They are willing to give time to develop the school teams,” stresses Fitzmaurice, who also has help from an unlikely source in Chorca Dhuibhne. Back in , when Fitzmaurice was Kerry U manager, he knew the season was going to clash with the schools football season. Tommy Grfin runs a pub in Dingle and the hours were never going to clash with school training. Plus, with many of the pupils coming from Tommys native Dingle, the local club would benefit. He gladly agreed. “That was a big factorand other schools have done that, where people were available and were happy to come in to help - it was completely voluntary. It was a coup and a half for us, that someone like that would get involved.” Donal Daly is another link. He played with Fitzmaurice on Kerry teams and operates a hands-off approach in his role as Kerry GAAs Games Manager. He uses his experience from the county scene to oversee and trust people. Allowing them to paddle their own canoe, yet pull the strings together at the same time. “Thats been very effective and has worked well,” Eacuteamonn comments, while also acknowledging the efforts of clubs. “When you put it all together, then a lot of very good players have been developed over the last  or  years and it has certainly worked.” Relationships are important. The school versus county minor loggerheads is a common scenario. But, with Jack OConnor at the helm with the minors in  and , it was the perfect scenario. Fitzmaurice had a good working relationship from playing under Jack with Kerry, and later alongside him as a senior selector. “We had an arrangement that the players spent most of the time with us , played most of the football with us and when the dferent Kerryteams got knocked out along the way, they spent more time with the minors,” Fitzmaurice explains.  Mark OConnor and Brian Oacute Beaglaoich show off the Hogan Cup Four days after the  Hogan Cup final win over Maghera, Kerry played their first minor championship game, a comfortable win over Clare. OSullivan and Oacute Beaglaoich lined out in defence. Current AFL player Mark OConnor and Barry OSullivan were at midfield, Cathal Bambury was in attack, with Tomaacutes Oacute Seacutecoming off the bench. “That was certainly a challenge for the minor management,” he concedes. “They had a bunch of players coming in, who they not seen a huge pile of. “That became the model for other years when Peter Keane became involved , Tommywas a selector with him so there was crossover and co-operation.” St Brendans Killarney followed up with two Hogan Cups. In Fitzmaurices opinion, there was no masterplan, yet it worked. Co-operation, communication and trust, the three words he rolls out. The minor management knew the players would be primed for action. “It has definitely stood usin good stead at colleges and minor level, thankfully it has worked out from our perspective.” *** Trotting down the Cusack Stand corridor, with swapped jerseys slung over their shoulders, the Kerry minors chiselled physique matched their silky skills of the previous hour. When asked about the provision for strength and conditioning, it was done within the school with advice from the minor setup. Given the size of Kerry, pooling for central sessions wasnt feasible. Again, Fitzmaurice drops in the word balance. Between conditioning for the minor season and playing in the schools performance phase and knock-out football. “We got advice on what the minors were doing and what we could do in the school. In the winter time, we did gym work in school and took it into the minor season.” Chorca Dhuibhne could avail of Tomaacutes Oacute Beaglaoich, a teacher in the school. Though not fully qualied , he had knowledge, which he mixed with the advice offered by the county experts and supervised the sessions. “It is an awkward balancing act. We fed into it and tried to do it as best we could. In The Sem , they had Arthur Fitzgerald, who had been involved in the strength and conditioning with Kerry minor and U teams,” Fitzmaurice explains. “I think, across the county, there is joined up thinking from the development squads right up to senior level as to what the best route way is for players and the best way to manage it. “It is a challenge because of all the football players get to play, to balance that with physically developing them. It worked out quite well for us, in that a lot of it was a common-sense approach.” *** One aspect of the school versus county situation across Ulster, was the clash of the MacRory and MacLarnon Cup players and U squads, due to the changing of grades to U and U. It forced players into making choices and balancing spinning plates. Fitzmaurice feels that it is always fair to give new ideas a chance and allow experimentation. Two years down the track, he can now make up his mind. “I think the older age groups , for me, worked better,” he answers, with the experience of the pathway both as a player and manager. “The way it is now, you have a lot of lads doing their leaving cert, they are playing Us and Im not convinced it works. “I think U is a better age-group, by the time they are finished they have a good grounding at the end of the development phase and getting ready to make their mark at senior level.” Comparing the Derry and Kerry minor teams of -, the scoring s and a better balance to Jack OConnor and Peter Keanes teams was the game-changer. “Forwards dont tend to be a huge problem for us, they seem to be part of the identy of Kerry football,” states Fitzmaurice, while feeling the county needs more steeliness in their defence. A couple of hard as nails defenders, he jokes. Does he feel this attacking flair comes from the standard of club football, tradition down through the years or more expression being encouraged  After a brief pause, he feels its a combination of all three. “The standard of coaching and club football is very good here. Every generation growing up, they are looking at Mikey Sheehy, then you are looking at Maurice Fitzgerald, then the Gooch and now Clford. There is always someone to look at and to learn from, so that helps.” The Kerry style of play, he continues, does allow forwards to express themselves more - particularly at younger age groups. All emphasised by the county board coaches around the schools. Fitzmaurice feels the standard of coaching, all over Ireland, is of a high standard, with resources and clinics for coaches to improve. “At the younger age groups there would be a huge emphasis on skill development, getting all the basic skills and going up through the grades, particularly as they get older, the players themselves get more competitive. “It is not enough to have the skills, they need the grounding, the basics and fundamentals at a good level so they can start to aim at winning things. It becomes a bit more serious and tactical, but at the younger age groups there would be a lot of freedom.” The conversation heads to a conclusion, with his impression of Derry. From playing, managing and being at the coalface of underage at school. Alex Dohertys performance in the Paul McGirr final gets a mention. Growing up, do Kerry players have a better chance to flourish  “The way football is played down here , they have a bit more time to develop their craft whereasyou are playing a very defensive-orientated culture it is hard. “Playing against Derry myself, and watching Derry in the recent past they have played a bit more defensive. “There was a time when Derry,you think back  years ago or certainly when I was playing, they were very much a strong physical team and they were a kicking team. They had a great forwards, they had the Bradleysand they were hard to contain. “That is dferent over the past couple of years for sure, I wouldve thought in the past that the forward culture wouldnt have been that dferent between the two counties.” The Kerry man would have often likened the Derry style of play to Kerry. And people down here know their football. The roll of honour reinforces that. RELATED - Fitzmaurice on the lure of Australia More...

He is now in his second year as Principal of Dingles Pobalscoil Chorca Dhuibhne, who he managed to successive Hogan Cups. He handed senior debuts to  players who played minor against Derry. He spoke to Michael McMullan... *** A  minute phone-call to Eacuteamonn Fitzmaurice is time well-spent. The former Kerry boss is as interested as he is interesting. Calm. Concise. A listener and a talker in equal measure. “No problem,” comes the response earlier in the week, to a request for a Kerry angle on an Ulster minor football feature. A peek into the county who know it better than most. A county where football chat ebbs around every corner and silverware is the only currency. googletag.cmd.push Derry went  years without an Ulster minor title. Gradually the wheels of change are beginning to turn. We start our conversation with Kerrys shortfalls. From  until the golden minor generation, Tom Markham didnt set foot inside Kerry. In the senior ranks, by the time Liam Hassett lted Sam, it was  years since  skipper Tommy Doyle carried it into his native Annascaul. A real famine in these parts. As the noughties began, Sam came to visit more often. “There were senior All-Irelands being won and there were no minors being won, so it wasnt as much of a concern,” Fitzmaurice said of the his playing career at the start of the millennium. googletag.cmd.push One or two players coming off a minor production line added to an already strong senior core. Its above that where his concern rests. At U level, a grade where Fitzmaurice, the player, annexed two All-Ireland U medals and found the net in the  win over Laois. “It is a better yardstick for players in terms of making it to senior afterwards,” he adds, looking through the eyes of an ex-senior manager. A sole title since, in , is a concern for him. The minor success was still great, he continues. Of the  players from the winning teams to have already tasted the senior championship, Fitzmaurice and Peter Keane dished out an equal number of debuts. Another eight have played in the league. “I think it is a case by case basis,” Fitzmaurice replies, when prompted about the decision to bring them in. Tom OSullivan, Barry OSullivan and Brian Oacute Beaglaoich, from his Hogan Cup winning team, were first. It is a delicate balancing act, he concedes. Finding the middle ground between giving players exposure and risking long-term prospects. “You have David Clford and the Seaacutenie OShea, they are the exception rather than the norm, who can come through and make an impact straight away,” he points out. Diarmuid OConnor played in the league once he stepped out of minor, just one game. Clford is the only one from the five minor teams to become a fully-fledged Kerry senior in his first year out of underage. “What you find with a lot of the other players, it does take a couple of seasons training with the senior squad,” he added. Five seasons passed before Peter Keane made Shane Ryan the regular senior goalkeeper, reaching an All-Ireland final in . Liam Kearney, minor captain in , wasnt a regular until this season. Another  graduate, Miceaacutel Burns, couldnt nail down a starting berth in the Dr Crokes team that defeated Slaughtneil in , but is now a Kerry regular. Killian Spillane went the scenic route via the All-Ireland junior winning team. “It has probably taken longer than they wouldve anticipated themselves to come through, but it is such a big jump up from minor to senior.” Fitzmaurice chips in with Dublins U success. The politans have won four titles in the last  years and lost last years final. “It takes a couple of seasons to come through and get ready to be at the level where you can really impact...to get used to the level of training, to be physically developed and mentally and emotionally be ready,” he believes. *** Kerrys minor run had to start somewhere. It was a collective, according to Fitzmaurice. Development squads were a big factor, as well as having former Kerry players teaching in the locals schools. The local influence was massive. Jack OConnor is in Colaacuteiste na Sceilge, Liam Hassett is Deputy Principal in St Michaels Listowel. Marc Oacute Seacute is in The Green in Tralee. “They are willing to give time to develop the school teams,” stresses Fitzmaurice, who also has help from an unlikely source in Chorca Dhuibhne. Back in , when Fitzmaurice was Kerry U manager, he knew the season was going to clash with the schools football season. Tommy Grfin runs a pub in Dingle and the hours were never going to clash with school training. Plus, with many of the pupils coming from Tommys native Dingle, the local club would benefit. He gladly agreed. “That was a big factorand other schools have done that, where people were available and were happy to come in to help - it was completely voluntary. It was a coup and a half for us, that someone like that would get involved.” Donal Daly is another link. He played with Fitzmaurice on Kerry teams and operates a hands-off approach in his role as Kerry GAAs Games Manager. He uses his experience from the county scene to oversee and trust people. Allowing them to paddle their own canoe, yet pull the strings together at the same time. “Thats been very effective and has worked well,” Eacuteamonn comments, while also acknowledging the efforts of clubs. “When you put it all together, then a lot of very good players have been developed over the last  or  years and it has certainly worked.” Relationships are important. The school versus county minor loggerheads is a common scenario. But, with Jack OConnor at the helm with the minors in  and , it was the perfect scenario. Fitzmaurice had a good working relationship from playing under Jack with Kerry, and later alongside him as a senior selector. “We had an arrangement that the players spent most of the time with us , played most of the football with us and when the dferent Kerryteams got knocked out along the way, they spent more time with the minors,” Fitzmaurice explains.  Mark OConnor and Brian Oacute Beaglaoich show off the Hogan Cup Four days after the  Hogan Cup final win over Maghera, Kerry played their first minor championship game, a comfortable win over Clare. OSullivan and Oacute Beaglaoich lined out in defence. Current AFL player Mark OConnor and Barry OSullivan were at midfield, Cathal Bambury was in attack, with Tomaacutes Oacute Seacutecoming off the bench. “That was certainly a challenge for the minor management,” he concedes. “They had a bunch of players coming in, who they not seen a huge pile of. “That became the model for other years when Peter Keane became involved , Tommywas a selector with him so there was crossover and co-operation.” St Brendans Killarney followed up with two Hogan Cups. In Fitzmaurices opinion, there was no masterplan, yet it worked. Co-operation, communication and trust, the three words he rolls out. The minor management knew the players would be primed for action. “It has definitely stood usin good stead at colleges and minor level, thankfully it has worked out from our perspective.” *** Trotting down the Cusack Stand corridor, with swapped jerseys slung over their shoulders, the Kerry minors chiselled physique matched their silky skills of the previous hour. When asked about the provision for strength and conditioning, it was done within the school with advice from the minor setup. Given the size of Kerry, pooling for central sessions wasnt feasible. Again, Fitzmaurice drops in the word balance. Between conditioning for the minor season and playing in the schools performance phase and knock-out football. “We got advice on what the minors were doing and what we could do in the school. In the winter time, we did gym work in school and took it into the minor season.” Chorca Dhuibhne could avail of Tomaacutes Oacute Beaglaoich, a teacher in the school. Though not fully qualied , he had knowledge, which he mixed with the advice offered by the county experts and supervised the sessions. “It is an awkward balancing act. We fed into it and tried to do it as best we could. In The Sem , they had Arthur Fitzgerald, who had been involved in the strength and conditioning with Kerry minor and U teams,” Fitzmaurice explains. “I think, across the county, there is joined up thinking from the development squads right up to senior level as to what the best route way is for players and the best way to manage it. “It is a challenge because of all the football players get to play, to balance that with physically developing them. It worked out quite well for us, in that a lot of it was a common-sense approach.” *** One aspect of the school versus county situation across Ulster, was the clash of the MacRory and MacLarnon Cup players and U squads, due to the changing of grades to U and U. It forced players into making choices and balancing spinning plates. Fitzmaurice feels that it is always fair to give new ideas a chance and allow experimentation. Two years down the track, he can now make up his mind. “I think the older age groups , for me, worked better,” he answers, with the experience of the pathway both as a player and manager. “The way it is now, you have a lot of lads doing their leaving cert, they are playing Us and Im not convinced it works. “I think U is a better age-group, by the time they are finished they have a good grounding at the end of the development phase and getting ready to make their mark at senior level.” Comparing the Derry and Kerry minor teams of -, the scoring s and a better balance to Jack OConnor and Peter Keanes teams was the game-changer. “Forwards dont tend to be a huge problem for us, they seem to be part of the identy of Kerry football,” states Fitzmaurice, while feeling the county needs more steeliness in their defence. A couple of hard as nails defenders, he jokes. Does he feel this attacking flair comes from the standard of club football, tradition down through the years or more expression being encouraged  After a brief pause, he feels its a combination of all three. “The standard of coaching and club football is very good here. Every generation growing up, they are looking at Mikey Sheehy, then you are looking at Maurice Fitzgerald, then the Gooch and now Clford. There is always someone to look at and to learn from, so that helps.” The Kerry style of play, he continues, does allow forwards to express themselves more - particularly at younger age groups. All emphasised by the county board coaches around the schools. Fitzmaurice feels the standard of coaching, all over Ireland, is of a high standard, with resources and clinics for coaches to improve. “At the younger age groups there would be a huge emphasis on skill development, getting all the basic skills and going up through the grades, particularly as they get older, the players themselves get more competitive. “It is not enough to have the skills, they need the grounding, the basics and fundamentals at a good level so they can start to aim at winning things. It becomes a bit more serious and tactical, but at the younger age groups there would be a lot of freedom.” The conversation heads to a conclusion, with his impression of Derry. From playing, managing and being at the coalface of underage at school. Alex Dohertys performance in the Paul McGirr final gets a mention. Growing up, do Kerry players have a better chance to flourish  “The way football is played down here , they have a bit more time to develop their craft whereasyou are playing a very defensive-orientated culture it is hard. “Playing against Derry myself, and watching Derry in the recent past they have played a bit more defensive. “There was a time when Derry,you think back  years ago or certainly when I was playing, they were very much a strong physical team and they were a kicking team.

On Monday, five of Derry City  Strabane District Council’s  household recycling centres reopened after being closed for a period as a result of the COVID- emergency legislation. Long queues formed outside the centres before they opened as people who were in lockdown attempted to dump and recycle materials that had accumulated. Derry’s centres do not charge people to get rid of their waste. In Donegal people must pay for some items at recycling centres while others are free.  googletag.cmd.push At the most recent meeting of the council, DUP Alderman Maurice Devenney said the use of the dumps by people from Donegal was a quite serious problem which needed to be examined. Alderman Devenney said that given the costs being faced by the local council as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, they should not be footing the bill for people from a dferent jurisdiction to get rid of their rubbish. He suggested that when the dumps are re-opened the council should look at new measures to prevent people from outside the council area using the facilities. Alderman Devenney asked for a report to be prepared in a bid to try and establish how many vehicles with southern registrations are using the local dumps. googletag.cmd.push Addressing the issue of cross border waste, a council spokesperson this week said that it is aware of ‘some cross border waste’ being brought to its recycling centres by members of the public and that its centres are designed to handle the volume of waste which passes through daily. She said: “This issue is reviewed on an ongoing basis with elected members recently requesting a full report on usage that will come before them for review and discussion at the next Environment and Regeneration Committee. “Council acknowledges the fact that there are many instances where users of the amenity sites live outside of the Council area, for example they may own a property within the Council area. “Council continues to remind people from outside of the council area that where possible they should limit travel and should use services and facilities in their own areas.” The Council spokesperson added that they experienced a high volume of users at the sites when they reopened on Monday and encouraged the public to hold off and avail of the services later in the week. Five centres at Pennyburn, Glendermott Road, Strathfoyle, Claudy and Strahan Road in Strabane are all open from am to pm Monday to Friday, am to pm on Saturday, and Sunday opening from  to pm for Pennyburn, Glendermott Road and Strahan Road sites only. The public are reminded that the council’s regular refuse collection service is fully operational throughout this emergency period and that additional support to deal with excess waste has been provided through a bespoke COVID Waste Helpline –    - and a free Bulky Waste Collection Service that can be booked online on the councils website.

Patricia McCallion, who owns her own hair and beauty salon in Waterloo Street, agreed to be stripped of her make-up and lashes to take part in Pretty Single which airs on Monday. The series sees siximage-concious singeltons embrace the natural lookto try and finda love connection that is more than skin deep. Patricia kicks off the showbygoing on five dates with five dferent guys, while her co-starswatch the dates unfold from the comfort of their sofa – providing supportive and humorous commentary throughout. googletag.cmd.push Mum-of-one and self-confessed romantic, Patricia admits she hides her true self behind make-up to boost her confidence. “It’s putting on a mask in the morning, it’s covering the flaws that you don’t like about yourself, she said. People often say to me you look like you workin the beauty industry and I do like to look the part. I have to look at myself in the mirror all day at work so I want to look mybest. Each of the five suitors have been specially matched to Patricia but she could only take one to dinner. The dates were one after the other and then you had to whittle it down to two and decide which one to take on a proper date, explained Patricia. googletag.cmd.push If I was going on a normal dateId have my make-up done because you want to impress, but the funny thing was the fellas didnt even notice we werent wearing make-up. I felt like I was putting myself out there and it was scary, but at the same time I felt like they were getting to know the real me because I was more vulnerable. Patricia remains tight lipped about who she chose for her date, but revealed she was given the option of going bare faced or wearing make-up. I kind of went for a bit of both, she laughed. She is now looking forward to seeing the show for the first time when it airs on Monday. The trailer came on the other night after Eastenders and I was jumping around the room, she admitted. I kept rewinding it to watch again. Narrated by Derry Girls star Saoirse-Monica Jackson, Pretty Single is a Stelly Media production for BBC One Northern Ireland and BBC Scotland. It begins on BBC One Northern Ireland on Monday  May at .pm. All six episodes in the series will be available on BBC iPlayer after the first episode is broadcast.

In an extensive interview this weeks County Derry Post, the former Kingdom and Hogan Cup winning boss gives a Kerry slant to a feature on the minor clashes with Derry from  to . Derry have lost the services of Conor Glass and Callum Brown since minor level, with former U player Anton Tohill also lost to the AFL. Current Derry captain Chrissy McKaigue had a stint with Sydney Swans, and more recently Conleth McShane attended a AFL combine in Dublin before Christmas. googletag.cmd.push It was the same one Tohill and Oisin McWilliams attended two years ago. McWilliams later spent time in Australia with North Melbourne, in , but wasnt snapped up. Kerrys  goalkeeper Deividas Uosis and  winning captain Mark OConnor, both past pupils of Fitzmaurice have travelled down under, but their prize asset – David Clford – has stayed put. “It wasnt on his radar,” reveals Fitzmaurice of a meeting they had when he was senior manager. “He had no interest in going to Australia, or anywhere . Id say there were definitely approaches made but he wanted to play for Kerry and win All-Irelands with Kerry.” googletag.cmd.push On the flip side, Kerry lost OConnor to the AFL. He won two Hogan Cup medals under Fitzmaurice in Pobalscoil Chorca Dhuibhne. “He is a great guy and a big loss to Kerry,” Eacuteamonn states. “He got made an offer and decided to avail of it. From a Kerry perspective, it is up to us to make sure the players want to stay for the right reason. “If they do stay, they get a good education. There is a good job for them and they are well looked after to allow them to pursue an amateur sport. “Rather than giving out about it, it is always important to look in the mirror...is there anything we can do that would make a players le a bit easierthey do stay at home. David wanted to stay at home and we are delighted that he did.” Playing inter-county doesnt pay the bills, but Fitzmaurice sees a bigger picture. “When you are the manager of Kerry, thats what you want – for the players - to ensure the were happy in their personal and professional lives every bit as much as they are in their football lives. “If they are happy in their personal and professional lives, iniably they are going to be better footballers for it. Its not jobs for the boys, what you are trying to do is to encourage players to get a good education, to go down a route that they are interested in, so they can build a good career as well as being a successful footballer.” RELATED - Tohill waiting to make his mark.

St Mary’s have been involved with Ronan McLaughlin of Sustrans NI this year and it has continued during lockdown. His challenges incorporated into their weekly timetables for online learning.

Former professional cyclist and current sports presenter Daniel Lloyd called for the jersey to be made. Eurosport presenter Orla Chennaoui, a past pupil of St Mary’s, was ready to place her order. In no time, French blogger Justin Velo brought the design to le, prompting an increase in demand for the jersey to be made. Interest flooded in from all over the world. Conan had his hands full communicating with admirers from far and wide. Offers flooded in from a number of interested sporting bodies, wanting to bring his topical cycling jersey to le. googletag.cmd.push Conan is thrilled to announce that the famous sports design company Pactimo will produce his cycling jersey. Their clothing is worn by professional athletes, national champions and Olympians. Principal Corinne Coyle assures us, they are in good company with our Conan! “I was so excited when my jersey was being retweeted by so many people,” Conan told the County Derry Post “When I was designing the top, I thought the Covid- message, Keep your distance would be equally good for cyclists, as I know they often worry about how close motorists get to them when they are out on the roads. “So, as well as saving lives against the virus, the message could also save lives on our roads. My sister Cadhla is looking for some credit, as I used her markers to colour the jersey!” Pactimo have agreed to initially make two copies of the original design, one for Conan and one for the school. Exciting discussions are currently underway with Pactimo to decide how this brilliant design can best reach a wider audience and benefit others in the process. As this project continues to unfold, excitement is at an all-time high at St Mary’s PS Draperstowns Learning Hub. We can’t wait to see how this story develops and we anticipate many more adventures in June.

DUP Alderman Graham Warke said many people from the local area travelled  miles to Lisburn to visit the Lagan Valley Leisureplex which has a number of swimming pools and state-of-the-art facilities. He said Derry City and Strabane District Council should be looking to create a similar facility. Alderman Warke was speaking today at the councils monthly meeting during a discussion on the future of local leisure facilities. Sinn Fein councillor Aileen Mellon brought a motion before the meeting asking the council to note the public disappointment at the lack of progress to date to advance the construction and re-development of Templemore Sports Complex in Derry and Riversdale Leisure Centre in Strabane. googletag.cmd.push The motions stated: “This motion calls on Council to prioritise the development of those long outstanding projects by bringing forward a report to the Council meeting in September to include the identication of all funding options available and a timetable towards completion so that the Council can consider its options.” Alderman Warke told the meeting his party would support the motion but added that he believed the council should use the opportunity to look at ways of improving its leisure facilities even further. He said he had travelled with his family to the Lagan Valley Leisureplex because of the facilities.

Cllr Boyles amendment proposal was supported by  councillors and opposed by ten. The reworded motion was then passed unanimously at the meeting.

He then raised the alarm with their parents, Valerie and Declan senior, who rushed to be with their son.Paramedics were quickly on to the scene, but on the way to Belfastrsquos Royal Victoria Hospital , the teenager needed a le-saving blood transfusion due to his major internal injuries.The ambulance was met in Greyabbey by a doctor and the emergency helicopter team where the procedure was carried out before Declan continued on to hospital by air.The Year  student from St Patrickrsquos Grammar School, Downpatrick, later underwent eight hours of surgery to save him.Two and a half weeks later, Declan was back at home recovering with his family and vowing to get back on to a tractor as soon as he is fit and able.Eoin, who also attends St Patrickrsquos Grammar School in Downpatrick, wants to give another person a chance of survival.He has started a Just Giving appeal to fund the provincersquos helicopter emergency medical serviceand raise at least the pound, it costs to run it per day. The family has now raised nearly pound,, including gt aid for the service as their thanks for saving Declan.Mrs Keating says her son has a ldquolong road to recovery with rehabilitation and further surgery down the line but they are ldquoforever indebted to the air ambulance and the entire hospital team who cared for Declan. She said surgeons told her that he was ldquoextremely lucky as the accident could have had fatal consequences.Reliving the morning of the accident when Declan mdash whose nickname is lsquoThe Milkmanrsquo mdash and Eoin had just left home to go their unclersquos farm for the milking at am, is still traumatic for Mrs Keating.She said: ldquoI donrsquot like to think about what happened to Declan. For what happened and how it happened, itrsquos nothing short of a miracle for him to be here. We were told thathis injuries had been one centimetre one way or the other, it could have been a lot worst. There were terrible injuries but at least there was no injury to his head or spine head.ldquoIt was just a freak accident and hopefully nothing like this will ever happen again. However, Declan has told me that he will be back in the tractor as soon as he can walk.Mrs Keating said Declan had passed his tractor driving test late last year and was used to driving their tractor to her brotherrsquos nearby dairy farm.ldquoThe boys had set off from home and were literally just yards down the road when the accident happened,ldquo she continued. ldquoWe are not sure how but Declan said that one minute he was driving and the next he was flung out the side door onto the road and the tractor ran over him.ldquoThe tractor continued moving and Eoin managed to get it stopped and immediately checked on Declan and called his daddy.ldquoDeclan was fully conscious and realised he was badly injured. He checkedhis legs and arms worked. He thought that his pelvis was broken and wanted to seehe was paralysed and somehow managed to get himself up and walk over to the other verge before his legs gave way. He was sitting up when me and his father arrived at the scene.Mrs Keating said that while both Declan and Eoin were naturally shocked by what had happened, she was proud of both her sonsrsquo presence of mind during the horric accident.ldquoEoin called us  seconds after the accident and we were there within minutes, she said. ldquoDeclan was alert the whole time when the ambulance and paramedics arrived.Mrs Keating and her husband followed behind the ambulance as Declan was rushed to the RVH. An emergency doctor met the ambulance in Kircubbin before continuing on. However, the parents feared the worst when the ambulance pulled over at the tennis courts in Greyabbey.ldquoThe doctor jumped out of the ambulance and told us not to worry, Declan was OK. He was going to give him a blood transfusion as he was losing blood internally and the air ambulance was on its way. Literally, it seemed the helicopter arrived just seconds later and Declan was transferred by air then to the hospital.Mrs Keating said that the blood transfusion was vital to Declan at that time, adding: ldquoFor remote communities where we live, the air ambulance is an essential service. They only have started carrying blood supplies earlier this year. If he hadnrsquot have gotten the blood, he may not have been here.Declanrsquos injuries were found to be signicant. He sustained a broken pelvis, perforated bladder and bowel, a collapsed lung, three broken ribs, internal bleeding and bruising.Mrs Keating said: ldquoThe accident and emergency doctor said he would have expected anyone  to be in a critical condition with the range of injuries but Declan was in a serious condition which showed us what a fighter he was and he wasnrsquot letting it get the better of him. We took some comfort from this at that time.She said that three teams of specialist surgeons operated on Declan for more than eight hours to deal with his major injuries.ldquoThe surgeons were extremely worried about Declan and I kept askinghe was going to be OK. The surgeon would only say that he was out of immediate danger and that the next - hours would be critical, she said.Declan spent three nights in intensive care before moving into another ward. Mrs Keating said that the care Declan received was ldquofirst-class and spoke of how caring the medics were to their plight.ldquoDeclanrsquos father and I wanted to be with him through the night. At one point the ward sister called us over and offered us the sleep room the surgeons use for rest during their sht. They gave up that room for us for three nights so we could be with Declan and we saw just how busy they all were. We thank them from the bottom of our hearts for their kindness.The family say they were overwhelmed by the support and well wishes they received from their local community and their donations to the appeal.Mrs Keating added: ldquoDeclan will recover and he canrsquot wait to be up again at am every morning to help on the farm as he just loves the farming le. The air ambulance was the legacy of Dr John Hinds [the late emergency medicine specialist] and it would be remiss of me not to remember him and what he did for others during his le and his campaign to get the service. We are forever indebted to him and the air ambulance service for saving Declanrsquos le.ldquoRegarding farm accidents in Northern Ireland, we know we are one of the more fortunate families and we are so thankful. I hope people continue to give money as itrsquos a vital service for the whole of Northern Ireland.To donate go to www.justgiving fundraising eoin-keating..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/27th May 2020 C Diary.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C May 27%2C 2000  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH ndash Residents at a Ballynahinch housing estate are due to hold talks with a range of key officials this morning in a bid to raise the profile of the area.People from the Hillcrest Drive area in the town are due to meet with senior officials from the Housing Executive, Down Council and the Department of Environment.The meeting comes in the wake of recent vandalism attacks in the Windmill Street area which damaged a number of cars, homes and business properties.Prior to this morningrsquos meeting, residents met with local councillor Anne McAleenan to discuss their concerns and prepare for the crucial talks with the representatives of the statutory agencies.Last weekend, the local councillor discussed with residents their concerns and advised them to draw up a strategy and work closely with the ious agencies who could provide them with key assistance.One of the main concerns is an area at the top of Hillcrest Drive which residents would like to see the Department of Environment cleaning up to enhance the image of the area.In addition, residents are calling for environmental improvements and also believe sealing off the rear of the estate from the lough area could prevent trouble at weekends.KILLYLEAGH ndash The impact a young Killyleagh footballer is having on the international soccer stage was praised at Monday nightrsquos meeting of Down Council.Killyleagh councillor Sam Osborne highlighted the achievements of  year-old David Healy who marked his Northern Ireland debut with a brace against Luxembourg and another strike against Malta.Mr Osborne said the young Manchester United star was a great ambassador for the area and last week received the international personality of the year award at the annual Northern Ireland soccer writers awards sponsored by Guinness.The local councillor said Healyrsquos success for Manchester United and the Northern Ireland team was a great boost for the area.ARDGLASS ndash An Ardglass couple are waging a war against hostile waters in an attempt to circumnavigate Ireland for charity.Rhonda and Vincent Kearney set sail in their -foot boat, Invinceable, on Saturday to make their way around Ireland in a bid to raise pound, to help buy a new leboat.And while the duo is no stranger to challenge, both sailors admit they face a fearsome feat.Vincent is a former Red Arrow and a stunt motorcyclist, while his we, Rhonda, is the former British clay pigeon shooting champion, but nothing, they say, could prepare them for the journey they are now making.ldquoWe only concocted the plan three months ago and thought we had better act quickly before we have time to think about what we are letting ourselves in for, said Vincent.ldquoI have been sailing on and off for about  years and have owned boats for quite some time, but it will still be extremely dficult, particularly with the dreadful weather forecasts we have been given.

Even so, there is a palpable sense of joy among the golfing fraternity.St Patrickrsquos Golf Club in Downpatrick resumed last Wednesday and the captain, Robert McCausland, said he ldquowas absolutely delighted.ldquoThe club is very pleased to be up and running again, he remarked.ldquoWe are very grateful to our green keepers who continued with their work during the lockdown and have delivered a golf course in magnicent condition for the members to enjoy.Mr McCausland said the club was now open to new members and that there were a ldquonumber of very attractive offers in place for those who may wish to take up the game of golf.He added: ldquoThe time sheets over the last few days are quite full and the car park has been busy with lots of smiling, happy faces about the club.Wednesday also saw the reopening of Ardglass Club and Paul Vaughan, the clubrsquos director of golf, said the course has been full up ever since.ldquoOur members have been playing in three-balls and going off every  minutes. We havenrsquot had a spare space since we re-opened, he said.ldquoEveryone is delighted to be back and itrsquos great to see so many people about. I think our members were glad to get out of the house and back on to the golf course.ldquoWe have a marshal at the front gate and the members are obeying the all the guidelines so that they can play casual golf.Mr Vaughan said the loss of visitors represented the loss of a major source of income for the club, but hoped this would be offset by new members.ldquoWe have had a lot of enquiries about new members, but visitorsrsquo green fees are a huge part of our business, he said.ldquoHopefully, we will be able to salvage something towards the end of the season and things willto something near normal next year.At Spa Golf Club, near Ballynahinch, which re-opened on Friday, the captain, Gordon Martin said everyone was ldquoexcited at the expectation of getting back playing in a sport we love so much.He went on: ldquoI am very aware of the sacrices many people have made in our communities that allows us to get to this point. May I on behalf of Spa Golf Club members and their families thank all the heros in out communities.ldquoSpa recognises the great responsibility golf has in being one of the first sports to re-open after the lockdown and fully intends to adhere to all the protocols agreed by our governing body.He said the club had been fortunate to be able to keep some greens staff working at the club over the lockdown period.ldquoThe driest April on record put extra burdens on green keeping staff in terms of additional watering and essential maintenance. But we are pleased to say the course is looking just magnicent.Mr Martin also said it has been a dficult period from a financial point of view with not many golf clubs being eligible for any signicant assistance under the ious Covid finance packages.Bright Castle Golf Club, which is privately owned by the Ennis family, has also been busy since it re-opened last Thursday.ldquoThe course is looking magnicent and the members are enjoying it, said Linda Ennis.ldquoItrsquos been a tough few months, but wersquove worked hard to keep the course maintained to a high standard and itrsquos really looking the part.ldquoThe members are glad to be out playing and itrsquos great to see so many happy faces.ldquoThe last time the course was closed this long was about six or seven years ago and that was because of heavy show. It was a bit disheartening having the place empty in April and earlier this month when the weather was lovely.She added: We rely on visitors and societies for a good portion of our income, but we have had enquiries about new memberships, which is good news for us.Crossgar Golf Club president Paddy Bell heaped praise on the clubrsquos green keeping staff for having the course in great shape and also revealed there has been a surge in new members.ldquoWe have had a big uptake in new members in the past few weeks, which will help compensate for the lack of green fees, he said.ldquoWe re-opened last Wednesday and itrsquos fantastic to see people playing again. It gives you hope that everything may soonto normality.ldquoThe course is in great condition and thatrsquos due to the green keeping staff who have worked hard during the lockdown. All praise is due them.Temple Golf Club has also been inundated with membership enquiries. Since it re-opened last week it has welcomed  new junior members.Owner Tim Martin said the pandemic lockdown couldnrsquot have come at a worse time with membership subions due on April .ldquoAs like every other club, our income disappeared overnight. We depend heavily on the income from the restaurant and bar and our cash flow dwindled rapidly, Mr Martin said.ldquoWe were only able to continue paying our staff each week because of some of the loyal members who paid their fees on time. To them we are very grateful. This kept us ticking over until the government job retention scheme kicked in.Mr Martin said the members had been very accommodating and were adhering to the guidelines and protocols.ldquoWe look forward to progressing into the next stage, but will have to make sure it will be financially viable to open the restaurant and bar when the time comes, he added..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/27th May 2020 Loughinisland.jpg","title":"Loughinisland man Gerry praises Move More initiative  ","story":"THERE are not many who have been to the top of the majestic Efel Tower in France.But Loughinisland man Gerry Morgan is one of the lucky few who have made it to the summit to snatch a birdrsquos eye view of the stunning Parisian landscape.That was  years ago when he opted for the easy option by popping into the lt and by-passing the , steps.

We also do sit-ups and squats.After the exercise regime it is time for a coffee and a chat, which all the Move More participants thoroughly enjoy.ldquoWe are literally one big family as many of us have been through cancer and fortunately come out the other side. In a way, illness has brought us together, continued Gerry.But everything changed in March when the arrival of the coronavirus forced Newry, Mourne and Down Council to close all its leisure centres and public buildings.To keep everyone involved, Laura mdash one of  Move More coordinators funded by Macmillan in every council area across the province to support those living with cancer mdash created an app to enable people to keep in touch remotely and exercise at home.She also recently unveiled a new initiative encouraging people living with cancer to virtually climb their way around some of the worldrsquos top landmarks to stay active during the coronavirus pandemic, without leaving the comfort of their own homes.Laura said that while Move More members were not able to physically travel the world at the moment, there was no limit to their imagination.Participants were given the choice of a number of buildings to scale, including Londonrsquos imposing Big Ben.Not surprisingly, Gerry opted to head back to the top of the Efel Tower, only this time he didnrsquot have to leave his front door during the virtual challenge. He set off at a leisurely pace and over three days and, with a little je nous said quoi, made it to the top.ldquoI could have completed the climb in two days, but decided to do it over three instead, he joked. ldquoI really enjoyed doing it, but miss being with my Move More friends.Gerry is pleased that while face-to-face classes and appointments are not possible, Laura has been working on positive, fun and interesting ways to keep programme participants motivated and active in the comfort of their own surroundings.He is also looking forward to getting back to the Down Leisure Centre when it is safe to do so and the pandemic is no more.Recalling the first time he went to the centre following his referral, Gerry admits that he was a little apprehensive.ldquoI distinctly remember driving to Downpatrick and was so nervous that I almost turned the car around to go back home, he said. ldquoBut I continued on and am so glad that I did. It has been an overwhelmingly positive experience for me, one that I thoroughly enjoy.ldquoI was a bit down for a few years after losing my lung and the chemotherapy, but getting involved with the Move More programme changed everything. It was just the fillip that I required.

It will mean people can enjoy an evening together while still maintaining social distancing in the comfort of their own car.As a start, Cllr Devlin is keen to see a drive-in cinema in Newcastle to mark the start of her year in office.She explained that this would allow the local authority to gauge its success and how it complements the legislation on social distancing.ldquoHopefully after this, we may be in a position to roll this venture out across the entire district over the course of the year and include all our towns, said Cllr Devlin.ldquoAlready, this idea has gained a lot of support from local people which I think is a testament to the need that currently exists within all of us to connect and eventually interact with our family and friends once more.Cllr Devlin added: ldquoThe test of how we unlock this will be in how we can continue to adhere to essential government guidelines on social distancing and ultimately defeating this disease..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/27th May 2020 Paul.jpg","title":"Newcastle man Paul running in aid of MYMY  ","story":"A NEWCASTLE man who has been running five kilometres every day since the beginning of the lockdown has raised over pound, for a local mental health charity.Paul Tumelty found himself with more time on his hands when the seaside coffee shop he worked in was forced to close its doors under government guidelines to curtail the spread of the coronavirus.The  year-old father of two, says he never thought of running until he saw a Facebook post from Mind Your Mate and Yourself , stating that the charity was struggling financially.It was forecasting ain income of pound, because of the cancellation or postponement of fundraising events.Paul, who has suffered from mental health issues, realised the importance of the charity after experiencing a number of family tragedies and decided he would help raise money to help them bridge the deficit.ldquoI always need to be doing something.

recommending that a proposal for a major new housing development comprising  new homes at an  acre site on the outskirts of Ballynahinch should proceed.Their recommendation to approve plans for a mixed development comprising a range of detached, semi detached and townhouses on the Lisburn Road will be discussed at next weekrsquos meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos Planning Committee.This particular committee has not met since March as a result of the coronavirus pandemic and to comply with social distancing requirements, the planning meeting will be held at Newry Leisure Centre next Wednesday.In papers submitted ahead of the meeting, the proposed development site mdash which comprises a number of fields mdash is described as ldquoirregular in shape, with the recently constructed Lime Trees, Edengrove and Kinedale developments in close proximity.Planners say that the site earmarked for the new homes is located on the ldquoinner edge of Ballynahinchrsquos development limits, with the area zoned for housing in the Down Area Plan.It is also confirmed in the planning papers that initially, plans were lodged to build  homes, but the figure was subsequently revised after planners expressed concern.The Department for Infrastructure is also content that the proposed housing scheme can be accommodated within the existing roads network.Northern Ireland Water said there is available capacity within the existing sewerage system to cope with the planned new homes, while planning permission has been granted for a new sewage pumping station on adjacent land.The papers indicate that the planning application was submitted in March  and that a number of objections to the proposed development were lodged.Other objections to the proposed housing scheme centre around traffic and access arrangements, claims that the application had not been properly advertised and insufficient neighbourhood notication.Objectors also pointed to the lack of a so-called planting buffer and the ldquolack of effort to integrate an open space area adjacent Ballynahinch River into the proposed development.Another objector highlighted the schemersquos ldquoinappropriate density, arguing that it is greater than other developments closer to the town.The detail of a noise impact assessment submitted to planners has also been questioned, but Newry Mourne and Down Council environmental health officials have expressed satisfaction with the document.The planning papers reveal that an acoustic mound has been incorporated in to the proposed development, with landscaped proposed throughout to mitigate any noise impact on adjacent land uses.In addition, the papers confirm that there is a Tree Preservation Order covering the site and while a number of trees have already been felled, this issue is the subject of an enforcement case.Planners say the proposed development is ldquoappropriate to the character and topography of the site and that ldquoadequate provision is made for public and private open space and landscaped areas as an integral part of the development.They also state that where appropriate, planted areas of discrete groups of trees will be required along site boundaries ldquoin order to soften the visual impact of the development and assist in its integration with the surrounding area, with adequate provision made for parking.Planners say that the development will not have an ldquounacceptable, adverse effect on existing or proposed properties in terms of overlooking, loss of light, overshadowing, noise or other disturbance.Next weekrsquos planning committee meeting takes place two days after the local authorityrsquos annual meeting when it is expected that Rowallane councillor, Robert Burgess, will be

than would normally be the case.ldquoIn normal circumstances we would have had a large crowd, since it is our flagship meeting of the year, he said.ldquoOnly industry officials, jockeys and trainers were allowed to attend, so we had around  people there in total.Commenting on theof racing, he said: ldquoIt is great to see the resumption of Irish racing in June. It will help boost the entire thoroughbred industry.ldquoWe very much understand that racing will be behind closed doors for the foreseeable future and will work diligently to comply with the very strict protocols put in place to ensure the safety of all those attending.The July date was announced by the Board of Horse Racing Ireland, which met recently and agreed a number of fixtures for theof race meetings.The first meeting is at Naas on June , with National Hunt racing resuming at Limerick on June .For the first three weeks, racing will be restricted to nine racecourses which are more centrally located to minimise travel distances and which also have higher stable capacities given the requirement for one stable per horse under the new protocols.All the fixtures will take place under the strict protocols published by Horse Racing Ireland.Brian Kavanagh, chief executive of Horse Racing Ireland, said: ldquoWe are grateful to everybody for the patience they have shown during this very dficult time and we will provide every opportunity for essential personnel to fully understand and implement theto racing protocols.ldquoWe expect there to be signicant demand for horses to run once we resume, and we will aim to provide opportunities across the spectrum of age, gender and ability.ldquoWe will have missed  weeksrsquo racing which will take some time to catch up.

However, signs will be in place advising people where it is not safe to swim.The politicians say that council staff will be on duty at beaches, country parks and harbours to ensure required social distancing measures are adhered to. In addition, the number of visitors at the ious facilities will also be monitored, with staff carrying out regular cleaning duties.Cllr Clarke confirmed that local authority staff will be present to engage with the public around guidelines on social distancing and facility information.He said: ldquoWhile these measures will no doubt be welcomed, I would encourage people to be responsible and show consideration for others by continuing to follow the public health guidelines on social distancing and hand hygiene.Cllr Walker said the past two months have been particularly dficult for people across the district.ldquoIt has not been easy and we all hope that people will act responsibly when the beaches, country parks and harbours are reopened. The onus is on them to obey the rules in place which are designed to keep them safe and help prevent the spread of the virus, he continued.Cllr Walker said there were plans to put one-way systems in place, where appropriate, but that all public toilets would remain closed.He added: ldquoI hope that over the coming weeks other facilities will reopen. The fact that we can open beaches and country parks is as a result of local peoplersquos commitment to stay at home to prevent the spread of coronavirus.ldquoWe are making progress and for that to continue it is essential that people continue to adhere to public health advice.

I help my clients achieve their goals by finding that balancebetween nutrition, diet, and exercise.ldquoSome clients, and a lot of men actually, have come to me with problems with anxiety and gut health. For everyone to look after their gut health is something Irsquom verypassionate about.ldquoLast week was Mental Health Awareness Week and I would like people to understand the connection thatwe are feeding our bodies processed food, it can directly impact on our brains and our mental health.Apart from working on her own health and studying to understand what diet and nutrition works for her mdash shersquos vegetarian and stays away from grains, apart from oats and barley mdash Stacey was heavily influenced by holistic approach to health during her late fatherrsquos illness.Mr John Murtagh died in  at the age of  after being diagnosed with oesophageal cancer.He was initially told that he has only six months to live and Stacey and her family believe that he helped extend his le through his devotion to nutrition, juicing, mediation and his deepreligious faith.ldquoOnce we heard the news, we researched everything we could to help him nutritionally and holistically, explained Stacey. ldquoWe believe  per cent his faith and his dedication to nutrition and meditation was definitely pertinent to his added time with us. His oncologists thought he was a miracle.ldquoI think it was through what we experienced with my father and my own journey that I knew I wanted to help others nutritionally and how to find their inner happiness and peace.In , she and her brother, Jonathon, climbed Mount Kilimanjaro in memory of her dad to raise nearly pound, for Marie Curie.Staceyrsquos own gut health problems were finally diagnosed while she was working in Dubai where she was able to avail of private health service through her job.ldquoI eventually found out that I have visceral hypersensitivity which is typical of IBS and means that the nerves endings in my intestines are exasperated by stress, she said.ldquoMy doctor was very interested in holistic therapies and when he found out that I was doing a lot of HITT [high intensity interval training] but still not losing weight, he recommended switching to lower intensity training such as yoga and Pilates. The dference it has made to my le, along with yoga and a balanced nutritional diet had been incredible.According to Stacey, an open mind and a willingness to test out certain foods to see what triggers your condition are essential for clients to get the right outcome.ldquoJust traditional medicine alone ndash and I would never encourage anyone not to go with traditional medicine ndash is not always the answer. Itrsquos a partnership approach with traditional side and holistic. But most importantly its listening to your own body and what feels right, said Stacey.ldquoClients need to bring a huge trust in the coaching and we really need to work between three to six months and delve quite deep into the personrsquos le to see how we can work together.ldquoIrsquom a big advocate for staying away from fad diets mdash they never worked for me. I believe you have to work to be happy and content within yourself and this is helped by making the right lestyle choices for yourself. Itrsquos about finding balance and what works for you as an inidual and settling into that lestyle.After having a fixed-term contract as a marketing manager before the lockdown, Stacey is no longer working and thinks that this might be the time to push through with yoga and heath coaching full-time.While offering free online yoga classes , Stacey is also offering a complimentary -minute health coaching interview.For further information visit www. staceymurtagh..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/20th May 2020 Supporters Club.jpg","title":"Supporters’ club members select their favourite Man Utd team  ","story":"LOCAL Manchester United fans have picked their favourite Reds team of the Premier League era.Members of the Downpatrick Manchester United Supportersrsquo Club were asked to pick their favourite players since the start of the Premier League in .They were tasked with selecting a best eleven along with five subs.

But,all  fails, you will understand that for the safety of our community members that we will be left with no option other than to close the grounds completely. Please spread this message to users of our grounds.Rowallane councillor Terry Andrews said he hoped people would respect the wishes of the Passionist Community and listen to the appeal which has been issued.He said Tobar Mhuirersquos trails were extremely popular with local people and the retreat facility was well used by walkers, especially at this time of the year.Cllr Andrews said while people are allowed to exercise daily, they can continue to walk in Tobar Mhuirethey obey the advice that they have been given and stay away from a number of designated areas.ldquoThe advice in relation to social distancing remains in place and people need to adhere to public health advice to prevent the spread of the coronavirus which has had a devastating impact across the globe, he continued.ldquoThe advice is to stay away from certain areas and this should be relatively straight forward given the size of the complex. The Passionist Community provides free access to the trails for the benefit of the local community and this is greatly appreciated by the people of Crossgar in particular.Cllr Andrews described Tobar Mhuire as a ldquohaven of peace and tranquillity and appealed to people to stay away from the areas highlighted.He continued: ldquoNo one would want to see public access to the grounds prohibited and the Passionist Community has made this clear.ldquoIt is important that visitors recognise that Tobar Mhuire is home to elderly and vulnerable people, some of whom are self-isolating, and must not do anything that would potentially put their safety at risk. People can continue to use these beautul grounds, but they must recognise the needs of the people who reside there.Cllr Andrews said people in Crossgar were delighted that members of the Passionist Community lived among them and hoped that by everyone following public health advice, it would not be long before some ldquosemblance of normality is restored for everyone..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/27th May 2020 UUP.jpg","title":"UUP’s McKee takes vice chairman role  ","story":"ULSTER Unionist councillor Harold McKee has been selected as the new vice-chairman of Newry, Mourne and Down Council.The race for the deputyrsquos position was between the Mournes councillor mdash a former South Down MLA ndash and Rowallane councillor Robert Burgess.Cllr McKeersquos appointment comes weeks after the SDLP confirmed that another Mournes councillor, Laura Devlin, would be the districtrsquos new first citizen, succeeding Sinn Feinrsquos Charlie Casey.Cllr McKee said that it was an ldquoimmense privilege to have been selected as the local authorityrsquos vice-chairman and is looking forward to his new role.First elected to the former Newry and Mourne Council in , Cllr McKee said he has a proven track record of delivery for the benefit of the local community.ldquoI believe in hard work, honesty and accountability in working with local people to raise and solve issues that they care about in their daily lives, said the incoming vice-chairman.ldquoI know that the community is living through unprecedented times and many people are under huge pressure. I will certainly strive to do all that I can in my new role to work for everyone across Newry, Mourne and Down in what is likely to be an ongoing period of uncertainty.Cllr McKee also extended his congratulations to Cllr Devlin on her nomination as the councilrsquos new chairwoman and said he is very much look forward to working with her.The leader of the councilrsquos UUP members, David Taylor, described Mr McKee as an ldquoextremely dedicated public representative and a man of great integrity.He added: ldquoHarold is very deserving of the honour of representing the district as deputy chairman and will put his heart and soul into the role.The formal appointment of the new chairwoman and her deputy will be confirmed at next Monday nightrsquos annual meeting of the local authority which had been tipped to take place at Newryrsquos Canal Court Hotel.However, issues in relation to the acoustics in thehall where the meeting was due to take place forced council chiefs into an eleventh hour rethink.The meeting will now take place at Newry Leisure Centre but not all of the districtrsquos  councillors will be in attendance.Only the leaders of the main parties and Independent councillors will be in attendance, alongside a number of council officers, with strict social distancing measures in place.Traditionally, the annual meeting was held in the debating chamber at the local authorityrsquos administrative headquarters at the Downshire Civic Centre in Downpatrick.Ahead of the annual meeting, a mock AGM was held yesterday at Newry Leisure Centre to provide councillors with a run-through of proceedings.

This is not a time to say ‘everything’s OK, we’re releasing measures, everything’s going to be rosy’.“It’s a time to go very cautiously with changes as they take place, monitored very carefully, being prepared that there will be local outbreaks because there will be and being prepared that therefore recommendations would come to reimpose measures.”Professor Vallance stressed that “the number of cases remains high it’s not a low number – sothe R remains at , those numbers stay at that high level, whereas what we’ve got to do is get them down”. He added: “We’re at a fragile state.”When Boris Johnson was asked whether he could bring himself to utter any words of criticism for how his chief spad Dominic Cummings had acted – given that lives are at stakethe public health advice becomes bastardised by his spad’s actions – the prime minister declined to say anything critical.He said: “The crucial message that I want to get to you is that the British people have made heroic sacrices ... and no, I don’t think that people will respond dferently [because of Mr Cummings’ actions] I think that people will listen very carefully to what the messages are.”—— ——A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

However, for some reason that warning was not included in the inquiry’s letter to the two men.For instance, in the written questions sent to former DUP minister Jonathan Bell he was told: “It is vital that the witness statement you provide to the inquiry is your own evidence, absent the influence of others ...”He was also told – as were many other witnesses – that “you may share the correspondence and the enclosed notice with your legal representative, but neither you nor they may show, communicate the contents of, nor provide this correspondence or the notice to any other person or organisation without the express permission of the RHI Inquiry. Any breach of this duty of confidentiality is actionable at the suit of the inquiry chairman”.Mr Bell, again in common with many witnesses, did not receive an offer to meet the solicitor to the inquiry, Patrick Butler.However, in his letters to Mr Howell and Mr Lynch, Mr Butler said: “If it would assist you, I am happy to meet with youto discuss the requirements of the Section  Notice and what evidence you may be able to provide which is within the scope of the Section  Notice.”By contrast to the identical evidence provided by Mr Howell and Mr Lynch, when Sinn Fein ‘super spad’ Aidan McAteer was asked some of the same questions, his answers were worded dferently – as were those of the spad to then finance minister Máirtín Ó Muilleoir, Eoin Rooney.The questions to all of the Sinn Fein figures had been around an Ofgem employee, Edd Fyffe, who had contacted Sinn Fein in January  and presented himself as a whistleblower, setting out a series of allegations against Ofgem, which runs RHI for Stormont.Each of the republicans said that they had handled his allegations appropriately and neither they nor Mr Fyffe were called to give oral evidence to the inquiry.The News Letter asked whether Mr Howell or Mr Lynch discussed with each other how they would respond to the inquiry and,not,how they could explain the remarkable similarity between their answers.At the time of going to press, there had been no response, despite repeated requests for comment.Mr Howell and Mr Lynch, along with veteran IRA man Padraic Wilson, had been the triumvirate of senior republicans to whom Mr Ó Muilleoir passed a series of complex policy decisions around RHI – even though none of them are energy experts, lawyers or serve as spads who are bound by civil service codes.Amid alarm from senior civil servants, Mr Ó Muilleoir had asked Mr Howell: “Would you be contentI were to sign off on the business plan on Wednesday afternoon ”The former finance minister insisted that he had been merely consulting the influential republican close to Gerry Adams and not seeking his consent to the plan for retrospective cost controls.However, the RHI Inquiry ruled that was not what had happened and Mr Ó Muilleoir had indeed asked for the publicly unaccountable republican’s consent for the massive decision.—— ——A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

in one of his articles that such a progressive town as Penarth was without an operatic and dramatic society, writes Penarth Operatic  Dramatic Societypresident, Mary Gardner.The response to his outcry was quickly taken up and within three weeks the Penarth Operatic Society was formed.The Societyrsquos first production was Gilbert  Sullivanrsquos Iolanthe, played at The Hippodrome which later burnt down, and what a glittering opening evening it must have been as the audience wore evening dress.The review featured next day read, ldquoBrilliant Initial Performance.More newsVale council issues warning over the use of parksFines increased for coronavirus lockdown breachesMarie Curie Great Blooming Tea Party goes virtualA few years later in , the drama section came into being and with it a new title of the Penarth Operatic  Dramatic Society, known affectionately as PODS.Since then PODS has progressed down through the decades with many highlights along the way.One being in  when PODS presented that great musical, The King And I, which won the premier prize at the Waterford International Festival, for which the company received a beautul Waterford crystal vase.The Town Council held a reception to honour the Society at the Paget Rooms, and James Callaghan, the local MP, paid his tribute to PODS saying it ldquoadded lustre and brought culture to Penarth.Another landmark was the play, Dear Octopus, by Dodie Smith produced for PODS th anniversary celebrations.One of our most challenging and exciting shows was Cabaret in , which won the National Operatic  Dramatic Associationrsquos award for Best Production and Best Stage Management and Technical presentation.More recently in , to honour and pay tribute to the many men who gave their lives in World War One, PODS presented the very special play, Last Man Standing, which also won a NODA award for Best Drama.In , PODS decided to do pantomime, and this has been a greatly gratying and popular addition to the companyrsquos output.Itrsquos wonderful to see children in the cast having on-stage experience, and then those children in the audience, perhaps for the first time, enjoying and loving live theatre.PODS is a very busy Society putting on four shows a year, a musical, two plays and a pantomime.Mrs Gardner said: ldquoThis year, sadly and very upsettingly after much hard work by all involved, the covid- virus struck as PODS had just set-up at the Paget Rooms ready for its run of Goodnight Mister Tom, only to be told the venue would be shut down next day.ldquoSince January, the Society had also been rehearsing for its May musical, The Full Monty, and that too has had to be cancelled.       ,params: .pushldquoNevertheless, when this terrible emergency is over the company will put on these two productions sometime in the future. ldquoPODS is proud of its achievement in giving much pleasure and entertainment to the local community with its first-class shows over the last  years, and its goal is to make its centenary in  with the help of its faithful audiences, friends and patrons.PODS is always ready to welcome new members, but at the moment it cannot meet or rehearse due to the covid- restrictions.It might be some time before restrictions are lted on groups being able to rehearse together, or audiences allowed back in theatres, meanwhile PODS members keep in touch on social media.There is a lsquoPODS public grouprsquo on Facebook, PODS quiz nights are being held on Zoom, and there is a website to keep track at podspenarth.org article_url   content_id   site_id

Co Armagh Orangemen go above and beyond call of dutyOrangemen in Co Armagh have raised more than £, to help those fighting against coronavirus and those worst affected by lockdown.By Graeme CousinsThursday, th May , : pm\"\"Bessbrook District made a special delivery of a food pack to Bro Thomas Alderdice in Kilkeel : Other rd PartyDistrict and private lodges have provided food hampers for its own members and other vulnerable people in the community, donated to frontline NHS staff, raised cash for charity and boosted PPE provision in the area.Right Worshipful Brother Denis Watson, county grand master, said: “The money we’ve raised has gone towards assisting all communities and, as the largest community-based organisation within Co Armagh, it shows that the institution is so much more than just a parading body and has had a very positive impact in all areas of the county.“Almost as soon as the impact of the coronavirus pandemic became known and lockdown was implemented, the  district lodges and many private lodges in Co Armagh made spontaneous and impressive efforts to assist in their local communities.Rt Wor Bro Denis Watson, County Grand Master, and Wor Bro Jeffrey Lawson, Deputy County Grand Secretary, presenting the cheque for £, to Jane McKimm, Head of Communications, and Helen ONeill, Director of Finance.at the Southern Health and Social Care Trust, for specic use at Craigavon Area Hospital : Other rd Party“The tremendous response from the County Grand Lodge was immediate and the monies came from existing funds, with no member asked to contribute, unless to do so in a voluntary capacity.”Support included preparing food hampers for elderly and vulnerable brethren, and others in the community, making donations of food and goodies to frontline hospital staff, making monetary donations to charities, and providing PPE to nursing homes and community nursing services.A substantial donation of £, was made to the Southern Health and Social Care Trust, specically for Craigavon Area Hospital.Mr Watson said: “One of the first things put in place by the County Grand Lodge was the issue of a daily prayer from our County Grand Chaplain, Wor Bro Rev Dr Alan McCann, to members by email and posting on the Museum of Orange Heritage at Sloan’s House, Loughgall Facebook page.County Grand Lodge Officers made a donation of £, to the Southern Area Hospice as they are currently unable to fundraise, and this was presented to Anne Dalzell, hospice representative, at Sloan’s House : Other rd Party“The response has been very favourable in these trying times, with the daily reach on Facebook being between  and over ,.”He added: “The museum at Sloan’s House was very proud to display the Grand Lodge banner of support for the NHS and other frontline services on the front of the building and encouraged young people to send in rainbow pictures for display on the front windows of the premises. “The County Grand Lodge central committee has been able to liaise by having regular Zoom conference meetings and this has proved very beneficial in maintaining contact and co-ordination.” Reflecting on the work he said: “It’s a very commendable effort by the Orange brethren of Co Armagh and of course this is being replicated in other counties within the jurisdiction of the Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland.”\"\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\"

some of its events virtually.By The NewsroomThursday, th May , : pm\"\"The proposal to look at the feasibility of hosting certain events remotely was raised at Tuesday evening’s virtual meeting as members discussed a report recommending all Council led events are cancelled until the end of August.Council’s Head of Tourism, Artsand Culture, Brian Johnston, advised members there will be a further report in June that will give consideration to events held until the end of December .The report, circulated to members before the meeting, states that at present, events involving gatherings of people are not permitted and it is anticipated that when they are, other controls such as social distancing will be required.Some of the events recommended for cancellation include Buskfest in Banbridge Town Centre on June , Armed Forces Day in Banbridge Town Centre and Rugby Club on June  and the Seven Hills Blues Festival in Armagh which runs from August -.Other events for later in the year, including the Georgian Festival in Armagh and Halloween events across the borough and Christmas and twilight markets are all marked for further consideration.When asked by Banbridge Sinn Fein councillor, Kevin Savage why an estimate of council savings was not includedin the report Mr Johnston said Council would have spent £, on the events it now proposes to cancel.However, he did advise that not all of that will be saved by Council as some contractual obligations will need to be met.SDLP group leader, Councillor Thomas O’Hanlon raisedthe possibility of holding some of these events virtually.“We are encouraging businesses to do things online,” said the Armagh representative.“If we could look at some of these events happening between now and Christmas and seethere is an opportunity to do similar with them, could we have that explored and brought back in due course ”Lurgan councillor Liam Mackle said: “I would be very happy with some virtual events taking place in the months ahead.”The Sinn Fein representative then proposed that Council officers explore this idea and report back in due course with the proposal seconded by Councillor O’Hanlon.A message from the
