It rained the entire day long. It was cold, it was miserable, it was wet.\u0027The young Prince had to dress up in a kilt, black jacket and white lace jabot for the Royal Family procession into Westminster Abbey.          Pictured: Michael Crawford at 11Actor Michael Crawford was an 11-year-old schoolboy when he watched the occasion with his family in The Mall. He tells the programme: ‘This brought our country together – it’s very stirring, moving and brings out great pride.’Looking at his scrapbook from the time about the Coronation he admits: ‘It was a passion. Everything I could find in the newspapers I cut out.’Crawford, above, who went on to find fame on television and stage, says: ‘You see thousands of soldiers and it’s the pageantry, the uniforms, the regalia… There was this extraordinary spectacle.’                                                    Watching film commissioned by the Queen to record the atmosphere inside Buckingham Palace on the day, he says: \u0027Imagine the build-up and the excitement. A great deal of hustle and bustle and fiddling around making sure things were put on the right way round. I remember how glamorous the Queen looked, this radiant figure.\u0027In one sequence, a line of carriages in the Palace courtyard prepare to transport members of the Royal Family and VIPs including Winston Churchill to the Abbey.The Prince recalls the journey in a carriage with his mother, Princess Marina, his sister, Princess Alexandra, and brother, the Duke of Kent. \u0027There was an enormous crowd and they had periscopes, a lot of them, which were strange-looking devices where you looked through a viewer, and it then went up and you could look over the heads of the people in front of you… \u0027So you had a forest of these strange-looking things which were sticking out from the crowd.\u0027The sight of the Queen\u0027s four-ton Gold State Coach with eight grey horses also transfixed him.\u0027I don\u0027t think there are very often occasions where eight greys pull a coach. You have to have as many as that because the Coronation coach weighs so much.\u0027The Prince, 75, adds: \u0027It was a wonderful occasion and it\u0027s amazing to think we are here all these years later.\u0027The Queen\u0027s Coronation In Colour is on ITV tomorrow at 9pm.

Jeppesen said he found North Korean people to be friendly, pictured above with two friends in 2016          In his book he reveals how he lived in a lavish but empty hotel, was escorted by two mandatory guides in public at all times, and was woken up every morning to a 5am ode to Kim II-sung          He adds that the hardest part of the trip was the psychological toll of being constantly watched and monitored as he studied in the nation\u0027s capitol, railway station in Pyongyang above          He describes everyday life where men and women wear colorful clothing, head to the zoo for fun, and are under the constant watchful eye of their official housing unit spy, view of Pyongyang aboveBut that doesn\u0027t mean there aren\u0027t loopholes. Relaxed inminbanjangs would turn a blind eye to certain rules such as one woman Jeppesen met who was \u0027known to rent out her second room as an hourly love hotel for extra income.\u0027Contrary to the mental picture of uniformed citizens and regimented society many might have of North Korea, Jeppesen says times are changing and fashion has become more relaxed. Men were seen wearing short-sleeve shirts of all colors and designs as well as flashy Rolexes on their wrists, though they\u0027re often fake ones.Women wore skirts and occasionally jeans were permitted for certain positions.A hot trend for the ladies was high heels sported with socks.   One of the more bizarre sights for the student was seeing North Korean citizens visit the zoo which boasts more than 6,000 animals and 650 species and mostly displayed dogs and cats.\u0027Having pets was never really part of the culture. North Korea has always been a very poor country, and they’ve always had difficulty feeding their citizens. Keeping an animal you have to feed when you yourself aren\u0027t getting enough rice to get you through the day is an outrageous luxury to them,\u0027 Jeppesen said. It was at the zoo he was stunned to find an elderly woman selling ice cream and candy be violently taken away by two police officers. \u0027I subtly tried to watch where they were taking her, but I lost sight of them...I don’t think it ended well for her,\u0027 he wrote in his book.  As for home entertainment, Jeppensen said the evening news was a monotone review of Kim Jonh-un’s daily schedule recited as \u0027cheery symphonic music\u0027 played in the background.While watching TV at a government official’s home, Jeppesen said the officer turned off the news and instead played a \u0027pirated copy of Zootopia he bought at a DVD stall.\u0027    The sun sets in Pyongyang pictured last April where Jeppesen was shocked to see housing unit spies and locals gawk at pet animals at the zoo          Locals are pictured walking around the North Korean capital in a photo from April 2017For the student, the hardest part of the experience being constantly watched as he assumed his hotel room, computer and phone were all bugged.\u0027Psychologically, it was very difficult and stressful. It had all these weird side effects. There were moments when I finally was alone and nobody was watching me, yet it felt creepy because I was so used to being watched,\u0027 he said. \u0027Also, even when you’re not being monitored, people are staring because I’m a white guy and they’re not used to seeing foreigners in North Korea,\u0027 he added.He said he felt \u0027psychological stress of not being able to communicate with my parents and my partner back home.\u0027Despite the hardship of being away from family and friends, he opted against buying a SIM card that gives internet access to his mobile phone to avoid having his e-mail spied upon.At the end of his term Jeppesen was awarded a certificate for successfully completing the beginners level Korean language for foreigners course.He returned for an additional two weeks of class last spring. Despite his desire to return yet again, he was not allowed to do so following a US travel ban on the country following the imprisonment and death of American student Otto Warmbier, who was jailed in North Korea after stealing a banner from a hotel in 2016."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/03/14/4CDFB80B00000578-0-image-m-22_1528031748597.jpg","title":"Tory donor calls Theresa replaced Michael Gove","story":"    Hedge fund boss Crispin Odey said the PM could not make decisions and would not see Brexit throughTheresa May faces fresh Tory infighting today after a party donor demanded she quit because she is failing to \u0027carry Brexit through\u0027. Hedge fund boss Crispin Odey said Mrs May should be replaced by Michael Gove to see the country through negotiations with the EU. Meanwhile, former Cabinet minister Priti Patel accused the PM of \u0027negativity\u0027 as she raised doubts about her approach.The pressure on Mrs May escalated as talks with Brussels reach a critical  stage - with a standoff over the Irish border threatening to throw the process into turmoil.  Mr Odey told the Observer the Prime Minister could not make decisions and would not see Brexit through. He said Mr Gove - one of the architects of the Leave campaign - should take over at the head of a much bolder administration that was prepared to break EU rules before Brexit.Mr Odey, who previously donated to Ukip before switching allegiance, said: \u0027Michael has got lots of attributes that make him a non-traditional Tory. \u0027He is very aware that he has to appeal not just to the wealthy, but also more broadly.\u0027I don\u0027t think May can carry Brexit through any more.\u0027 Praying for a Brexit miracle?

For example, a Rouge Breakfast at Café Rouge is £9.50 at Center Parcs in the UK, which is 60 per cent more than the £5.95 charge at a standard city outlet of the chain.          The price difference is so great that it could be cheaper for a British family to visit a Center Parcs on the Continent rather than in the UK (Pictured: a family on a raft ride at the resort in Sherwood Forest, Nottingham)At Las Iguanas a children’s meal is £7.95, which is 35 per cent more than the £5.90 the chain charges at a city centre outlet. There are also mark-ups on pizza, pasta, drinks and children’s meals at Bella Italia and Strada.It has long been known that Center Parcs hits parents in the pocket by putting up prices at its five UK holiday centres as soon as the schools break for the summer at the end of July.          What is less well known is that the prices to stay at the UK parks, with their woodland lodges, lakes, pools, and sports facilities, are so much higher than the prices in Europe.The UK and European parks are separate businesses, but the accommodation, facilities and services are similar. UK parks offer three levels of accommodation: woodland lodges, executive lodges and exclusive lodges.The standard lodges have a family bathroom, kitchen, TV, wood burner and patio. The top of range options add en-suite bathrooms, housekeeping services, a sauna, a hot tub and, generally, a games room with a pool table. A family of four staying for seven nights at a woodland lodge in Woburn Forest, Bedfordshire, at the start of August would have to fork out £1,958.That is more than double the price of £909 for similar accommodation at the German Center Parc at Hochsauerland, in Medebach.It is also some £930 more than a premium cottage at the De Vossemeren park, in Lommel, Belgium, which is around £1,027.The holiday company was set up by a Dutch entrepreneur and later bought by the British brewing and hospitality chain Scottish \u0026amp Newcastle. It sold the European part of the business to a French holiday company and German investment group in 2003.          The British business was subsequently bought by the American private equity firm Blackstone.Consumer advocate Helen Dewdney, who runs The Complaining Cow website, said: ‘It is really shocking that British families can be charged hundreds of pounds more than those in Europe for what is effectively an identikit holiday, but this is typical of rip-off Britain.’ Rory Boland, the editor of Which? Travel, was particular critical of the higher food prices. ‘Families have already paid a lot of money for their Center Parcs stay and will be rightly upset to find they are being charged inflated prices for the food at chain restaurants on site,’ he said.A Center Parcs spokesman said: ‘Center Parcs UK is a separate company to Center Parcs Europe we operate in very different market conditions.‘We heavily reinvest in our accommodation, activities and restaurants each year and our pricing is based purely on demand for the short break experience we offer in the UK, which does differ from Center Parcs Europe significantly.’Café Rouge, Bella Italia and Las Iguanas are all part of a company called the Casual Dining Group.A spokesman said: ‘As is common practice across many retail businesses, such as car dealerships, supermarkets and restaurants across the UK, we operate a range of different price brackets across our brands, dependent on where a site is located.’Strada did not respond to a request for comment."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/26/15/4CA5D84100000578-0-image-m-17_1527345300131.jpg","title":"Churchgoers urged report suspicious behaviour local car wash expose slave labour","story":"    Churchgoers will be urged to report any suspicious behaviour or evidence of workers being abused when they take their car to be cleanedChurch members are also asked to give information on whether the car wash boss ‘appears over-controlling or intimidating’ and whether ‘the body language of workers appears fearful or withdrawn’.The campaign, developed by the Church of England, yesterday won backing from the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Reverend Justin Welby, and from the leader of Roman Catholics in England and Wales, Cardinal Vincent Nichols.Francis becomes the first Pope to denounce a \u0027culture of...Church of England tells parishes not to publish prayer...Share this article     It comes as part of a Church of England scheme to help victims of slave labour (file image)For this reason people using car washes are asked by the churches to check whether they can pay through electronic banking systems as well as by cash, and whether or not the car wash offers its customers receipts.The Church of England Bishop of Derby, the Right Reverend Alastair Redfern, said: ‘It is shocking that an act as simple as having one’s car washed can help perpetuate the human misery involved with modern slavery.‘This practice, and our indifference to it, needs to be challenged and reversed.’Bishop Redfern said the campaign ‘is looking to mobilise the Church’s grass roots presence in an unprecedented intelligence gathering exercise to better understand this problem’.He added that information provided by people using the Safe Car Wash App ‘will help the police and other agencies calibrate their responses accordingly’.The Clewer Initiative said: ‘The more people that use the mobile app the better quality intelligence we will be able to provide to the police and the greater the chance that perpetrators will be prosecuted and victims rescued.’ "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/03/22/4CE245F300000578-5801525-image-a-87_1528062475739.jpg","title":"Mary Berry slashes 150 000 price six bed mansion","story":"    Mary Berry, 82, and her husband decided to move from their home in Buckinghamshire to greener pastures in Henley          The eighteenth-century Queen Anne-style farmhouse boasts a number of attractive featuresThousands of bottles of Mary Berry’s £3 salad dressing are...Better than the Bake Off tent!

North Korea\u0027s leadership is believed to regard nuclear weapons as crucial to its survival, while Kim has said he plans to focus on economic development.The U.S. official did not identify the three ousted military officials.The White House, State Department, CIA and Office of the Director of National Intelligence did not respond immediately to requests for official comment.South Korea\u0027s unification and defence ministries declined to confirm the report, while an official at the Unification Ministry said the government was watching the North\u0027s leadership very closely.          Kim Jong Un (pictured) is preparing for a high-stakes summit with Trump in Singapore on June 12, the first such meeting between a North Korean leader and a sitting U.S. presidentSouth Korean foreign minister Kang Kyung-hwa had a 15-minute phone call with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Monday to discuss the upcoming summit between Kim and Trump, the foreign ministry in Seoul said.Given the military\u0027s secondary role in the North\u0027s nuclear and missile programmes, the moves are likely more about installing a younger, even more trusted cohort of officials who Kim Jong Un can rely on as he confronts a variety of domestic and international issues, said Michael Madden, a North Korea expert at Johns Hopkins University´s 38 North website.\u0027The nuclear weapons are a side issue,\u0027 he said.The moves are likely linked in part to Kim Jong Un\u0027s drive to have the military take a bigger role in critical infrastructure projects. That could explain why newly appointed director of the KPA\u0027s General Political Bureau, Army General Kim Su Gil, accompanied Kim Jong Un on a field guidance trip to a beach tourist zone with other officials, Madden said.  Trump wants North Korea to \u0027denuclearise\u0027, or get rid of its nuclear arsenal, in return for relief from economic sanctions. North Korea\u0027s leadership is believed to regard nuclear weapons as crucial to its survival, while Kim has said he plans to focus on economic developmentKim Jong Un is also likely expecting to receive more international economic aid and investment soon as part of the ongoing talks and he wants to prevent corruption that plagued some past projects, Madden said.All of the newly promoted officials are younger than their predecessors, including 63-year-old Ri Yong Gil, who is 21 years younger than Ri Myong Su.\u0027This points to two things: the consolidation of Kim Jong Un\u0027s power as the sole leader of North Korea and strengthened cooperation between the North\u0027s party and military as the country works towards further economic development,\u0027 said Yang Moo-jin, professor at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul.\u0027They\u0027re all young but capable people,\u0027 Yang said.Lower-level U.S.-North Korean talks to prepare for the summit are continuing but have made only \u0027halting progress\u0027, according to a second U.S. official briefed on the discussions.That official said U.S. negotiators\u0027 efforts to press for definitions of immediate, comprehensive, verifiable and irreversible denuclearisation by North Korea had run into opposition from the White House.In a remarkable shift in tone eight days after cancelling the summit, citing Pyongyang\u0027s \u0027open hostility\u0027, Trump welcomed North Korea\u0027s former intelligence chief, Kim Yong Chol, to the White House on Friday, exchanging smiles and handshakes.Yonhap reported that Kim Yong Chol had transited Beijing on Monday on his way back to Pyongyang from the United States.All three of the new military officials have at least some experience interacting with foreign delegations, a factor that is critical as Kim seeks to line up meetings with leaders from the United States, China, Russia, and Syria.\u0027They are shaping these guys up because there is going to be a lot of foreign interaction,\u0027 Madden said. \u0027They know to sit there and not get too drunk at the parties ... they know how to behave themselves.\u0027"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/03/18/4CDC34C400000578-0-image-a-71_1528048511559.jpg","title":"Say cheers gastropub Cambridge professor says boost society","story":"    Cambridge University professor and sociologist Christel LaneSome say they are harbingers of gentrification – killing off traditional pub culture with their organic steaks and homemade panna cottas.But gastropubs are unfairly maligned and those who lament the demise of the old-school boozer are simply hankering after a ‘past society’ says Cambridge University professor and sociologist Christel Lane. She has examined the rise of gourmet pubs in her book From Taverns To Gastropubs, which argues that their emergence in the 1990s was a natural consequence of social changes. ‘Much of the criticism of gastropubs seems to have less to do with what they actually offer, and more with the fact that people miss a past society which is no longer there,’ she said. Sssssss-ozzled!

It comes as it was revealed last week in a report that top executives had been using ‘pitiful and patronising’ excuses to keep women out of boardrooms.FTSE company chiefs claimed women ‘don’t want the hassle’ of top jobs and could not deal with ‘complex issues’.

The top of range options add en-suite bathrooms, housekeeping services, a sauna, a hot tub and, generally, a games room with a pool table. A family of four staying for seven nights at a woodland lodge in Woburn Forest, Bedfordshire, at the start of August would have to fork out £1,958.That is more than double the price of £909 for similar accommodation at the German Center Parc at Hochsauerland, in Medebach.It is also some £930 more than a premium cottage at the De Vossemeren park, in Lommel, Belgium, which is around £1,027.The holiday company was set up by a Dutch entrepreneur and later bought by the British brewing and hospitality chain Scottish \u0026amp Newcastle. It sold the European part of the business to a French holiday company and German investment group in 2003.          The British business was subsequently bought by the American private equity firm Blackstone.Consumer advocate Helen Dewdney, who runs The Complaining Cow website, said: ‘It is really shocking that British families can be charged hundreds of pounds more than those in Europe for what is effectively an identikit holiday, but this is typical of rip-off Britain.’ Rory Boland, the editor of Which? Travel, was particular critical of the higher food prices. ‘Families have already paid a lot of money for their Center Parcs stay and will be rightly upset to find they are being charged inflated prices for the food at chain restaurants on site,’ he said.A Center Parcs spokesman said: ‘Center Parcs UK is a separate company to Center Parcs Europe we operate in very different market conditions.‘We heavily reinvest in our accommodation, activities and restaurants each year and our pricing is based purely on demand for the short break experience we offer in the UK, which does differ from Center Parcs Europe significantly.’Café Rouge, Bella Italia and Las Iguanas are all part of a company called the Casual Dining Group.A spokesman said: ‘As is common practice across many retail businesses, such as car dealerships, supermarkets and restaurants across the UK, we operate a range of different price brackets across our brands, dependent on where a site is located.’Strada did not respond to a request for comment."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/03/10/4CDECA9700000578-0-image-a-6_1528018447154.jpg","title":"Pubs Britain remove Saudi Arabia flags World Cup bunting","story":"    The Air Balloon pub in Filton, Bristol.

It is being launched with passenger watchdog Transport Focus, and responses will lead to recommendations for the government to consider in the autumn. The group said it was cancelling its annual conference due to start on Monday because of the ongoing delays and cancellations to services but the consultation would go ahead.Last month, rail companies announced that they were seeking “root and branch” reform of fare regulations that date back to the mid-1990s and had failed to reflect the march of technology and changing working patterns. With 55m different fares in the current system, the industry wants to persuade ministers to simplify ticketing and make it easier to use, ending anomalies such as split-ticketing, whereby it is cheaper to buy several tickets for a journey than a single one. Following recent disruption on some parts of the network due to botched timetable changes, passengers will be asked whether fares should be based on quality of service. They could opt to travel more cheaply on routes with slower, less regular and more basic trains, with better services becoming more expensive.Abolishing railcards could also be considered, along with rewarding regular travellers for their loyalty. Passengers will be asked whether they prefer certainty over the price of journeys, even if it means early-bird or last-minute deals are restricted.The industry has pledged that average fares will not rise as a result of any reform. Paul Plummer, chief executive of the Rail Delivery Group, said the industry’s priority was to create an easier-to-use fares system.“Reforming the rules about how tickets are sold and bought has the potential to transform the buying experience for customers, making it easier for people to be confident they are getting the right ticket,” he said. “These reforms support what the industry is already doing to make improvements to fares alongside record investment in new train carriages, upgraded stations and extra services.”The three-month consultation will be hosted on britainrunsonrail and involve a questionnaire that can be completed online or posted via freepost.Anthony Smith, chief executive of Transport Focus, said: “Our research shows that rail passengers want a fares system that is simple to use, easy to understand and is flexible enough to cater to how people work and travel today. ... We will ensure the voice of the passenger is heard clearly as part of this consultation.”The consumer group Which? welcomed the consultation but called for automatic compensation to be introduced as standard. “It’s been clear for years that rail fares are too complicated and confusing for passengers, and all too often people don’t get the best fare for their journey” said Alex Hayman, Which? managing director of public markets. “It’s a situation that’s gone on too long and the government needs to make sure that any changes to the fares system are in the best interests of passengers.“Trust in the industry is chronically low. While fixing the broken fares system will go some way to address this, more must be done for passengers who have to deal with shambolic services day in, day out. That’s why automatic compensation should be introduced across the industry for people who have to endure delays and cancellations.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/799e68cfebac27de0d59a60fd081e62f8b2364ea/0_11_3582_2149/master/3582.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a95d6559927354750b2c6b5751a4dfc9","title":"sunday essay britain always an island nation but never alone","story":"The Brexit charge is that the European Union has become an overbearing political project threatening British sovereignty and values. Britain, so the story runs, is an exceptional country with an exceptional history, exceptional institutions and an exceptional destiny. For Europeans inured to political instability and bloodshed, supranational institutions are needed to keep the peace. These chosen British lands have no such need. The Brexit vote was a protest vote against an order that had created insupportable lives for too many British citizens, intensified by fears over immigration, but it was underpinned by this cultural narrative of Britain’s uniqueness.Like all caricatures, this story contains enough truth to be plausible. As the dominant part of an island to the west of the continent, England after 1066 was able to develop parliamentary government, religious toleration and common law without the periodic invasions that beset other parts of mainland Europe. It was not occupied by Napoleon or Hitler or ravaged for decades by territorial-cum-religious war. It was first into the Industrial Revolution and built the most extensive of the European empires on the basis of maritime prowess as an island nation. It was on the winning side in the 20th century’s two world wars. English, once spoken only in the Thames valley, became the world language.But there are limits to this account. It greatly overstates the uniqueness of English history, our differences with Europe and our differences with the other nations of the British Isles.We have never been truly orced from our continent. How could it be otherwise? England’s violent record in Ireland, Scotland and Wales should disabuse anyone who thinks our history is distinctively peaceful – and our record in empire-building was of a piece. All the currents that have shaped us – Roman, Saxon, Danish and Norman occupations, the Renaissance, the rise of Protestantism, the gains of overseas expansion, the concept of the nation-state, universal suffrage and the welfare state, industrialisation, the brutalities of early capitalism and the emergence of socialism – have shaped the rest of Europe, too. The development has been symbiotic.Thus, Magna Carta was part of a family of European settlements that fettered monarchical feudal rights across Europe. England’s break with Rome under Henry VIII prefigured the cataclysm that overcame the Holy Roman Empire England was part of the European state system established by the 1648 peace of Westphalia.Sometimes, as with industrialisation, Britain was ahead of the pack, although we soon lost the advantage to Germany. Sometimes, as with votes for all women over 21 in 1928 or laying the foundations of a welfare state before the First World War, we were well behind Scandinavia and even ex-colonies Australia and New Zealand. On the welfare state, we took our cue from Bismarck. The Enlightenment was a pan-European movement. Indeed, there is a powerful argument for viewing the British Industrial Revolution as a European event, given how many of the key inventions had origins in European thinking and in immigrants, many of them refugees compelled to seek better lives here.The truth is that Britain has been integrating immigrants and sharing sovereignty for centuries. As urban centres grew and trade and cultural networks flourished, supported by revolutionary advances in technology from the three-masted sailing ship to the printing press to electrification to containerisation, these connections have woven Britain, Europe and the rest of the world closer together.This interconnectedness has made cooperation more, not less, essential over time. Since 1834, Britain has signed more than 13,000 treaties and international conventions – a red-tape mountain – virtually all of which have diluted our notional sovereignty while advancing our national interest. The EU continues this process. The EU buildings that Boris Johnson sees ominously “looming over cobbled Brussels streets” are not representatives of some terrifying “other”: none of the EU’s members has ambitions – whether public or cryptic – to submerge their nation into a federal superstate. There is no European army massing in Calais. The EU’s buildings represent an often ticklish interdependence in which we Europeans devise solutions to shared problems – from environment to trade, from security to terrorism – that we could not have applied on our own. It is a construct for the future. Brexit is a step back to an imagined past that never existed.Even as England became a separate state from parts of the European mainland in the 16th century, engagement remained intense. Elizabeth I spoke six European languages and regarded herself as a “prince of Europe”. Resisting marriage advances by French and German princes lest they cramp her options, she was as deeply engaged as any of them in the culture and politics of the European Reformation and Counter-Reformation.Shakespeare’s Jaques (As You Like It) said that “all the world’s a stage”, but Europe was Shakespeare’s actual stage – all of it, together with its history: Venice, Verona, Sicily, Denmark, Athens, Rome, Paris, Vienna, Milan, Naples, Mantua, Cyprus, Bohemia, Illyria (Croatia), Navarre (Spain), Troy and Antioch (Turkey). And most exotic of all, the unnamed, heavenly Mediterranean isle of The Tempest, of which Caliban tells the shipwrecked Stephano: “Be not afeard. The isle is full of noises, Sounds, and sweet airs that give delight and hurt not.” Political unions between England and mainland Europe continued long after Mary I, married to Philip II of Spain, was evicted from Calais in 1558. The Glorious Revolution of 1688 brought William of Orange (the Netherlands) to the English throne. After the death of the childless Queen Anne in 1714, the throne passed to her cousin George, Prince of Hanover, an Anglo-German union of crowns that continued until Queen Victoria’s accession in 1837. Victoria promptly united with Saxe-Coburg in her marriage to Prince Albert. Victoria’s great-great-granddaughter, Elizabeth II – Elizabeth I of Scotland, which “the Faerie Queene” did not rule – is cousin to the kings or queens of Norway, Denmark, Sweden, Spain and the Netherlands. Her husband, Prince Philip, is a prince of Greece and Denmark and son of a German princess.So the monarchy is the most European of English institutions, just as it is the most Scottish and Welsh. It is nonetheless ambiguous. For as well as her European relationships, the Queen continues to be head of state of Canada, Australia and New Zealand. She is also head of the Commonwealth, a club of 53 mostly ex-colonies which still have strong cultural, educational, sporting and economic links to Britain despite the relative decline of the mother country. If those bonds are weakening, it is not because of the EU – it is because of Britain’s fading economic and political relevance.A similar story of tension between England Alone and European Britain is told across England’s intellectual, political, diplomatic, religious and cultural life. David Hockney was strongly influenced by Picasso, David Bowie’s talent flowered in Berlin, George Orwell wrote in Paris and Catalonia. Isaac Newton was far more internationally famous than Shakespeare in his day, because he wrote for a European audience in Latin. Only since the late 18th century have English language and culture held significant sway in mainland Europe. Even then, it took 150 years of revolution, turmoil and occupation for London to replace Paris as the capital of Europe. By the late 18th century, Britain’s leading scholars were writing in English, but no less engaged in Europe for their ideas and influence.Adam Smith, the father of modern economics, started writing The Wealth of Nations in Toulouse, while touring the continent as tutor to the Duke of Buccleuch. He met Voltaire in Geneva and David Hume in Paris, where his fellow Scot was secretary of the British embassy. Hume introduced him to all the great writers of the French Enlightenment. Smith even intended – his sudden death intervened – to dedicate his great book on the “invisible hand” of the free market to François Quesnay, a French economist as well as physician to Louis XV.The Industrial Revolution arrived in Britain not just because of British genius, or because we had abundant coal and running soft water, but due to the interplay with the European Enlightenment. The leading economic historian Joel Mokyr argues that the quest for knowledge that defined the Industrial Revolution – led by great inventors such as James Watt, Richard Arkwright and Josiah Wedgwood – was inspired by an Enlightenment seeking to open up the world to the force of reason.Inventors and thinkers alike converged on Britain, whose political institutions, tolerance and openness made it a European hub. As Hume wrote: “Notwithstanding the advanced state of our manufactures we daily adopt, in art, the inventions and improvements of our neighbours.” Whether it was Leblanc’s soda-making system, Jacquard’s loom or De Girard’s wet-spinning process, the British proved adept at absorbing European ideas from whatever source to reinforce their technological prowess and leadership.The Industrial Revolution transformed not only British but also European societies and polities. Managing the convulsions and uncertainties associated with industrialisation led to common responses: while the details differed, social unrest allied to Enlightenment views of inidualisation and human rights was a catalyst for democratisation, which opened the door for redistribution and the extension of social and educational rights to the masses. William Beveridge, godfather of the NHS and postwar welfare state, studied extensively the systems of compulsory social insurance for pensions and sickness that Bismarck had introduced into Germany in the 1880s.The greatest Briton, Winston Churchill, exemplifies the English European who never turned his back on the European mainland. Churchill had an American mother and an imperial destiny from his boyhood at Harrow and Sandhurst, as a young officer on India’s North-West Frontier and then a reporter in the South African war. Yet he was equally proud of being a descendant and biographer of the Duke of Marlborough, victor of Blenheim in league with Germans against the hegemonic Roi Soleil, Louis XIV.And therein lies an episode of significance for the history of Europe. While visiting Marlborough’s battlefields in Bavaria in 1932, Churchill nearly met Hitler. The Nazi leader, about to take power, had been due to meet Churchill at his hotel in Munich but – in a moment rich with symbolism – he cancelled at the last minute because Churchill had berated the Nazi leader’s press secretary the night before about antisemitism.“Why is your chief so violent about the Jews? What is the sense of being against a man simply because of his birth? How can any man help how he is born?” Churchill recalled saying. And the upshot: “He must have repeated this to Hitler, because about noon the next day he came round with rather a serious air and said that the appointment could not take place.”Maybe the most fateful non-meeting in history.Churchill never saw empire as a reason for British isolation from Europe. Faced by the ultimate crisis, he spurned Chamberlain’s isolationist view of Czechoslovakia as “a far-away country”. Instead, he stood up to Hitler, offered the French an “indissoluble union” to keep them in the war as Hitler’s armies advanced on Paris in June 1940, refused to contemplate the armistice urged on him by his foreign secretary, Lord Halifax, after the fall of France and pursued to the end a war to liberate Europe from “the pestilence of Nazi tyranny”. But note for devotees of Darkest Hour and Dunkirk: Britain was never “alone” and could not have triumphed had it been so. Even in its darkest hour Britain could call on its then vast empire and, within 18 months, on the Americans, too. It also had a powerful defence industry incorporating Europe’s largest and most sophisticated aviation industry, built up in the 1930s by methods that rejected laissez-faire. Britain could and did outproduce Germany.Today’s pro- and anti-Europeans quote different Churchill postwar speeches. “We must build a kind of United States of Europe” is the classic federalist quote from his 1946 Zurich speech. “We are with them, but not of them” is the classic anti-integration quote when he was prime minister for the second time in 1953. However, swapping quotes out of context is no substitute for understanding Churchill’s thinking, which was consistently in favour of strong European engagement.For Churchill, as for Attlee, his internationalist Labour counterpart, the issue of the 1940s was to combine European engagement, imperial power and global partnership with the United States.Churchill’s approach was unambiguously to maximise British influence in all three circles, not to disengage. Seventy years after Llandudno, Britain has only one circle left intact – “United Europe” – and it is implausible that Churchill would have favoured disengagement from that one. On the contrary, he would have seen British leadership of the EU as all the more imperative because it is now our principal circle of influence. He would have been equally resolute in support of Nato, being the legacy of his wartime alliance with the United States that still secures British security and influence, but it is inconceivable that he would have regarded this as a substitute for the EU.The key point about Churchill’s 1953 “with them but not of them” remark is that it was in the context of France and Germany debating the establishment of an integrated “defence community” separate from the US, a stillborn precursor of the economic community that they went on to found in 1957.Churchill was not in principle against close military engagement with France and Germany, but in the context of the early 1950s he did not want to weaken the Anglo-American bedrock of Nato by supporting a speculative bid for a European army.In the event, the French parliament rejected the defence community, for reasons similar to Churchill’s. However, on economic cooperation Churchill was consistently positive. “We are prepared to consider, and if convinced to accept, the abrogation of national sovereignty, provided that we are satisfied with the conditions and the safeguards,” he said of the Schuman Plan in 1950. A year later, he was more explicit in disowning isolationism: “There are disadvantages and even dangers to us in standing aloof.” And after he left No 10, he supported Macmillan’s application to join the EU, having privately opposed Eden’s ill-fated Suez expedition in 1956.“In defeat, defiance” was another Churchill maxim. He never gave up the struggle to change public opinion and the Conservative party to his way of thinking, even when threatened with deselection as Tory MP for Woodford in Essex, now Iain Duncan Smith’s constituency, for opposing Chamberlain on his Munich agreement with Hitler to dismember Czechoslovakia.The Brexiter argument that Britain has outgrown the old continent has a long pedigree. Global Britain, descended from the “blue water” tradition, assumes a future in which Britain escapes European geography, European engagement and European immigration. Out in that blue yonder, there are no risks, no power imbalances and no limitations on sovereignty.This Global Britain, ludicrously branded “Empire 2.0” by some Brexiters, is a piece of flimsy nonsense, particularly as our former empire is entirely self-governing, the Commonwealth is a club with no clout and there are no uncolonised continents besides the Antarctic ripe for exploitation. The reality is that British strategic thinking has always been – has always had to be – at least as European as global. To argue, as Brexiters do, that we are not leaving Europe but rather the EU is elemental fatuity. The institutions of the EU are today’s Europe: they are where Europe’s states cut their deals, organise the economics, politics and security of our continent, hammer out joint foreign policy and are through which the shared rules that keep our borders open to the friction-free movement of goods, services, money and people are sustained. And all is congruent with democracy, the rule of law and accountability. They are a magnificent achievement. To argue differently is to traduce the evidence of our eyes – and a betrayal of our interests as a European power.For European balance-of-power politics, so advancing our national interest, has been a central theme of our history. We resisted the emergence of Spain, then France and then Germany as would-be dominators of our continent by building countervailing alliances. We helped defend Europe against outside predators – the Turks in their time, and in the last century the Soviet Union. The crusades, misguided as they were, were in their day quintessentially European. Britain built its overseas possessions in part to secure a better counterweight in Europe.As Churchill said, Europe is “where the weather comes from”. It is a Brexit fallacy that being out of the EU means being spared what happens in the EU and the eurozone. Britain has an existential interest in what happens in Europe, as it always has. There is no hiding place in the Atlantic.Today, risks are mounting, democracy is under threat worldwide, even in recently confident and progressive western Europe and North America. Putin’s Russia is behaving like the fascist regimes of the 1930s, backed by sophisticated raids from online troll factories. Citizens – and ominously younger voters in some European countries – are more and more willing to tolerate the subversion of democratic norms and express support for authoritarian alternatives.Oleg Kalugin, former major general of the Committee for State Security (the KGB), has described sowing dissent as “the heart and soul” of the Putin state: not intelligence collection, but subversion – active measures to weaken the west, to drive wedges in the western community alliances of all sorts, particularly Nato, to sow discord among allies, to weaken the United States in the eyes of the people of Europe, Asia, Africa, Latin America, and thus to prepare ground in case the war really occurs. To make America more vulnerable to the anger and distrust of other peoples.In Brexit-voting Weymouth, Captain Malcolm Shakesby of Ukip is unruffled by Putin or European populism. He inhabits the cartoon world of British exceptionalism, and his main concern today is Mrs May’s “sellout” of the referendum result. Brexit, uncorrupted, will be a success. “It will work because the British people are resilient,” he says. Then, in full Dunkirk mode: “In the Second World War, when we were down, we managed to pull through. The French couldn’t hack it, the Netherlands couldn’t hack it, the Belgians couldn’t hack it. We would have done what Churchill said, fight them on the beaches. That’s what nobody else ever does.” Of course Churchill did not actually do that – fighting on the beaches – and his whole statesmanship was to ensure that we did not have to, either.The MP for Shakesby’s South Dorset constituency is a Conservative who won the seat from New Labour in 2010. He, too, is a captain, one Captain Richard Grosvenor Plunkett-Ernle-Erle-Drax, educated at Harrow, then Sandhurst and the Coldstream Guards, grandson of Admiral Sir Reginald Drax and great-grandson of Lord Dunsany, second oldest title in the peerage of Ireland. Drax is quintessential governing class. At least six of his ancestors since the 17th century were MPs for Dorset or Gloucestershire. His home: the ancestral seat, Charborough House, Grade I listed, deer park and 7,000 acres. The grounds are open to the public twice a year, when the villagers of Sturminster Marshall are admitted to sell tea and cakes.Drax’s view on Brexit? “Resignation is the only honourable path” for MPs who won’t accept it. Drax is tribute to the Faragist takeover of the Tory party. It is a party now indifferent to Britain’s place in Europe and blind to the vital need for full engagement with our continent.

It is not a few bad apples not a few social media posts taken out of context. The problem has been growing unchecked for years, despite warnings by Muslim party members, and has now become so normalised that incidents are being reported with alarming frequency. Last week, the Muslim Council of Britain (MCB) called for an independent inquiry into Islamophobia following more-than-weekly occurrences in the party last month. In these past four weeks alone, Conservative party representatives and candidates have called Islam “the new Nazism”, posted a picture of bacon on a door handle as a way to “protect your house from terrorism”, and shared an article that called Muslims “parasites” who “live off the state and breed like rabbits”.Muslim party members also reported casual racism linked to the religion, and conversations where it was heavily implied or overtly spelled out that to get ahead in the party, they had to shed as much of their Muslim identity as possible. This is now a pattern. Peter Oborne wrote last week that in his research over the years he has shown that it is impossible for a practising Muslim to make his or her way to the very top of the Tory party.Prejudices do not just land at the door of certain parties. They bubble upwards from some foundational corruption. There is a reason that the anti-Muslim bigotry that has developed over the last two decades nested on the right, and found a home in the Conservative party. There is an overlap between specific antipathy towards Muslims and general hostility towards immigration, a cornerstone Tory attitude. And there is a reason it has intensified under the auspices of today’s party. A nativist\u0026nbspgovernment tone sharpened after the Brexit vote and overtures to the far right have won over Ukip voters and even ex-BNP supporters.Just as antisemitism on the left arises from a warped, conspiratorial view of a world in which Jews are enablers of powerful interests that conspire against the weak, anti-Muslim prejudice on the right arises from an obsession with immigration gone haywire, hence Muslims are hordes, invaders, breeding like rabbits and changing the culture with their creeping sharia.Hate speech against Muslims also conveniently channels a racial element that on its own would meet with far more opprobrium. There are many fig leaves that cover the naked prejudice, such as: people have legitimate concerns about immigration Muslims change the culture of a place far more than people of other religions do is it so wrong for a nation to want to preserve its culture? A handy manual for this sort of obfuscation is Douglas Murray’s The Strange Death of Europe: a masterclass in how xenophobia can take on a respectable shape by sublimating prejudice towards Muslims – and by extension immigrants – into a legitimate cultural anxiety.But the biggest fig leaf of all is that, somehow, it is all just legitimate criticism of Islam, that no one really has an intrinsic problem with Muslims. There is not much value in arguing against this logic because it is a set-up. Those who have been grappling with the whole “Islam is not a race” ersion for a while now know that it is obvious that hate speech, mockery, calling for internment and damaging people’s employment prospects, as studies have found, is not a legitimate interrogation of a faith. The religion-not-race canard is a threadbare semantic excuse deployed cynically by those who know that, once the religion element is stripped away, all that is left is the racist bigotry.A party that engages in populist rhetoric against immigration, the party of the Windrush scandal and the “go home” vans, is the natural home for the politics of fear. Zac Goldsmith’s shameful smear campaign against Sadiq Khan still stands as its monument. On Sunday morning, the home secretary, Sajid Javid, dismissed the MCB’s claims, citing its supposedly “favourable comments” on extremists, and refusing to engage with the fact that senior Tories, journalists and junior party members have all made the same claims. This is deliberate strategy. Raise the spectre of extremism and just hope everyone moves on.Of course legitimate interrogation of Islam can be, and is often, mislabelled as anti-Muslim prejudice, just as legitimate interrogation of Israel is often mislabelled as antisemitism. But it really is not hard to also see that, just as antisemites use Israel to hide their prejudice against all Jews, anti-Muslim bigots use Islamic extremism to excuse theirs.But the similarity ends there when it comes to popular condemnation. The difference in the public outcry against Labour and Conservative failures to tackle effectively race and prejudice issues in their parties is telling. We have become inured to the sharpness of the tone against Muslims, because criticising Islam has lent a civilising comfort to those who just don’t like Muslims, and Islamophobia has been successfully twinned with immigration in the public consciousness. There will be precious few pundits calling for an inquiry or radio shows asking callers whether Theresa May is fit to lead a party whose members bully and stigmatise Muslims. There will be few voters at the ballot box who will shun the Tory party because it makes their fellow citizens feel unsafe.Pressure must continue to grow on May to tackle the problem, but the only way that can happen is if the cause is taken up by others, not just the MCB. The present situation says much about the Conservative party and the alarming direction in which rightwing politics is taking the country. We’re seeing Islamophobia not just popularised, but gentrified."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e9b3704d3d552a1e42dc0bab7c4481af7f02d0d6/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2a5cf5da73c4d414c882b931c9bcfc01","title":"britain society inequality trade brexit is not the way","story":"The Brexiters are right about many problems but wrong on the solution. Poverty, inequality, low wages and job insecurity – all can be addressed without leaving the EUBrexit Britain is right. The status quo is insupportable. But the solution is not to leave the European Union. Our problems are made in Britain they can only be solved in Britain. Europe does not impede this mission rather it is indispensable. The imperative is to transform the way our country works.The poverty, inequalities and hopelessness that propelled the Brexit vote – seven out of the 10 poorest areas in northern Europe are in England, and all voted for Brexit – must be decisively addressed. Britain must simultaneously recommit to full EU membership as its benefits and the colossal costs of exit become ever clearer, and stand solidly with Europe as dark and menacing forces stalk the globe – not least an imminent transatlantic trade war and the wider threats of Donald Trump.To chase the economic moonbeams peddled by Brexiters while the values we prize are under global assault, to cower behind borders that shut out the rest of our continent, and to seek to resurrect an unachievable island sovereignty: this is a dead end that can only result in widespread suffering. That could even begin the day after Brexit next year, with widespread shortages of medicines, fuel and food as the port of Dover collapses with no Brexit deal – according to Whitehall departments’ risk assessments leaked and paraded in the Sunday Times yesterday.Brexiters dodge these truths. Intent on completing the Thatcher revolution, they want us out of the EU at any cost. While feigning concern for the state of Britain, their real agenda is wholly to embed a Thatcherite world of self-organising free markets and minimal social provision that will bring unalloyed benefit – whatever the baleful track record. They want out of Europe because it stands in their way.But two years after the referendum, the Brexiters’ “have your cake and eat it” fantasies have evaporated. There is no Brexit idend, rather the prospect of dismal economic growth and tax rises. The extra £350m a week supposedly available for the NHS turns out not to exist and instead we have an exit bill of £39bn (and rising). Then there is the up to £20bn a year cost of observing customs obligations after Brexit – an avalanche of self-imposed red tape – along with as much or more again as UK organisations expensively relocate to the European mainland.Virtually no one still claims, as they did during the referendum campaign, that we can retain the economic benefits of EU membership while leaving the European customs union and the single market. The prospect of “quick and simple” trade deals outside the EU is now recognised as delusory, particularly with Trump’s protectionist US and Xi Jinping’s China. It is the “global” EU that already has the trade deals, either done or in the making, with at least 60 countries, including Canada, Japan and South Korea – which are all in jeopardy for the UK on Brexit day. The EU is the citadel of rules-based international free trade and the international standard-setter that Britain did so much to create – and at whose centre we stood. “Global Britain” is a chimera.The economic warnings are there for those prepared to see them. Inward investment has collapsed by some £130bn over the last 12 months. The car industry fears “Carmageddon”. There is no open-skies deal with the US. Being frozen out of the Galileo project endangers our space industry. Universities fear being cut out of EU research budgets. It is the same in sector after sector.Europe’s achievements have not been driven solely by an economic calculus: they belonged to a bigger, nobler cause of representing European values, rooted in democracy. This is why any form of Brexit is a mistake. We want to share a continent where Europeans don’t fight each other, don’t prevent trade and where we allow its people to live and work wherever they like across their region. Never has Europe been so peaceful, democratic and prosperous as in the era of the EU.Saving Britain is a twin-pronged task: transforming our economy and society so they work for all while recommitting to an EU that covers our backs better than we know. Today’s laissez-faire, sink-or-swim approach to economics and society has to end instead our hijacked capitalism must be populated with repurposed businesses, motivated by a desire to produce goods and services that better humanity. New technology needs to be mobilised for the public good, while great institutions that serve the mass of people – such as trade unions, public-benefit companies to run utilities and building societies – must be reinvigorated and reshaped.A refashioned social contract should invest public money where desperately needed and raise the necessary taxes fairly. The centrepiece should be an educational Marshall plan. Part of this contract should be a stronger notion of citizenship, including a national identity card system to assure citizens that we know exactly who is here and what they are entitled to.A Great Charter for Modern Britain would hand power from Westminster to the cities, towns and counties of Britain so as to transform their localities, represented in a senate to replace the House of Lords, located in the north of England. This should be the foundation of a fully fledged written constitution.It is the Labour party – firmly pro-European and credible in its commitment to social reform – that could rally the country. The present policy of colluding in Brexit, while trying to make sure it is a Tory-authored disaster, will impose unnecessary suffering on too many. The great power of democracy is that citizens can change their minds as facts change: the Brexit refusal to countenance a second vote on grounds of its isiveness is born of fear that the people will reassess their decision. The worse isiveness is to press on regardless.Great countries find the political resource to turn around epic mistakes. The Labour party has the chance to save Britain, stand by Europe at a critical juncture in world affairs and form a great reforming government.

They do not have the training levels of Spain, the structure of Germany or the blend of top-class iniduals and team ethos harnessed by their bitter rivals Brazil. But they do have Lionel Messi, and that in itself is a reason to believe nothing is impossible.“If Leo is OK, the team will be more under his control than mine,” confessed the coach, Jorge Sampaoli. The most realistic objective would be progress to the quarter-finals elimination any earlier would be frustrating and anything beyond the last eight should be seen as a very positive performance. But no one in Argentina forgets the three lost finals in a row – the 2014 World Cup and the Copa Americas in 2015 and 2016 – and a team that suffer a worrying mental brittleness will be under plenty of pressure.One of Argentina’s weaknesses lies in goal, a position up for grabs after Sergio Romero was ruled out with a knee injury. Willy Caballero rarely featured at Chelsea last season and his deputies lack experience on this stage. In defence there is only one player of international quality, Nicolás Otamendi, and the performance of the entire backline has left a lot to be desired under Sampaoli. The coach has changed personnel and formations frequently, eventually settling on a conventional four-man defence. Gabriel Mercado, on the right, does not feel comfortable in that position and may be another achilles heel.There are also plenty of questions to answer in midfield, and Lucas Biglia’s injury – a double fracture of his lumbar vertebrae that casts doubt on his fitness going into the tournament – adds to the uncertainty. A lack of leadership and initiative to take hold of the ball and control a game in the middle of the park has posed significant questions the players’ answers have been hesitant.Two of those midfielders symbolise the mood surrounding Argentina and this World Cup. On the one hand Javier Mascherano, who turns 34 on 8 June and plays in a weak Chinese league, is clearly in decline and seems to mirror the plight of the national team. On the other Giovani Lo Celso, aged 22, who will have to assert more influence if Bielsa’s side are to do well. He is a moderate player, able to create attacks, who proved his worth last season at PSG. He is more engaged with the whole unit than some of his peers he can initiate attacks and pass between the lines to the forwards.And therein lies another concern. Messi’s explosive partners – players such as Sergio Agüero and Gonzalo Higuaín – must not let their captain toil alone if they dream of winning the cup. Argentina may lose with Messi, but the sense is that they will never win without him.Which player is going to surprise everyone at the World Cup? Giovani Lo Celso. European football has made Lo Celso a versatile, complete and decisive player. He left Rosario Central as a creative midfielder but at Paris Saint-Germain he has developed his range of skills and therefore his influence on his teams has grown. He is now much more able to defend against counterattacks and shadow the opponents’ best players. Not only that, his first touch – and pass – is excellent and he sometimes pops up in the opposition penalty area. From midfield he may be the perfect partner Messi has wanted in the national team for so long.Which player is likely to disappoint?Javier Mascherano. It was apparent that he could not continue playing for Barcelona and he went to China, really, so that he could stay in the game and have a chance to play in another World Cup. But playing in the Chinese Super League has not helped him much and, although still an option in defence or midfield, his best days are clearly behind him. When he plays, though, he can have a really positive influence on his team-mates.What is the realistic aim for Argentina at the World Cup and why? Despite having Lionel Messi, the best footballer in the world, a realistic aim for Argentina is to sneak into the quarter-finals. Many years of structural mismanagement have left scars. The coach, Jorge Sampaoli, has been in charge for a year and the team still lack a recognisable identity.Javier Saúl writes for La Nacion. Follow him on Twitter here.

He recalls how he wanted to tap into players’ competitive instinctsIn the 1970s, as Tomohiro Nishikado began to consider designing his next arcade game, the video game medium was in a fledgling state. With few rules to follow or break, the pioneering game developer had the creative freedom he needed to build a true cultural phenomenon. The game Nishikado was starting to plot out in his mind was Space Invaders, the iconic shoot ’em up that is celebrating its 40th anniversary.“I had no idea the game would become so popular it would become a social phenomenon,” Nishikado remembers. “I was totally taken aback.”Despite his surprise, the game designer had certainly crafted something of great cultural significance.Often credited as the title that single-handedly elevated video games above their then-status as a passing fad, Space Invaders is one of the foundation stones of today’s multibillion-dollar global games industry, along with other early arcade classics like Pong, Breakout and Pac-Man. Four decades after its release, Space Invaders continues to hold sway and status its pixelated enemy aliens are frequently used as shorthand for video games in their entirety. Not that Nishikado was even thinking about leaving a permanent mark on popular culture. He just wanted to push what could be done with the level of interactivity in a video game. In that aim, he succeeded and then some. Sea Wolf had introduced the notion of “high scores” two years previously, but Space Invaders did a great deal to popularise the concept.Nishikado linked points to in-game progression and introduced the concept of saving scores to the arcade cabinet. That framed score as a signifier of skill and survival, and lured players back to a given arcade cabinet to beat the tallies of others who had played before them a convention that established competitive gaming.“My initial intention was not to create a game that centred on scoring mechanics, but rather one where players would compete to see who could clear the most waves,” he explains. “However, making the UFO’s score a mystery led to players becoming very conscious of their score and eventually they started competing on that basis.“My aim was to give players a shooting game the like of which they’d never experienced before,” says Nishikado. “I did have the notion that I was introducing a new gameplay element, as the trend had been for only the player to shoot, but here the enemies fired back. More than that though, my focus was more on beginning software development for the microcomputer I used for the game, which was a new sensation given that games had been developed on hardware up until then.”Before Space Invaders – which did require Nishikado to build some hardware using parts ordered through the mail – games were often created by plotting out circuitry and electronic components on an arcade board. Nishikado saw another way, however, and pioneered the notion that games could be designed on a computer. His ambition wasn’t quite met by the underwhelming power of the microcomputers of the time, but in building his own development tools and customising the hardware, he set a convention for the future of the video game industry: games were now software, not hardware. Space Invaders’ popularity and legacy, of course, means that there’s been a lot of speculation about what inspired the game’s themes. Was it the presence of the tail end of the cold war, and paranoia about invading forces? Was it a trip to see a new movie called Star Wars? Did it stand as a metaphor for the relentless demands of modern life as computing power accelerated the human experience?“I wasn’t influenced by any social phenomenon or issues,” Nishikado says. “My aim was purely to create a game that was interesting and fun to play.”But what about George Lucas’s iconic film, which is often credited as inspiring the game?“It wasn’t Star Wars that led to the outer space theme,” he explains. “Initially I started with tanks, then tried warships and warplanes – but the movement and animation didn’t match the game. After much trial and error, by far the best match were soldiers, but shooting people was frowned upon. It was at this time, while I was stuck for an alternative, I chanced upon Star Wars and realised I could use aliens because no one would complain about shooting them. For the actual design of the aliens, I took inspiration from HG Wells’s octopus-like Martian design.”Forty years on, Nishikado admits he doesn’t find time to play many games. But he can’t quite stop dreaming them up. “I still think about how I could use some new technology or other and create an interesting game, so you could say that games are still part of my life,” he says.As well as spawning several dozen rereleases, remasters and sequels, Space Invaders has had a huge influence over video games. In the late 1970s and 80s, countless arcade companies rushed to release contenders for the game’s crown. Space Invaders stirred something in a whole generation of future game development superstars: Mario and Zelda Creator Shigeru Miyamoto, Metal Gear maestro Hideo Kojima and first-person shooter pioneers John Romero and John Carmack all credit it with setting them on the path to becoming game designers.Space Invaders was one of the first games to become a popular phenomenon, as Pokémon Go and Fortnite have become in more recent years. It stands up as an example of compelling game design, and a cabinet resides in MoMA’s permanent collection in Manhattan. It’s an ongoing entity for its publisher, Taito: a version called Space Invaders Extreme was recently ported to Steam in a nod to the 40th anniversary of the original. But Nishikado’s original arcade cabinet remains the locus of its cultural impact."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5023650d7c36fef83167262e087d3ccd819df9fb/0_203_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b6aa36855c43b22b6d55f9f26af0032f","title":"ghana unlikely marriage mining malaria control envious glances obuasi","story":"When a mining firm in Obuasi found malaria was hampering its operations, it joined forces with locals and the government to find a solution. Now others want to emulate their successNestled in the Ashanti region of southern Ghana, the small town of Obuasi is encircled by hills, largely forested but bearing scars from open-cast and illegal mining. Eighty kilometres south of the country’s second city, Kumasi, it is a community of subsistence farmers and miners.One of the world’s largest gold mines, it has been quarried since the 1890s.  But right now the underground drills are silent and a quieter operation is underway, digging out one of the world’s smallest but most deadly predators: the malaria mosquito.Such was the impact that the programme has been extended to the north of the country, where malaria is most problematic. “Malaria used to be a very serious situation in this community,” says Nana Ewaitemaa Adam II, community leader – or “queen mother” – of the settlement of Adansi-Odumase. “Children were dying. Adults were dying. But now they come to spray and the incidence has gone down. I don’t remember the last time I had malaria.”Despite these advances, countries like Ghana are being challenged by increased resistance to pesticides and drugs, as well as funding pressures.Approximately $2.7bn (£2.03bn) was spent on malaria control and elimination efforts globally in 2016, significantly less than the $6.5bn annual investment required for the WHO’s global malaria strategy.Countries that have eliminated malaria in recent years have tended to be subtropical or islands, like Sri Lanka.In addition to the risk of death, the economic cost of malaria is also high. As far back as 2001, research by John Luke Gallup and Jeff Sachs estimated the economic burden of malaria on African countries to be up to $12bn annually.  “Funding is dwindling everywhere, but one thing we are really working on is to increase domestic resources, because it’s the only way we can sustain our gains.” A 2006 World Economic Forum report, Business and malaria: a neglected threat?, sought to catalyse private sector interventions against malaria. Some, like the mining company in Obuasi, have taken up the challenge. A 2016 study on the effect of malaria on private companies in Ghana – covering agriculture, services and mining – showed 3,913 workdays and $6.58m were lost between 2012-14 due to staff falling ill with the disease, both managers and junior workers.The turning point came the year before, when malaria was formally identified as a risk to operations, and the mine committed to a deeper development partnership with both the community of Obuasi and the government. Today, the company states that “communities and societies in which we operate will be better off for AngloGold Ashanti having been there” – a bold claim in an industry with evident environmental impact.The resulting malaria control programme, AngloGold Ashanti Malaria Control Ltd, or AGAMal, had a small administrative team, with support from mine managers for financial control, planning, logistics, laboratory facilities and strategy. The mine funds salaries, office space and operations.This investment in quality facilities and staff – $15,447m since 2004 – together with determined prevention and treatment in the community, was spotted by the Global Fund to Fight Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria. A $138m expansion grant enabled AGAMal to scale up operations beyond the initial mining region and to offer indoor preventative spraying in northern districts with the highest malaria rates.AGAMal’s modern insectary and laboratory has now become central to Ghana’s fight against malaria. Alongside the national research centre, the Accra-based Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research, it provides a satellite centre for academics and public agencies.But in 2104, a classic private sector problem put the company’s contribution at risk. Facing a crisis of profitability, operations halted, significant restructuring started, and the mine was placed in care and maintenance mode. Now, following lengthy negotiations with the government – hampered by an invasion of a part of the mine by illegal miners in 2016 – it awaits permission to reopen, potentially this year. As part of the company’s reorganisation, “non-core” units like the hospital, school, sawmill and football club were split off and are now independently managed. Under the terms of the Global Fund grant, AGAMal became a wholly owned subsidiary.The company has maintained its support of the malaria programme.The mine’s economic viability affects many residents’ livelihoods. Even since suspending operations, the company is the largest employer in Obuasi district, with 300 employees and 350 third party contractors. Its redundancy bill totalled $240m.Underemployment remains a daily challenge for many here. Through the spraying programme and community advocacy that supports it, many local people have received high-quality training and regular stints of employment. It is not only the direct prevention and improved treatment of malaria in which Obuasi can find cause for celebration. School attendance and performance rates have also improved. “Everybody in Ghana is at risk of malaria, irrespective of whether you work in the private or public sector,” says Malm. “The Anglo Gold malaria programme started from a private company initiative, and it’s brought something on to the plate that is taking care of the public sector too.“For us to really win the war against malaria in this country, we need both the private and the public sector. We are looking to Obuasi to drive elimination and use this as a model to learn.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/57082aedd34f2e7176d5f6f718ec97c462592add/0_314_3008_1804/master/3008.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=96a98d8783500ec0d2e620d259547af0","title":"simon cowell says giving up mobile phone has made him happier","story":"Not using phone is ‘a strange experience but really is good for you’, music producer saysSimon Cowell has revealed that he has not used his mobile phone for 10 months in an attempt to boost his mental health and happiness.The music mogul said the move had paid off in terms of his quality of life. “I literally have not been on my phone for 10 months,” he told the Mail on Sunday. “The difference it made was that I became more aware of the people around me and way more focused.“The thing I get irritated with is when you have a meeting everyone’s on their phone – and I was probably in that place too.

I have therefore opened a lifetime Isa so I can benefit from the first-time buyer bonus that comes with it.My boyfriend, however, owns a holiday caravan. It’s non-residential as it is on a park that’s only open for a season and not the entire year, and there’s a maximum 28-consecutive-day stay policy.Does he still qualify as a first-time buyer and, if so, can he also open a lifetime Isa? According to HMRC, you are disqualified if you have “freehold or leasehold interest of a residential property”.I read somewhere that owning a park home means someone cannot be a first-time buyer, but I assume that is residential. Other than that I haven’t been able to find any information on this matter online. CSA You don’t have to be a prospective first-time buyer to qualify for the government bonus of up to £1,000 a year that comes with a lifetime Isa in which you can save up to £4,000 a year. But you do need to be aged 18 or over, under 40 and resident in the UK (unless you are a crown servant or married to one). However, to use your Isa savings – including the government bonus – towards property purchase (rather than for your retirement from the age of 60) you must be a first-time buyer.And you are right that you are not deemed to be a first-time buyer if you have ever owned any interest in land anywhere in the world that is freehold, leasehold (where the lease was longer than 21 years) or commonhold. In addition, the “interest in land” must not comprise “a building that is used – or suitable for use – as a dwelling”, which includes holiday homes even if they cannot be used all year round.Whether your boyfriend counts as a first-time buyer will depend on the agreement drawn up with the caravan park regarding the land on which it sits. If his agreement gave him “exclusive occupation” of a particular area for more than 21 years, he will own the land as leasehold and so his ownership of the caravan would stop him being a first-time buyer of other property. However, if his agreement with the park contains a provision that the caravan can be moved to an alternative pitch at the site at the park owner’s request andor gives the park owner free access to the land, it makes the agreement a licence to occupy the land rather than a leasehold. If it is a licence, it doesn’t affect your boyfriend’s ability to say he is a first-time buyer despite having a caravan. So he would be able to use savings from a lifetime Isa to put towards the property purchase without paying a penalty to withdraw funds before the age of 60.What neither you nor your boyfriend can do is use savings in a lifetime Isa to buy a caravan, other type of mobile home or houseboat as they do not “provide a legal interest in land”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/21bfe7d1d0aef2edfefda4feb4962aec36b7d369/758_38_2015_1209/master/2015.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=86a8d08fc98aeb384b80c43b09191665","title":"field day review brockwell park london festival","story":"Brockwell Park, London Under orders not to upset new neighbours, Field Day got strict with its headliners – pulling the plug on an overtime Erykah Badu – while serving a jazzy lineup of fresh starsWhen the sound gets shut off on the first night of Field Day, Erykah Badu has just peeled herself off the floor, where she’s been serenading us on her belly like a teenager on a late-night phone call. The neo soul queen may be upfront about her age – tweaking the lyrics of Me to sing: “This year I turned 46” – but she still has the youthful insouciance that brought her acclaim as a thrilling live performer in the 90s. Drowned by an oversized cream suit and enormous wodge of crimped hair, Badu is the sparky counterpoint to her ultra-tight backing band, bashing out beats on a drum machine as she introduces “the 90s babies” to classics like Next Lifetime and Tyrone.But she’s late, and the curfew comes anyway – after barely an hour, she’s on a mid-set high during Bag Lady when the plug is pulled. It was always going to be this way Badu isn’t renowned for her punctuality, for a start, but Field Day, now in its 11th year, is under strict orders to keep a lid on the noise and chaos. This is the festival’s first appearance in south London after events behemoth AEG nudged it out of its slot in east London’s Victoria Park. Residents of the affluent area around Brockwell Park were quick to raise the alarm, warning of vandalism and damage to bioersity. Their concerns seem to have been taken seriously, with curfews strictly monitored and stewards for miles around. The downsizing just about works – Field Day has always had a homespun feel to it – but at times the site feels overwhelmingly packed. With Badu in the headline slot, Friday’s lineup demonstrates a shift in priorities for London’s younger music fans, who have developed a serious thirst for jazz. From the 70s-style ensemble showdowns of Moses Boyd Exodus and the Comet Is Coming to the hypnotic Ethio-jazz of Hailu Mergia, about half the day’s acts are loosely jazz, often cross-pollinating with hip-hop, Afrobeat and soul. And on the main stage, the extraordinary falsetto of Moses Sumney heralds a potential successor to Badu’s eccentric crown, with the LA singer beefing up songs from last year’s Aromanticism with violin, clarinet and guitar. The perplexing charms of Jimothy Lacoste start Saturday off on a different note, as north London’s viral wonderkid brings a hint of knowing wit to his absurd iPad pop about “future baes” and London buses. New York rapper Princess Nokia caters to a similarly young and enthusiastic crowd, mixing juicy autobiography with hip-hop, jungle and, on new tracks, early 00s emo. Her a cappella Blink-182 cover is dreadful, but who else would dare?Elsewhere, dance music is the focus. The Barn, a high-spec rave tent, fills up immediately and stays full – Four Tet’s headline slot has to be paused temporarily to relieve the crush. Finally, Fever Ray closes the weekend with a dose of a radical art-punk energy. Karin Dreijer is flanked by two singer-dancers – one in a stunningly grotesque muscle-suit – and an all-women band as she turns the abrasive rave-pop of 2017’s Plunge into a choreographed celebration of queer sex and mental rebirth. The anthemic peak comes with To the Moon and Back, as Dreijer’s voice is drowned out by thousands of (mostly women) hollering: “I want to run my fingers up your pussy!” For once, it’s a welcome disruption to the festival order."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/adab2595a3019703c94efc20010aec12d901f4bd/0_0_5472_3552/master/5472.jpg?w=480\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=27c357308b6400c057e74ababf8a1f51 960w","title":"no strong business case for ditching eu rules says thinktank","story":"UK should accept regulations in return for strong market access, argues Open EuropeBritain should accept continued EU regulations in goods in return for retaining access to the EU single market, one of the thinktanks closest to Downing Street has proposed.After consultations across business and politics, a report from Open Europe concludes: “There is no strong business case for immediate significant ergence from the EU’s regulatory regime.” It says adherence to EU standards would not restrict growth in the export of British goods outside the EU.The report says the proposed “enhanced mutual recognition agreement would mean most goods manufactured by in one country would be considered pre-authorised for sale across others”. The proposal will anger many Eurosceptic MPs, but Open Europe – a thinktank that in the past has provided some of Downing Street’s most senior policy European analysts – says the government has to shift position both to unlock the polarised political debate and to meet demands clearly expressed by British business.The proposal will be taken as another sign that the tide of opinion is shifting away from a free trade deal in which the UK gains little access to EU markets in return for the right to full regulatory ergence. The Open Europe compromise has strict limits since it suggests the UK should be free to regulate itself in services – the bulk of the UK economy – and should not accept a customs union or a common external tariff.It also suggests the UK could be allowed to decide for itself whether it wishes to accept new EU regulations in goods, so long as it acknowledges that rejection of such new regulations would limit future UK market access. The paper assumes that the UK will negotiate a standstill agreement until December 2020 in which the UK maintains all of its obligations and market access but plays no role in setting rules.However, a long-term willingness to accept EU rules in the field of goods would require a greater role for the European court of justice, or at least a judicial dispute resolution mechanism informed by the ECJ rulings, and would also set limits on the UK’s ability to negotiate its own free trade deals. The compromise will be seen as significant step forward by European business leaders, many of whom are due to meet Theresa May on Monday in Downing Street. The proposal is largely endorsed by the Eurosceptic former chancellor Norman Lamont in a foreword to the pamphlet. “There is an argument that Britain could commit to preserving the existing body of EU rules and regulations on goods,” he writes. “Business has already adjusted their systems to make products to meet these requirements.”The pamphlet’s authors say: “Giving up some control – or sovereignty – over goods regulation is a price worth paying for strong market access. Manufacturers in highly regulated industries often follow EU rules anyway, in some cases even in the US.“The debate at the moment is polarised between hardline leavers who refuse to accept giving up any sovereignty whatever the economic costs, and extreme remainers who want to either reverse the referendum result or at least recreate the entire structures of the EU from the outside. This is not where business or the public are. A sensible compromise recognises that giving up a little sovereignty can deliver good economic benefits, but there are diminishing returns in asking for more.” The detailed talks over a future trading relationship are due to be held at a June meeting of the EU council, but the run-up to the meeting has been overshadowed by the inability of the UK government to come up with an agreed proposal on the Northern Ireland border. Open Europe claims its compromise should be welcomed in Brussels since the EU already allows countries such as Switzerland and Ukraine very high levels of access to the single market in goods, in return for their broadly following the EU rules."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/73954129ec1fd7c52bbe3ac25a08e4338a17961d/0_183_3772_2263/master/3772.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=72a70485d2a866c8f16cb3b99d8a7e5c","title":"can you solve it world cup arithmetic","story":"The puzzle that shoots and scoresThe World Cup is almost upon us, so here’s a puzzle to get you in the mood.England, Tunisia, Belgium and Panama make up Group G.

Training overran. The England forward is in intensive preparations for the hockey Women’s World Cup, which begins at London’s Lee Valley park in seven weeks’ time. Not that she’s complaining.“It’s all go, go, go,” she says from Bisham Abbey. “We just finished training and we ran over slightly. Next we’ve got a team meeting, and that’s before our next training session. It’s a lot of work. Our gym work is based around being really buff, being strong and preventing injury. To be honest, I don’t think I appreciated it was such a key factor for performance athletes, and it really is brutal. But we wouldn’t have it any other way.”Listening to Defroand run through the schedule of her working week could get you out of breath by itself. It’s double sessions every day, with an emphasis on gym work. Even the rest day, on Wednesdays, is used by many players for swimming and yoga to help their muscles recover from the rest of the week. The Thursday sessions are the most notorious, though not for their physical demands.“Thinking Thursdays” recreates a match scenario but for a game nobody has played before. By changing the rules (two points for a goal, for example, or points for entering the shooting circle), players have to literally think on their feet breaking the habits they have formed and creating new ones. Defroand loves it.Playing club hockey for Surbiton, Defroand is a full-time athlete, benefiting from UK sport funding as part of the Great Britain squad. The 23 year-old’s career has run in tandem with professionalisation and, after graduating from Birmingham University in 2016 with a masters in sports science, she became part of a new generation able to dedicate themselves entirely to the sport. “I submitted my dissertation a couple of weeks after the girls won gold in Rio,” she says. “It’s really been lucky, the timing of it all, it’s been a natural progression for me. I finished university, was able to trial for the squad and now I’m living my dream.”Defroand made her Great Britain debut in February and her current training is as part of that group. Like most of the GB squad, however, she will be representing England at the World Cup. The relationship between the two teams is a fluid one (and, indeed, England earned their second-placed seeding at the World Cup in part thanks to GB’s performance in Rio) and it was while playing under the flag of St\u0026nbspGeorge that Defroand got her first experience of tournament competition at the Commonwealth Games this year.“I will always remember that first game,” says Defroand. “The moment when I stepped out on to the pitch. We’re a sport-mad family and I’d always watched the Commonwealth Games as a kid, every one. I wanted to take a step back and think, you know? To think, wow this is it, this is why I’ve trained so hard. I looked into the crowd and my mum and dad were there and that’s just such a proud, proud moment for myself.”In the countdown to the World Cup, England hockey has encouraged its players to share details of their sporting role models as part of a campaign called Behind Every Great Player. There is no doubt about Defroand’s inspiration her mother, Gill.“My mum has been the biggest influence for me growing up and becoming the hockey player that I am,” she says without a moment’s hesitation. “I got into hockey through her. I started playing at age seven because I used to watch her play every Saturday at our local club in Havering.“Mum would say that I’d steal her stick at half-time and be running up and down the pitch. By the age of 10 or 11 I was lucky enough to be playing in the same team. Since becoming a team-mate my mum’s been my club, my county and my regional manager. She’s my biggest fan and my biggest critic and this campaign is about trying to get that relationship between parent and child, get that support network, because it does make such a difference in sport. My mum has been such a fundamental part of my journey and I can’t thank her enough.”The Lee Valley is not far from the Defroand family home, which adds an extra local flavour to a competition already being billed as the biggest ever women’s sporting event on UK soil. Every England match is sold out and, after winning bronze at the Commonwealth Games in a strong field, the onus is on the hosts to match or better their\u0026nbspperformance.As Defroand counts down the days until the first centre pass, she is typically bullish about England’s potential. “You’ve got a mixture of experience and youth. You’ve got a real blend of pace but complete composure in our team,” she says.“I think we would be kidding ourselves if we didn’t think we could get on that podium. That’s what we focus on day in day out to make sure we get these major medals. Over the last year we’ve come away with a European bronze, Commonwealth game bronze so why not go a few better this summer with our home support behind us?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/beda80d810188f3fc1cfd944a6b0741b8ad89fe5/48_312_3196_1917/master/3196.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dbff7ac41e56444770dfeb2422e66642","title":"joe root england pakistan headingley","story":"Joe Root has warned that England’s series-levelling win against Pakistan must not “paper over the cracks” despite expressing some personal satisfaction that his players delivered on their orders to show more pride and\u0026nbsppassion.The three-day innings victory at Headingley stopped what had become a worrying rot for Root’s side, who had gone winless over the course of their Antipodean winter and then hurtled into a full-blown crisis with the crushing defeat at Lord’s last week.Questions were asked of their head coach, Trevor Bayliss, while the former captain Michael Vaughan set the hare running on a war of words with Stuart Broad after suggesting either he or Jimmy Anderson should miss out in Leeds to “ruffle a few feathers” among the squad.Speaking after Broad had fittingly taken the final wicket to cap a fine inidual performance, Root said: “I asked the guys to play with pride and passion and you saw that on the field. I think there is an element of that that comes out through criticism.While Vaughan’s theory was always unlikely to come to pass, defeat here would have seen England tumble to No\u0026nbsp7 in the world Test rankings and certainly increased the pressure on Bayliss given Ed Smith has just begun his selection role and Root is only a year into captaincy.“Trevor is the easy target when the side is losing,” Root said. “It would have been very easy for the whole group to get tense and have a negative feel but Trevor’s experience pulled us through. You saw it on the field, the energy the guys had. The confidence after that great start was there all week and that is a big thing for the team moving forward.”The chief positives to emerge from the 1-1 series draw came from the two standout selections at the start. Jos Buttler’s two half-centuries validated his return, while Dom Bess followed a maiden half-century on debut at Lord’s with 49 from nightwatchman here and then claimed his first three Test wickets as Pakistan crumbled\u0026nbspon Sunday.Root said: “The one thing we knew we were going to get from Dom was that character. He was padded up for 45 minutes, desperate to get in as nightwatchman, because he wanted to be involved in the game. He wants to bowl, he wants the ball in the field – that’s the sort of player he is. It’s no surprise to me that you get the results you’ve seen this week from him.”England’s thoughts now turn to their strongest format – one-day cricket – before the Test series against India in August, with a one-off match against Scotland in Edinburgh on Sunday followed by a five-game series with a somewhat callow looking Australia side. Ben Stokes, who missed out in Leeds with a hamstring tear, is confirmed to sit out the weekend fixture and the “first part” of the Australia series that starts on 13\u0026nbspJune. Dawid Malan comes into the squad for the former, while Sam Billings has been added for the latter.Pakistan can reflect on two Test wins from three on their tour of Ireland and England, having beaten the Irish in Malahide ahead of this drawn series, and some fine performances from Mohammad Abbas – the man of the series – and the teenage all-rounder Shadab Khan.Sarfraz Ahmed, Pakistan’s captain, said: “When we came here people thought that we will not win one game. The way we played at Lord’s was perfect, the batting, the bowling the fielding. It’s disappointing that we had a chance to win the series but we didn’t play well here. I am still proud of my\u0026nbspyoung team.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/70110d33c5d6a9db7c3b4b2951078c1bda668bdf/421_79_2126_1275/master/2126.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3105efb1d386e8e3b1992885ad7bbc22","title":"amazon delivery firms face legal action over workers rights","story":"GMB union is demanding gig economy drivers get sick pay and national minimum wageDrivers delivering goods for Amazon are to fight for better employment rights, including sick pay, holiday pay and the national minimum wage.The GMB union announced on Monday that it is taking legal action on behalf of members working for three delivery firms used by Amazon, arguing that the companies wrongly classed them as self-employed.A statement from the union, which represents professional drivers, said: “The drivers were required to attend scheduled shifts that were controlled by Amazon, meaning they did not have the flexibility that is integral to being self-employed. In this situation, the couriers were treated like employees in terms of their working hours and the GMB union contends they should be treated as employees in terms of their rights too.”The case is the latest in a string of gig economy legal disputes challenging what unions say is bogus self-employment among couriers and other drivers. The GMB won a landmark judgment against Uber in 2016 and others, including Deliveroo, Addison Lee and CityLink, are all involved in ongoing legal action.The case is being handled by solicitors Leigh Day. Partner Nigel Mackay, a specialist in employment and discrimination law, said seven drivers – including two who had been dismissed – were involved in the claim at this stage and he expected that number would grow. One of the drivers described his experience of leaving the house at 6am, not returning until 11pm at night and as a “thank you” for his hard work, had £1 per undelivered parcel deducted from his wages. On more than one occasion he was told by the company that he would not be paid if he did not complete a route and had sometimes driven when “half asleep at the wheel” in order to ensure he got paid.Two of the members are also claiming that they were dismissed because of whistleblowing, claiming their roles were terminated because they raised concerns about working practice. These included that the number of parcels allocated to drivers resulted in excessive hours andor driving unsafely to meet targets, and that drivers were expected to wait a significant time to load their vans, extending their working hours.  GMB’s general secretary, Tim Roache, said: “The day to day reality for many of our members who deliver packages for Amazon is unrealistic targets, slogging their guts out only to have deductions made from their pay when those targets aren’t met and being told they’re self-employed without the freedom that affords.”“Companies like Amazon and their delivery companies can’t have it both ways – they can’t decide they want all of the benefits of having an employee, but refuse to give those employees the pay and rights they’re entitled to.” “Guaranteed hours, holiday pay, sick pay, pension contributions are not privileges companies can dish out when they fancy. They are the legal right of all UK workers, and that’s what we’re asking the courts to rule on.”An Amazon spokesman said delivery providers are contractually obligated to ensure drivers they engage receive the National Living Wage and are expected to pay a minimum of £12 per hour, follow all applicable laws and driving regulations and drive safely. “Allegations to the contrary do not represent the great work done by around 100 small businesses generating thousands of work opportunities for delivery drivers across the UK,” he said.He added: “Amazon is proud to offer a wide variety of work opportunities across Britain – full-time or part-time employment, or be your own boss. Last year we created 5,000 new permanent jobs on top of thousands of opportunities for people to work independently with the choice and flexibility of being their own boss – either through Amazon Logistics, Amazon Flex, or Amazon Marketplace.”In April, the delivery company Hermes, which delivers packages for retailers such as Next, Asos, John Lewis, Topshop and River Island, began a legal battle with eight of its own drivers. It is under pressure to settle after rival delivery firm DPD offered all its drivers sick pay and holiday pay as part of wholesale reforms to its gig working model sparked by the death of a driver it charged for attending a medical appointment to treat his diabetes and who later collapsed and died.In 2016 the ride-hailing firm Uber was told its drivers should be classed as workers with minimum-wage rights.Uber, which says its drivers are self-employed, lost its appeal against the decision last year but said it would appeal again. The case could end up in the supreme court this year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b7003ab1b960fbc075d6230cfc9da82abd1e61f/0_215_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=38f96834a6910a1ed8b11d8914469935","title":"elon musk visionary space travel fell back down to earth","story":"The champion of clean energy and space travel, who was on a trajectory seemingly forever up, is now locked in battle with the same media which once feted himOnce upon a time Elon Musk was our era’s real-life Tony Stark, a billionaire Iron Man streaking across the sky with technology to save the planet and take us to Mars.Reusable rockets, electric cars, solar power, he did them all, taking time out to advise Robert Downey Jr on how to play the Marvel superhero on a trajectory seemingly forever up, up, up.Now Musk, 46, is literally and figuratively in a long, dark hole. He is tunneling beneath Los Angeles to create a prototype underground transit network which, he says, can save the city from traffic congestion. A noble goal. But a recently released video of the tunnel plus a map of potential lines coincided with a dark turn in Musk’s fortunes and reputation, creating the impression of a man in a labyrinth of his own making.His car company Tesla is hemorrhaging money and credibility. Unhappy shareholders want to dump three directors, including Musk’s brother Kimbal, from the board. Lawsuits tangle his clean energy company SolarCity.The entrepreneur has responded to negative headlines by lashing out at the news media and inidual journalists.“Holier-than-thou hypocrisy of big media companies who lay claim to the truth but publish only enough to sugarcoat the lie, is why the public no longer respects them,” he tweeted last week, ire stoked by a damning report about Tesla factory safety. Musk followed up by calling journalists sanctimonious twisters of facts beholden to advertisers – and proposed a remedy. “Going to create a site where the public can rate the core truth of any article \u0026amp track the credibility score over time of each journalist, editor \u0026amp publication. Thinking of calling it Pravda.”For some of his online supporters – he has 21.9 million Twitter followers – this was a call to arms. They piled on journalists with abuse and threats.For Musk skeptics it was further evidence of his burrowing into ethical murk. Instead of Iron Man here was Gollum, erratic and vengeful, scrabbling with trolls.“Going after the free press because they’ve been critical of your company is not how a CEO, visionary or even an adult reacts to criticism and it has real-world consequences,” Roberto Baldwin wrote in the technology blog network Engadget. Other outlets have weighed in, excoriating Musk as a thin-skinned bully who wouldn’t recognise journalistic independence if it rode a blazing meteorite over California. “The Donald Trump of Silicon Valley,” declared the New York Times.The bold champion of clean energy and space travel now locked in battle with the same media which once feted him as a visionary. How did it come to this? One possible answer: Tesla has skidded into trouble and Musk is blaming the messenger in apparent hope of soothing skittish investors and potential investors.A year ago Wall Street was toasting the company. Its market value surpassed that of Ford and General Motors thanks to sales of the battery-powered Model S sedan, a pioneering autopilot system and the promise that a $35,000 economy version of the Model 3 would soon roll off assembly lines, turning Tesla into a mass market auto-maker.Breaking into a market of gasoline-focused giants to make stylish, emissions-free cars adored by customers was a remarkable feat. Few others had dared, let alone succeeded. Musk’s public presentations inspired an evangelical vibe among cheering audiences. Then came setbacks. Tesla recalled 126,000 Model S cars to fix bolts. Crashes raised troubling questions about autopilot systems. “Production hell” – Musk’s words – plagued the Model 3. The long-promised economy version has yet to emerge, undermining Tesla’s claim to be a mass market player. The company reported record losses and burnt through $750m in cash in the last quarter. Its stock, credit rating and valuation plunged amid speculation about bankruptcy. Tesla will likely need a big cash infusion to survive. “More bad press for Elon: the car Elon Musk launched into orbit has fallen back down to Earth and crushed Malala Yousafzai,” blared a headline this week. This time it really was fake news – a satirical article from Clickhole, a spinoff from the Onion. “Hell of a week,” he tweeted. The Pakistani human rights advocate ran with the joke and tweeted that she was keeping the car. “Finders keepers,” he responded.It was a fleeting, lighthearted interlude in his toxic response to genuine bad news, a mix of scorn and conspiracy theory aimed at delegitimising reports of Tesla woes.“Anytime anyone criticizes the media, the media shrieks ‘You’re just like Trump!’” he tweeted. “Why do you think he got elected in the first place? Because no one believes you any more. You lost your credibility a long time ago.“Problem is journos are under constant pressure to get max clicks \u0026amp earn advertising dollars or get fired. Tricky situation, as Tesla doesn’t advertise, but fossil fuel companies \u0026amp gasdiesel car companies are among world’s biggest advertisers.”His followers have followed up with invective against inidual reporters, especially female ones, a misogynistic streak detailed in a Daily Beast article. “It is as though they’ve invested their own identity as males into Elon and his work,” said Shannon Stirone, a science writer.When not gaslighting online, Musk’s fans can unwind by using handheld flamethrowers: his tunnel company, Boring, sold 20,000 at $500 each. A good investment for the impending zombie apocalypse, said Musk.Amid the tide of criticism it is easy to overlook Musk’s achievements, and some nuance.The South Africa-born boy who designed and sold a video game, Blastar, by the age of 12, is self-made. He studied economics and physics and minted a fortune at PayPal before upending space exploration with audacious innovation.He sets impossible targets, for example in fuel efficiency, said one SpaceX engineer, on condition of anonymity. “We tell him it can’t be done, then spend months working around the clock and deliver maybe half the target, which is amazing, but we’re almost apologetic.”SpaceX set a new milestone in February by launching the Falcon Heavy, the first time a private company has sent such a powerful rocket into space, paving the way for even bigger rockets to potentially carry humans to Mars. “It’d be pretty cool to die on Mars, just not on impact,” Musk once joked to the . (His representatives declined an interview request for this article).Unlike most CEOs Musk engages with customers and journalists, albeit mostly via Twitter. He has told his more trollish supporters to cool it. “At risk of stating the extremely obvious, I am against threats of violence \u0026amp abusive epithets in any forum. Please do not use them in my name or at all.”The media sometimes misses or chooses to miss his humour. Naming his putative journalism credibility rating site Pravda may not be hilarious but is hardly an attempt to recreate the Soviet propaganda mouthpiece. And yes, many journos are under pressure to get max clicks and earn advertising dollars.The reason Iron Man fell to earth, however, is that reality overtook the hype. He dazzled investors with an image of mass produced Teslas which so far remains a mirage. Maybe Musk can yet make it real – the jury is out.Blasting the media is a tantrum or smokescreen, perhaps both. Either way it is straight from the Trump playbook, though in this case the media are not lying, hypocritical liberal ideologues but lying, hypocritical shills for Tesla’s fossil fuel rivals.That narrative may play out underground too if the media keep reporting skepticism about Musk’s vision of a Los Angeles labyrinth, with some calling it a plutocrat’s fantasy, others a boondoggle.A recent public presentation hosted by Musk was tightly controlled – no TV cameras, entry by reservation, pre-approved questions – and packed with a cheering crowd. The last question: “Will you organize a big party before the tunnel launch?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f31e26c256a6e213e43ecdf7b8ea6403f4cac05/0_248_3786_2271/master/3786.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=28edeb8f7c3e6af4ec64b6df6c241a6b","title":"krakow locals guide city food drink bars art","story":"It’s Kraków’s striking medieval old town, one of the finest in Europe, that attracts visitors, but the city’s youthful restaurants, bars and cultural hangouts are well worth checking out, tooHotel Forum was a monstrous concrete carbuncle of a hotel built during the Soviet era (started in 1978, it took 11 years to complete) next to the Vistula river in the middle of the city. It represented unprecedented luxury in Poland at the time, and featured a swimming pool, mini golf and a casino. But it only stayed open for 13 years – a design fault led to the basement constantly flooding, and it stood decaying and abandoned for many years. The long-term fate of the building is still uncertain, but five years ago, a group of creatives set up Forum Przestrzenie, a contemporary cultural centre with a bar and a good kitchen, which is now one of the hippest venues in the city. Local beers cost about 8zl (£1.65), pizzas from £6.30. Alongside concerts, movie screenings, food and fashion shows, locals come to relax on deckchairs and enjoy the sunset, with Wawel Castle across the river. DJs provide extra ambience. It has a very relaxed atmosphere in a retro setting. • Ul Marii Konopnickiej 28, forumprzestrzenieA few minutes from Kraków’s tourist-thronged main square (Rynek Główny), Tytano is an old tobacco factory whose production halls and offices have been turned into bars, restaurants and clubs. The high ceilings, large loft windows and exposed brickwork have all been retained, and the complex is closed to traffic so people can stroll between venues. Among the most popular are Weźże Krafta, which offers more than 30 local craft beers on tap (Polish IPA at around £2.50) cocktail specialist Lastriko and Veganic, which serves vegan fare such as beetroot falafel burgers and cabbage leaves stuffed with red rice and boletus mushrooms (main from about £5). There are concerts and fashion events throughout the year and most venues have indoor and outdoor seating. It has just been announced that the site will be developed into a hotel in the next few years, so enjoy it while you can.• Ul Dolnych Młynów 10, on FacebookAt the Bezogródek food truck in Błonia Park, you can try anything from Hungarian langosz (fried dough cakes) to Thai ice-cream. But my favourite is Andrus food truck at the Skwer Judah food court in the Kazimierz district (see below). Andrus takes a traditional Polish pork dish, called maczanka Krakówska, and gives it a twist by marinating the pork in his secret signature sauce for 48 hours and serving it in a warm bun with onion and pickles. Other combinations include horseradish and fried egg, and the showstopper comes with beetroot mousse and dark chocolate. Bring wipes as this sandwich is as messy as it is delicious (£2.60).• Andrus Food Truck, ul Wawrzyńca 16, on Facebook Bezogródek – ul Piastowska 20, on FacebookLooking at Kraków’s skyline from Wawel Hill (seat of the Polish government in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance), you’ll notice a few lumps on the surrounding hills. These are the Krakówskie Kopce or Kraków Mounds. The oldest – Kopiec Krakusa and Wandy – are believed to have been built by pagan tribes several thousand years ago. Kopiec Krakusa is located across the river in Old Podgórze and is said to be the burial site of Kraków’s founder, King Krakus, although no grave has ever been found beneath it. There is a large lawn at the foot of this mound, great for a picnic with a view. During the summer solstice the mounds are in alignment with the sun rising at Kopiec Wandy and setting at Kopiec Krakusa. Two newer mounds commemorate Polish generals, with the most visited being Kopiec Kościuszki, finished in 1823, which offers spectacular views of Wawel Castle, St Mary’s Basilica, the Main Square and Błonia Park. The largest mound is Kopiec Piłsudskiego, constructed in the 1930s, and located in the Las Wolski forest next to Kraków Zoo.This cafe and bar is attached to the Bunkier museum of contemporary art, which hosts many exhibits, including the World Press Photo Contest. The building, designed by Stefan Borzęcki and Antoni Hajdecki in 1965, is one of Poland’s few examples of brutalist architecture and was the first modern building within Kraków’s old town. It’s in Planty Park, where the medieval city walls stood until the early 19th century. The cafe has different sections: snug, antique corners with wing-backed chairs, a larger tunnel-like greenhouse affair and an outside terrace facing on to the park. This is one of the few places in Kraków where you can drink tank beer – beer that is not pasteurised or micro-filtered and is less carbonated (about £2).  • Plac Szczepański 3a, en.bunkiercafe.plWhile the rest of the world has speakeasies, Kraków has its “lost bars” – though the principle is the same. The first bar to hide its door was Mercy Brown in 2015. It’s located in the Smakolyki restaurant, and you gain access through the cloakroom, down a hallway and up a flight of stairs to the hidden courtyard of an historic tenement building. Once inside, the vintage decor offers a small glimpse of what life was like in Kraków in the 1920s – there’s soft lighting, chandeliers and frilly lampshades, velveteen couches and golden drapes. The menu is short and simple and drinks cost £4-5, including signature cocktails such as tea time – gin with jasmine tea cordial accompanied by elderflower liquor served in a china tea cup. Finding a seat can be difficult so reservations are encouraged. Regular events include burlesque shows and cocktail mixing competitions. Other lost bars worth searching out include Sababa, Z Ust do Ust and Lost Bar.• Straszewskiego 28 on FacebookFor 500 years, Kazimierz was the bustling centre of Jewish life and culture – until it was destroyed and its inhabitants were forcibly removed to the Kraków ghetto just across the river in Podgórze by the Nazis in 1941. During the communist era, it was a rundown quarter of the city that most people avoided. But since the fall of communism in the 1990s, and when it came under the spotlight of Steven Spielberg’s movie Schindler’s List, it has once again transformed into a buzzing, bohemian neighbourhood packed with bars, cafes and historic sights – the Remuh Synagogue traces its roots back to the 1550s the Galicia Jewish Museum chronicles the sobering history of Polish Jews. Plac Nowy, the heart of the district, is home to flea markets at the weekends with antiques, books and food stalls – grab a traditional zapiekanki (pizza breads packed with toppings) from one of the stands or holes-in-the-wall in the square. Cheder, which was opened by the Jewish Culture Festival Association in a former prayer house, is a venue for lectures, film screenings, concerts and other events and serves Israeli-style coffee alongside traditional mezze (£4.30 for five small dishes with pita bread). The Jewish Culture Festival runs from 22 June to 1 July.• ul Józefa 36, jewishfestival.plplchederOnce a limestone quarry where Karol Józef Wojtyła (AKA Pope John Paul II) worked during the second world war to avoid forced labour in Germany, this lagoon just beyond the city centre was created in 1990 when the quarry was flooded. Now Zakrzówek is an oasis of turquoise waters and cliffs where locals come on hot summer days to stroll, sunbathe and enjoy barbecues. Swimming here has been banned on safety grounds, but there’s a scuba ing school at the site. Thanks to its vertical limestone walls and good visibility, it’s considered one of the best ing sites in Poland. It’s a special place because you feel as though you’ve trekked through forests to get to the lagoon – then you climb a hill, and realise you’re on top of the city centre. But visit soon: the city has voted to redevelop the site for recreation, and although it will reintroduce bathing, it’s sure to lose its sense of wilderness.• The nearest bus (number 194) and tram (18) stops are Kapelanka and NorymberskaKraków locals love their ice cream.

He is, the caption in the calendar says, only doing what comes naturally – keeping his family and his village safe. Seigo Fujiwara’s picture shows him staring into the middle distance, his head swathed in a traditional tenugui. The 29-year-old surveyor is looking for a woman with a “beautiful smile” with whom he can travel the world.They and 10 other men from Otari are the faces of Japan’s ticking demographic time bomb. They hope their calendar poses will generate interest from potential love matches and help end their search for love and companionship.Finding a partner in Otari, a village in Nagano prefecture in Japan’s northern Alps known for its dramatic scenery and some of the best skiing in the country, is proving a thankless task for Kobayashi and his friends.Its population is about a third of what it was in the 1950s in the past decade, the number of residents has fallen from 3,734 to 2,795, including fewer than 180 children of primary and middle school age.According to the National Institute of Population and Social Security Research, its population will fall to just over 900 by 2060 if current demographic trends persist. As of last March, just 275 men and 218 women in their 20s and 30s lived in Otari.Young women are more likely to leave in search of jobs, and perhaps a partner, while the men are expected to stay and inherit family farms and businesses, leaving them with little prospect of marrying and having children. Otari’s predicament is repeated in many places across the country. According to one study, 869 municipalities – almost half the national total – are at risk of disappearing due to the low birth rate. In a report titled Local Extinctions, the Japan policy council said those towns and villages would cease to function if the number of women in the 20-39 age group falls by more than half by 2040.Yuki Nozaki Quilkey, a former foreign ministry official who advises Otari’s mayor, came up with the idea after seeing the success of the New York fire department’s Calendar of Heroes.She is convinced that Otari’s best hope of long-term survival is attracting a small number of young professionals who are sick of city life but do not have any connection to the countryside.She is behind a programme to disassemble some of the village’s grand, but abandoned, farmhouses and move them to more convenient locations in the hope of attracting start-ups. Two tech companies are due to start sharing a renovated 250-year-old house in the village next year.“The time came to dispense with the laissez-faire attitude and actually do something to rejuvenate the village by incorporating its assets into a proper business model,” she says. “The calendar was the first step in changing that mindset. It was money well spent.”Kobayashi, who works in the village office, was instrumental in rounding up the 11 models and says he encountered surprisingly little resistance. “There are very few opportunities to meet young women here – and I speak from experience,” he says.Kobayashi and the other calendar models are reluctant, though, to go through the upheaval required to take their search farther afield. He partly attributes that to a “village mentality”, but says there are clear advantages to life in this unspoiled corner of northwest Nagano prefecture.“I went to university in Tokyo and I would get stressed out just taking the subway in the morning,” he says. “Here it’s a totally stress-free existence.”The calendar lists the models’ professions and hobbies, and a few words about their goals in life and their ideal partner. To date, the village office has received enquiries from eight women, four of whom have followed up by sending in their photographs and profiles.While Japan has seen a slight rise in the fertility rate in recent years, government incentives such as one-time cash payouts have had limited impact. In Otari, parents with bigger families receive one-off payments that rise with each child, as well as discounts on education fees. But the return has been minimal.“We don’t have a silver bullet for depopulation,” the mayor, Hisashi Matsumoto, conceded. “The population will probably continue to fall, but if we can persuade more families to have, say, three children, then we can at least slow down the rate of decline. “At the very least I want the people who already live here to lead as happy and healthy lives as possible. The same goes for anyone who decides to move here.”Daniel Hunter, a 21-year-old Australian who is in the middle of a plastering and tiling apprenticeship, has fallen for Otari since his first visit to the area a few years ago. He is single and wouldn’t mind having a girlfriend, but sees the calendar as more of a PR opportunity for the village than a personal plea for companionship.“I thought it was a cool opportunity to show people that there are foreigners living happily here,” says Hunter, whose parents spend every winter running a ski lodge nearby. “I can see myself sticking around for a while, although there are times when I wish it was a bit livelier.”No one in Otari expects the calendar to spark an influx of young women and a localised baby boom. But Fujiwara, who doubles as Mr May, hopes it will get people talking about the village.“I’m part of a family business so I will be here for the foreseeable future,” he says. . “In any case, moving to a place where there are more women would mean there are also more men, who would be my rivals.”At 26, Kobayashi is not fretting about marriage just yet. But he is typical of many Otari men who must reconcile their determination to stay put with a desire to find a life partner. “The thought of leaving the village has never crossed my mind,” he says. “But I don’t want to stay single either.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c43d9eecc08c0c4c9e7098ad68c659410d40d04c/0_327_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f12b1a9ee19194cc7488bafe3255585b","title":"new zealand great walks foreign tourists to pay double","story":"Price rise, part of a trial to raise money for maintenance and combat overcrowding, will apply to the popular Milford Track among othersTourists to New Zealand will soon have to pay double the fee that locals do to use huts and campsites located on some of the country’s great walks.The move is part of a trial by the government that seeks to gain extra revenue to maintain the network of walks – one of the country’s major tourist drawcards.“New Zealand’s nine great walks are premier tracks that pass through unique and spectacular scenery and are a magnet for international visitors,” said the conservation minister, Eugenie Sage.She said the seven-month trial from October will provide information on the effectiveness of pricing as a tool to manage visitor pressure.“It is also part of setting and maintaining a fair pricing system for New Zealanders.”Currently, the Department of Conservation’s (DOC) investment in maintaining the great walks exceeds the revenue from users’ hut fees by up to NZ$3.8m (US$2.6m) each year.“DOC expects to recover up to an additional $2.9m during the trial period, without significantly reducing bookings and visitor demand,” Sage said. “The increased accommodation fees may also encourage overseas visitors to use less visited wreat walks where prices remain the same.”Prices for huts for international visitors, including children, on the Milford Track will be $140 per night, on the Kepler and Routeburn $130 per night and Abel Tasman Coastal Walk $75 per night. Hut prices for New Zealanders remain at $70 per night for the Milford, $65 per night for the Kepler and Routeburn, and $38 per night for the Abel Tasman Coastal Walk. New Zealanders under 18 will remain free of charge.With almost five million international visitors predicted to arrive each year by 2023, the announcement is one way the Labour-led government is looking to increase revenue off the back of the lucrative tourist market. Tourism directly contributes $14.7bn to the country each year, with a further $11.3bn contributed indirectly.As part of its election campaign the party also proposed a $25 “tourist tax” that would be levied on visitors at the border.

The US official, who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity, was commenting on a report by South Korea’s Yonhap news agency that all three of the North’s top military officials were believed to have been replaced. Trump on Friday revived the proposed 12 June summit after cancelling it a week earlier. The US is seeking a negotiated end to North Korea’s nuclear weapons program. US officials believe there was some dissent in the military about Kim’s approaches to South Korea and the US. Kim likely wants to ensure any deal struck in his meeting with Trump will not face opposition at home. Since coming to power in 2011, Kim has conducted several purges in an effort to consolidate power. The young leader was just 27 years old when he took power in a society that reveres older cadres. Mintaro Oba, a former US diplomat who focused on North Korea policy, said Kim might be using the upcoming summit “as leverage to get rid of internal hardliners”. It was also possible the “summit created such a risk to his internal power he felt he had to protect himself by moving people around”.“It’s worth considering whether this round of summit diplomacy has given Kim Jong-un an opportunity to get a more favourable group of people at the top,” Oba said.Kim had his uncle and potential rival for control, Jang Song-thaek, tried and executed in 2013. Kim’s older half-brother, Kim Jong-nam, was assassinated last year in an operation widely believed to have been directed from Pyongyang. The US official did not identify the three military officials. Yonhap identified them as defence chief Pak Yong-sik chief of the Korean People’s Army’s (KPA) general staff, Ri Myong-su and Kim Jong-gak, the director of the KPA’s General Political Bureau. Trump wants North Korea to “denuclearise,” meaning to get rid of its nuclear arsenal, in return for relief from economic sanctions. North Korea’s leadership is believed to regard nuclear weapons as crucial to its survival. Citing an unnamed intelligence official, Yonhap said No Kwang-chol, first vice minister of the Ministry of People’s armed forces, had replaced Pak Yong-sik, while Ri Myong-su was replaced by his deputy, Ri Yong-gil. It said army general Kim Su-gil’s replacement of Kim Jong-gak was confirmed in a North Korean state media report last month. The White House, State Department, CIA and Office of the Director of National Intelligence did not immediately respond to requests for official comment. Lower-level US-North Korean talks to prepare for the summit are continuing but have made only “halting progress,” according to a second US official briefed on the discussions. That official said US negotiators’ efforts to press for definitions of immediate, comprehensive, verifiable and irreversible denuclearisation by North Korea had run into opposition from the White House. In a remarkable shift in tone eight days after cancelling the summit, citing Pyongyang’s “open hostility,” Trump welcomed North Korea’s former intelligence chief Kim Yong-chol to the White House on Friday, afterward exchanging smiles and handshakes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e27b9d79f11f7a7ae6449c828e2bde58dd4fb16/0_267_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cb7cce2145351e84fc07a422a676d8ec","title":"sao paulos gay pride parade in pictures","story":"Hundreds of thousands of people have gathered in Brazil’s largest city for its 22nd annual celebration.

Kingdom, that there are no trade barriers put up between Northern Ireland and our biggest market, which, of course, is Great Britain.”  Photograph: PA WireDemocratic Unionist Party leader Arlene Foster has threatened to pull her support from Theresa May’s government if London agrees a plan that gives Northern Ireland special joint EUUK status.Ms Foster rejected the latest idea floated by the UK government to avoid a hard border on the island post-Brexit and break the impasse in negotiations between the EU and the UK.Speaking to Sky News, the DUP leader, whose party keeps Ms May’s Conservative Party in power at Westminster, said she would withdraw her support if Northern Ireland was treated differently from the rest of the UK after the UK leaves the EU in March 2019.Ms Foster said maintaining alignment between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK was a “red line” that if crossed would result in Ms May losing the support of the 10 DUP MPs in the House of Commons.“For us our only red line is that we are not treated any different from the rest of the United Kingdom, that there are no trade barriers put up between Northern Ireland and our biggest market, which, of course, is Great Britain.“That’s what we will judge all of the propositions that are brought forward, we will judge it against that red line, and she’s very much aware of that, and I have confidence that she knows that she cannot bring forward anything that will breach that red line or we simply will not be able to support them.On Friday, it was reported that the UK’s Brexit secretary David Davis was creating a plan that would give Northern Ireland joint UK and EU status so it could trade freely with both and set up a “special economic zone” of 10 miles (16km) along the Border to eliminate the need for checkpoints.The idea has been dubbed Mr Davis’s “max fac 2” – an advanced version of his “maximum facilitation” or “max fac” solution relying on technological solutions to maintain an invisible border on the island.Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator in the Brexit talks, has rejected this plan, and the option of a customs partnership proposed by London as neither operational or acceptable to Brussels.Failure to find a solution to avoid a hard border jeopardises negotiations to secure a deal ahead of the UK’s formal departure from the EU next March, and raises the prospect of a disorderly Brexit.Britain would experience shortages of medicine, fuel and food within a fortnight without a deal under a “Doomsday Brexit scenario” drawn up by senior civil services for Mr Davis, the Sunday Times reported.Labour leader Brendan Howlin said the British people should be allowed to vote again on Brexit if there was a risk of such a “nightmare” scenario materialising, something he described “as a treasonous act”.“If the no-deal scenario materialises, we owe to our friends in the UK to support a referendum which would allow the UK to reverse the previous referendum result,” he said.Negotiations are entering a critical period as Dublin and Brussels have urged London to show substantial progress on Border proposals by the next European Council meeting of EU leaders at the end of the month.Tánaiste Simon Coveney has said Mr Barnier’s EU taskforce must receive detailed proposals in writing from the British government within a fortnight if they are to be agreed at the June 28th-29th council.On Friday, in response to Mr Davis’s reported “max fac 2” plan, Mr Coveney’s department called on the British to engage “in a more detailed way” on other solutions and a legal text on the “backstop” option that would effectively keep Northern Ireland under EU economic rules if there is no other plan for the Border.Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce"},{"url":null,"title":"legal action by consultants catastrophic for health funding","story":"The State has warned that a successful legal action by hospital consultants over withheld pay increases could have “catastrophic consequences” for health services funding.Consultants have challenged the withholding of agreed pay increases in 2009, and the State is contesting their claims.The HSE had previously forecast that in a worst-case scenario, about 2,000 consultants could have to be reimbursed, at an ultimate cost of about €700 million gross.In High Court affidavits on behalf of Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe and others in defence of the cases, it is claimed 700 other consultants have identical claims, and that there are a further 2,280 on the same contract who may also be affected.The cases – 10 of which are due to be taken this week – are being defended by Mr Donohoe, as both Minister for Finance and Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Minister for Health Simon Harris, the HSE and inidual hospitals.Paying all these claims would be “beyond the means and normal budgetary management” and would have “catastrophic consequences for service delivery”, their affidavits argue.It is understood there has been significant contact between the two sides in the dispute in recent weeks and that this week’s hearing may be adjourned to allow for further talks with a view to a possible settlement.However, any settlement is still likely to cost the State hundreds of millions of euros.Under a contract introduced in 2008, consultants agreed to major work-practice changes, including the restriction – and in some cases, the elimination – of private practice, weekend working and extended rosters. In return, then minister for health Mary Harney offered them salaries of between €170,000 and €240,000, with increases to bring the rate up to these levels to be paid on a phased basis.The first payment was made, but not the second phase, following the collapse in the public finances, and the State later cut consultants’ pay by 15-25 per cent.The affidavits on behalf of the State say the “economic, fiscal and banking” circumstances at the time were of “unparalleled severity”.They also argue that the government of the day “made clear” in April 2009, including with the Irish Medical Organisation and the Irish Hospital Consultants Association, that some pay increases “would not be sanctioned andor approved due to the serious disturbance in the economy and a decline in the economic circumstances of the State that had occurred”.“In circumstances where there are approximately 700 other plaintiffs seeking identical relief to the plaintiff and a further 2,280 consultants on the 2008 contract, if the relief sought is granted the liability accruing is wholly beyond the means and normal budgetary management.“In the circumstances it would be contrary to public policy, to the administration of justice and to principles of good administration” if claimants were allowed pursue their cases “outside the time limits provided for judicial review”.The doctors are understood to argue they signed up to and operated the contract with the legitimate expectation its terms would be fulfilled. Other arguments understood to have been put forward by the consultants include an increase in the number of hours worked per week and how working arrangements, including in private practice, were affected. Mr Donohoe has previously said the Government would “vigorously defend” any legal actions by consultants.Mr Donohoe has declined to say how much the potential costs to the exchequer of settling or losing cases against a large number of consultants would be.

Photograph: iStockThe Government is preparing for a “worst-case scenario” of extradition arrangements with Britain breaking down entirely after its planned pull-out of the EU in less than a year’s time.And it fears a “very significant” deterioration of co-operation between Dublin and London, causing “immediate and serious problems” in dealing with criminals and terrorists if the UK also exits a handful of key EU-wide conventions.Under the European Arrest Warrant (EAW) system, police in any EU country can ask its counterparts in another member state to arrest a criminal suspect and return them for prosecution.The process takes as little as 48 days to complete at present.Documents from the Department of Justice show assistant secretary James Martin, head of international policy, briefed staff that the “best-case scenario” for extradition post-Brexit is the transfer of accused criminals taking “four or five years”.“Worst-case scenario is that extradition breaks down,” Mr Martin told his international policy unit, records released under Freedom of Information show.“This is not an understatement. Before the EAW, there were a whole series of cases where people were not extradited to the UK because it was regarded as political or courts said a person would not get a fair trial.“There was practically no extradition between Spain and the UK.”Last week, a senior EU figure told journalists during a briefing in Brussels that Britain would not legally be able to continue in the EAW system after it leaves the bloc.Several appeals are already before the courts in both the UK and Ireland challenging extradition on the basis of Brexit.In a separate discussion on the matter, Mr Martin told criminal justice figures last October that the UK’s decision to exit the EU had “alarmed” his department.Notably, the UK’s insistence on ending the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice will “pose serious and complex obstacles” to close co-operation between the two countries, he said.It could take between “10 to 15 years before new agreements enter into force”, he told a private meeting of the Association for Criminal Justice Research and Development, his speaking notes show.The figure is based on the length of time it took for Norway and Iceland to negotiate a “surrender agreement” with the EU, which remains subject to a political clause.The “fall-back situation is the 1957 Council of Europe Convention on Extradition,” which “has many flaws”, he said.In a heavily redacted release of the department’s official assessment of the impact of Brexit, it says there will be a “noticeable practical effect” on Ireland through more than 700 EU regulations, directives and other instruments .Some 86 were identified as needing immediate attention, but a handful – including the EAW, Mutual Legal Assistance, Europol and the Prum convention on cross-border co-operation on crime and terrorism – are deemed among the most important.“If the UK was to exit all these instruments, the level of criminal justice and police co-operation between Ireland and the UK would be adversely affected to a very significant degree for both ordinary crime and terrorism,” it states.Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"joyous and tearful scenes in dublin castle as eighth amendment to be repealed","story":"  May 27, 2018Ireland has voted No to tribalism and fear in overwhelming decision to remove the Eighth   May 27, 2018Thirty-five years after its introduction, Eighth Amendment repealed after bitter campaign   May 28, 2018Cheers and tears greeted the verdict \u0026ndash a just reward for decades fighting the good fight   June 1, 2018The victory belongs to everyone but any analysis that does not place at its centre the feminist, women-led movement is bereft "},{"url":null,"title":"miriam lord it took 35 years to build this stunning result","story":"Thirty-five years after it was placed into the Constitution, the electorate voted for the Eighth Amendment to be repealed and for provision be made for the regulation of termination of pregnancy.

Photograph: Nick BradshawIt took 35 years to build a landslide.Repealing the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution was neither quick nor easy, despite what the margin of difference might say.Sixty-six per cent said “Yes”. Makes it look simple.But that two-thirds majority conceals hard history and hard-fought battles behind a stunning final result.Woman by woman, story by story, year upon year, day after day. The rocks and pebbles of countless unjust ordeals and small personal tragedies piled up after each furtive trip to Liverpool and beyond.Brave campaigners for basic abortion rights did everything they could to increase the pressure, their efforts ignored and condemned by priests and politicians and that tiresome class of pious people who live in terror of the slippery slope.They thought they could hold back a landslide. On Friday, gravity kicked in. The slippery slope did for them in the end.The Eighth Amendment, which guaranteed a foetus the same right to life as the woman carrying it, is gone from the Constitution. Good riddance to it. It brought nothing but difficulty and despair to Irish women in times when they desperately needed proper care and compassion at home.It was a wonderful morning on Saturday in the RDS when the boxes were opened and the votes counted. It was a wonderful afternoon in Dublin Castle when crowds filled the courtyard to hear the official declaration. It was a wonderful day for Irish women.A day made even better in the happy knowledge that the vast majority of Irish men are looking out for them and want only the best for them. By voting in their droves to repeal, they placed the concerns of women far above the fears of ideologically-motivated crusaders who prize saving souls above having a heart.With repeal looking the likely outcome, there were calls from some quarters for a muted and dignified response. Perhaps it was the reason why there was neither screen nor public address system for the huge crowd at the castle.But no. For all the decades of all the women who suffered, and for all the women who fought and agitated for change, we had to celebrate this historic turning-point in modern Irish society.Some never thought they would live to see the day. Some, like Monica Barnes and Mary Holland and Nuala Fennell and many more, didn’t. The celebration was for them too.It was for Ailbhe Smyth, who never stopped fighting. It was for senator Ivana Bacik, Catherine Murphy, Joan Burton, Catherine McGuinness and many more who were there from the start.Political rivalries were cast aside for the day. “Oh, c’mere to me,” said socialist Bríd Smith, giving Fianna Fáil’s Timmy Dooley a hug.Obstetrician Peter Boylan, looking very cool in his shades turned up and it was like George Clooney had just rambled in, such was the clamour which greeted his entrance. The three co-directors of Together4Yes – Ailbhe Smyth, Orla O’Connor and Gráinne Griffin – arrived to rapturous welcome.Senators Lynne Ruane and Alice Mary Higgins were in floods. Ruth Coppinger was hugging for Ireland. Katherine Zappone, who demanded the referendum as her price for supporting the Government, was ecstatic.“Oh God, I told my husband I’d give up the fags if there was a repeal,” said Fine Gael’s Kate O’Connell, one of the party’s most active campaigners, as she ran out for a smoke.Brendan Howlin arrived in just after Mary Lou McDonald’s big entrance. The Labour party was fighting the cause when all the others didn’t want to know. “We never get the credit,” said Howlin, shrugging. “We carry the flag, but then in comes the fresh faced Leo to take all the glory.”Maybe not. Health Minister Simon Harris pretended to be embarrassed by the “I fancy Simon Harris” poster, but he was secretly thrilled. Wherever he went he was mobbed. No wonder Leo stuck close by him.Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin maintained a low-key presence, but his early intervention and support for repeal and the proposed legislation was a pivotal point in the campaign.It was a courageous move which now sees him on the right side of history and one half of his parliamentary party stranded on the other.As Micheál walked through the crowd, tearful young women hugged him. A man and woman approached. “We’re one of those couples who had a fatal foetal abnormality,” the women said to him. “Thank you. Just, thank you,” she sobbed.Meanwhile, back in the RDS, the Attorney General was chatting to former Supreme Court Judge Catherine McGuinness.She had had eye surgery the day before but the doctor gave her a special dispensation to attend the count. “Theoretically I should have a patch over my eye today.”At Dublin Castle, Frank Crummy (81), who set up Ireland’s first family planning clinic, was resplendent in his repeal jumper, alongside his wife Evelyn.There was a lot of discussion about why so many politicians and pundits called the campaign so wrong. The Together4Yes team remains amused by the old school, outmoded metric used by some of them to evaluate their very effective efforts. It was as if they were affronted at the idea that people outside the Kildare Street bubble might actually know more than they do about what the electorate really wants these days.Independent TD Clare Daly, a politician hugely deserving of credit for the part she played, decided to stay away from the castle bunfight. Instead, a number of Johnny Come Lately politicians with a weakness for self-publicity preened and waved from the platform.It’s always the same.A third of the electorate voted No. “I feel like I’ve lost my country,” a woman told us amid the celebrations in the RDS. She was very sad. She couldn’t be consoled.Cheers and tears and champagne greeted the announcement. The sky fell in briefly when a few drops of rain fell. Everyone danced.Because it was a monumental day. The day when the intelligent, compassionate citizens of Ireland turned to the Catholic Church and the retreating fundamentalists and firmly said: “Thanks, but no thanks.

We believe that countries should play by the rules,” said Mr Williamson. “This is even more important at a time when storm clouds are gathering and regional fears are rising, when more nations have nuclear and chemical weapons, not to mention the infringement of regional access, freedoms and security.”But he declined to answer whether British ships would sail within 12 nautical miles of a disputed territory or artificial island built by the Chinese, as US ships have done. At the end of May China’s military said it had dispatched warships to challenge two US Navy vessels that had passed within 12 nautical miles of the Paracel Islands, an archipelago in disputed waters off the coast of Vietnam. Gavin Williamson, UK defence secretary, tours the HMS Sutherland in SingaporeChina, whose claim to the Paracel Islands is not recognised, argued that passage within 12 nautical miles constitutes a violation of the country’s territory under the United Nations Convention of the Law of the Sea. Mr Williamson stressed that the UK, France and Australia had also been asserting their rights of passage in the region. “We’ve been sending a clear message to all that the freedom of navigation is absolutely critical,” he said. Since it left UK shores in January, the Sutherland and its 220-strong crew have also engaged in surveillance operations to counter efforts by North Korea to bypass UN sanctions on banned commodities through illicit ship-to-ship transfers. Mr Williamson said the UK was “very realistic about the challenges” that lay ahead with North Korea, but welcomed the prospect of the upcoming Singapore summit between Donald Trump, the US President and Kim Jong-un. “The most important thing that we have is the fact that people are talking, people are trying to work to find a solution and the diplomatic lead that has been shown is one that I think we all welcome and we know is the right approach.”    Please review our commenting policyA Very English Scandal, episode 3, review: Hugh Grant completes transformation from romantic lead to hypocritical rotter in finale of the Jeremy Thorpe affairBritain\u0026#39s Got Talent 2018, the final: Lost Voice Guy a worthy winner as Rev Michael Curry gives his blessingLove Island 2018: A beginner\u0026#39s guide to the new series and contestants as it starts on ITVTrain chaos as dozens cancelled on day one of emergency timetable Grenfell Tower inquiry to hear evidence on the cause of the fire, as survivors hail the beginning of a \u0026#34long road to justice\u0026#34Man leaps from runaway car at Dracula\u0026#39s castle Lazy cooks who use ready-made sauces are more likely to get cancer Philippines president Rodrigo Duterte sparks outrage by kissing woman on stage in South KoreaIs Kim Jong-un replacing top military leaders to fend off coup ahead of Trump summit?MSPs call for child \u0026#39welfare assessment\u0026#39 of all armed forces visits to Scottish schoolsComment: I recoil when Alzheimer\u0026#39s sufferers are talked about in the past tenseRichard Leonard urges Left-wing Scots to oppose \u0026#39austerity economics of nationalism\u0026#39The 8 things you might have missed this weekendGuatemala volcano eruption: At least 25 dead and hundreds injured as lava river sweeps through villagesBritain faces \u0026#39full spectrum\u0026#39 of Russian threat for \u0026#39years to come\u0026#39, MP\u0026#39s report says All 10 series of Doctor Who since 2005 revival arrive on BBC iPlayerGrenfell \u0026#39disaster tourists\u0026#39 flocked to site to \u0026#39take selfies\u0026#39, report finds Cheap advance rail fares could be on the way out MI5 will reveal the identity of terror suspects to police officers and teachers to help disrupt plotsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/06/04/TELEMMGLPICT000165345184_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"8 things might have missed weekend1","story":"Volcan de Fuego, or Volcano of Fire, blows outs a thick cloud of ash in GuatemalaGuatemala is reeling from a deadly volcano eruption, Theresa May is expected to lift the cap on doctors from outside the EU, and a new breast cancer trial is being hailed as the biggest advance for 20 years.Meanwhile, England bounced back against Pakistan and Gareth Southgate has warned  his squad about the use of the VAR in the World Cup.If you\u0027ve been away from a screen or newspaper all weekend or want a summary, here\u0027s a quick recap of the main events.1.

Is the adoption of other people\u0027s customs and cultures fair game or has political correctness gone mad?\u0026nbspDavid Barnett treads warily\u0026nbspLet’s get this out of the way: I am a straight, white, middle-aged man, so what follows you may take with a pinch of salt or disregard completely. But we’re going to talk, you and I, about the thorny issue of cultural appropriation.It was only a year ago that Oxford Dictionaries put the phrase into their official lexicons, with the definition, “the unacknowledged or inappropriate adoption of the customs, practices, ideas, etc. of one people or society by members of another and typically more dominant people or society.”Cultural appropriation is sometimes so blatant it smacks us in the face. The Black and White Minstrel Show ran on British television for – what seems now to us, looking back at it – and astonishing 20 years, from 1958.Even halfway through its run the show, in which white entertainers “blacked up” to sing songs in a Deep South of America style, was the subject of petitions calling for it to be taken off the air because of its in-your-face racism. It can hardly be seen now without an overwhelming feeling of embarrassment. How did we ever think that was acceptable?The show was harking back to the minstrel shows in 19th-century America, and blackface was a popular form of entertainment until the enlightenment of the 1960s, coupled with rising racial tensions across the US, finally put paid to it.\u0026nbspEven Al Jolson, dubbed “the world’s greatest entertainer”, was renowned for performing in blackface. Jolson was Jewish, and while there can never be any excuses made today for blacking up, it’s interesting that in their 2008 book the Encyclopedia of American Jewish History, authors Stephen Harlan Norwood and Eunice G Pollack talk of Jolson’s 1927 movie The Jazz Singer in terms which suggest some kind of what we would today call intersectionality. For example: “Is there any incongruity in this Jewish boy with his face painted like a Southern Negro singing in the Negro dialect? No, there is not…The son of a line of rabbis well knows how to sing the songs of the most cruelly wronged people in the world\u0027s history.”Can a Jewish man really pretend to be a black man without racism? Is this cultural appropriation of the very worst kind or solidarity that only two historically subjugated peoples can appreciate? And what, then, of a Jewish woman who dresses up as a Japanese woman for entertainment?The cries of “cultural appropriation” were resounding around social media even before Netta Barzilai had finished her (ultimately competition-winning) performance of Toys, the Israeli entry in this month’s Eurovision song contest held in Lisbon.Netta wore a stylised kimono and was surrounded by dozens of maneki neko waving lucky cat statues. Twitter in particular was rather exercised by the thought of the cultural appropriation taking place before its very eyes. Or, I should say, mainly white Western Twitter. It seems the only people not too fussed were the Japanese themselves.According to the website soranews24, which repackages and discusses Japanese news stories for an English speaking audience, the overwhelming response on the ground seems to be a mildly nonplussed reaction.The site quoted from Japanese social media accounts which included the responses, “Culture is meant to be stolen. If it’s not worth stealing, then it isn’t culture”, “If people keep claiming ‘cultural appropriation’ then people will not touch our culture. Then, people will not understand our culture and it will be easier to become our enemy”, and, perhaps crucially, “Westerners care too much about silly things”.Is that the problem? Are we, Westerners, liberal Westerners, too over-sensitive of the feelings of others brought on by white guilt? Or are we right to call out what we think is wrong when we see it? Should we wait before speaking, to see what the actual people affected think? Or is it our duty to step in first?Perhaps it’s now we should go back to the Oxford Dictionaries definition of cultural appropriation, particularly the bit that talks about the “more dominant people or society”. Is Israel a more dominant culture than Japan? Or vice-versa? What do we think? What do they think?A couple of weeks before Eurovision, Eastern dress was setting Twitter alight again, this time when a Utah teenager posted online pictures of her wearing her prom dress which was actually a qipao, traditional Chinese dress. The 18-year-old was accused of cultural appropriation and casual racism. People of Chinese heritage chimed in with arguments on both sides of the debate, with some pointing out that the outfit was originally worn by women carrying out domestic duties, and thus not something to be really celebrated, and another writing, “I’m Asian and Chinese, you looked beautiful in that dress, I’m sorry you got bashed for it.”Fashion is, of course, a highly sensitive area for cultural appropriation. The fashion shows routinely feature collections riffing off a range of global cultures. For the coming autumn, Gucci recently unveiled a series of headwear inspired by Sikh turbans. Vogue ran a photoshoot in its “Diversity Issue” last year with a model in full Japanese geisha outfit. Not unusual, and perhaps nothing wrong with it… save for in both cases (and in the Victoria’s Secret show last year in which a model flaunted a Native American-style headdress) all the models were white.Here’s where cultural appropriation smacks up against representation. Maybe if Victoria’s Secret had employed a Native American model, if Vogue had used a Japanese model, if Gucci had – as the Sikh Coalition suggested in the aftermath – used Sikh models who would have properly observed the correct way to wear what is, after all, a sacred clothing item, then the later dissemination of these items on to the high street might not be quite so problematic.There’s a difference, too, between fashion and performance. When I was very young, on a holiday at a Pontin’s camp on the North-West coast, I was wrapped in a blanket, had two stripes of lipstick put across my face, and a feather from a passing seagull taped to my head. I was entered into the fancy dress contest (I didn’t win). I was of course, a Red Indian, as Native Americans were called in those less-enlightened times.As bad as the Black and White Minstrels? Possibly. But “Red Indians” back then were almost a fictional, fairytale group of people, the image drawn from Monday matinee westerns not renowned for historical accuracy, from Peter Pan, from Hiawatha and Little Plum. Would I have dressed my children like that when they were the same age? Undoubtedly not. Times change. Sensitivities alter.And I look down at what I’m wearing right now as I type this. A T-shirt, which has its origins as an undergarment in 19th-century America. A pair of jeans, which were originally developed in Italy (Genoa, which gave rise to “jeans”) and France (the fabric of Nimes, or de Nimes, from which is derived “denim”). A pair of flip-flops (don’t judge me), evolved from the Japanese zōri which servicemen took back to America post-Second World War\u0026nbsp(though early flip-flops have been discovered in ancient Egyptian burial sites).I am a melange of styles borrowed, begged and stolen from around the world. Is this cultural appropriation, several generations down the line? Should I be wearing what my grandfathers wore? Polyester slacks and an Oxford shirt, a cardigan, brogues? Where is the line, and on which side of it are we?Music is another cultural appropriation battleground. Every time Katy Perry or Taylor Swift goes “ghetto” for another video, or Lana Del Ray puts on a Native American headdress, it’s there to see. White folks stole rock’n’roll from African rhythms filtered through the American South, we stole electronic dance music from the predominantly-black post-disco clubs of Chicago and Detroit, and Italy. Take away the cultural appropriation, and what’s left? A couple of rousing choruses of Knees Up, Mother Brown or The Lambeth Walk, perhaps.Should we talk about food? Those great British traditions such as pizza, or chow mein, or curry? A few miles from me, Bradford is awash with curry houses. The clientele is largely white. Is that cultural appropriation? Well, no, because most of the restaurants are owned and worked in by people of South Asian heritage. But what was deemed cultural appropriation was when, earlier this year, a restaurant called Fanny’s announced it was opening a venue for the purveying of “posh kebabs” in London’s Stoke Newington.The move was lambasted on Twitter because, for one, Stoke Newington is a hub for Turkish restaurants and takeaways… the people who, you know, invented the kebab. For another, because the people behind Fanny’s weren’t Turkish (one of the founders is called Claude Compton, for your information), and the tag-line “posh kebabs” intimated that these “lads from Fulham” were basically going to beat the Turks at their own game (as a side note, Fanny’s subsequently dropped the “posh” bit from their marketing and logo).If you’ve made it this far, you might be wondering where I’m heading with all this. And the honest answer is, I just don’t know. Cultural appropriation seems, on the face of it, like it should be something that all of us should fight against, but the flip-side of that is knowing exactly just what it is and when we should call it out.As I said at the top of this piece, take what I say with a pinch of salt, given that I am a middle-aged white man. But where does that leave me, if we remove years of embedded cultural appropriation? Dressed in my grandad’s clothes, listening to a 78 of George Formby classics, and clutching a chip butty? And on that score, should I be calling cultural appropriation on the New York magazine The Insider’s awestruck piece last month on a Turkish restaurant that was selling this remarkable new thing, a sandwich stuffed with fries?The answer’s no, of course, because cultural appropriation will never affect me in the way it does other, marginalised people. I have working-class roots but I’m still pretty close to the top of the privilege chain all I can realistically get away with is some faux outrage at posh kids slumming it at Wetherspoons and Greggs for Instagram likes.But maybe those who identify as white, liberal allies should hit the pause button before calling out cultural appropriation, and just take a moment to think. The obvious stuff, the outright horror of the Black and White Minstrels and the more subtle but by no means any less problematic racism, yes, by all means, dig in. Dog-piling on teenagers for wearing a prom dress, maybe hold off a bit.Cultural appropriation is a big desert, and one on which we might have to draw our own personal lines in the sand as to what we know in our guts is wrong, and what we think might be, possibly, a little bit off.And with that, I bid you sayonara.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

As Vince Cable, the Lib Dem leader, argues, Britain could have a second EU referendum before Christmas this year, giving time for a lengthy 12-week campaign starting next September.Nick Clegg puts a rather different argument. He says that Brexit should be put to a second referendum because people who voted Leave are dying off.\u0026nbspThe “high point” of support for Brexit had passed because “the oldest voters voted for Brexit in the largest numbers” while the young voted to remain in the EU.\u0026nbspMy case is that the first referendum said we should leave without specifying how. In a second referendum, the government would in effect say – here’s the deal we have negotiated... do you approve? What could be more logical? What could be more natural?\u0026nbspNothing except that Ms May has ruled out a second Brexit referendum. In February, in a typically muddled formulation, she told a conference:\u0026nbsp“We are leaving the EU and there is no question of a second referendum or going back and I think that’s important. People in the UK feel very strongly that if we take a decision, then governments should turn not round and say, no, you got that wrong.” But if anybody is going to say, “you got that wrong”, it wouldn’t be the government but rather the people saying to the prime minister that she got wrong the exit terms she negotiated.\u0026nbspThat is what Ms May doesn’t like about the notion of a second referendum.In fact, there is a strong case for holding a second referendum. Since 23 June 2016, the date of the first referendum, we have learnt quite a few things we didn’t know before. Business chiefs, for instance, are worried about the time-wasting bureaucracy of filling in customs declarations after Brexit takes place. That is what a hard border would mean.As to the Brexiteers’ notion that technology could be used to avoid this, Jon Thompson, chief executive of HM Revenue and\u0026nbspCustoms, delivered a stark verdict\u0026nbspwhen he appeared before the Treasury Committee.\u0026nbspThe cost to business of introducing a high-tech customs plan would be up to £20bn a year, he said. That is a frighteningly high price to pay.\u0026nbspWhen we cast our referendum vote, we also hadn’t thought about complex procedures such as car assembly. As a car chassis moves along the production line, components from all over Europe are put into their appointed places. If this is taking place in a British car plant, then many of the components will have come from the continent. If the plant is on the other side of the Channel, then many British-made parts will have had to have been shipped across. In fact, more than two-thirds of the UK’s exports to the EU take the form of intermediate inputs to the production of finished goods and services. Likewise, about 55 per cent of imports from the EU represent products to be incorporated in final production in the UK. If all this were to be subject to customs clearance, then the whole series of complex procedures would come to a halt.No wonder the prospect of Brexit is already having a negative effect on economic activity. As the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, an intergovernmental economic organisation, commented this week: “Economic growth is projected to remain modest at 1.4 per cent in 2018 and 1.3 per cent in 2019, owing to high uncertainties about the outcome of Brexit negotiations.”\u0026nbspThis is about half the rate of growth being experienced by the rest of Europe. Did we know that Brexit would condemn Britain to reduced economic activity?In short, we need a second referendum because we know much more about the disadvantages of leaving the European Union that we did when we were first asked. Moreover, in Ms May we have a prime minister who cannot make up her mind about anything. The Financial Times put this point strongly on 17 May: “It has been 693 days since Britain voted to leave the EU. In another 316, that decision is set to become reality. Yet the government of Theresa May has still not come to an agreement – either with itself or with Brussels – on what the new economic relationship with the continent should be. This was the most basic question raised by Brexit, and it should have been answered before Article 50 was triggered, setting in motion withdrawal.\u0026nbspFailure to do so is testament to political isions and weak leadership.”\u0026nbspSo we shall have to make up Ms\u0026nbspMay’s mind for her.So, in light of this muddle and confusion, what question would be put in a second referendum?\u0026nbspIn the 2016 referendum the question was\u0026nbspshould the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?\u0026nbspIn effect, this formulation called for an answer from the gut. Like it or leave it? But in a second referendum, this luxury would not be available.\u0026nbspThere would have to be reference to the terms of disengagement covering such crucial questions as whether the UK would remain a member of some kind of customs union.\u0026nbspAs it is hard to get such detail into a simple question, I suggest the following:Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave on such terms as approved by parliament?\u0026nbspIn addition, a simple version of the terms approved by parliament could be sent to every voter and could be made available in voting stations.This would have the merit of emphasising that parliament is the supreme decision-making body in this country. However, as a Remainer, I must remember a key rule about asking questions – never ask one when you might not like the answer. How likely is it that the answer to a second referendum might differ from the first? Remember that voters are likely to be hostile to the holding of a second referendum. They may think – you have asked us once, we gave you an answer, don’t bother us again. With the result that the turnout for a second referendum would likely be low and thus unconvincing.However, Peter Kellner, the experienced political commentator and former president of YouGov, has just published a much more upbeat appraisal.\u0026nbspHe believes that below the surface, public opinion is stirring. In particular, one million Labour voters who backed Brexit two years ago are having second thoughts. His study of recent polling results convinces him that significant numbers of younger Leave voters, as well as those supporting Labour in last year’s election, no longer think Brexit is right for Britain. He also supports the Nick Clegg thesis and argues that the effects of demographic changes since the referendum are growing. “Bluntly,”\u0026nbspas he writes, “older, mainly Leave, voters are dying and younger, mainly Remain, voters are joining the electorate.”Mr Kellner bases his findings in the more than 23,000 voters that YouGov has questioned since the start of the year.\u0026nbspAnd his conclusion is that there is a real prospect that if the people were given the final say on Brexit, they would vote for the UK to stay in the European Union. So let’s have a second referendum.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

One was so long ago that engraving had to do the job of photography the other was recent enough that some people alive today will have heard about it from their parents. In one, a foreign ship came to grief in British waters in the other, a British vessel went down in foreign waters, and down she stayed.First to Texel, safe haven, population 13,500: the largest of the West Frisian Islands off the coast of the Netherlands in the Wadden Sea. Today it is a magnet for Dutch cyclists, walkers, swimmers and riders (the latter an important reminder that Texel is the only known place where an entire navy was defeated by men on horseback, which is another tale altogether).In June 1743, a 700 ton vessel, VOC Hollandia, set sail on her maiden voyage bound for Batavia, the capital of the Dutch East Indies, now known as Jakarta. In any study of trade between Europe and Asia throughout the 17th and 18th centuries, the Dutch East India Company is pivotal, shipping everything from nutmegs and cinnamon to coffee and tobacco, porcelain to rubber. And that is what VOC stands for: Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie.A brief history of democracy: Is it the \u0027will of the people\u0027?Yet on this prestigious occasion, Hollandia, being of brand new and bold design, an impressive 42 metres in length, was carrying a particularly special cargo: not only many VIP passengers but also 130,000 coins. Most were “pillar-dollars”, cut to represent smaller denominations, but among the haul were also highly valuable Mexican and Guatemalan silver coins.Hollandia’s captain must have been nervous therefore, as he headed for Brittany through rough seas. Perhaps he was aware too that just 36 years before, in 1707, at least 1,550 men had perished in the same waters, haplessly drifting towards the Scillies aboard four Royal Navy warships: the Firebrand, the Romney, the Association and the Eagle. (Indeed, square mile for square mile, the treacherous Scillies are probably responsible for more of the world’s estimated 159,000 shipwrecks than anywhere else.)Remember, these were the days before the invention of reliable navigation instruments still before the erection of most lighthouses.Texel is now a popular tourist venueSure enough, like those earlier ships, the Hollandia was blown off course, scarcely six weeks after setting sail, on a blustery 13 July. And it too came to grief off the Isles of Scilly, striking the notorious Gunner Rock, going down just off Annet, an uninhabited nature reserve just 54 acres in size, 20 miles from the Cornish coast.Nobody lived to tell the tale.Miraculously, in 1971 a London attorney called Rex Cowan discovered the Hollandia’s wreck, along with its bronze cannons and some of its treasure. Unusually, he was using a proton magnetometer, allowing him to test the Earth’s field of magnetic resonance, which in the process reveals every slight variation across that field – including ferrous objects embedded in land or sea.However, it is now time to turn to the anniversary of a sinking far further away and to consider the watery grave awaiting an equally emblematic vessel. This was a calamity that was far more preventable.Many boats have come a cropper in the waters around the Scilly Isles (iStock)State of the art flagship and battleship, the HMS Victoria – named in named in honour of the Queen’s impending Golden Jubilee in 1886 – was launched at a cost of £845 from Elswick on the Tyne. When she headed for the Mediterranean in June 1893 for training exercises, she had already endured one major mishap – a grounding at Platea, off the Greek coast, with Captain Maurice Archibald Bourke having permitted members of his crew to misplace the buoys that might have saved him from some very shallow waters.On that first cataclysmic day, 29 January 1892, no full tide – indeed nothing at all – would get the extraordinarily long (100 metres), extraordinarily heavy (11,200 tons) Victoria afloat again. Jettisoning 483 tons of coal, and calling for a tow from three other Royal Navy frigates, somehow the Victoria – its bottom damaged, three of its compartments seriously damaged – resumed its voyage on 4 February, limping into the new Hamilton Dock, Malta, for repairs. Bourke, despite being severely censured, retained his command.  HMS Victoria in dock, prior to completionAt the dawn of a second catastrophic day, 22 June 1893, Bourke and his contemporaries, among them Captain Jenkins on the Collingwood and Captain Markham on the Camperdown, were lined up like tin soldiers ready for an experimental manoeuvre – a very tight one at that. It was their misfortune to be in the hands of Vice Admiral Sir George Tryon, Commander of the British Mediterranean fleet: an obstinate, overbearing man with some very peculiar traits and strategies.Tryon was deliberately taciturn and unapproachable – the better, he thought, to assert the superiority of his rank. The better too to outdo “inferior” French and Italian navies also cruising the vital Mediterranean and the better to force his officers to think on their feet.Inexplicably – and at a time when signalling remained primitive, based as it was on a mixture of flags, semaphores and lamps – Tryon wanted the two columns of his fleet to turn, uniformly, a full 180 degrees, first towards each other then (so the theory went) retracing their prior course. His 11 Captains – with Tryon himself menacingly aboard the Victoria – were to do this whilst positioned a mere 1,100 or 1,200 metres from each other, even though a gap of 1,800-2,200 metres might have been considered a safe bare minimum.Markham hesitated. Surely Tryon had confused radii for diameters? Surely he had issued the sort of order likely to be revoked any minute? Perhaps Tryon really intended the convoy to turn 60 degrees to port, then 60 degrees to starboard, before resuming its original course?Tryon however, was getting impatient. Fearing humiliation – his colleagues also hesitant to defy their esteemed commander – Markham aboard the Camperdown conceded, swinging towards the fated Victoria, despite believing he cannot avoid hitting her.  Even so, the Victoria – built before the installation of automatic bulkhead doors – has many proven stabilisers. Perhaps Bourke is a more gifted captain than he has previously demonstrated?At the last, both lead vessels went straight into reverse thrust. But it was all too late.Vice Admiral Sir George Tryon was a difficult man insofar as his junior colleagues were concernedThe toughened steel ram of the Camperdown tore 9 feet into the side of the Victoria, a full 12 feet below its waterline. After two minutes the two vessels disengage but the Victoria lists, her many gun hatches and portholes taking in floods of swirling water.Three minutes later, her bow dips – but an unrelenting Tryon demands any rescue boats return to their respective ships. Now he commands the leaking Victoria to head straight for the shores of Tripoli, five miles distant. After all, the Victoria’s engines are still running, many men below deck unharmed.Maybe Tryon trusts that the “watertight” doors are still closed, so trapping many hands not already flushed into the ocean. Rapidly though, certainly by collision plus eight minutes, the whole of the Victoria’s bow is submerged, its stern far out of true, propellers turning in open air.At last, but way too late, Tryon yells: “Abandon ship! Everyone for himself!”  Five minutes on, the top deck goes under. Loosened boilers explode. Everything remotely portable bounces into the already hazardous surrounding ocean.Two men on board refuse to jump ship: Reverend SD Morris, the chaplain on duty in the sick bay, who folds his arms across his chest, closes his eyes and says a final prayer and Tryon himself, in time honoured tradition, going down on his watch, muttering: “this is entirely my doing, entirely my fault”.HMS Victoria disappears beneath the Mediterranean’s surfaceBourke – fitter and quicker than his superior – does, with great difficulty, make his escape. A distinguished fellow-escapee is the fevered John Jellicoe, one day himself to be promoted to commander-in-chief of the British Grand Fleet and dispatched to confront a detachment of the German navy off Jutland.Staff Commander Thomas Hawkins-Smith, one of Tryon’s most vocal critics, also survives by clinging on to rigging.\u0027Made in China’ label helps archaeologists solve 800-year-old mysteryIn total, 358 of Victoria’s complement perished, coincidentally the same number as those believed to have been saved. Six bodies only were taken ashore, along with 173 men injured during the tumult. Jenkins on the Collingwood unarguably rescued more people than any other captain on duty – mainly due to his not recalling his lifeboats.The stricken Camperdown, despite taking 90 minutes to effect partial water resistance, partial stability, somehow managed to keep going, battered, but without loss of life.Back in England, reliable news was scarce. Only Markham’s telegram listing 22 surviving officers was to hand and so thousands of anxious friends and relatives milled round the Admiralty.Anger and sorrow rapidly give way to philanthropy. Within three weeks, a remarkable distress fund of £50,000 was raised for Victoria widows and orphans – the equivalent of more than £5m today.John Jellicoe survived HMS Victoria’s sinking and went on to become Commander-in-Chief of the British Grand FleetDebates raged about whether there should be a public inquiry into the disaster some argued that would hand too many secrets of British seamanship to her enemies. A court martial was opened – Bourke’s second – with reporters allowed to witness some of the proceedings. Bourke requested that any captain sistering the Victoria was exempted as a judge.In the dock, Bourke kept referring to navy ships as if they were on a highway, obeying “rules of the road”. But the very concept of obedience troubled the chief investigator, Sir Michael Culme-Seymour – “a safe pair of hands” – throughout his deliberations.It appeared to be common ground that Markham on the Camperdown should have followed his first instinct and aborted the manoeuvre. But then, had there not been a collision, Markham would have been hauled over the coals for insubordination.Tryon actually gave his orders in person ignoring them was extremely difficult, however foolish and foolhardy they were.HMS Camperdown was commissioned at Portsmouth in 1889Culme-Seymour himself had to walk a tightrope: avoiding any hint at a precedent for altering (let alone ignoring) instructions from above. Tryon’s mental health was queried. Perhaps he was suffering from a brain disease, dementia, when he sent the Victoria to its doom?In the end, Bourke came out best, his reputation undiminished. Markham, meanwhile, was censured almost as much as his flag captain, Charles Johnstone. Both could have acted differently at different stages in the unfolding catastrophe. Markham was stripped of his command, his pay halved, and relegated to minor duties. He died early, aged 65, in 1906.Crucially, Tryon’s philosophy of seamanship was abandoned, history not permitted to be kind to his memory. Of the engaged fleet formation only a repaired Camperdown was still being tossed by high seas in 1898.Like the Hollandia, the Victoria’s wreckage lay undiscovered for a long time. Not until 111 years and two months later, on 22 August 2004, was the ship found, by Austrian-Lebanese er Christian Francis, assisted by British explorer Mark Ellyatt. It was positioned almost vertically, 140 metres below their search vessel. They concluded that a full 30 metres of the Victoria’s bow had buried itself in the seabed.Our fascination with the ocean is ceaseless (PA)Three intriguing footnotes to the sinking of the Victoria continue to tantalise. First, it has long been the legend that, at the very moment of inevitable collision between the Victoria and the Camperdown, Mrs Tryon was hosting a party in her London mansion, when Commander Tryon himself, but ghostlike, descended the staircase to join festivities.Second, one of Tryon’s hobbies was collecting memorabilia connected to his hero, Horatio Nelson. In 2012, Ellyat temporarily retrieved Nelson’s sword from Tryon’s cabin but, unsure what to do with this precious artefact, he hid the discovery in a different part of the wreck where it abides till this day.Third, is the very title “Victoria” fated? After all, it was the MV Princess Victoria, a British Railways’ roll-on, roll-off ferry that sank on its passage from Larne to Stranraer, on 31 January 1953, costing 133 lives (at the start of the weekend of the great Lincolnshire floods, which left many people drowned across East Anglia and the Low Countries).How Chad’s killing fields have been turned into an elephants’ havenHow crowdfunding is enabling indie talent to create graphic novelsWhy women in South Africa are carrying the burden of HIVAnd barely six weeks after that terrible storm, a reordered SS Victoria also sank, this time striking rocks – just as the Hollandia did.Why, though, recognise the anniversary of any ship’s demise when there are no living survivors and nothing to add to any inquest? Well, the lure of the sea still captivates and enchants even the most landlocked of the general population.Despite all its dangers – because of all its dangers – the sea is where many of us are most alive.Isles of Scillyor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Since 1816 they have been housed in the British Museum.Their status has long been hotly disputed. Greece, which for decades has called for their return, with several formal requests, has also in the past threatened legal action and proposed solutions such as mediation by Unesco.Lord Elgin insisted he had permission to take the sculptures, saying he had the permission of officials of the ruling Ottoman empire, and that he was worried about their being damaged.Opponents of their removal from London say that the move would pave the way for requests from other countries for artworks in British museums to returned.Supporters of the Greek position argue that the Ottoman authorities were a foreign force and had no right to let the artefacts go.Ta Nea reported: “In the exclusive interview given to Nea, Jeremy Corbyn agrees that, if elected, he will begin the return of the Parthenon sculptures to our country.”Mr Corbyn reportedly said: “They were made in Greece and have been there for many centuries until Lord Elgin took them.“As with anything stolen or taken from occupied or colonial possession – including artefacts looted from other countries in the past – we should be engaged in constructive talks with the Greek government about returning the sculptures.”Mr Corbyn has long been a supporter of the marbles’ repatriation but this is the first time as party leader that he has made his intent so clear.The UK government’s position is that the ownership of the sculptures is a matter for the trustees of the British Museum, according to a House of Commons briefing paper.The British Museum website says: “The Acropolis Museum allows the Parthenon sculptures that are in Athens to be appreciated against the backdrop of ancient Greek and Athenian history. This display does not alter the trustees’ view that the sculptures are part of everyone’s shared heritage and transcend cultural boundaries. The trustees remain convinced that the current ision allows different and complementary stories to be told about the surviving sculptures.”It says the British Museum Act 1963 bans the trustees from permanently disposing of objects unless they are duplicates of others already in the collection or are “unfit to be retained ... and can be disposed of without detriment to the interests of students”.A Labour spokesperson said Mr Corbyn was stating his long-standing personal view and that he was right to call for constructive talks.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

At the time, it was reported that a new solution would be ready by March 2019, but the timetable appears to have slipped again, with no date now set for completion.Former transport secretary Lord Adonis said the government’s planning had been “ostrich-like”, while a spokesperson for Highways England said they would attempt to avoid disruption.If Britain cannot reach a deal with the European Union it will crash out in March 2019 with no transition period and will immediately face customs checks and paperwork for the millions of trucks that pour off ferries and Channel Tunnel shuttles every year.In recent weeks the Department for Transport unveiled contingency plans to convert part of the M20 motorway carriageway into a lorry park as a temporary stopgap – causing huge disruption to motorists and freight.The threat of a no deal\u0026nbspis looming larger than ever in Brussels, with no significant progress for months, issues thought to be settled in December rearing their heads again, and EU officials describing the UK’s approach as “fantasy”.Lord Adonis, a supporter for the Best For Britain anti-Brexit campaign, told The Independent that Britain was being left “dangerously vulnerable” by the government’s lack of preparations.“This failure to invest in – or prepare for – Brexit is emblematic of a government that seems incapable of taking its own policies seriously,” he said.“These delays may well end up causing queues of lorries for miles and miles, clogging up Kent and beyond and causing shortages of goods in our supermarkets.“This is just one of a number of areas where the government’s ostrich-like behaviour is leaving Britain dangerously vulnerable. I have just visited Rotterdam to see for myself the chaos that Brexit will cause our international trade.”Though Brexiteers have been keen to stress that they are leaving the EU rather than Europe, there are a number of major physical changes that will be need to be made in time for the UK’s departure whether or not a deal is reached.Theresa May has ruled out membership of the single market and customs union, meaning traders will face customs and regulatory checks upon entering the UK from Europe. This will require the expansion of physical infrastructure at ports and airports. Though the government wants a two-year transition period to give it time to prepare for Brexit, there will be none in the event of a “no deal”.As part of the preparations, the Highways Agency says it wants to “develop one or more lorry-holding areas to reduce the congestion in Kent caused by cross-Channel disruption”, with the M20 and M2 motorways into Dover the focus of expansion.\u0026nbspThe new infrastructure is at the very early planning stage, however.The Highways Agency does not mention Brexit in its consultation document on the new lorry parks, referring euphemistically instead to “disruptive events” that could cause them to be needed.Road infrastructure in the region already regularly goes over capacity in the event of poor weather or industrial action, and Kent Police have developed an approach called Operation Stack where part of the M20 motorway is converted into a temporary lorry park. The procedure has been implemented dozens of times in the last few decades.As well as the planned construction work on the south coast, the Home Office also revealed at the end of March that it was facing the task of recruiting an extra 1,000 border staff for Brexit.Other countries that see a lot of trade with Britain are also making similar preparations. The Netherlands is recruiting over 700 customs officers for the port of Rotterdam and Schipol airport, major hubs that connect the UK to world markets. The port of Rotterdam itself predicts 9km of traffic jams on its side of the channel in the event of a “no deal” scenario.A consultation document drawn up by the Highways Agency says: “Forecasts tell us that trafﬁc is expected to increase on the M20A20 and M2A2. The number of lorries travelling to and from the Kent ports is also expected to increase significantly.“Since severe weather, equipment failure and other disruptive events can never be completely avoided, the risk is that Operation Stack will be implemented more frequently if action is not taken. Without action, the safety and journey time reliability of everybody using the motorways, major and local roads in Kent is likely to be affected.”A Highways England spokesperson said: “We are clear that the disruption that people in Kent suffered in summer 2015 should never happen again.“We are starting a public information exercise soon which will take a completely fresh look at long term solutions for Operation Stack and will ask people living, travelling and working in Kent for their views on what they’d like to see. The date these measures will be in place will depend on what option is chosen.“In the meantime, we are taking steps to increase the resilience of the road network, including a contraflow on the M20 which will be available for use early next year. This will increase the options available if there is the need to deal with any potential disruption.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The approach on services therefore should be about managing ergence.”Ministers are under pressure to come up with some commonly agreed proposals that are acceptable to Brussels by the European Council summit meeting towards the end of the month.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

In most circumstances, if\u0026nbspone dies, quits or\u0026nbspretires then the successor is voted for by members of their own party.Analysis by the Electoral Reform Society (ERS) found that the average electorate for normal hereditary by-election\u0026nbspis only 32 voters, with only 29 people usually turning out.The group\u0026nbspfound that four by-elections had more candidates than electors in recent years – including a by-election for Labour hereditary peers with\u0026nbsp11 candidates and only three voters.Some 3,190 votes have been cast in the last 32 by-elections, which began in 2003, compared to the last 32 Commons by-elections, where 931,725 votes have been cast.ERS chief executive\u0026nbspDarren Hughes\u0026nbspsaid: “These so-called by-elections are an undemocratic farce – and make mockery of our democracy.“This time, around 25 peers are set to decide which aristocrat remains in parliament to vote on our laws, for the rest of their lives. “That is not democracy – and it’s time we ended this bizarre hangover from feudal times. \u0026nbsp“It’s vital for trust and faith in our democracy that the forthcoming farce of a by-election – brought about by the retirement of Earl Baldwin of Bewdley – will be the last. “The public should decide who votes on our laws – not a tiny clique of aristocrats.”Labour peer Lord Grocott\u0026nbspis trying to axe the by-elections through a private members’ bill but his efforts were blocked by a handful of hereditary peers in March.However,\u0026nbspConservative frontbencher Lord Young of Cookham\u0026nbspsaid the government “will not obstruct” his bill and offered it more parliamentary time.Lord Grocott\u0026nbsptold The Independent:\u0026nbsp“These were only supposed to be a temporary measure but it’s now gone on for 19 years.“There have been 32 hereditary by-elections, so I mean that’s a third of all hereditary peers who have been replaced. It’s ridiculous.“You have this situation where the government is trying to reduce the size of the Lords and the House of Commons but you have 92 peers who cannot be touched.”Only one woman is eligible to stand in the upcoming by-election out of more than 200 candidates, and just 31 peers will be able to vote, according to a written parliamentary question to Lord Grocott.The poll will also cost taxpayers more than £1,140 to stage.Liberal Democrat MP Tom Brake said the issue was “another reminder of how archaic, undemocratic and outdated” the Lords is.“Liberal Democrats have long argued for an elected upper chamber, but sadly attempts to introduce reform were thwarted by the self-interest of the other two parties,” he said.\u0026nbsp“Isn’t it ironic, however, that murmurs from the Tories have changed in recent weeks as a result of the Lords defeating them on the EU Withdrawal Bill on fifteen occasions?”Lord Fowler, the Lords speaker, has welcomed efforts to slash the size of the upper chamber\u0026nbspafter a key Lords committee\u0026nbsprecommended limiting any peer’s term to 15 years and adopting a new “two-out, one in” system to accelerate a reduction in numbers.\u0026nbspA Lords spokesperson said:\u0026nbsp“The House of Lords recognises the need for reform and, following a report from the Lord Speaker’s committee on the size of the house in October 2017, showed overwhelming\u0026nbspsupport for reducing and capping the size of the house, and for linking new appointments to general election results.”It comes after\u0026nbspTheresa May\u0026nbspwas\u0026nbspaccused of\u0026nbsp“hypocrisy” after appointing nine new Tory peers to the House of Lords, including several ex-ministers, despite promising that senior politicians would not receive automatic ennoblement.Her announcement coincided with the eve of the royal wedding between the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, prompting claims that the prime minister had tried to\u0026nbspsneak out the news when it would receive little attention.Candidates for the upcoming by-election will be announced on 15 June, with the count on 4 July.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Certainly, opening bank accounts, and whether you can or cannot as an illegal immigrant, I’m not sure that the data that we have is accurate enough so I have suspended that for the time being.”However, he said he still wanted to maintain a distinction between welcoming people in the UK who are here legally and not tolerating illegal immigration.Mr Javid also said that overall net migration is still too high and needs to be addressed by policies to bring it down to a sustainable level.Asked if the “tens of thousands” was still a commitment he was happy with, he said: “It is a commitment in our manifesto … we are happy with our manifesto.”Earlier this week, Ms Davidson doubled down on her call for the “tens of thousands” target to be scrapped.She said in a speech: “I see neither the sense nor the need to stick to an immigration figure devised nearly a decade ago, which has never been met and does not fit the requirements of the country.“Setting an immigration target reduced to the tens of thousands is one thing when unemployment is running at 8 per cent. Refusing to review it when the country nears full employment and sectors are reporting skills shortages is quite another.”The Independent, along with the Open Britain group,\u0026nbsphas been running the Drop the Target campaign to scrap the “tens of thousands” net migration policy.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Organisers say Tibet’s involvement has been met with considerable oppositionWhen the Fifa World Cup kicks off less than two weeks from now, the top prize at stake is not really going to be the token £29m handed to the winner, but an unquantifiable sense of national pride.And although it may feel a million miles away from Russia’s 81,000-capacity Luzhniki Stadium, pride is also the most important factor at the rival World Football Cup which began this weekend across a number of little-known non-league grounds orbiting London.Sixteen “members” are taking part in the 10-day tournament run by Conifa, the Confederation of Independent Football Associations, offering a platform for oppressed regions and unrecognised breakaway states that, for one reason or another, have been rejected for membership by Fifa itself. The question is, can their pride be classified as “national”?Conifa has\u0026nbspbeen running the World Football Cup roughly once every two years since 2013, but this year’s tournament is comfortably the biggest.Thursday’s opening match day also boasted some high-profile names – former Premier League referee Mark Clattenburg officiated the first game, former Major League Soccer star James Riley captained a team from the North American “bioregion” Cascadia and there’s a team representing the Ndebele people of\u0026nbspZimbabwe that is coached by former Liverpool goalkeeper Bruce Grobbelaar.Yet the real stars of the show, and the ones who have proved most controversial, are a team from Tibet. Dispatched to the earthly confines of Enfield and Sutton with a blessing from the Dalai Lama himself, they have been ordered by His Holiness to conduct themselves with “compassion” and “uphold the honour and dignity of the Tibetan people”.That won’t mean pulling out of any 50-50 tackles, the team’s manager Passang Dorjee tells The Independent. But it does bring with it a sense of responsibility to provide “an example for the whole world to see” of what Tibet can achieve when it stands on its own.The Tibet team were\u0026nbsphanded a wildcard to appear at this year’s competition by the organisers, and face an uphill struggle to get out of Group B. They were beaten 3-0 on Thursday\u0026nbspat Enfield Town’s Queen Elizabeth II Stadium by the reigning 2016 champions Abkhazia, a Russia-backed disputed territory in northwestern Georgia. Two more challenges await over the course of the weekend in the form of Northern Cyprus – the Turkish part of the island – and Karpatalya, a Hungarian-speaking enclave of central Europe.But they are the definition of the plucky and popular underdog, boasting an impressive number of supporters and leading out the opening ceremony procession.None of them actually live in the Chinese-administered region that they are in London to represent – Dorjee explains that “because of the political situation, there was no hope at all that Tibetans could come out of Tibet to play in this kind of thing”. The Chinese, he says, are “very strict about who goes in and who comes out”, and those who did play would never be allowed to go back home.Their players come instead from the Tibetan diaspora, most from the mountainous regions of India, Nepal and Bhutan but also some from North America, Europe and two from the UK.While a good number attended the blessing by the Dalai Lama at\u0026nbsphis home in India, the first time the full squad met up and trained together was in London, a week before their first match in the cup.Just having Tibet at the World Football Cup is enough to ruffle feathers, the organisers say. Paul Watson, Conifa’s director, says they had several international brands lined up to provide sponsorship into the six figures until, one by one and,\u0026nbsphe suggests, at China’s behest,\u0026nbspthey asked for Tibet to be kicked out. Only Paddy Power, the bookmaker not alien to controversy itself, remained as the main sponsor.It made financing the competition “really difficult”, Watson told Sky Sports. “People are scared to sponsor an event like this because they’re afraid of offending China.”But, the team’s manager Dorjee stresses,\u0026nbspthe Tibetan football team was not calling for the region to have full independence from China, but rather to be granted more autonomy and have its people’s rights observed.Tibet are not the only participants to come up against opposition. The organisers claim the (Greek) Cypriot government wrote to every council hosting matches – even those where Northern Cyprus were not scheduled to play – telling them they should withdraw from the tournament.But for the players, even at this most unusual and geopolitically charged event, the sport rises above politics.Tenzin Nyendak is one of the two British members of the Tibet squad. The 30-year-old centre-half moved to the UK nine years ago from Bylakuppe, a town in southern India with a Tibetan diaspora second only to Dharamsala – where the Dalai Lama lives.He has never actually played for a league club in London, but as one of the stars of London Tibetan Football Club has travelled across Europe to compete against other teams of Tibetans in exile.Nyendak tells The Independent it is “a privilege to be part of the national team squad… I am really proud to represent Tibet globally.”He says that football is the closest thing Tibetans have to a national sport, and he believes the team will be backed “by all Tibetans, in and outside Tibet”. Unable to travel from London, he was disappointed to miss out on the pre-tournament audience with the Dalai Lama – who has said in the past that he enjoys watching football when he can.Yet in spite of all that, Nyendak would not be drawn on what his manager referred to as the “political situation”. “We take it as a sporting event, we don’t want to involve football with politics,” he says.“We came here to play. Playing football and winning the tournament are the only objectives we have.”Tibet’s chances of proceeding to the knockout stages of the cup, let alone winning it, will depend much on their result against Northern Cyprus, again in Enfield, on Saturday evening.Either way, it won’t matter too much to their manager, Dorjee.“We are just proud to get this golden opportunity to represent Tibet at Conifa,” he says. “When we hear our national anthem, and we can see our national flags flying in the ground, it makes us realise we have already achieved a lot.“Winning and losing is not important. The important thing is to say that we are here, we Tibetans can also play football, and to show that we have equality.”Tibet lost 3-1 to Northern Cyprus in Saturday\u0027s matchor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

It says the programme is carried out in accordance with the International Convention for Regulation of Whaling.“Whales are already facing substantial threats including bycatch in fisheries and marine pollution,” Ms Wellbelove said. ”Significant conservation efforts are underway worldwide to address these issues, so the least Japan could do is put away the harpoons.“The continued killing of any whales is abhorrent to modern society, but these new figures make it even more shocking. We look forward to Australia and other pro-conservation countries sending the strongest possible message to Japan that it should stop its lethal whaling programme.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

No one else. Nothing else.What is sometimes hard for the British to understand is that we don\u0027t want to negotiate, we don\u0027t want to compromise on who we are.They want to leave, it is their choice to leave.In an astonishing rant, he added: It\u0027s not only about negotiating between officials in Brussels or London, it\u0027s about the people, about the business, about the stakeholders.                Brexit news: EU ready to REJECT next UK plan for Irish \u0027buffer zone\u0027So I think that this negotiation cannot be secret.Mr Barnier questioned UK\u0027s relationship with the EU post-Brexit, saying he had no certainty about their future relations.He added: My work is not finished.The first step is setting the terms of this orce.But the most important thing is our future relationship, which will last for many years, that\u0027s the important part.Right now, I have no certainty.I can see the difficulty and the intensity of this debate.Michel Barnier has refused to negotiate UK\u0027s Brexit terms any furtherWe\u0027re waiting for the British to have clear positions and choices.This is their decision to leave, which creates the issue.Mr Barnier dismissed all UK\u0027s Brexit proposals as unacceptable, declaring that Mrs May\u0027s plans for a customs arrangement with the EU - a customs partnership or Max Fac alternative - was not possible.During a meeting with members of the EU\u0027s Brexit steeering group, he said: Given the rather volatile British political situation, I recommend that we remain very united and clear about our objectives and principles.They have two proposals which are being debated with British minsters.Mr Barnier, EU Brexit chief negotiator, said he will not compromise on EU\u0027s Brexit termsNeither of those proposals are operational or acceptable to us.In the video, Roberto Gualtieri, Italian MEP, member of EU\u0027s Brexit steering group agreed with the EU Brexit chief negotiator, replied: Indeed, I agree with you that the two options on customs are totally unacceptable.Mr Barnier said: This is their red lines, not our red lines.It\u0027s a daily job, evaluating technical issues, legal issues, financial and economic issues, which were made by Britain\u0027s decision.When we worked with the British delegation on the draft treaty, we worked, the whole team worked, three days and two nights in full.Mr Barnier said he has no certainty on UK and EU\u0027s future relationshipIt wasn\u0027t easy. That\u0027s a lot of stress.The main document from now until October is this draft treaty.\u0026nbspMr Barnier then displayed a thick booklet with many papers, mostly highlighted green.He continued: About 75 percent of the text now, we are in the green and the rest, the 25 percent, this is the hardest part, the most risky.If it\u0027s a no deal, there is no transition, that\u0027s the cliff edge.David Davis meets EU\u0027s chief negotiator Michel Barnier in Brussels ahead of a crunch meeting of European Union leaders later this week                    AFPGetty Images1 of 10British Brexit minister David Davis (L) and EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier meet at the European Commission in BrusselsThat means problems for everyone.To get the approval of the parliament you must not wait for the end of the ruling process.You have to build every day, all along the roads, all along the process, you have to build the trust.This is their decision to leave, which creates the issue."},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/139/590x/Jeremy-Corbyn-968991.jpg","title":"Jeremy Corbyn Elgin Marbles Greece vows return sculptures Prime Minister Labour","story":"Jeremy Corbyn has declared he will return the Elgin Marbles to Greece if he becomes Prime MinisterThe Labour leader has long campaigned for the return of the Elgin Marbles to Greece, and declared in a 2014 debate in the Houses of Parliament that the items had been \u0026ldquostolen.Speaking with the Greek newspaper Ta Nea, Mr Corbyn said: \u0026ldquoIt is very clear to me that the Parthenon Sculptures belong to Greece.\u0026ldquoThey were made in Greece and that is where they were for thousands of years until they were taken by Lord Elgin.Pointing to the UK\u0026rsquos colonialist past, he added: \u0026ldquoAs with everything stolen or removed from a country that was in the possession or colony - including objects looted from other countries in the past - we should also begin constructive talks with the Greek government on the return of the sculptures.                Labour MPs sign for second referendum in bid to cancel Brexit                 Inside Politics: Tory wets face up to BrexiteersThe Elgin Marbles were removed from the Parthenon by Lord Elgin between 1799 and 1810He concluded he would commence \u0026ldquoconstructive talks with the Greek government to begin the process of returning the artefacts upon entering Downing Street.A Labour spokesman commented on Mr Corbyn\u0026rsquos statements, saying: Jeremy was stating his long-standing personal view that the Parthenon statues were made in and belong to Greece.The Elgin marbles are an emotive issue and it is in the interests of both Britain and Greece to have a constructive dialogue about them, which represents all views.Jeremy was right to call for constructive talks between the UK and Greek governments.The UK Government has claimed the ownership of the sculptures is a matter for the British museumThe sculptures were removed by Lord Elgin from the Parthenon at the top of the Acropolis in Athens and brought to the UK between 1799 and 1810 after obtaining permission from the Ottoman Empire which ruled Greece at the time.The Greek government has made formal applications to the UK for the sculptures to be returned, and have argued the Ottomans had no legal right to sanction their removal.Yet numerous MPs and academics believe the acquisition of the sculptures was legal and argue they have contributed greatly to the education of the British public.A Government source slated Mr Corbyn\u0026rsquos statements, saying: \u0026ldquoWe don\u0026rsquot share the anti-historic views that Mr Corbyn and others have on the left, which is that you should disavow yourself of everything that has happened in your country\u0026rsquos history, whether you were responsible for it or not.\u0026ldquoYou might as well say to any foreign country that wanted to: come and bring your removal trucks to the national museums and strip them out.The Government\u0026rsquos position on the issue was outlined in a briefing paper published in June 2017, which noted: \u0026ldquoThe Government\u0026rsquos position continues to be that \u0026lsquoissues relating to the ownership and management of the Parthenon sculptures are matters for the trustees of the British Museum\u0026rsquo.However the British Museum has indicated the return of the sculptures remains highly unlikely.They wrote: The trustees hold the whole of the British Museum collection under the terms of the British Museum Act 1963, for the benefit of the public.This legislation prohibits the trustees from permanently disposing of objects unless they are duplicates of others already in the collection or are \u0027unfit to be retained and can be disposed of without detriment to the interests of students\u0027."},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/106/590x/the-queen-the-queen-food-royal-family-her-majesty-the-queen-favourite-food-queen-Elizabeth-royal-chef-royals-968673.jpg","title":"queen

Because 17.4million of us voted to leave, to take back control of our money, our laws and our borders.Before the referendum vote, Parliament decided — quite rightly — that the British people had the right to decide whether we should leave the EU.That is why Parliament passed the Referendum Act and voted to trigger Article 50.And it is why both major political parties agreed in last year’s general election to abide by the referendum decision.Liam Fox says Britain has proved the doubters wrongThere is also great strength in the UK economy that should give us reassurance as we move towards a more independent future.Remember the dire consequences predicted if the British people decided to vote to leave? We were told investors would desert us.What happened?Last year we landed more inward investment projects than ever before, a vote of confidence from the international financial community.We were told we would face an employment crisis.What happened?Employment is up by 600,000 since before the referendum to 32.34million, with record numbers in work.Our manufacturing order books are at their highest for years and our exports have risen by about ten per cent in the past year.Remember how jobs would flood out of the City of London to Paris and Frankfurt?What happened?Last year saw more venture capital on tech, including financial technology, coming to London than all of Germany, France, Spain and Ireland combined.Thankfully, the British people had the sense and courage to ignore the prophets of doom.We can rightly be confident and optimistic about our future outside the EU — and the PM has set out a vision of what that will look like. The UK already has enormous advantages in a competitive global economy.Our system of law is admired across the globe. Our skilled workforce and universities are world class.We have fantastic research and development facilities, some of the best innovators and we are leaders in the digital revolution.And we speak English and are in the right time zone to trade with Asia in the morning and the Americas in the afternoon.The UK is in a strong position. We are not the dependent and supplicant country some would have us believe.We are a leading member of the Commonwealth, a grouping of 53 countries that is home to one third of the world’s population and half of the globe’s top 20 emerging cities.We are one of the highest contributors to Nato, have a permanent seat on the UN Security Council and are members of the G7 and G20.The UK’s future is, and needs, to be global. Based on International Monetary Fund data, it has been calculated that in the next ten to 15 years, 90 per cent of global economic growth will originate from outside the EU.That is where we must concentrate our efforts for exports and investment, alongside maintaining our ties of prosperity and security with our European neighbours. The well-being of future generations depends upon it.Sometimes it is difficult for people in Britain, or the rest of Europe, to grasp the scale of this growth.But when we understand that by 2025, China, alone, will have 221 cities with more than a million people, while the whole of the European continent will have 35, we can begin to see a fuller picture.Of course, the EU will continue to be an important economic and trade partner and we want to have a full, open and comprehensive trade agreement with it that puts the prosperity of European people before the ideology of the EU bureaucracy.But the truth is that our trade relationship with the EU has been changing over the years, since well before the referendum.In 2006, 54 per cent of our exports went to the EU. That has now fallen to 44 per cent, as markets elsewhere have expanded faster.One of the main benefits of Brexit, and being outside the Customs Union, will be having an independent trade policy for the first time in more than 40 years — made in Britain, for Britain.We need to have policies that ensure we are able to take advantage of the opportunities that will lie ahead as Asia and Africa develop growing middle classes with an appetite for the high-quality goods and services Britain provides.We cannot allow our future options to be constrained by the patterns of the past.As we leave the EU, we will take up our independent seat at the World Trade Organisation, the governing body of global trade.We will be champions of the free trading system that has helped take a billion people out over abject poverty over the past generation — one of the greatest achievements in human history.We believe protectionism will always fail and that spreading prosperity through trade is the best route to the global stability and security that is in all our interests.The UK can, and should, be a leader in that quest.It is time for our country to raise its level of ambition, take pride in our achievements and help shape our global future, joining the PM and the Government in delivering a Brexit that works for everyone — in Britain and beyond.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It had all these weird side effects,” Jeppesen says.“There were moments when I finally was alone and nobody was watching me, yet it felt creepy because I was so used to being watched.Also, even when you’re not being monitored, people are staring because I’m a white guy and they’re not used to seeing foreigners in North Korea.”On his first morning, he heard an eerie sound outside his hotel room at 5 a.m., then heard it again every day after that.The entire city, it turns out, is awakened by an instrumental version of the North Korean tune, “Where Are You, Dear General?” a salute to the countrys founder Kim Il-sung.“It’s very, very haunting, and very bizarre,” Jeppesen said.“It almost sounds like something out of a David Lynch movie. It’s one of the things that reminds you that Dear Leader is with you everywhere you go. At every moment.”What North Koreans didn’t have at every moment was electricity, which Jeppesen’s prestigious university was usually without.“The hallways were dark. There was no plumbing really in the bathrooms,” he says.“It hit home that this is a really poor third-world country. Everything is very bare-bones.”Every housing unit came with one official spy — usually a middle-aged or elderly woman — called the inminbanjang, whose job is to know everything about her residents and report back to the government.“Her job is to ‘heighten revolutionary vigilance,’ as one propaganda poster has it,” Jeppesen writes in the book.“[She keeps] a watchful eye over the comings and goings of her assigned unit, down to the smallest detail. A good inminbanjang knows exactly how many spoons and chopsticks are in each family’s kitchen and can spill that information on cue if the need should arise.Which is not to say the inminbanjang are always strict. Many let certain rules slide, such as the elderly woman Jeppesen met who was “known to rent out her second room as an hourly love hotel for extra income.”This is just one example of how life is becoming slightly less regimented for North Koreans.While virtually all citizens wore uniforms until recently, there is now a freer sense of fashion. Men wear “short-sleeve shirts of all colors and designs,” with Rolexes adorning their wrists for status (even if most are fakes from China).Women mostly wear skirts, although jeans are permitted for some in certain positions. The hot footwear fashion is high heels worn with socks.At the home of a government official, Jeppesen also got a look at the nation’s television habits. The evening news is a fawning, monotonous rundown of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un’s daily schedule while “cheery symphonic music” plays in the background.But as he watched, the official turned off the news and put on “a pirated copy of ‘Zootopia’ he bought at a DVD stall.Incredibly, given the horror stories we hear about North Korea, as well as Jeppesen’s own frequently fearful experience, he still wants to return.“I’ve developed this weird affection for North Korea, even though I know it’s a horrific place,” he says. “I feel like it’s changing every day, and I want to know and understand more. One of the best ways of doing that is to be there.”See You Again in Pyongyang: A Journey Into Kim Jong Un’s North Korea, is out now, published by Hachette."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/nintchdbpict000243101392.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"time traveller james oliver alien year 6491 passes lie detector","story":"James Oliver insists he is an alien stuck on Earth who could be here for days, years or centuries.After he finished answering all questions posed by Paranormal YouTube channel ApexTV , the word TRUE appeared on the screen.But the camera did not film the presenters laptop screen, to unveil the full results of his lie detector test.In response to a question which aimed to determine where he is from, James said: Where Im from, the years are longer.My planet is further away from the sun than yours is, so it takes longer to get around.But we have gifted mathematicians who work to calculate our years from those from other civilisations.issued a chilling warning about mankind in a video posted online, James undertook a lie detector test, to determine who he actually is.James, whose face was blurred, went on to tell the presenter who was also blurred, he works for an alien research agency specialising in the history and culture of the human race.When asked if he has ever met an alien, James said: Personally? Several times, before adding: The definition of alien is something out of this world, so technically, I am meeting one right now.His lie detector test comes months after he claimed the Yellowstone volcano could devastate America.James said: I would be very cautious about the Yellowstone volcano. As all of you know its overdue by about 600,000 years and an eruption that size would devastate the entire United States.And the biggest issue about an eruption like this is that it will produce a massive amount of ash into the atmosphere and the way your transportation mechanisms work - if you were to drive or fly through one of these ash storms you engines will be ruined.There will be no air travel the second Yellowstone erupts.James is not the first time traveller claiming to have got stranded in the past this year.Alexander Smith told KIIS FMs Kyle and Jackie O Show he was sent on a mission  to the year 2118 and revealed the future will see flying cars and humans dating robots.A young man named Noah also claimed to have come back from the year 2030 in a tale that had echoes of Back to The Future."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/nintchdbpict000410665919.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"school bans boys from wearing shorts but allows skirts","story":"Parents have been told that only long trousers or skirts can be worn under its “gender-neutral” uniform policy.Chiltern Edge School introduced a new uniform of blue blazer, white shirt, grey trousers or skirts and black shoes as part of a drive to improve standards after an “inadequate” Ofsted rating.But dad Alastair Vince-Porteous asked if his 13-year-old son could wear tailored grey shorts as he suffers nose bleeds which become more frequent when he gets hot.He said: “I wanted to try to make him a bit cooler but I was told shorts are not part of the uniform.”He said: “They mentioned its policy being gender-neutral.

We don’t want to compromise,” he confessed to Vice online news. Now we all know.

For believers in ever-closer union this an immutable article of faith.Abandoning the True Path is a heresy punishable by economic death.If we make it a success, we put the sacred Project in peril.In fact we should welcome Barnier’s harsh honesty.It provides an urgent wake-up call to dithering Theresa May who seems to favour a deal at any price.The PM’s weakness has made Britain a soft touch for Brussels and renegade Tories.Mrs May, a Remainer, has surrounded herself with a Downing Street coven of pro-EU fanatics and Whitehall mandarins who want her to cave in.She has a defeatist chief whip who keeps telling her she can’t win Commons votes against Brexit wreckers.And she is terrified of Chancellor Phil Hammond, a defiant Remainer who sabotaged spending on No Deal plans.Meanwhile, officials stoke fake news about a food, fuel and medicines crisis while the tax man invents a ludicrous annual £20BILLION customs bill for British exporters.Theresa May’s government is scaring itself to death.But a Sun on Sunday poll reveals voters don’t buy this rubbish.Most think, rightly, Theresa May has made a total hash of negotiations and must be replaced as PM when we leave next March.Mrs May is a rabbit in the headlights — aware of the trap she is walking into but paralysed by indecision over ways to escape.She seems to believe the EU Commission really can cripple one of the world’s major economies, wreck security ties and revive terrorism in Northern Ireland.And she is ready to cough up a gigantic £39BILLION of taxpayers’ cash for the privilege of surrendering — a prospect which enrages Remainers as much as Brexiteers.Paying that monstrous ransom in return for national humiliation would condemn the Tories to the scrapheap at the next election and hand the country over to a Corbyn-led Marxist nightmare.Ambitious Barnier — a preposterous puffed-up plutocrat — thinks he’s got it in the bag.EU needs all the friends – and money – it can get.In fact, his arrogance is causing alarm among EU leaders who want a deal — and offers Britain a chance to escape not just intact but in triumph.Barnier may have the support of France which has throughout history seen Britain as the great enemy.But many other countries — including Sweden, Holland, Italy and even Germany — regard the UK as their best customer.Trade is two-way traffic. Trade wars are bad news, as Donald Trump is starting to prove.Theresa May may be super-cautious but she has surely learned that boldness pays.She earned her leadership spurs by taking on Police Federation thugs. And she won global credit by standing up to Vladimir Putin over the Salisbury nerve agent poisonings.She must apply those lessons to this month’s crucial EU Council where member states gather to consider Britain’s future, just as Italy bursts into flames.The PM has a choice.She can accept an unpopular compromise which will unravel disastrously if British voters think they’ve been conned. Or she can march into talks with a clear, fair, take-it-or-leave-it offer to Europe from a valued economic and security ally.Her £39bn cheque is the trump card. With Greece destitute, Italy imploding and Austria, Poland and Hungary near revolt over immigration, the EU needs all the friends — and money — it can get.European leaders would have to decide whether to accept the deal or see Mrs May take everything off the table, including that mouth- watering £39bn pile of crisp Bank of England notes.Forget about “cliff edges”. The EU desperately needs that cash. There would be a stampede to stop Mrs May reaching the exit.Now it seems most if not all those casualties could have escaped if they had not been penned in their flats by fire-brigade diktat.We raise our hats to the fire service teams who risked death in this hideous blaze.

Men from Northern Ireland feel the most insecure about their body hair, with almost three quarters disliking one of their body parts.Those in the West Midlands have the most self-confidence, with 49 per cent happy with their bodies.The data, taken from a poll of 2,000 people by bathroomtakeaway, also found the average woman spends 66 minutes a week looking after her skin, while men take 47 minutes.Women pay an average of £13.32 for skincare products per month while men spend £8.67.

Diana once said it was where she spent the happiest time of her life.She moved into the flat almost immediately after it was given to her and furnished it in simple Habitat style. Diana lived with friends - Virginia Pitman, Caroline Pride and Ann Bolton - whom she charged £18-a-week rent.She wrote the words Chief Chick on her bedroom door so no-one would forget her landlady status, and was said to have imposed a strict cleaning rota.Diana left the flat in February 1981 and moved into Clarence House, the Queen Mothers residence on the night before her engagement to Prince Charles was officially announced.After the wedding in July, Dianas mother, Frances Shand Kydd, sold the flat to Japanese buyers for £100,000, twice as much as she originally paid for it.One royal buff told The Sun: “Letters from this period of Diana’s life are very rare.“It is written on December 28th, but we don’t know which year. It is very likely to have been 1980. The letter hints that Christmas was organised for her. She did not go to Windsor, where the royals spent Christmas, that year.

There is a big ‘Diana market’ in the States but the truth is that this letter could end up anywhere.”The highest bid for the letter, on Julien’s Auctions website, was $700, or £525.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And the emergency services themselves can be very nervous. It’s a very daunting time. But without fail, our emergency services step up. It was no different during the London Bridge attack. The policemen who answered - within minutes - the first call had no idea what they were going into. It’s times like that you really do see the best of our services. We must never take for granted the sacrifices they make.  Each time there is a terror attack or a tragedy like Grenfell, we see our emergency services doing us proud. You see off-duty medics, police, firefighters coming in to help their teams. And that’s to save as many lives as possible. I worked with Dr Martin Griffiths when I was at the Royal London and he’s a great example of this. Martin was off duty when the London Bridge call came in. He made his way there as soon as he heard the news. It’s so important that people like Martin are recognised for their work. And it was great he won an award at the NHS Heroes event, where he said he wasn’t the only one who should be thanked, There are all the unsung heroes as well.

Official figures requested by Tim Roache’s GMB union from the Office for National Statistics shine a public light on a dirty secret well-heeled, bad bosses and a Conservative Government want ignored: low wages, long hours and poor conditions are killers.

It comes after the NHS warned the cap was leading to staff shortages in the health services. It limits the number of ‘tier 2’ visas granted in any one year - including doctors - at 20,700. Home Secretary Sajid Javid yesterday said he was taking a “fresh look” at the cap.  And discussions in government on tearing up the limit are at a “fairly developed stage”, according to the  , after Mr Javid and Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt reportedly persuaded Mrs May to shift her position.

It is up to the Speaker who is hauled before the Commons but you suspect Chris Grayling will be requested to account for the meltdown in the railways, especially in the north of England .   MPs are also pushing for an emergency debate on abortion in Northern Ireland – the Downing Street line this is a devolved matter is looking increasingly tenuous – and a statement on the looming trade war with the United States.   Someone may also chance his or her arm and call for a statement on the leaked papers showing the doomsday consequence of walking away from the EU without a deal.   Then there is Sajid Javid’s re-writing of Theresa May’s immigration policy - the cap on skilled workers looks set for scrap heap.        Sitting in the middle of this swirling storm of problems, her cagoule pulled tightly over her face, is our besieged Prime Minister.   Mrs May has received plaudits for her resilience but the paralysis at the heart of government is a reminder of her limitations.   She is an over-promoted municipal politician who would struggle to make a decision on planning permission for a conservatory let alone something as all-encompassing as Brexit.   We should not be surprised the Department for Brexit has game planned a no deal scenario and concluded it would be disastrous.   Anyone who has half an eye on the Brexit understood the implications of falling back on World Trade Organisation rules without resolving hundreds of issues ranging from our membership of the European medicines agency to the collection of VAT on foreign imports.   Brussels has been aware of this from the off which is why they always knew Mrs May’s ‘no deal is better than a bad deal’ was posturing.   With time pressing and Cabinet differences apparently insoluble, the greater the likelihood that it will be left to Parliament to determine what sort of Brexit we have.   Having campaigned to take back control Brexiteers are in no position to complain about this.   And there was a strong argument that Mrs May should have taken a more consensual route in the first place.   But it does mean Downing Street and the Cabinet are struggling to keep control of events which adds to the uncertainty that so unnerves business.   This is a message the bosses of leading firms will convey when they meet the Prime Minister in Downing Street today.

Stretching lazily, Miss Kisses, Kitten’s pink dog, yawned. On Kitten’s pink bedside table, her pink phone sat beside her pink lamp. Sunshine was peeking through the pink curtains and as Kitten gazed across her pink room, she was in heaven.  Kitten’s pink pursuit began almost by accident 34 years ago. It was her 20th birthday and she was trying to work out what to wear to her party. She settled on a pink top, pink fluffy skirt, pink shoes and pink accessories.  I felt fabulous. I thought, if wearing that much pink could make me feel fantastic, why not wear pink every day? Going back to blue jeans and a white T-shirt seemed ludicrous to me. I didn’t want to wait until the next special occasion to feel pink-credible again. I wanted to feel and look pretty in pink every day. I sold my car so I had enough money to leave my hometown of Houston, Texas, and head for the bright pink lights of Hollywood, says Kitten.   I like to say I’m a flamingo in a world full of pigeons. When I walk down a busy street during the morning commute, everyone’s wearing grey and black. There’s no expression, no individuality. Yet people think I’m the crazy one! Over the years, Kitten estimates she has spent over one million pounds on pink paraphernalia and outfits.  That sounds like a lot, but if you break it down over the decades, it’s no more than anyone else is spending on cars, sofas and soft furnishings. The only difference is, for me every pound is spent on pink, she says.  From the moment you step over the threshold into her pink palace, everything is pink. Tickled pink From the front door to the TV to the loo roll, if it comes in pink you can bet your pink dollar I’ve got it. My hairbrush, my toothbrush, my kitchen utensils, you name it, it’s pink, enthuses Kitten.  My car is customised in pink, with pink chair covers and a pink gear stick. The number plate reads PINKEST, of course! Every item of clothing I own is a shade of pink. I have a pink whisk for when I bake pink cookies, a pink chair where I sit at my pink dressing table to apply my pink make-up. I have a pink throne and a pink crown bedazzled by pink jewels. I am the Queen of Pink, after all. I even use a safe, vet-approved, beetroot-based dye to colour my dog, Miss Kisses. I don’t have children but Miss Kisses is my baby, we go everywhere together. I have a recurring dream that I have a super power, where everything I touch turns pink, as if I’m magic, Kitten says.   It’s like the Midas touch but instead of everything turning gold like it does in the mythological story of the King of Phrygia, everything I touch turns a beautiful shade of my favourite colour. When I wake up, I can’t help smiling because I look around and think dreams do come true. Celebrities, including Paris Hilton and Carmen Electra, have flocked to Kitten’s home. But while most people find Kitten’s life entertaining, she is used to fending off criticism from those who think it’s all for show. Hollywood highlights  People think there must be days I’m feeling sad or just can’t be bothered to do the pink thing. They think sometimes I must just throw on a black tracksuit, but I say, \u0027Never!\u0027 It’s not for show, Kitten says.  Every day I wake up looking forward to the day. I couldn’t wake up in this pink world and feel anything but happy – it’s such a happy colour. It’s a privilege to run my hand over my rail of pink outfits and figure out what ensemble I’ll wear each day. I’m a fashionista and I make sure my outfit is well choreographed. Not every shade of pink complements every other shade of pink. My life is a carefully curated work of art.   Kitten has now made a name for herself as the Pink Lady of Hollywood. Every year, on America’s National Pink Day in June, Kitten is called upon as the world’s premier pink specialist.   When I pulled on that adorable pink outfit for my 20th birthday, I never could have imagined I could have a pink career but now, being pink is not only my passion, it’s put a pink roof over my head too, says Kitten. I earn money through my social media platforms. It still amazes me that a three-minute YouTube video can earn me money but that’s how the world works now. I’m an influencer – I didn’t even know that was a job but I’m just doing what I love and getting paid for it.  I also work as an actress and singer. My latest song, Queen Of Pink, has just been released. I’m a big fan of the Queen of England. She wears pink too. I would love the Queen of Pink to meet the Queen of England. We could swap fashion tips! Kitten’s Instagram page @kittenkaysera has over 70,000 followers and 52,000 people have subscribed to her YouTube channel. Videos chronicling Kitten’s pink life have been viewed millions of times – her fans are hooked on her every pink move.  Kitten even writes her emails in a pink font. She has several pink cases for her phone, pink sweets in jars on her pink kitchen surfaces, pink coats to go over pink tops. There are 30 pink sunglasses and lipstick in every shade of pink, to suit every pink mood she’s in.  There will always be haters. For some reason, people take offence when other people are too sure of themselves, too happy. I never let the trolls get to me. They’re just jealous that their life isn’t as colourful as mine, Kitten says.  I take their jibes with a pinch of pink salt. Seriously – even my salt is pink. It’s Himalayan rock salt, a beautiful, soft shade of pink. Kitten is single by choice but dates occasionally. Most men find her style fun but one gentleman came to Kitten’s house for dinner and didn’t comment on the extraordinary world he’d entered. After a while I had to ask him what he thought of all the pink and he looked at me blankly, before asking if I was wearing pink. He was colourblind! To him, my outfit and home seemed grey. He couldn’t appreciate it so I had to give him the pink slip, Kitten says. ‘I’m not looking for love and I wouldn’t want a man to wear pink for me but I can only ever imagine myself being with someone who sees the pink and loves me for it. A colourful life The evolution of Kitten’s taste has seen her go through soft pink and baby pink stages, but right now, she’s loving a neon vibe. The older I get, the hotter the shade of pink I am drawn to, Kitten says. I get sent pink gifts from fans all over the world and I can’t sell or give anything away.

John McAlea, boss of Belfast-based Park Taxis, said shameless passengers calling up the depot to ask for their lost narcotics is actually a constant issue for his firm. Mr McAlea said that drug runs are a constant problem for his staff. He said: “The bag of coke was dropped in the car and the driver went and picked up another passenger. “And while he was in the car, the person had rang the depot saying that he’d dropped something in the car and asking if the driver could bring it back to him.  “So the desk rang the driver and asked, and the pensioner, a woman in the back of the car, said: \u0027All there is is this\u0027 - she didn’t even know what it was.”  The bag of cocaine was flushed down the toilet, Belfast Live reports.  He added: “People are carrying drugs and if they come to any sort of check point they can drop it on the floor and say it must have been the last passenger. “People are getting taxis in our areas and they say: ‘We’re just going here and back again’, and drivers know what they’re going for.

Collette Lee, who was just 33 when she died last month, was engaged to marry her partner Sasha Ruan next year. But the much-loved manager at the Vanilla bar in Manchester was found dead on the morning of May 24. It is thought she died from hypoglycemic shock, when the blood sugar level suddenly crashes, during the night. Ruan, 31, said that the tragedy had left the life she had planned with Lee in tatters.  In the three years that we were together, Collette did so much for me, she told the Manchester Evening News .   I never would have got into the ambulance service without her support. I had my dream job, we got this house together, we had started the adoption process, we were planning the wedding... then this happened. Lee, well-known in Manchester\u0027s Gay Village as the duty manager at Vanilla, only discovered two years ago that she had Type 1 diabetes. She first met Ruan around five years ago when they both used to get the same bus back from Manchester city centre to Bolton. I said \u0027hi\u0027 to her and she said \u0027hi\u0027 and went to sit at the back, Ruan said. I wanted her to come and sit next to me! Eventually we got to know each other. She was just so loveable. She was very kind and warm-hearted and made an effort to remember everyone.  Even if someone had just been into Vanilla once before - she would try and remember their drink and talk to them. So many people knew her in the Gay Village. When she tried on the wedding dress I cried... she only had two payments left on it. I keep saying to everyone - don\u0027t leave life too late. Steph Kay, Lee\u0027s boss at Vanilla, said she had worked there for around six years and described her as “a complete diamond”. “She was very much a people person, loved and admired by all the staff and customers, Kay said. “She was known for being an obsessive cleaner, but her main passion was cocktails - Collette probably made the best cocktails in the Village! “She was very caring and down to Earth, nothing was too much trouble for her. She would always remember your birthday or anniversary.” "},{"url":null,"title":"celeb golf club used sean","story":"NewsCeleb golf club used by Sean Connery and Tim Henman under investigation over \u0027cruel\u0027 bird traps to catch crowsBerkshire club Sunningdale, which has been in business for 118 years, is the subject of a complaint over \"Larsen\" traps passed to police by the RSPCA\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByMartin Fricker18:05, 3 JUN 2018Updated18:07, 3 JUN 2018NewsColin Montgomerie playing at Sunningdale Golf Club which has been hit by an animal cruelty probe over bird traps (Image: Getty Images)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA leading golf club is being probed by police over claims bird traps were used cruelly to catch crows.

In total, 20 minutes passed before the dog was released from the hot vehicle, Somerset Live reported.  I could hear the dog crying and howling and I could see the window was only cracked open a little bit, the onlooker said.  I timed how long the dog was in the car for and it was 20 minutes until the owner came to the car to let the dog out. It\u0027s thought an announcement was made over the tannoy at the Sainsbury\u0027s store in Sherborne, Dorset, to call for the dog to be let out at around 3pm. The RSPCA has repeatedly warned of the dangers of shutting dogs in hot cars in recent years - even if it\u0027s only for a few minutes. A spokeswoman for the RSPCA said: “It’s important to remember not to leave any animal in a car or caravan, or in a conservatory or outbuilding, where temperatures can quickly rise, even when it doesn’t feel that warm outside.

Oluwafemi Omosuyi was left writhing around in agony on the floor with blood streaming from his face after the callous attack at 8pm yesterday.   The 22-year-old, known as Femi, was sitting inside a blue Ford Focus with friends yards from his mother\u0027s house in Peckham, south London when he was shot .  Another man, 25, was stabbed.

Nathan Rees posted a Tweet to easyJet on Friday night after the airline was forced to cancel a flight to Prague, saying he would be taking legal action against them. More than 140 people were left disappointed after the flight from Bristol Airport to the Czech capital was cancelled after a group of revellers treated the plane like a nightclub, reports BristolLive . But Nathan slammed easyJet for destroying his stag do, and said that the head of their cabin crew should be sacked.

Legal action is been taken. Joke. And he went on to respond to other passengers who had Tweeted about the incident - telling one man to get off your high horse and wind your neck in. Writing to private pilot Joe Roberts, Nathan said: No one was shouting and swearing you tool of a guy. Wind your neck in. Got no time for your opinions. If you honestly can say we deserved to get thrown off that plane well so be it. We have a number of people who are going to stand in our corner for this. One member of staff was on a power trip and caused this. A number of people took our side on this and have made a formal complaint about the staff of EasyJet.

Nathan is set to marry long-term girlfriend Stephanie Lewis, 31, from Treharris in Wales. There has been confusion as to why the flight actually had to be cancelled. Bristol Live report that it wasn\u0027t just the rowdy behaviour of a minority which led to the flight\u0027s cancellation.  While police and easyJet staff were delayed dealing with the disruption, the weather forecast developed. EasyJet released an initial statement about the incident which the company then updated late on Saturday evening. In the update a spokeswoman explained that it was the bad weather which ultimately led to the flight being cancelled - and around 140 people having to get off the plane before it had moved at Bristol Airport. However, it\u0027s thought that if there hadn\u0027t been bad behaviour, the flight might have been able to take off safely before the weather became an issue. An EasyJet spokesman said: EasyJet was required to cancel flight EZY6267 from Bristol to Prague on June 1 due to a group of passengers behaving disruptively on board which caused a delay - the flight was further delayed and then cancelled due to adverse weather conditions. She went on to apologise for the effects on passengers and said it had done what it could to help those affected. The spokeswoman added: “EasyJet’s crew did everything possible to minimise the disruption for our remaining passengers who have been given the option of transferring their flight free of charge or receiving a refund.  EasyJet also provided hotel accommodation and meals for those passengers who required them. “Our crew are trained to assess and evaluate all situations and to act quickly and appropriately to ensure that the safety of the flight and other passengers is not compromised at any time. “Whilst such incidents are rare, we take them very seriously, do not tolerate abusive or threatening behaviour on board and always push for prosecution. “The safety and wellbeing of our passengers and crew is easyJet\u0027s highest priority.” A police officer, Nick Falconer, took to Twitter to share pictures of the police operation.

Giorgi Kakava fled with his mother Sophie to Glasgow seven years ago from their native Georgia. The family were in danger because Giorgi\u0027s late father allegedly owed money to gangsters. But after Sophie died in February while waiting for her asylum claim to be decided, the Home Office has threatened to deport Giorgi, and his only remaining relative, grandma Ketino Baikhadze.  A petition set up in support of keeping the pair in Scotland has already reached 53,000 signatures in just three days, the Daily Record reported .   Giorgi has lived in Glasgow since he was three and, according to his grandmother, doesn\u0027t understand a word of the Georgian language. She added: He only speaks English and has grown up in Glasgow where all his friends are, so it would be very hard for him to go there. Ketino is also worried that the gangsters who threatened his father and mother would target their son if he returned to his homeland.  Since the news was first revealed of their fears for deportation , members of the public, politicians and local religious figures have come out in support of the youngster.   The petition was set up by Springburn Parish Church\u0027s Rev Brian Casey, who led the funeral to Giorgi\u0027s mum. Since it was launched just three days ago, 50,000 people have added their signature, showing their support for the boy who, as described by the minister, by all intents and purposes, a Scottish boy.

Ayman Faisal managed to open a bottle taken from a bottom shelf while his mum Saira\u0027s back was turned and ingest a substance containing caustic soda. The boy, who was aged two at the time, has been left unable to speak and has to be fed through a tube in his stomach. Ayman\u0027s family launched legal action, and a judge has found that shopkeeper Safiqit Younis is one-third responsible for his horrific injuries, the Manchester Evening News reports.  The youngster, now aged seven, was left fighting for his life following the incident at Younis\u0027 Safa Superstore in Moss Side, Manchester, in January 2013. Following an investigation, manufacturer Active Brands Concept Ltd admitted it was liable because the child-resistant cap was easily removed by the toddler, court documents said. Senior judges have now ruled that Safa Superstore is one-third responsible because the bottle should have been stored on a higher shelf. In addition, the owner did not have the correct licence to sell the toxic substance - which was marked ‘keep out of reach of children\u0027.  Ayman’s mum Saira, 38, also suffered chemical burns to her hands and feet as she desperately tried to help her son. Both have claimed compensation. The little boy was strapped into his pushchair when the incident happened. Reaching to get something, Saira turned away for just a few seconds - when she turned back she saw Ayman’s lips had gone purple and blue and there was blood coming out of his mouth. Describing the horrifying moment she said: “I didn’t know what it was or what had happened at first, I just knew it was something bad. “I remember screaming at the staff to phone an ambulance while I tried to get as much as I could out with my hands. I was terrified. All I kept thinking was ‘please don’t let me lose my son’.” Ayman spent around a month in intensive care and a further six weeks on a general ward at Royal Manchester Children’s Hospital before being allowed home.  Four years later he still needs round-the-clock care to manage his tracheostomy. He attends the Lancasterian School in Didsbury and is learning to communicate using his iPad and sign language. Saira, from Rusholme, said she is incredibly proud of how her son has managed his life-changing injuries. “It has been a struggle and I’ve had my moments, but when it comes to Ayman I just have to carry on,” she said. “I am so proud of him for what he has been through and I try to stay positive and make sure he does too. “He does ask questions like when his tracheostomy is going to come out and I do try to be honest with him. That’s when it upsets me and I don’t think that will ever go away.” Manufacturer Active Brands Concept Ltd admitted liability after Saira’s lawyers, Slater and Gordon launched legal action. They will now have to pay two-thirds of the damages. Judge Craig Sephton QC initially found Mr Younis partly to blame last July. The case went to an appeal hearing and Mrs Justice Yip has now upheld that decision.  During an appeal hearing at Manchester Civil Justice Centre last month, Justic Yip said Mr Younis had been described as a ‘sympathetic man who would do what was right’. But not knowing he needed a licence to sell the product was ‘no defence’ for not having one, she said. The judgement read: “The first defendant did not know he needed a licence. His name was not on the local authority’s list and it was therefore unlawful for him to sell it.” The bottle contained highly corrosive caustic soda and had a marked warning to keep it away from children. It would have cost nothing for him to have stocked the bottle on a shelf out of reach of youngsters, she said. She said: “On the facts as found, a dangerous product which should have been kept out of reach of children was being stored somewhere children could reach. It could easily, and without cost, have been put on a higher shelf. There was nothing to suggest that was not practicable or reasonable. “Although what happened was an unlikely occurrence, the risk of exposure to the product was more than negligible.” The judge upheld the decision that Mr Younis is one-third responsible for the injuries suffered by mother and son.  A financial settlement will not be reached until the long-term effects of Ayman’s condition are known. However Slater and Gordon say the defendants have agreed to fund a trip to Cincinnati Children’s Hospital, an international centre of excellence for paediatric medicine in the US. Saira added: “I would love to get my son back to normal. It would be a dream come true just to hear his voice again, just to hear him say mum. “I just hope this serves as a warning to other shops and manufacturers to put chemicals out of reach of children. I don’t want another family to have to go through what we have been through.” "},{"url":null,"title":"sleep tight princess boyfriends tribute","story":"News\u0027Sleep tight princess\u0027: Boyfriend\u0027s tribute to partner, 19, killed after they were both mown down in \u0027hit-and-run\u0027Sophie Smith died after a car plowed into pedestrians at a car meet at Trafford Park, Greater Manchester, on Thursday night\u0026nbspShareByPete BainbridgeElaine McCahill17:52, 3 JUN 2018Updated18:24, 3 JUN 2018News (Image: Facebook)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe boyfriend of a woman killed after a BMW ploughed into pedestrians in an alleged hit-and-run has paid tribute to his princess.

Shannon Vincent, 22, from Wales, had her life turned upside down when she was rushed to hospital where she was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Just over a week ago, Shannon went to the doctor after suffering from headaches and a high pulse and thought she might be anaemic.  A blood test confirmed she had leukaemia and Shannon will start treatment within days, Wales Online reports .  Around 650 people are diagnosed with the rare cancer every year that affects the white blood cells.  Although rare, the cancer is the most common type of childhood leukaemia, with around 85% of cases affecting children younger than 15. Shannon, from Pontypridd, is now on a Teenage Cancer Trust ward at hospital in Cardiff waiting for her treatment to start. Explaining how quickly everything happened, she said: “I went to the doctor Friday – I’d been suffering with a fast heart rate, breathlessness, and, headaches. I thought I was probably anaemic. At the appointment she checked my heart rate and told me I needed to go to the hospital to be checked ASAP, as it could be a blood clot. “At the hospital they took my bloods, gave me a chest x-ray and just generally checked me over.  “The next thing I remember being told is that I was anaemic but there was something odd about the blood. “Not long after a specialist came down and told me that it’s highly likely that it’s leukaemia. “I felt like my head had exploded. Cancer? Me? I’m too young. “The rest of the day was a blur. “I was told I had to stay in hospital and I was referred to the Heath, Cardiff, where I received a blood transfusion and was told I had to stay indefinitely.  I’d never stayed in a hospital before and I was terrified. I have struggled with anxiety my whole life, so I just didn’t know how I’d cope with this. “Tuesday I had a bone marrow test to determine what kind of leukaemia I had. I was dreading it. It involved having a needle inserted into your hip bone and some bone marrow sucked out. Shannon then decided to cut her hair before it started to fall out due to the chemotherapy. She said: It was that day I decided to get my hair cut short and into a pixie cut like I’ve always wanted, since I’m likely going to lose all my hair anyway. I felt so liberated.

Kathryn and Richard Bolton, from Banbury, Oxfordshire, had received the voucher as a Christmas present from their son, Nick.  They tried to use it to book flights to their holiday home in Spain, but received the message: Passenger name doesn’t match.  Confused, they then rang Ryanair - and were reportedly told by the operator that the \u0027correct\u0027 name was Dear Mum Dad. Nick, 34, had written this on the token in place of the recipients\u0027 names.   Kathryn, 60, told The Sun: “The whole thing has been a ludicrous farce. It would be laughable if it wasn’t so annoying.”  The low-cost airline would not accept her and Richard\u0027s voucher because the names didn\u0027t match the ones on their passports. We rang Ryanair – at 13p per minute – and finally a man said, ‘The name doesn’t match, recalled Kathryn, who works in insurance. I asked what the ‘correct’ name was, and he said, ‘Dear Mum Dad.’ I said that’s a salutation, not a name. Ryanair is now reissuing the voucher to the couple following an investigation, according to the newspaper. An airline spokesperson said: “The name on the voucher must match the name on the passport as per our terms and conditions. As a gesture of goodwill we have contacted the customer directly to resolve the issue.” "},{"url":null,"title":"political candidate wants legalise paedophilia","story":"NewsUS political candidate wants to legalise paedophilia and says sex with kids aged TEN is okay so long as they’re marriedNathan Larson, 37, is running as an independent for a US House seat in Virginia\u0027s 10th congressional district and has a three-year-old daughter\u0026nbspShareByChris Murphy08:40, 4 JUN 2018NewsNathan Larson is running as an independent candidate in Virginia\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAn accountant in America running for Congress wants to legalise paedophilia and has said it is okay for adults to have sex with children - even 10 year olds. Nathan Larson is running as an independent for a US House seat in Virginia\u0027s 10th congressional district. In an astonishing interview with a local news station, the 37-year-old says there needs to be one thing in place - marriage. He told WJLA that he doesn\u0027t have a problem with paedophilia and added: “Like, if it\u0027s in the context of a marriage, then it, I think it\u0027s usually fine.  In the phone chat with WJLA\u0027s Tim Barber, he was asked if there was some sort of age limit. Reporter Barber asked bluntly: “Even if you\u0027re 10?

The Huffington Post has also reported his campaign website shared an IP address with chatrooms that talked about paedophilia and raping women. In an interview he said: “A lot of people are tired of political correctness and being constrained by it. “People prefer when there’s an outsider who doesn’t have anything to lose and is willing to say what’s on a lot of people’s minds.” Larson has a three-year-old daughter who lives with relatives.

James Oliver says he was on a mission in the 21st century from the year 6491, but is unable to get home to his family and friends.  It sounds like something straight out of the plot of one of the Back to the Future films - but now there is evidence he may be telling the truth. Paranormal YouTube site ApexTV hooked him up to a lie detector test and claims he passed every question. His face is blurred out and his accent is a thick Birmingham one, which can sometimes sound American or Australian, and he has a slight lisp.  Your years are different to mine, he tells the presenter, whose face has also been blurred out. There is some obscurity as to whether he lives on planet earth or another planet, as he adds: Where I\u0027m from, the years are longer. My planet is further away from the sun than yours is, so it takes longer to get around. But we have gifted mathematicians who work to calculate our years from those from other civilisations. But he does, however, appear to be human. When he has finished speaking, the word TRUE appears on the screen over the video, but the camera never pans to the laptop to prove he is not lying. He says global warming is going to get worse and our planet is going to get hotter, and advises us to put a cap on carbon emissions. He goes on to say that everyone in the future has their own Artificial Intelligence system called Siri, which recognise users by their voice. He adds: We are constantly finding new planets and galaxies every day. Most of it is just nothing. Sometimes you hit the jackpot and find intelligent life on it. You find new planets, new eco systems. There are a lot of planets more intelligent than humans.  Planets are controlled by an umbrella of elected officials, similar to the United Nations, but all still have some independent control. When asked if there has been fights between humans and aliens, he says: Errr, I can\u0027t....yes, seemingly stuttering. But he then finds his confidence, adding: There have been some conflicts, but most of it has been put under control by the federation very quickly. The federation is there as a peace keeping vessel.  He claims to work for an alien research agency, specialising in the history and culture of the human race. When asked if he has ever met an alien, he replies: Personally? Several times. The definition of alien is something out of this world, so technically, I am meeting one right now. I have, on occasion. But the only time I meet them is when I am at home. It\u0027s the same sort of thing. They travel to where I live and I do know them.

Debra Demetriou claims the blurry snap was taken when she was home alone and her house was locked. Taken from the foot of her bed, it shows her with her eyes half open and the covers tucked over her chin. The stay-at-home mum insists her Samsung S7 was under her pillow when she fell asleep, and it was still there when she woke up hours later, Chronicle Live reports.  Debra, from Benton, Newcastle, said she discovered the photo while scrolling through pictures from the night before. She said: “There was nobody else in the house at the time - I was completely freaked out. She said her oldest son left for work 45 minutes before the picture was taken, and her other son was with his dad. The house was locked, untouched from the night before, and there were no signs of a break in, she added.  Debra said: “I know you shouldn’t, but my phone had been under my pillow when I fell asleep. “It was still there the next morning. “I held down the picture to see the movement, and you can see both my arms are by my side so it couldn’t even have been a selfie. “And my eyes are half-open - if someone else had been in the room I’m sure I would have noticed them. “I’m absolutely convinced nobody else was in the house.”  The eerie snap has left her full of dread. She can’t stop thinking about who took it. Paranormal investigator Sammy Rawlinson has examined the image and admits it is “spooky”. The Stockton psychic added: “Spirits do things to get our attention. “If someone has passed in the last year it could be them trying to get her attention.”  Debra has lost both parents, but not that recently. However she admits this isn’t the first time something “strange” has happened to her. Pictures from her son’s last birthday contained, according to a clairvoyant, “ghosts” of deceased family members. But Debra isn’t sure. And she isn’t sure how this picture was taken.

That was a major factor in coming here,” is how the left-back put it.And he was convinced that will be the case after a chat with United assistant boss Laurie Ellis.The pair know each other, having been team-mates at Raith Rovers during the 2013-14 campaign.“I knew Laurie pretty well from my time at Raith. We got speaking about the prospect (of joining United). Since then it has gone pretty quickly.“Coming to a club like Dundee United is really a pretty simple choice.”Ironically, with new Morton boss Ray McKinnon considering a move for his old work-mate Ellis, it could be the pair don’t end up working together again next season.If United can persuade their highly regarded coach to stay, McKinnon could team up with another of his former Tannadice backroom staff, Darren Taylor.Returning to Booth, after a year spent vainly scrapping to avoid the drop, the ex-Hibs, Arbroath and Brechin man is looking forward to a challenge at the right end of a table.“Last season was tough and we just couldn’t get away from that drop zone,” he added.“This will be a different type of pressure, being expected to win most weeks and one which I will relish.”Booth will battle for the left-back slot with youngster Jamie Robson, who himself last week signed up for another two years at Tannadice.Manager Csaba Laszlo is pleased to have that kind of competition in the squad and to get a man of Booth’s quality and experience.“I’m delighted to bring Callum to Dundee United,” he said.“He is an experienced left-back who has played in the Premiership.

This is in stark contrast to the lowest temperature – on May 1 – when it touched just below freezing.Dundee regularly clocks up more hours of sunshine than any other city in Scotland.The council launched the #Sunny Dundee campaign to promote the city’s position as the country’s sunniest city.Nicola Maxie, a forecaster with the Met Office, said Dundee and Angus had enjoyed the highest sunshine levels since their records began, thanks to warm, easterly weather coming in from continental Europe.The Met Office uses historical Scottish counties to write its weather reports, with Dundee and Angus previously part of the same one.She said: “Dundee and Angus was around 3C above its usual average May temperature last month, compared with other years.“Sunshine levels in Dundee and Angus provisionally look like being the highest since records began in 1929 for that area.“There were 246.4 hours of sunshine, which is 37% above average for May in that area.”Thousands of pairs of #SunnyDundee-branded sunglasses were given to visitors and businesses, with an invitation to explore the city and share their photographs using the #Sunny Dundee hashtag.Although free, a £1 donation is suggested, which will go to support the cancer care centre Maggie’s Dundee.Despite a yellow warning of rain and thunder in place for the area today until 9pm, sun worshippers might still have a

It’s not like ‘you’re only 16 or 17 and you’ve not really cracked it yet’, there’s nothing like that.“Come in for the four weeks of pre-season and blow the webs off it.”There might be no barrier but the level required from these young players and what the manager expects from every player, no matter the age, is extremely high.And it won’t take long for the youngsters to find that out.A prime example is 19-year-old Scott, a prolific goalscorer in the Development League, who featured for the Dark Blues in the final three matches of the last campaign.He came on against Partick Thistle in the last game of the season, replacing Craig Wighton after an hour, but failed to impress his manager.Neil said: “I’ll not tell you what I told Cedwyn after the Partick game but it was pretty stark.“If he is coming into my first team I expect him to score goals, create chances, to run after centre-backs, close down full-backs – he doesn’t get let off because he’s 18 years old.“He’s coming in during the summer and he’s got a short space of time to get in my face and say ‘I’m better than what you’re going to bring in. If you’ve not got anybody in yet, gaffer, I’m your man’.“All the boys that have made an impact in the first team have a real chance but they need to come back and be better than what I’ve got.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b10f80c669bf-e1527838783208.jpg ","title":"ralph signs but striker desired","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee have added left-back Nathan Ralph as their fourth signing of the summer – but a striker is still top of boss Neil McCann’s wishlist.The 25-year-old moves to the Scottish Premiership from the English National League after suffering relegation with Woking last season.And the Tele revealed way back in January that a move for the former Yeovil Town man was likely in the summer.Gaffer Neil, however, is still working on bringing a goalscorer to the club.He’s made no secret of the fact his team were short in the scoring department last season and adding somebody to put the ball in the net would help him achieve the top-six finish he craves for his side.The club have already made a move for Macauley Bonne.The Leyton Orient striker knocked in an impressive 22 goals in the National League last season and has drawn plenty of interest from English league clubs.The Dark Blues tried to get in there early. However, they look to have been priced out of that deal.On Thursday the club did announce a capture in the shape of Ralph on a two-year deal.Moving up from the English non-league, he said: “I know the level is better than what I have been playing at recently so I’m looking to test myself as much as possible.“I feel like I’m good enough to play at this level. I’m excited, looking forward to it.”He also revealed he’d been persuaded to make the move north by new team-mate Roarie Deacon, with both players clients of OYS Sports Management along with Glen Kamara.Ralph added: “I’ve heard a lot of good things about the club.“I spoke to a few people as well, the likes of Roarie Deacon who said it’s a good place to come, play good football and the manager will improve me.“That’s pretty much everything I was looking for.“I am energetic, I like to attack.“I’m a left-back but I like to get forward as well.“I would say I’m decent in the air.“I like to try create when I can, I like getting assists.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7486028.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the Oscars","story":"                          Swindon\u0027 own Maisie Sly has topped off her trip to Hollywood in style, after the film she starred in, The Silent Child, was announced as the winner Best Live Action Short Film at the 90th\u0026nbspAcademy Awards."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7590066.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"11 things you d only hear in Glasgow","story":"                          There are some things you will only ever hear in Glasgow or Glesga, as us locals call it,\u0026nbspand this is our definitive list of the best."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7608211.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Times Past gallery of the week  Glasgow theatres","story":"                          Evocative Images from the Archives of the Herald and Evening Times."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7857447.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"  1m to transform Glasgow boathouse","story":"                          TRANSFORMING a historic boathouse will open up the River Clyde to all Glaswegians."},{"url":null,"title":"Booze-fuelled rammy leads to calls for alcohol ban at kids  matches","story":"                          CALLS have been made to ban alcohol at children\u0027s football matches after a booze-fuelled rammy that has led to the end-of-term football tournament being cancelled."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7735731.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"In Pictures  Contestants face off in World Custard Pie Championship","story":"                          The 51st annual World Custard Pie Championship got under way on Saturday in the village of Coxheath, near Maidstone in Kent."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7873671.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Gerrard gets a head start in Europa League mission","story":"                          STEVEN Gerrard has already met some of the Rangers players as he aims to hit the ground running in order to qualify for the group stages of the Europa League."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7873769.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"National Trust for Scotland sets out ambitious five-year plan","story":"                          Almost \u0026pound60 million will be spent preserving Scotland\u0027s heritage over the next five years, National Trust for Scotland bosses said as they announced their \"most ambitious\" programme."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7875247.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Celtic unveil beginning of   4m stadium upgrade","story":"                          CELTIC yesterday revealed phase one of Parkhead\u0027 \u0026pound4million facelift which aims to make the stadium known throughout the football world as one of the best for spectator experience."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7873438.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Neil Cameron  I like the Ally McCoist of right now -

The intention is to change it to clear glass and make it more attractive entrance.\"The next phase would be to\u0026nbsp refurbish the shop fronts in Market Arcade and make them more in keeping with the building.It is hoped both phases will be able to secure funding from the Academy Street Townscape Heritage Project to regenerate that area of the city centre.With that funding due to finish in 2020, the proposed improvements are at the top of the list of priorities on the market action plan.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe third phase focuses on the market hall itself.\"This is the area potentially most subject to change,\" Mrs Murray said.\"We are going to look at having a feasibility study done to see what is physically possible and how much can be developed to create a better and more usable space, better units and a better environment.\"One idea, for example, is to look at whether a mezzanine floor would be possible.\"We also want to try and create a more open area which we could use as a venue, Mrs Murray said.She is particularly keen to see more cafes and restaurants and food units while zoned areas such as a restaurant quarter or a jewellery hub are another possibility.Rents could also be set according to whether units are assessed to be in a strong or weak location.Of the 36 units, 32 are currently occupied and there has\u0026nbsp also been interest from other prospective tenants.\"The Victorian Market is quite unique in Inverness and we need to exploit that,\" Mrs Murray said.\"We are trading healthily but we want to maximise our potential. With the future of the British High Street in decline at the moment, we need to look at as many options to make it viable for all business and attract new brands into the city centre.\"Monday 4 Jun 2018 9:35 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04105000/04105690.jpg","title":"East of Inverness plans include bid for 3000 new homes","story":"\u0026nbspA VISION for 3000 new homes, three schools and a 30-acre district park for Inverness will be formally unveiled later this week \u0026ndash amid fierce opposition.While public feedback has included optimism about improved transport potential, fears have been raised that a fresh focus on the swathe of farmland between Barn Church Road and the Inverness College UHI could \"undermine investment confidence\" in the nearby Stratton new town project which is already under way.The Inverness East development brief prepared by Highland Council planners will be considered for adoption by city councillors on Thursday.The blueprint \u0026ndash which does not estimate the overall cost \u0026ndash aims to ensure expansion is \"co-ordinated, offering a clear vision and the right facilities to support new communities\".A draft version was approved for consultation last November. Public consultation followed with 328 nearby addresses contacted, prompting 104 formal responses.The report to the committee stressed that the brief \"does not seek to create competition between the two locations\".Stratton, it stated, \"has opportunity for larger footprint retail and community buildings whereas Ashton provides opportunity for education, park and higher density residential development\".The focus of development would be \"east Ashton\". The owners of the adjacent western part of Ashton Farm do not intend selling for development but to continue farming the land.Opportunities have been identified for improving public transport links, particularly for Inverness Campus users. Transport agency HiTrans will consider the provision of a new rail station at Seafield, the campus or Stratton.Discussions are underway with the college and Highlands and Islands Enterprise on the \"early delivery\" of sports facilities at the campus. A least one pitch plus associated buildings could cost \u0026pound4.7 million.The expansion also promises to include an upgrade to the busy Inshes roundabout layout.Planning officials are discussing road widening proposals with landowners. Council representatives will attend community council meetings in the coming months to assess local requirements.A 500-space park-and-ride facility was consented as part of the Stratton scheme.The report references a landowner who argued that the brief contradicts an existing development plan and \"fails to recognise Stratton and only refers to potential future development at Ashton Farm\".They also complained that the \"vision map does not reflect the original permission\u0027 town centre at Stratton or the development plan support for it\".Another considers \"Ashton centre\" to be \"an unreasonable competitor location to Stratton\" that \"undermines\" Stratton.It is unclear from the report what long-term employment would be created in the area \u0026ndash an issue raised historically by numerous city councillors who questioned council officials\u0026rsquo aspirations for growth.The report stated: \"Analysis identified that the optimum location for a new centre is at east Ashton.\"This location is, therefore, identified as the core area for new and existing communities to visit as a destination that has footfall generating uses including a new district park, high school and mixed-use centre that includes high-density residential uses.\"It emphasised that the Stratton site does not include provision for a district park or high school with community facilities like those at Inverness Royal Academy.The brief \"does not seek to create competition between Stratton and Ashton\", according to the development planning team.Public feedback has already established an aversion to more development in the area with calls for the focus to instead be on the city centre and brownfield sites, and concern that the recent demand for new homes could stall, leaving a surplus of residential properties.Other responses included a plea that \"pubs should not be allowed\".Smithton and Culloden Community Council chairman David McGrath welcomed the document, with a caveat that it improves access to the nearby Inverness Shopping Park with a short cut for existing residents.A spokesman for the Stratton developer Hazledene said: \"We don\u0026rsquot think it\u0027 appropriate that a competitor town centre should be introduced, as this would add uncertainty and confusion.\"These [Ashton] proposals are early stage proposals and we believe should not be given the same weight as the Stratton permissions already granted.

Russell clipped in the cross from the right and McBurnie\u0026#8217s powerful header from 10 yards bounced back off the right post.However, four minutes later the Scots were lucky not to be further behind. A counter-attack from a Scottish corner ended with Vela being free in the area.But rather than shoot Vela cut the ball back for Layun, but his effort from close range was blocked by a combination of Bain and Shinnie.On 65 minutes Scotland had another let off when Dylan McGeouch\u0026#8217s poor pass allowed Lozano in and after skipping away from Mulgrew he rattled the crossbar from 10 yards and then sub Marco Fabian blazed the follow up over.With 18 minutes left the ball was in the visitors\u0026#8217 net when sub Oribe Peralta knocked in the rebound after Lozano\u0026#8217s header was saved by Bain, but Peralta was flagged offside.Scotland tried their best to force an equaliser but another clear-cut chance wasn\u0026#8217t forthcoming and Mexico were threatening on the break.In the 90th minute sub Jesus Corona got clear and lobbed the ball beyond the advancing Bain but Mulgrew headed off the line.Mexico: Guillermo Ochoa, Jesus Gallardo, Carlos Salcedo (Rafael Marquez 46), Hugo Ayala, Miguel Layun, Edson Alvarez, Hector Herrera (Marco Fabian 57), Giovani dos Santos (Jonathon dos Santos 57), Hirving Lozano (Jesus Corona 73), Carlos Vela (Javier Aquino 63), Raul Jiminez (Oribe Peralta 57).Subs not used: Alfredo Talavera, Javier Hernandez, Erick Gutierrez, Jesus Molina.Scotland: Jon McLaughlin (Scott Bain 46), Stephen O\u0026#8217Donnell, Jack Hendry, Scott McKenna, Graeme Shinnie Johnny Russell, Dylan McGeouch, Kenny McLean (Chris Cadden 55), Callum Paterson (Charlie Mulgrew 55), Ryan Christie (John McGinn 55), Oliver McBurnie (Lewis Morgan 80).Subs not used: Jordan Archer, Jamie Murphy.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/06/IMG_2084-e1527853798398-780x564.jpg ","title":"beer of the week stone ipa","story":"\t\t\t\t\tStone Brewing, headquartered in California but brewing in Berlin, pops up regularly when chatting to bar staff about good beers.When I spotted their IPA on the shelf at Tesco (I had popped in for milk, honest) I thought I\u0026#8217d give this West Coast IPA a go.It fills the glass with a lovely antique gold, crystal-clear beer, topped with a pleasing white head.The nose is subtle, citrus lemon and a hint of Weetabix about it.It has great body and mouth feel with a juicy attack and those citrus notes are nicely sharp, then it\u0026#8217s washed away almost immediately with a huge hoppiness.

At times when the builders are working the gulls understandably leave the site but then return during the evenings and at weekends. Several birds were again sitting on apparent nests as recently as May 4, however it looks like many others may have moved elsewhere.Measures have since been taken by the builders to encourage the birds to leave the area prior to laying their eggs and to give them a chance of nesting elsewhere soon. Recently I had a meeting with SNH (Scottish Natural Heritage) and the RSPB and both were sympathetic and understanding of the situation.I also plan to meet with the Scottish Canals environmental scientist soon in the hope that perhaps provision can be made, within the scope of the hub project, to allow for a nesting area for the Common Gulls in future years at the site.This could give rise to an exciting opportunity enabling the public and visitors to the new heritage centre to view these gulls raise their chicks, for which is effectively the rarest colony of nesting birds in the Crinan Canal corridor.Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,This week Allt Dearg Wind Farm distributed over £135,000 to the Ardrishaig Community Trust, which holds the village\u0026#8217s share in this locally owned wind farm.Combined with the recent payments to the Tighnabruaich and Tarbert Trusts which hold similar shares in the neighbouring Sròndoire Wind Farm, together with the wind farms\u0026#8217 contributions to the local educational trust, this brings the total direct community benefit payments from these projects to well over £ 1 million.This is a significant milestone for the projects, and highlights the socio-economic advantages of local ownership in wind power. Despite its relatively small capacity Allt Dearg is the single largest contributor of community benefit payments in Argyll.This week the UK Government published the results of its latest tracking survey of public attitudes to energy and climate change. This shows continued growth in support for on-shore wind, and eight in ten agreed that renewable energy developments should provide direct benefits to the communities in which they are located.Some objections to wind farms remain, and our turbines remain visible in the distance. We hope that the views of Allt Dearg and Sròndoire might remind such objectors that we are economically dependent on what we can produce from the limited options available to us in remote rural areas. That our particular wind farms are able to make a significant contribution to local employment and deliver funding direct to our neighbouring communities, whilst supplying around 20 per cent of Argyll and Bute’s annual domestic electricity requirements from a clean renewable resource, is very satisfying.We would like to thank all those who have made these projects the successes they are, and in particular thank those local community councillors and trust members who have given so much of their time in recent years to make this all happen. For our part, we will continue our efforts to grow the industry and economic activity that provides secure employment and opportunity for our local community.We look forward to our community partners being able to invest the fruits of these wind farms into exciting local projects.Mary Broadfoot of Stronachullin and James F Lithgow of OrmsarySir,Loneliness is a major issue in society and affects everyone from all walks of life, regardless of age or ability.That’s why we’re pleased the Scottish Government is looking at the development of a new approach to tackling the issues of loneliness and social isolation – something we have first-hand experience of and how it affects many of the people we support in Scotland.Following a recent survey of over 150 service users of our homecare services in Stirling, Falkirk, Perth and Kinross, and Angus which focused solely on loneliness and social isolation, it was revealed that loneliest people receive far fewer visitors each week. While this is hardly surprising, we did find that those who either lived with family or had family close by were less at risk of loneliness and the negative health impacts associated. Our research also highlighted that respondents, in most cases, simply wanted a chat over a cuppa with someone their own age.Social interactions are something the vast majority of us take for granted as we all lead such busy lives, but for someone who is alone, watching time go by very slowly, it’s incredibly painful for them to sit at home day after day with no communication from the outside world.Charities such as Sue Ryder regularly arrange social events for our service users and their families.But if, as a nation, we’re serious about tackling loneliness as a public health issue then we need to be resourcing our local authorities to put in place services or to commission them from the third sector to ensure that no one feels alone and isolated in Scotland.Pamela Mackenzie, director of neurological services and Scotland, Sue Ryder, StirlingSir,This spring we hope your readers will celebrate the royal wedding with their very own Right Royal Tea Party in aid of Meningitis Now.Putting on a spread fit for a royal wedding is a piece of cake with our free fundraising pack and, as Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have requested charity donations rather than wedding presents, you can fulfil their wishes whilst helping families affected by this devastating disease.A royal-themed Time4Tea can be held anytime, not just on Saturday May 19, the date of the Royal Wedding.

Help us fight back on all fronts by funding research to eradicate the disease, raising awareness and supporting survivors.That would be the perfect wedding present.Find out more at www.MeningitisNow.org and search for Time 4 Tea.Elaine Close, community fundraiser, Meningitis NowSir,Please would the parents of the young girl who may have witnessed a recent incident with a man and dog in Inveraray Main Street be kind enough to contact my husband and I through this newspaper?We saw a man who, we believe, mistreated a dog in the street at 8.30pm on Sunday April 29, and his movements in the immediate aftermath.We are both keen to know that this young person is alright as she appeared to be terribly frightened, running off at speed with her two dogs as he headed straight for her.Knowing she was now fine would put our minds at rest.

It was a gamble \u0026#8211 but one that paid off, with the business now turning over millions each year.He left the business \u0026#8216at least 10 years ago\u0026#8217, but was a very interested visitor at last week\u0026#8217s \u0026#8216Fyne at 40\u0026#8217 celebrations \u0026#8211 more on pages 16 and 17 \u0026#8211 to mark the company\u0026#8217s four decades in business.\u0026#8216Looking back, I feel quite astonished really,\u0026#8217 he told the Advertiser.\u0026#8216I mean, away back we had a wooden hut, but before that there was a fish box and an umbrella. We were growing shellfish, cooking prawns and smoking a bit of fish.\u0026#8216The restaurant as we see it today was an old farm steading \u0026#8211 well, it was a midden, really. But we slowly evolved within it.\u0026#8216It was open to the slates and the wind used to go straight up the length of the oyster bar. We had a hessian sack to keep down the draught, and it used to stand out at about 45 degrees a lot of the time. It was very primitive for many years, because we were skint.\u0026#8216People sat in their overcoats, but they liked the style. All of a sudden they could get local shellfish, and it just developed from there.\u0026#8217He continued: \u0026#8216Since my time the whole place has had a re-make and it is really, really nice.\u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s been driven by the volume of people wanting to dine here. I mean, you couldn\u0026#8217t keep up that slightly rustic look. It\u0026#8217s a cracking place now. Just superb.\u0026#8217Johnny Noble sadly died in 2002, aged just 66.\u0026#8216He was an inspiring, lovely man, said Mr Lane. \u0026#8216No matter what disaster befell us no matter what cock-up happened, he was ever-optimistic and just kept us going.\u0026#8216We would have our business meetings in the billiard room at [Johnny\u0026#8217s home] Ardkinglas House, and there would be a bottle of something. That just keeps the morale going.\u0026#8216He was a great man, and wonderful entertainment.\u0026#8217The stories of Johnny Noble are legion, and most are true.Andy Lane recalled: \u0026#8216In the days of the Oyster Bar in our old draughty building, everyone had to muck in. Johnny would go round being the wine waiter for a while. Until, that is, someone would choose an inappropriate wine. At that point he\u0026#8217d start a sort of genial argument with them. In the end he\u0026#8217d sit down with them and you\u0026#8217d never see him again for the rest of the evening.\u0026#8216I don\u0026#8217t think we realised just how important he was for the business until he was gone.\u0026#8217Now living a quieter life in Cornwall with his Dexters, Mr Lane concluded: \u0026#8216My wife and I changed tack in life, really, and it keeps us busy.

Therefore, we support separating pedestrians, cyclists and motorists through an expansion of the network of walking and cycling paths across Scotland.We would like to stress, however, that measures like these will not single-handedly lead to safer roads. The road mentality in Scotland still favours the motorist over more vulnerable road users, which presents a huge barrier to more people taking up active lifestyles.More needs to be done to change our road culture for people in Scotland to feel safer regardless of their means of transportation, ultimately empowering them to lead healthier and more active lifestyles.Perhaps it is time we started to beat the ‘presumed liability’ drum once again?Brenda Mitchell, Road Traffic Accident Law (Scotland) LLP, Edinburgh.Sir,Some people have difficulty getting up and down the steps on the Glasgow bus. We asked West Coast Motors about this and they gave us the answer we wanted.All Citylink buses are fitted with an access ramp, worked by the driver. A platform comes out on to the pavement, with a holding bar, and is then raised up to floor level. This is designed as a wheelchair lift, where two seats at the front have to be arranged to be taken out, to give plenty of room.It was agreed, however, that if someone felt nervous about climbing up or down the stairs, they could also use the access platform. Once they have paid their ticket, they can walk to a seat.West Coast Motors asks anyone wanting this service to please remember two things.Firstly, book your single or return tickets by phone or on the Citylink website.Then, 48 hours before your journey, phone Citylink and tell them the times and details of the booking you have made and let them know you will be using the access ramp. The telephone number is 08712 663333.Kirsty McCuaig and Patricia Crawford, Mid Argyll Buddies.Sir,The ongoing effects of weather, bureaucracy and concern for the future continue to put our countryside under pressure, with few avenues to turn to for support.This can have dramatic consequences for the rural economy and the people who live and work there.The Prince’s Countryside Fund is committed to supporting community-led projects that will re-invigorate and sustain farming networks and the countryside by providing services and amenities through its grant programme.Open for applications until June 14, grants are available for up to £50,000. If you are involved in a community-run or farming support project and think your organisation may benefit – or if you know someone who might –  visit  www.princescountrysidefund. org.uk/grants.The fund has supported a diverse range of projects, including a community transport app in Argyll and projects on Barra, Orkney and Shetland. We are proud to have distributed more than £9 million since 2010 to more than 250 projects led by these grassroots organisations.It is crucial we help rural areas during these times of change to retain a thriving countryside and encourage a sustainable farming sector in the UK and would encourage people to apply for our funding.Claire Saunders, director, The Prince’s Countryside Fund.Sir,At first sight, it seems odd that the controversy over the reported disturbance to common gulls, oystercatchers and black guillemots at the old oil depot in Ardrishaig is focused on a breeding colony of common gulls.I’m no bird expert and hadn’t realised common gulls are less common than the bigger varieties or that they’re a declining species.But among the reasons given for this are predation by mink and the loss of open rubbish dumps and both might be contributing factors in Mid Argyll.It’s surely hardly surprising that the only breeding colony along the canal is at the Ardrishaig end, where the urbanisation around the tidal flats of Loch Gilp and the Lingerton dump offer prime scavenging opportunities.I don’t know whether they lose out to the bigger gull species when it comes to local island nesting sites, or whether the old Gleaner site might offer other advantages, for example, maybe less vulnerable to mink predation – but could it be the gulls are there primarily because of man-made feeding opportunities and that they’ll find an alternative site that’s similarly convenient?Likewise, the smaller populations of oystercatchers and black guillemots, however, although they’re also both amber listed they don’t scavenge and seem to be more dependent on the sea and shore for their livelihoods.Their decline might be of more concern but they’re hopefully less swayed towards easy pickings around Loch Gilp and more evenly distributed to Loch Crinan.Perhaps Jim Dickson and Andrew Tongue can enlighten us further on just how endangered the populations of these three species are in Mid Argyll.Robert Wakeham, Lochgilphead.Sir,Please would the parents of the young girl who may have witnessed a recent incident with a man and dog in Inveraray Main Street contact my husband and I through this newspaper?We saw a man who, we believe, mistreated a dog in the street at 8.30pm on Sunday April 29.We are both keen to know this young person is alright as she appeared to be frightened, running off at speed with her two dogs.Knowing she was fine would put our minds at rest.

You have a most beautiful part of the country to live in.Name and address supplied.Sir,It has been announced recently a Scottish Conservative government would invest £100 million into fixing potholes over the course of the next parliament.We all rely on our roads but they are now plagued with potholes which are damaging cars. Beyond our concerns for public safety, this systematic under-investment is slowing our economy and costing local councils a fortune in compensation for car owners.We recognise the importance of well-maintained roads and we are willing to invest in it.The SNP has consistently neglected Scotland’s roads and the results are obvious for everyone to see.Councillor Alastair Redman, Islay.On Monday May 14, I spotted six swallows over the rear of Meadows Place, hopefully heralding a decent summer.First seen this year.Mike Power, Lochgilphead.Sir,During this week\u0026#8217s Holyrood vote on the UK Government’s Withdrawal Bill, Labour, the Greens and LibDems joined the SNP in an overwhelming rejection of the UK Government’s currently-drafted Brexit plans, voting 93 to 30 against the bill.While the Scottish Government agrees in the need for UK-wide frameworks, it has described the retention of the overall control of agriculture, fisheries, food labelling and public procurement as a power grab.The Scottish Parliament has spoken loudly and clearly, and if the UK Government wants us to believe they value Scotland and devolution, they must respect the vote and remove the proposed power grab.Any constraints placed on the existing powers of the Scottish Parliament without consent would be a democratic outrage.During Prime Minister\u0026#8217s Questions, Theresa May failed to reassure us she will respect the decision of the Scottish Parliament. If she does choose to ignore the vote and force through this legislation, she will be breaking the conventions of the 20-year-old devolution settlement and imposing a power grab upon Scotland against our will.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters natures patterns","story":"\t\tDorothy H CrawfordUpdated: 20/05/18, 11:47 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe natural world abounds in beautiful patterns, each evolved to enhance survival of a species \u0026#8211 the extravagant, iridescent peacock’s tail, which serves to attract a mate, while intricate orchid flowers entice pollinators and tigers’ stripes provide camouflage.But not all nature’s patterns are quite as showy it is the mathematical symmetries that I find most intriguing.Italian mathematician Leonardo Fibonacci lived in 12th century Algeria when Indian numerals were introduced to the West via the Middle East.  In his book, Liber Abaci (published in 1202), he describes a numerical sequence, now called the Fibonacci sequence, in which each number is the sum of the previous two digits: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 ad infinitum. He formulated this recurrence in relation to rabbit breeding, but it turns out to be exceedingly wide-spread in nature, from tree branching to mollusc shell growth to bee reproduction.Plant leaves are like solar panels, absorbing sunlight to power energy-providing photosynthesis.  Thus, leaves appear in a spiral around the stem, each positioned to optimise sunlight capture.  The ratio of leaves to turns is always a ration of Fibonacci numbers 3 leaves to 1 turn for hazel, 8/3 for pear and 13/5 for almond trees.  The angle between consecutive leaves is always close to 137.5o, called ‘the golden angle’ – perfect for maximising energy production.The number of petals in most flowers also follows the Fibonacci sequence: lilies have 3, buttercups 5, delphinium 8, common marigolds 13, asters 21.  But even more striking are the complex spirals of seed-heads of sunflowers, fir cones and pineapples.  In each case new seeds forming in the centre of the flower push older seeds out into mesmerising patterns of interlocking, clockwise and anticlockwise spirals.The numbers of spirals in both directions are consecutive Fibonacci numbers with 5 and 8 or 8 and 13 in pineapples, 8 and 13 in fir cones, and numbers as high as 144 and 233 recorded in sunflower heads.Why? Because these configurations pack in the most seeds.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 21/05/18, 3:33 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Some would argue it has been an eyesore that should have been knocked down long before now and replaced with a more modern building.But it\u0026#8217s sad to see the old Inveraray Community Hall crumble and rot with neglect.What makes the building\u0026#8217s current predicament all the more galling is that there was the chance, according to Inspire Inveraray, to make the building safe six years ago.

Nearly all Sunbeams are painted black and originally had a gold leaf lining on the petrol tanks.\u0026#8216Sunbeams were described in early sales literature as \u0026#8216the most expensive\u0026#8217 bike you could buy, simply because it suggested superior quality.\u0026#8217The Scottish run is organised every two years by Chris Odling from Easdale, who said: \u0026#8216The weather just makes everything. Coming over the hills seeing Arran when we\u0026#8217ve just seen the Paps of Jura, taking your time on an old bike, is just wonderful.\u0026#8216The smokehouse opened for us today to give us soup and sandwiches when it is usually closed on a Saturday.

Was that a bird\u0026#8230or something else? Just what might we find beyond the paths?The reserve’s new art trail, though, dials up the magic a notch.Just by the entrance, Jane Walker’s straw deer of willow and scraps greet the viewer. Entitled ‘Looking for Noah’ they stand, incongruously with a licence plate wedged in antlers.The walk takes the visitor past thought-provoking sculptures, including Lesley Burr’s beautifully-painted birdcages that could house fairies, to an opening at The Mill with its own maze and poetry carved into rock.The Artmap Argyll group brings together artists of different specialities to make for an intrigung walk through the woods.A highlight for many will be Melanie Chimelewska’s limestone seal pup, lying gleefully on the shore, but Andy McClintock’s dancing mermaids undoubtedly captured a feeling of eerie magic, as though having stepped into a Grimm brothers\u0026#8217 fairytale. The wire and cloth faceless mermaids dance on the surface of a pond but hide, too, under a running waterfall, washing the seaweed stuck to their scaled tails.Andy McClintock said: ‘I imagine water sprites dancing in the lagoon and disporting themselves in waterfalls.’Within The Mill itself, paintings are hung showing the allure of algae.Artist Lottie Goodlet said: ‘As a snorkeller and swimmer in the Sound of Jura, I am fascinated by seaweed beneath me. I see it as secret and unexpected treasure \u0026#8211 underwater kelp forests and ocean meadows gracefully riding the ebb and flow of the tides.’The influences of nature brought into a new light makes for a mysterious experience that will stay with you far longer than the trail can last.The art trail at Taynish National Nature Reserve runs until Sunday September 30.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 21","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 27/05/18, 5:12 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,Many thanks to Robert Wakeham, writing in last week’s Advertiser, for his questions regarding the nesting colony and status of common gulls within the former oil depot, currently the Mid Argyll hub and museum construction site.I am happy to address these questions.Historically, this species was first named in the 1700s and thought by many to come from their association with grazing or ‘common land’ and in the more recent past the name ‘uncommon gull’ may be more apt.In the UK they are essentially restricted as a breeding species to Scotland where numbers continue to decline, with this being reflected in Argyll, principally due to predation by the American mink, as pointed out.Studies at the Lingerton landfill site have shown that, unlike the larger gull species at the tip, Common Gulls do not scavenge there, as was perhaps claimed, but use the tidal mud flats of Loch Gilp and surrounding fields to find invertebrates, fish and vegetarian foodstuffs. As with other gull species which are opportunist in diet, junk food and bits of plastic provided by us humans can be inadvertently consumed.Over many years the Gleaner oil depot, which has a concrete bund in case of oil spillage, has provided a safe nesting site for around 20 pairs. The suggestion that this colony could easily find an alternative site is perhaps wishful thinking as suitable sites nearby in Mid Argyll are already occupied by other gull species or don’t have the required habitat features.Thankfully, however, this should not prove necessary. Following a productive on-site meeting last week with the Scottish Canals\u0026#8217 environmental scientist, the project architect and TSL contractors we noted 10-15 birds sitting on eggs and unaffected by the work going on around them.Planned works over the coming weeks should not affect these gulls, Oystercatchers or Black Guillemots from nesting and will also not impede the building work which is scheduled to be completed by next spring.The Mid Argyll hub project and new canal museum will largely reflect the social and cultural heritage of the Crinan Canal, but should also encompass the important and often decreasing natural history of the Crinan Canal corridor. These breeding birds are also a part of this and should not just be something to ‘chase off’ to somewhere else.Excellent viewing and educational opportunities from the new build will be possible to watch this colony raise their chicks as well as providing a point to lookout for other wildlife on the loch.Nearby, the tidal estuary of Loch Gilp provides us with an often highly under-valued unofficial nature reserve that links Ardrishaig with Lochgilphead, which in winter hosts important numbers of duck and waders, in summer includes breeding Eider ducks and Common Terns and during migration is a vital stopping off point during adverse weather for passage Whooper swans, Brent geese and Black-tailed Godwits to name a few.Increasingly good work is being undertaken by locals and the Phoenix Trust to help clear up some of the increasing amounts of shoreline rubbish.Keep up the good work!Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,I have been out and about Islay the past week speaking to my constituents, visiting local businesses and monitoring the roads department\u0026#8217s progress with road repairs.Unfortunately CalMac management\u0026#8217s shocking handling of our local ferry service is really taking it\u0026#8217s toll on many local businesses that depend heavily of Islay\u0026#8217s growing tourist trade. We simply cannot allow CalMac to continue to make the same errors every year without consequences.On another subject, I have been unimpressed with our local roads department management\u0026#8217s sluggish response to a large number of complaints from local residents and myself about the plague of potholes scattered across Islay.There are many roads across Islay that have some potholes marked to be filled while others remain unmarked despite them in many cases being side by side. This scattershot approach to pothole repairs is as random as it is ineffective.In the future we will need to see a more long term resurfacing solution to our local roads with less short term, random and piecemeal patchwork.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,In the run up to National Volunteering Week (June 1- 7), Cats Protection would like to extend our thanks to the many thousands of volunteers throughout the country who offer their time and expertise to help cats and kittens across the UK.In 2017, our 10,200-strong volunteer network contributed an incredible 5.5 million hours, each volunteer gifting a wealth of expertise and immeasurable passion to the charity. Their dedication enabled Cats Protection to help around 200,000 cats and kittens nationwide.Cats Protection is always on the lookout for new volunteers to join the UK’s biggest cat community. Though a large part of our work is helping cats, through fostering and rehoming, our volunteers have the opportunity to become involved with a range of interesting activities such as organising fundraising events, helping with publicity or managing funds and resources to benefit the greatest amount of cats.Volunteering can offer the chance to develop skills such as time management, interpersonal skills and teamwork, making CVs much more attractive and, of course, helping cats.Anyone who is interested in becoming a volunteer can go to our website www.cats.org.uk/get- involved/volunteering  to find out more.Julie Meredith, head of volunteering development, Cats Protection,Sir,I really love being active, especially the feeling after and that’s why I’m supporting Bowel Cancer UK and Beating Bowel Cancer’s latest fundraising campaign to get sponsored to do 30 minutes of physical activity for 30 days in June.Step up for 30 is a fantastic way for you to be more physically active to reduce your risk of bowel cancer – the UK’s second biggest cancer killer.

Highland females lead the way with 94, with Shetland females closely behind with 84.In 2009 the show separated the Welsh C and Welsh D classes due to increasing demand, and that has proved to be winning formula with record entries again this year, with 43 and 59 respectively.Royal Highland Show Manager David Jackson, said: \u0026#8216The Highland continues to be the leading event for showcasing the very best the livestock industry has to offer, and it extremely rewarding that the industry continues to recognise its importance as a platform for the sector.\u0026#8216We continue to see very strong entries, with increasing numbers in many sections, especially in the commercial classes, and I know we will see some fierce competition for a winning place.\u0026#8216As an event, we grow year on year and attract new audiences as we widen the appeal for visitors from town and country. Yet we remain true to our roots as an agricultural show and work hard to be truly relevant to all aspects of farming and rural life.\u0026#8216The Grand Parade always proves to be a high point of the show and gives us a chance to celebrate the commitment and dedication of all our cattle and heavy horse exhibitors. I recommend everyone to make time to observe this truly spectacular display.\u0026#8216The team look forward to welcoming all our exhibitors, from the Scottish islands to South West England to Northern Ireland. They are dedicated to their craft, and I am extremely grateful for their continued support and wish them all the best of luck.\u0026#8217Supported by Royal Bank of Scotland, the 178th Royal Highland Show will take place at the Royal Highland Centre, Ingliston, Edinburgh, on June 21-24.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 26","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 02/06/18, 3:08 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.What a spell of weather we have had over the past week and more.Knowing the Argyll climate, by the time you read this you might be sitting in a blizzard in front of the fire enjoying your paper but it was good while it lasted.Welcome as it is, warm weather brings its own problems.

He said: “I don’t know what the future holds yet, mainly because we didn’t know what league we were going to be in. “We haven’t even spoke about it yet — we are still focused on the celebrations, to be honest.”  “The fans have been incredible all season and have always turned out in big numbers. “Especially away to Alloa, the turnout was just amazing. “The support have been amazing with me and have taken a real shine to me. “I have played well for Ayr and the fans have obviously recognised that, and it’s good to play for those fans. “This is my highest scoring season, but I was gutted not to get 30. “Although if I had a chance to get 30 it would have been in the play-offs, so I was happy to stay at 29.” "},{"url":null,"title":"ayr uniteds ian mccall lawrence","story":"NewsAyr United\u0027s Ian McCall and Lawrence Shankland bag Ladbrokes awardsIt comes after Ayr United won the League One title, with an impressive 124 goals in all competitions.\u0026nbspShareByLochlin Highet15:23, 9 MAY 2018NewsAyr United manager Ian McCall and striker Lawrence Shankland win the Ladbrokes League 1 Manager and Player of the Year awards (Image: SNS Group)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAyr United manager Ian McCall and striker Lawrence Shankland have bagged an awards double.

Shankland, 22, told the Ayrshire Post: “It’s a great club to be a part of. The main thing for this decision is that I am enjoying my football. The gaffer has been great with me and that’s why I came here. He gave me a chance to get back into football. I am happy and I don’t think there’s any amount of money that beats happiness. The fans have taken to me and that gives you confidence going into every game you play. Shankland smashed 29 goals en route to being named League One\u0027s player of the year as Ayr won the title.  Boss Ian McCall said: Lawrence could have doubled his money elsewhere and had offers from the Premiership up here and League One down in England. But the affection he has had from our supporters has played a huge part in his decision. It’s a huge piece of business for this club. Be in no doubt that Lawrence could easily have gone, but he has made a footballing decision. It is a big, big signing which shows our intent and now we need the fans to respond with an upsurge in season ticket sales.

The pair are both from Kilmarnock. “We met in the Brass \u0026amp Granite in 2010 at a pub quiz,” said Erin. “I worked part time in Tesco while studying and Stuart would come in and chat to me on a Sunday when he wasn’t offshore. “It wasn’t until 2015 when my gran met Stuart at a wedding and told him that I was single that he finally plucked up the courage to ask me on a date! “Stuart invited me to his house where he cooked me a lovely meal and the romance started. We moved in together early 2016 and then Stuart proposed whilst we were on holiday in Dubai in September 2016. “He bought me a pair of Valentino shoes and got down on one knee to put them on for me before pulling out my beautiful engagement ring that he’d designed himself and had made by a jeweller in Dubai.  The couple tied the knot on Saturday, February 24 this year, with the ceremony held at Glasgow University Memorial Chapel and the reception at Boclair House in Bearsden. Erin said: “It was a nice contrast of traditional and modern glam. “We were so lucky getting a beautiful crisp sunny day - right before the Beast from the East came later that week. “Stuart and I wrote our own ceremony and personalised vows. “We ended the night with [I want to spend my] Life with You by The Proclaimers. “It really was a perfect day and more than we could of dreamed of! The bride wore Everlasting by Caroline Castigliano, from The Bridal Garden in Glasgow, with her bridesmaids wearing customised blush Haley Paige dresses from Anne Priscilla, Glasgow.  Groom Stuart wore an Arran Mist kilt and plaid with matching navy jacket and gold tie. And the groomsmen wore Arran Mist tartan kilts with charcoal jackets and gold ties - exclusive to MacGregor \u0026amp MacDuff in Prestwick. The bridal party consisted of chief bridesmaid Eilidh McKenzie and bridesmaids Lynsey Ross, Raina Purba and Kirsteen Havlin. Making up the rest of the wedding party were best man Craig Marshall, ushers Les Lawrie, Dean Wear and Torin McKenzie, mother of the bride Una McKenzie and parents of the groom Yvonne and Fraser Murray. The couple celebrated being newlyweds with a trip to the sunshine. Erin said: “We squeezed in 10 nights in at the Centara Ras Fushi resort in the Maldives before Stuart went offshore again. “It was paradise! Our villa was right on the beach so it was perfect for watching the sunset.  Thistle \u0026amp Blink Photography from Kilmarnock captured the couple’s big day, leaving them with fond memories to relive. Emma Lawson of Betty Bluebell, based in East Kilbride, pieced together the bouquets with Ashley Nimmo, Ellis Dewhurst and Jett Paterson of Allure in Kilmarnock creating the hair and beauty looks for the day. As for their cake, the couple opted for four-tiers with all their favourite flavours, including red velvet. A local lady called Gianna made the cake, completed with a handmade topper by friend Rachel Currie. Erin added: “We would like to say a huge thank you to our families, bridesmaids and groomsmen for their help in the planning and execution of our dream wedding- it couldn’t have gone better! “Thank you to everyone who shared in our special day, your generosity and well wishes have been overwhelming.

Community leaders in Stranraer, desperate to lick their own sand back in shape, want to use the South Ayrshire model of success. It follows Prestwick’s hard fought battle to convince council bosses to clean up their rubble-strewn shore. Norrie Smith, vice chair of Prestwick South Community Council, performed the role of special envoy on a trip down the coast. He said: “The guys down there were very keen to talk to us about how we went about things. “Their problem is slightly different in terms of what they need to clean up, but the premise is the same. “They’ve got a fantastic community asset, much like ours, and it’s just about returning it to its rightful state and making the most of it.”  While weeds and silt are dogging Stranraer’s shoreline, Prestwick is facing the ongoing battle of mounting rubble. Already, more than 500 tonnes has been removed from the beach since council diggers were sent in to level the sand. Norrie added: “We’re delighted that our example has been recognised elsewhere. “People in this town campaigned long and hard to get where we are now, and if we can help others by sharing best practice then great. “I’m all for collaboration, whether it’s in your own town or further afield, so linking up like this can only be a positive thing.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"south ayrshire council bosses urged","story":"NewsSouth Ayrshire Council bosses urged to throw Ayr United a title partyCalls are mounting for civic head, Helen Moonie, to hold a bash at County Buildings, following Ayr’s first league title in 21 years.\u0026nbspShareByStuart Wilson12:11, 9 MAY 2018NewsAyr United title celebrations (Image: SNS Group)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailCouncil bosses have been urged to throw Ayr United’s champions an official party. Calls are mounting for civic head, Helen Moonie, to hold a bash at County Buildings, following Ayr’s first league title in 21 years. But the request could be snubbed in favour of a joint sporting celebration, the Post understands. A request for the engagement, lodged in the aftermath of Ayr’s success, is being considered by officials. Former cop Alasdair Malcolm, now a volunteer at Somerset Park, has called for the recognition. He said: “Every effort should be made to mark this fantastic achievement. “Ayr United are an integral part of the local community and, particularly through their Academy programme, have close working relationships throughout local schools and community groups. “The club, which has been a feature of the town since 1910, have had an outstanding season.” Ayr became the first club in the UK to score 100 goals in domestic competition en route to their title.  And their championship was the first to be clinched on home soil for 90 years. Mr Malcolm, secretary of the Ayrshire Golf Association, said: “It would be fitting if the local authority, by way of a civic reception or similar event, would mark the achievement of the management, players, officials and staff.” South Ayrshire Tory leader, Martin Dowey, added: “It is a wonderful achievement and one that is worthy of a civic reception. “A prosperous Ayr United is good for the town and we will be calling on all councillors to recognise the title win.” However, it’s believed there may be other invites on the guest list of any civic celebration. Carrick Rugby Club, three-time winners of the BT National Shield, and Commonwealth gold medallist Paul Foster, are among those in their thoughts. A council spokesman said: “A request has been received and will be considered in line with our civic hospitality guidelines.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"win a summer shopping spree","story":"NewsWin a summer shopping spreeTo help you get fashion and beauty- ready for summer, Debenhams at Ayr Central are hosting a fabulous VIP shopping event on Thursday June 7.\u0026nbspShareByAyrshire Post10:35, 30 MAY 2018Updated10:36, 30 MAY 2018NewsGet ready for summer and be in with a chance of winning a shopping spree\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailWIN A SUMMER SHOPPING SPREE!

The firm, based in Lincolnshire, will make its first foray into Ayrshire when the store opens its doors. Its nearest outlet is currently more than 40 miles away at Abbotsinch, near Paisley. The addition comes as a welcome boost for park bosses, who are set to lose three retailers this year. Homebase will bow out on June 24, joining Carpetright and Maplin on the casualty list. The departures will see 50,000sq ft of trading space lost. However, Alastair Dickie, director at Heathfield’s developers Ediston Properties, said: “This is a positive piece of business. “Wren are an expanding company and this represents their first store in Ayrshire.  “They clearly view Ayr as a place to be and we are happy to have them on board. “It will mean jobs, not only in store but indirectly for fitters.” Wren will move into the unit vacated by the former PC World. The firm, which was founded in 2009, employs more than 4000 staff. It comes as park bosses prepare to seal a deal with another new name on site. Mr Dickie added: “Since acquiring the park we’ve let out ten units and don’t anticipate stopping there.” Ediston bought Heathfield in 2011 in a deal worth \u0026pound31.8 million. Retail giants such as M\u0026ampS, DFS and Costa have all moved in as part of the park’s overhaul in the intervening years.

This must have been a favoured site well-placed beside a coaching inn on the main road North.\nThe 1860s saw the further development of the railways begun five years previously.\nBefore this Peebles lived up to its reputation of being, \u0026ldquoAs quiet as the grave or as Peebles. With the railways came industry and people and money.\nCommercial Peebles began to develop and the Northgate was no exception. Up until then the Northgate was little more than the road out of town with several pastoral tofts strung out along it. Laird Girdwood, was a larger-than-life character and also one of the prominent proprietors. He was also a member of the Peeblesshire Rifle Volunteers.\nThen as now, such organisations accommodate a little social networking.\nIt is not surprising then that Charles Ker, also a Volunteer and his sister acquired one of these tofts from a comrade. Meanwhile James Ker lived with his wife at Red Lion House in Biggiesknowe. Their toft was more than half an acre in size with a barn whose gable end faced the street and a single-storey cottage attached. Parts of the barn were rebuilt\ninto a new dwelling house.\nThe barn itself is not without interest being the one scene of Laird Girdwood\u0026rsquos Venison Feast to which all the residents of the Northgate were invited everyone, however, to bring his own beverage.\nIt was a resounding success\u0026mdash\u0026ldquoNever before did the rafters ring with such glee. was the reported account of the event.\nA traditional forge and a modern purpose-built engineering workshop were built as well as a \u0026lsquospec\u0026rsquo tenement of four dwellings.\nWrought iron work was much in evidence, with a large garden behind and a rustic rockery at the front of the property. It was then given the name \u0026lsquoKer Place\u0026rsquo after the fashion of the time for such businessmen of which there are several examples in Peebles.\nThe cottage (pre 1823), which is still in place, became part of the enterprise and judging by the size of the lathe bed and fire-scorched rafters some serious work went on there.\nIt also incorporated James Ker\u0026rsquos dispensary for his veterinary work. James had been a student of William Dick at his Edinburgh Veterinary College which he had established at his father\u0026rsquos forge in Clyde Street in Edinburgh where the bus station now stands.\nHe obtained his diploma to practice as a veterinary surgeon and was also made a Fellow of the Edinburgh Medical Veterinary Society for his \u0026ldquovaluable contribution to veterinary science. This may have been in connection with a product he sold commercially as \u0026lsquoKer\u0026rsquos Alterative Sheep Pill\u0026rsquo.\nIt must have been effective since it was still being sold in the 1930s by his son, John Ker. He, also a blacksmith, had qualified as a veterinary surgeon nearly forty years after his father at what was by then called the Royal \u0026ldquoDick Veterinary College.\nJames and his wife died at a young age and his brother and sister, Charles and Elizabeth, carried on the business successfully as well as raising James\u0026rsquos family of two boys.\nJohn Ker, as said, served his apprenticeship as a blacksmith and also qualified as a veterinary surgeon. About 1916 the smiddy closed when the farriers went to war.\nJohn Ker served as a captain with the Royal Army Veterinary Corps and on his return practiced locally as a veterinary surgeon until he died after a short illness towards the end of 1938. The smiddy, itself, \u0026ldquodid its bit during hostilities, by billeting troops.\nIt did not reopen after the war and operate at its former level of business as blacksmiths and engineers. It did, however, remain in general use and is currently a joiner\u0026rsquos workshop.\nJohn Ker was also the last \u0026ldquoBoxmaster (minute secretary) of the Peebles Incorporation of Hammermen\u0026mdashthe blacksmiths\u0026rsquo once exclusive and powerful guild.\nIt fell to him to record in the minutes, rather regretfully, \u0026ldquoThere was no meeting and no dinner held in 1927\u0026mdashfitting, his forebear had been one of the founding signatories we believe. Times had changed, the calling had lost its prosperous and confident ambience, and that was a fact.\nThese events resonate with the story of Black Beauty\u0026rsquos life over a hundred years ago in Victorian England.\nSome of his memories were happy and some were very sad, none less so than those when he meets his old friend Ginger . . .\n"},{"url":null,"title":"40 week one-way system introduced in Jedburgh","story":"A TEMPORARY one-way system has been in introduced in Jedburgh to allow work to be carried out to a privately-owned dangerous building.\nThe new arrangement, which began on Monday (June 4), has seen a section of the High Street become one-way southbound from Jewellers Wynd to Canongate southbound, and a section of Exchange Street one-way northbound from High Street to Friarsgate.\nThis one-way system is required to extend scaffolding onto the road to allow for repairs to be carried out to the building, which has significant structural issues and needs extensive work to make it safe.\nThe disruption is expected to last 40 weeks, and a temporary walkway has also been introduced around the scaffolding to allow pedestrians to still use High Street and Exchange Street.\nSignage is in place to make people aware of the temporary arrangement.\nA joint statement by Jedburgh and District councillors Jim Brown, Scott Hamilton, Sandy Scott said: \u0026ldquoThe High Street dangerous building is a complex and long running issue, but the council is making progress and needs to introduce this temporary one-way system to carry out further repairs.\n\u0026ldquoThe council is looking at various options for the future of the building, and a report is expected to be discussed later this year.\n\u0026ldquoWe thank townsfolk for their patience so far, and would ask they comply with the temporary one-way system.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"Briton in Guatemala    fortunate    to avoid erupting volcano","story":"A Briton who climbed the neighbouring peak to a volcano in Guatemala a day before at least 25 people were killed in an eruption has told how he feels \u0026ldquofortunate to have escaped harm.\nHundreds of people were injured when the Volcan de Fuego (Volcano of Fire) exploded shortly before noon on Sunday, spewing ash and molten rock over nearby villages.\nAround 27 miles away in Guatemala City, the capital\u0026rsquos international airport was forced to close, with images showing planes dusted with volcanic material.\nThe Foreign Office has told Britons visiting and living near the capital, the city of Antigua and areas near the volcano to keep up to date with local officials\u0026rsquo advice.\nRichard Fitz-Hugh, a backpacker from Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire, spoke to the Press Association from ash-covered Antigua, around 11 miles from the erupting volcano.\nLava dust from the Volcan de Fuego, in Guatemala (Richard Fitz-Hugh/PA)\nThe 24-year-old trekked to the base camp of Acatenango, which lies around two miles from the deadly Volcan de Fuego, on Saturday.\n\u0026ldquoIt was fine then, erupting as normal with lava flows but it was a lot worse today, he said.\n\u0026ldquoWe heard about six people who were killed and more who were injured, that was at the foot of the volcano.\n\u0026ldquoWe also heard there were a couple of people who were coming down (from Acatenango) early this morning when it started raining small volcanic rocks up to the size of your palm.\nTourists can take guided tours up the Volcan de Fuego\u0026rsquos neighbour to view the frequent volcanic activity.\n\u0026ldquoWe knew it was active, it\u0026rsquos all part of the experience, you go up and see the lava, that\u0026rsquos the point of climbing Acatenango, Mr Fitz-Hugh said.\n\u0026ldquoI don\u0026rsquot know anyone who has been physically harmed (on Acatenango), but obviously it wouldn\u0026rsquot be completely safe being up high today \u0026ndash I\u0026rsquom sort of fortunate that I did it before.\nDespite its relative proximity to the deadly volcano and ash covering cars, roads and buildings, life appeared to be continuing as normal in Antigua.\n\u0026ldquoIn the town ash came down for about two hours mid-morning and shortly in the afternoon and it sort of mixed in the rain, he said.\n\u0026ldquoEveryone is really calm, there\u0026rsquos a business that is still open.

any trees rubbish or other obstacles that may have fallen into the river, or been washed down stream, after the winter spates, which would block or obstruct the seatrout and salmon run.Salmon and seatrout need overhanging trees and shrubs for cover and can hide from their many predators, so it is important that the cutting of overhanging trees is done with the utmost care.Members only remove and trim anything that interferes with the fish having a stress free run up river or which blocks pools to the extent that the river could start to erode its banks.This has the bonus of making the pool more accessible for anglers to cast flies or spinners.The river clearing is not only for the anglers benefit all sizes of bushes and trees are washed down stream and can also be washed out to sea causing problems for trawlers which may catch them in their nets.Carradale angling club also have the fishing on Tangy loch which has a good stock of wild brown trout.The loch provides early season fishing for members and visitors, who are waiting for the right conditions to fish the river, and for anglers who only fish on still water.The trout season started on March 15 and the loch has been fishing well with members reporting some very good catches.In May every tide gives anglers an early chance to catch seatrout and the tidal water is always worth a go even when the river is at summer

Immediately Jewson Campbeltown chipped in for a couple, leaving 13 up for grabs.CDJFA said a small part of this will help towards the running costs of the festival.
