She said those who have yet to fix a bubble to be in, should not form one now.In her daily briefing she said: \u0027The safest way to spend Christmas this year for you and those you love is to stay in your own household and your own home.\u0027My strong recommendation is that this is what you should do if at all possible.\u0027Any interaction you do have with another household should if at all possible be outdoors, but if you do consider it essential indoors with someone from another household you should limit both the duration and numbers as much as possible.\u0027The five-day relaxation is a window of opportunity during which you can meet, it is not a period that we think it is safe or sensible to get together for. You should see it as a maximum, not a target.\u0027My recommendation is that if you do form a bubble you should not meet up with people in it any more than on one day over that period, if possible, and you should not stay overnight unless it is unavoidable.\u0027You should also limit numbers as far as possible, three households is a maximum that tries to account for the fact that families come in all shapes and sizes, but two would be better.\u0027In short if you have to form a bubble keep it as small as possible.\u0027Mr Drakeford told the Welsh Government briefing: \u0027Here in Wales, the position is that only two households should come together to form an exclusive Christmas bubble during the five-day period.\u0027The fewer people we mix with in our homes, the less chance we have of catching or spreading the virus.\u0027None of us wants to be ill this Christmas. And we don\u0027t want to give coronavirus to our close family or friends.\u0027The Chief Medical Officer for Wales has provided special advice for people who were previously shielding about mixing over Christmas.\u0027Two leading medical journals had warned keeping to the five-day plan was a \u0027major error that will cost many lives\u0027.But ministers decided it would be unfair to penalise the whole country because of concerns about surging cases in London and the South East.And there were warnings that any attempt to ban Christmas would be impossible to enforce, with police chiefs already warning officers would not get involved in \u0027policing people\u0027s Christmas dinners\u0027.WHOEurope | Minimizing the COVID-19 risk: advice to iniduals, communities and governments for the winter holidays"},{"url":null,"title":"Coronavirus UK new rules Christmas bubbles UK","story":"Share this articleCan my bubble have Christmas dinner together at the pub?No. Under the rules Christmas bubbles cannot meet up at indoor settings such as pubs, hotels, retail businesses, theatres or restaurants.In England, rules on who you can and cannot meet will still depend on which tier of restrictions a venue is in.Can I stay in a hotel during Christmas?In England, you can stay in a hotel during the Christmas period, including in a tier three area, but only on your own or with members of your household.When do I have to decide my bubble by?The Government have advised people to decide on their bubble by this Friday.

It came in the final match of the season, away at Chelsea, as the Reds secured a 1-0 victory to win the league title at Everton’s expense. Dalglish controlled a looping through-ball on his chest and laced a sweet right-foot volley into the far corner – “an unerring finish” in the words of commentator John Motson – before wheeling away in celebration. Dalglish inspired ongoing success, primarily from the dugout, and by his final appearance in 1990 he had netted 169 times in 502 appearances for Liverpool.

However, the pandemic has drastically altered usual spending trends and the British economy has been struggling to escape the deepest recession for more than 300 years.Falling food and drink prices also dragged down the inflation rate by the most since 2017, driven by goods such as vegetables and confectionery. These were partially offset by rising prices for games, toys and hobbies.Jonathan Athow, the deputy national statistician for economic statistics at the ONS, said: “With significant restrictions in place across the UK, inflation slowed, predominantly due to clothing and food prices.

British fund manager Ruffer Investment Management last month made a bet on bitcoin now worth around £550m ($745m), a spokesman for the company told Reuters, in one of the largest signals of rising institutional interest in the digital currency this year. The allocation by Ruffer, which managed £20.3bn ($27.3bn) in assets at end-November on behalf of more than 6,500 investors globally, “acts as a hedge to some of the risks that we see in a fragile monetary system and distorted financial markets,” the spokesman said via email.Ruffer’s move is being seen as confirmation that institutions are taking bitcoin seriously as an asset class -- one of the factors behind this year’s rally.Yoni Assia, CEO and co-founder of trading platform eToro, says financial institutions have “woken up” to cryptocurrencies this year, with many banks and hedge funds buying bitcoin during 2020.We expect this to continue into 2021 as fears of inflation continue to creep up globally.Back in October, JP Morgan analysts suggested that bitcoin could challenge gold as an alternative currency, especially among younger investors, suggesting that it could double or triple (it was $13k at the time). Three years earlier, CEO Jamie Dimon was more sceptical, saying bitcoin was a “fraud” (it was around $4,100 then).Sterling isn’t the only asset rallying today.Cryptocurrency bitcoin has smashed through the $20,000 mark for the first time ever.Bitcoin has been rallying sharply since the spring (when it briefly fell below $5,000). Several institutional investors have backed cryptocurrencies this year, while Paypal is also embracing bitcoin.Nigel Green, founder and CEO of financial advisers deVere, explains“Unlike previous surges, this time around, a major price driver seems to be fuelled by the flow of institutional investors, who are steadily increasing their exposure to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.“They’re being attracted by the good returns that the digital asset class is currently offering but, more importantly, by the huge future potential it offers.“As some of the world’s biggest institutions – amongst them multinational payment companies and Wall Street giants - pile ever more into crypto, bringing with them their enormous expertise and capital, this in turn, swells consumer interest.”Bitcoin’s supporters also argue that it protects against inflation, triggered by the huge asset-purchase programmes launched by central bankers such as the Federal Reserve. “These emergency measures, like the massive money-printing agenda, reduce the value of traditional currencies like the dollar and raise the inflation threat. Bitcoin, like gold, acts as a shield.”Today’s surge comes almost exactly three years since bitcoin hit $19,000 for the first time ever, before then falling sharply through 2018.The pound has now dipped back slightly from its 31-month high of $1.355, after Downing Street told reporters that No-Deal remains the most likely outcome, although “some progress” has been made.Reuters has the details: Britain and the European Union have made “some progress” in post-Brexit trade talks but there are still significant gaps and the most likely outcome is for negotiations to end in no deal, Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s spokesman said on Wednesday.“We have made some progress in some areas but it still remains that there significant gaps,” the spokesman told reporters. “Our position is still that we want to reach an FTA (free trade agreement) but it is still the case ... the most likely outcome is still leaving on Australia terms.”Australia does not have a free trade agreement with the EU, meaning the bulk of its trade is on World Trade Organization terms.But the pound’s still clinging on above $1.35, and up around three cents since Johnson and Von der Leyen agreed to keep negotiating on Sunday.Here’s our news story on the problems caused by the disruption at UK ports.Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at Think Markets, suggests a UK-EU free trade deal could push the pound up to $1.40.No-deal, though, could send it sliding down to $1.20.Ursula von der Leyen this morning said that now there is a “narrow” path has opened up for the two sides to strike a deal.Although the EU Commission President stopped shy of saying whether there will be a deal or not as the issue of fishing rights are “still very difficult”, she added that there was progress on most outstanding issues At over $1.35 against the dollar, the pound is trading near levels where a Brexit deal is being ‘priced in’ by investors.That meant it’s all the more vulnerable if negotiations falter, as Paul Dales of Capital Economics explains:The recent swings in sterling triggered by shifts in sentiment towards the chances of a Brexit deal have left little room for the pound to appreciate if there’s a deal, but plenty of room for it to depreciate if there’s a no dealAs the markets appear to have largely priced in a Brexit deal, such a result by 31st December 2020 would be unlikely to push the pound much above the current levels of $1.35 and €1.13. But as a no deal would come as something of a shock to the markets, there is more scope for it to fall sharply. The pound has hit its highest level since May 2018, as optimism over a Brexit deal builds.Sterling has climbed nearly a cent to trade at $1.355, a 31-month high, after European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen told MEPs this morning that “there is a path to an agreement now”, saying: “As things stand, I cannot tell you whether there will be a deal or not. But I can tell you that there is a path to an agreement now. The path may be very narrow but it is there. This has pushed the pound above the highs seen earlier this month.Investor seem more optimistic about a deal being achieved, even though von der Leyen also warned that fishing rights are still an obstacle.Neil Wilson of Markets explains that traders seem to be pricing in a deal....Sterling jumped on hopes the UK and EU are close to a deal, with Ursula von der Leyen giving a broadly upbeat assessment of talks.The spot market is inclined to think a deal is coming, while options markets also show traders are scaling back bets on a no-deal collapse. Time is desperately short, though, and MPs may have to delay their break to get any legislation though, as the Financial Times points out:Some Conservative Eurosceptic MPs have indicated they could tolerate the deal taking shape. Jacob Rees-Mogg, leader of the House of Commons, is clearing the decks to legislate on the details of a deal at breakneck speed.Mr Rees-Mogg has not moved a “recess motion”, suggesting that plans for parliament to rise for its Christmas break on Thursday have been scrapped.“It’s highly likely we’ll be sitting next week,” said one senior government official.

So it’s not surprising that lockdown has left a third of children feeling more worried or stressed, according to a recent poll conducted by YouGov on behalf of Barnardo’s.Another survey by YouGov, for Public Health England (PHE), found that more than half of parents with children aged five to 18 said that their primary concern for their children was their mental wellbeing. Almost a quarter of parents said that not knowing what action to take had prevented them supporting their children’s mental wellbeing. PHE recommends establishing a routine and encouraging children to indulge in their interests and hobbies to help counteract this.Laura Maher, an education lecturer from Warwickshire, says play is central in developing the holistic wellbeing of the child and that it can help assuage anxiety during stressful times. “With an ever-increasing focus on formal learning, it’s more important than ever for adults to see the educational value in play,” she says.Playing not only provides a welcome distraction but also helps build resilience and coping mechanisms, says Dr Genevieve von Lob, a clinical psychologist and author. “Play is like breathing to children. It’s essential for processing emotions, building resilience and to give them a sense of control,” she says. “Playtime offers ideal opportunities for children to express natural emotion such as anger, sadness or happiness in a safe environment and explore their identities in relation to their peers, their family and the world.”It’s through play, especially role-play, that children reveal what is going on in their inner world, says von Lob. “Children will often role-play different characters and give their dolls or teddies the voice they are unable to express themselves because their feelings are too confusing. This can help them feel powerful in a world where they often feel small and powerless.”Sarah Bouchie, LEGO Foundation’s vice president of global programmes, says play also helps children strengthen their relationships with the people around them and reinforces bonding. “I have friends who say it can be hard to find the time to sit down and play with their child, but we can incorporate play into day-to-day life, such as counting the steps or singing a song on the way to school. Little things like this can make a real difference,” she says.Von Lob believes unstructured, free play is one of the most effective ways children can learn to socialise and interact with others. “Playing creates a sense of belonging to the group and feeling part of a community,” she says. “Children learn to communicate, negotiate, share and cooperate through play. As they mature, they learn teamwork, collaboration, and taking the perspectives of others.”It’s clear that children recognise how play can help calm them. Sophie Clark-Venner, an early years specialist and founder of MontiSensory, says her nine-year-old son, Sebastian, realises how beneficial playing can be.“I discussed what playing teaches us with Sebastian and he said ‘resilience’. He said: ‘You can spend a long time building something amazing and then put the final piece on and it gets knocked down by your brother and you have to start again, but that’s OK because the second time you build it, it will be even better!’”Clark-Venner says play is crucial to a child’s physical development. “As adults we know the benefits of exercise both for our bodies and our minds,” she explains. “Children have an innate drive to get up and move their bodies. They love to move. Dancing or playing at the park are fun and natural for them but what’s underneath all that is their bodies saying ‘get up, move about, strengthen your muscles, fine tune your balance and coordination’.”Bouchie says it’s never been more important for parents to play with their children. “Children pick up on more than we think they do about what’s going on in the world, so now, while we’re going through such change, is the time for us to connect and engage with them,” she says. “We know that playing with children helps them to develop their social and emotional skills, which are key to reducing stress in difficult situations. If we can help them increase these executive functions, we can help give them a sense of control and joy during this time of uncertainty.”The LEGO Foundation has developed a free online course, Coping with Changes: Social-Emotional Learning Through Play, to help give primary caregivers and teachers knowledge and ideas on how to boost children’s social and emotional wellbeing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f072699415fcd7d88a5ff76e32ed5eb6d91d3c4/0_182_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026s=542f2174bf7514b81d9caacac37b1c1a","title":"alaska sealife center aslc pandemic","story":"Alaska SeaLife Center is the only facility in the state that rehabilitates aquatic animals – but the future of the 22-year-old center appeared uncertain this yearWhen Pushki was brought to his new home on 12 November, he was scared, dangerously skinny and severely dehydrated. The two-week-old sea otter pup had been found crying on the beach in Homer, Alaska, seemingly having been separated from his mother. He needed help, fast.Now, nearly a month later, he’s running the show at the Alaska SeaLife Center (ASLC), an aquatic rehabilitation, scientific research and education facility in Seward, Alaska. The young sea otter, whose name captures his mischievous spirit (Pushki is another name for the Alaskan plant known as a cow parsnip, which can sometimes cause burns), has been keeping his veterinary team busy with his playful baby antics.“He’s incredibly lucky to have this second chance at life,” said Lisa Hartman, the ASLC husbandry director. “If we weren’t here, he likely wouldn’t be either.”But earlier this year, the research center seemed like the one in trouble. The ASLC is the only facility in the state that rehabilitates aquatic animals, and has a zoo and aquarium that are open to the public in a normal summer, the center sees more than 160,000 visitors, largely from out of state. This year – because the vast majority of Alaska’s summer tourists come in on cruise ships, all of which were canceled due to the pandemic – it saw only a fourth of it normal numbers.The future of the 22-year-old center – and the more than 4,000 creatures it houses – appeared uncertain. On 13 July, the ASLC announced they would be forced to close permanently unless they were able to raise $2m by the end of September.Their plea resonated: by 1 October they had raised $4m, over half of which came from inidual donors. Tara Riemer, CEO and president, said while they’re not yet operating at their prior level, at least they will remain open and be able to continue caring for their animals and conducting important research through the winter.With several species of seals, a few sea lions, myriad fish and an assortment of marine birds, the ASLC has made a name for itself as a bustling aquarium in small-town Seward (population: 2,700). But it also punches well above its weight in the global conservation and science arenas.The animals cared for at the center – some of which, like Pushki, have just been rescued and others which have been living there for much longer – have helped inform the greater aquatic and arctic research.One of the center’s newest studies is looking at ice seals, who historically haven’t been studied as rigorously by the scientific community as some of their aquatic peers. Studying the seals, as the ice they reside on melts due to global warming, helps give researchers an understanding of “what’s happening with our environment and our ecosystems in real time”, according to Hartman.“We’ve been able to gather information that nobody else has been able to gather before,” said Hartman.Their longest-running study began more than 20 years ago, when Steller sea lions became listed as endangered. By examining a nearby rookery over multiple generations, researchers have been able to study what threatens their existence. In the time since, they have learned about what makes for a successful breeding period for the Steller sea lions and what are some of the biggest obstacles for the juveniles to make it to adulthood.“You get an incredibly different perspective by watching them over so many years,” said John Maniscalco, the lead scientist of the study since its inception. “A lot of studies don’t last this long. You’re not going to get that understanding of how things are changing in one year versus five, 10 or 20 years.”The center is the only facility in the state capable of rehabilitating aquatic animals – the few other animal facilities in the state have a different focus. The closest facility that could take sick or hurt Alaska animals is a 44-hour drive (or several hours of driving and multiple flight connections) away in Vancouver, Canada, and getting permits to export animals is challenging. For animals rescued in poor shape, waiting that long is often not an option.The ASLC is also the only oiled wildlife response center in the state – meaning that, in the event of an oil spill, they had be tasked with organizing animal clean-up efforts.The ASLC hopes to empower other centers to take action if and when animals need to be rehabilitated: in recent years, the ASLC has started training professionals at zoos and aquariums nationwide on how to respond to animals that have encountered oil spills. They’re the only place in the country that offers that training.“If we were not here there would not be a resource to help train people, nor would there be a group of trained professionals locally that can immediately be deployed,” Hartman said. “Those first 72 hours are critical in getting your hands on those animals and starting treatment.”Whenever they can’t release an animal back into the wild, either due to regulations (NOAA doesn’t allow ice seals to be returned, for example) or because they missed out on learning necessary survival skills from mom (as is the case for Pushki), they’re sent to another aquarium or zoo with a goal of furthering that conservation message well beyond their state boundaries.Caring for a sea otter like Pushki is one of the most expensive endeavors the ASLC undergoes it costs the center $25,000 a month to look after and rehabilitate him, largely due to their entirely shellfish diet. In the coming months, the ASLC will look for aquatic facilities elsewhere to house Pushki for the rest of his life.But, Hartman argues it’s worth it, because saving Pushki, and others like him, helps influence future generations to care about the world around them. Pushki will soon join the legions of other ASLC graduates who now, in some small way, teach millions around the world about the importance of healthy ecosystems and being good caretakers of the planet.“For me, the most critical thing about the Alaska SeaLife Center is about developing a sense of empathy and care for our environment and our world and the animals we share it with,” Hartman said. “We have the ability to connect people. To see what is happening in our world and try to inspire change.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f293a40ae39cfaffb41c3a2323702a8672e4e20/0_0_2360_1416/master/2360.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=5c82cc55df2de998bd181e2648a0e666","title":"the woman who ran review hong sang soo","story":"Hong Sang-soo’s highly nuanced, low-key film could be a criticism of Korean sexual politics, or just a series of different meetings The cinema of Korean director Hong Sang-soo is seductively low-key and lo-fi, and his latest is a movie-novella in three encounters. It’s so downbeat, so matter-of-fact, that the registers and nuances are almost beneath the radar of what generally constitutes filmic effect. This really is just people talking, and though they sometimes raise their voices, get angry, embarrassed, or upset, a keynote of polite calm soon reasserts itself. Hong’s camera sedately records each exchange from an undramatic distance, sometimes zooming in for something closer midway through the conversation, but not for any pointed reason. Watching this film means recalibrating your expectations so you can gauge the subtleties and absorb the sotto voce implications about relationships and sexual politics. Pretty much all the way through, nothing very sensational seems to be happening. And yet the movie’s sensational meaning is hiding in plain sight: in the title.Gam-hee is a young woman in Seoul who is a florist by trade, though no great importance is attached to that. She is played by Kim Min-hee, the director’s partner and longtime collaborator, who has acted in seven of his last eight films – but is probably best-known for starring in Park Chan-wook’s 2016 film The Handmaiden, based on Sarah Waters’s novel Fingersmith. Gam-hee has been married for five years, during which time, we learn, she has never been apart from her husband for even a single day. She is at some pains to tell people that she has been fine with this. She says things like: “We manage to have good moments every day” and “I feel a little love every day and that’s enough.” But now her husband has gone off on a business trip so she is going around visiting some old friends, which evidently hadn’t been possible before.Gam-hee encounters three women in three sections. Young-soon (Seo Young-hwa) is a gentle, sweet-natured and slightly dowdy woman who is now orced and lives in the countryside outside Seoul raising chickens: the woman next door, to whom the title may or may not allude, has run away, leaving a distraught daughter roaming disturbingly around like a ghost. Next is Su-young (Song Seon-mi), a Pilates instructor in the city: she has a crush on a neighbour, but is also being stalked by a young poet, with whom she had a rash one-night-stand. Thirdly, there is Woo-jin (Kim Sae-byuk), who is imagined to be the manager of Seoul’s (real-life) Emu cinema and arts centre. She is a slightly spiky character.The first two encounters are planned but this third meeting, in the cinema’s cafe, is very much accidental: Gam-hee tells Woo-jin that she is here to see a film, but this is clearly a fib. In each case, the female conversation is interrupted, or disrupted, by a man. Young-soon’s neighbour pompously asks her to stop feeding stray cats because his wife has a fear of cats and so can’t leave their apartment. But could this woman’s agoraphobia be connected with her overbearing husband, not the cats? Su-young’s former lover rings on the doorbell and harangues her while she’s trying to tell Kim all about her agreeable flirtation with an older, distinguished man. And after talking to Woo-jin at the arts centre cafe, Gam-hee has a very tense but revealing conversation with a famous novelist and TV personality who is there to give a sold-out reading: Gam-hee was dating this man before she got married.When Gam-hee finally meets her old lover, she can’t help giving him a shrill piece of advice: when he’s on TV, which is a lot, he talks too much. Gam-hee is irritated by his volubility, a symptom of her dismay at his public visibility he keeps on popping up, gabbling away, while she is trying to concentrate on her new life with her husband. And yet there is every sign that this former relationship with a not-yet-celebrity was no better than the new one.Hong just places these three situations in front of us: muddled, messy, happy-sad. They don’t seem like crises. But they might make you want to run.• The Woman Who Ran is released on 20 December on Mubi."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2f037dd97693dd0c65300fb60039e2b0e68c576d/0_0_1844_1106/master/1844.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=e5de4a2f7fd0005775caa72c3979fc4a","title":"slaven bilic sacked by west brom after one win in 13 premier league games","story":"West Brom are in discussions with Sam Allardyce about potentially replacing Slaven Bilic, who on Wednesday became the first Premier League manager to be sacked this season when the club resorted to a drastic measure in an effort to climb out of the relegation zone.West Brom believe Allardyce, whose last managerial job ended at Everton in May 2018, can guide the club to safety thanks to his experience and know-how. The 66-year-old, a native of Dudley, has managed seven Premier League clubs and never been relegated. He had been due to host a tea-time show on TalkSport on Wednesday but pulled out of the engagement.The club confirmed the decision to dismiss Bilic in a curt statement. “West Bromwich Albion have today parted company with head coach Slaven Bilic. Assistant coaches, Dean Racunica and Danilo Butorovic, and first-team coach Julian Dicks have also left the club with immediate effect.“The Baggies are currently 19th in the Premier League table with seven points from 13 fixtures. Albion would like to thank Slaven and his coaching staff for their efforts in achieving promotion last season and wishes them all well in the future.”The timing of the decision is surprising insofar as it came after Tuesday’s commendable 1-1 draw at Manchester City, during which West Brom showed defensive qualities they had lacked for much of the season. However, the board evidently decided that improvement was unlikely to last under Bilic, whose relationship with senior figures in the club’s hierarchy has been strained for several months.The situation has been clouded by uncertainty regarding the club’s owner, Lai Guochuan, who has been reported to be keen to reduce or even end his involvement.Bilic was given relatively little transfer funds after winning promotion, with an initial £20m spent on squad reinforcements in preparation for a Premier League campaign that was always likely to be a battle against relegation. The manager made his unhappiness known in October when the centre-back Ahmed Hegazi was sold against his wishes and contrary to assurances he said he had been given. Two recruits for whom Bilic had lobbied hard, Branislav Ivanovic and Karlan Grant, have yet to prove their worth.West Brom, who have won once in the league, are only two points from 17th place but a key factor in their survival push will be the extent to which they are willing to support Bilic’s replacement with investment in January.

Mohamed Bouazizi, the 26-year-old fruit seller whose self-immolation triggered revolutions across the Middle East, has a boulevard named after him in Tunisia’s capital, Tunis. In his home town of Sidi Bouzid, he is depicted in a giant portrait facing the local government headquarters.But a decade since he set himself on fire in protest at state corruption and brutality, Bouazizi is out of fashion in Tunisia – along with the revolution his death inspired. His family have moved to Canada and cut most ties with Sidi Bouzid. “They were smeared,” says Bilal Gharby, 32, a family friend.In Sidi Bouzid’s main street a passerby, Fathiya Iman, 54, when asked what she thinks of Bouazizi, looks to his picture across the road. “I curse at it,” she says. “I want to bring it down. He’s the one that ruined us.”Qais Bouazizi, a cousin to Mohamed, says their surname was once a symbol of Tunisian pride. “Now the city of Sidi Bouzid and the last name Bouazizi feel like a curse,” he says.Myths about Tunisia – cradle of the protest movements, the lone success story, flag-bearer for Arab democracy – crumble the further one drives from the country’s Mediterranean coastline into the neglected hinterlands whose rage fuelled the ousting from power of Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali, the long-serving authoritarian president, in January 2011.Ten years later, Tunisian is a democracy. It has withstood assassinations, terrorist attacks and the ideological gulfs of its leaders, at crucial moments pulling back from the precipice of returning to authoritarian rule, as happened in Egypt, and of civil war, as in Syria, Yemen and Libya.Tunisians are freer to criticise their leaders than before, and their elections are honest. Yet people are miserable and disillusioned, joining jihadi groups in among the largest numbers per capita of any country in the world, and making up the majority of boat-borne migrants to Italy this year.Debates that occupy Tunis, such as whether women should have equal access to inheritance, or whether the presidency should be reserved for Muslims, feel remote to people in Sidi Bouzid, says Qais Bouazizi, 32. “It’s far away from the social questions the revolution was raised for. Our foremost slogans were about work and dignity.”On the outskirts of Kairouan, a desert city an hour from Sidi Bouzid, Aisha Quraishi, 60, says the corruption that characterised the Ben Ali era still blights her life. Foreign aid was directed to the area to build small brick huts for her and other women to sell bread by the roadside. Most of the money vanished, she says, and she still works from a hovel made of wood and tarpaulin.“We won a little freedom,” she says of Ben Ali’s overthrow. “Under him we couldn’t speak. But does this affect my life? I want freedom and dignity. Can’t I have both?”The fruits of the revolution are most obvious at the Bardo Palace, the 15th-century museum and parliament in the capital, where protesters stage sit-ins and legislators bicker under ceilings ornamented in gold leaf, in architecture that blends Roman, Islamic and European styles.The easy merger of eras and cultures that makes up modern Tunisia is cited as one of the reasons it has sustained a democratic experiment that elsewhere was short-lived or nonexistent. Analysts also point to its small, apolitical army, and a civil society that found ways to flourish despite authoritarianism, giving the nation ballast when Ben Ali fell.Geography helped, too. “Tunisia has always been sort of removed from the centre of gravity in the Arab world and was less significant due to its size and lack of natural resources,” says Safwan Masri, a senior research scholar at Columbia University. “It was marginalised by the rest of the Arab world and not significant in terms of larger geopolitical games.”Others argue Tunisia’s uniqueness is exaggerated, and that in moments where it could easily have gone the way of other Arab spring states, it was rescued by wise decisions. In the room for many of these was Ouided Bouchamaoui, the former head of the country’s employers federation and now a Nobel laureate.By the middle of 2013, feuding between the Islamist Ennahda party and secularists had frozen talks over a new constitution. When two leftist leaders were assassinated by suspected jihadis, Tunis swelled with enraged protesters. A similar movement in Egypt had just brought down the Muslim Brotherhood government, whose supporters were massacred in the streets.Along with three other civil society leaders, Bouchamaoui asked the country’s political antagonists to sit around a table for last-ditch negotiations. “To be very frank with you, what helped us was the situation in Egypt,” she says. “Ennahda was afraid we would have the same situation here.”But the quartet also needed to persuade opponents of the Islamists that they could not simply shut them out of the system. “Democracy is accepting others,” Bouchamaoui remembers telling recalcitrant opposition leaders. “We cannot ask for democracy and then say we do not agree with the results of elections. This is democracy.”Their success paved the way for successive free elections and won Bouchamaoui and her colleagues the 2015 Nobel peace prize. But years of fighting over Tunisia’s identity has left little oxygen for addressing the economic problems that drove the revolt.“I said to them, we can’t afford the two years,” she says. “We’re a democracy. The political power cannot take a decision knowing it’s going to be very hard for a majority of the population, because there are elections in this country. People can demonstrate.”Foreign money also equates the commotion of democracy with risk. “We’ve seen a lot of investors going abroad, looking at places like Morocco or Egypt that are authoritarian countries and present the same cheap, skilled labour force but with less trouble, less social demands,” says Youssef Cherif, the director of Columbia University’s Tunis Centre.Feeding off of the stagnation is a growing nostalgia for the old regime, embodied by the rightwing populist Abir Moussi, a lawyer and MP who harks back to the “stability” of the Ben Ali era and receives friendly coverage on Saudi Arabian and UAE-owned news channels.Voter turnout has been falling in Sidi Bouzid since the first free elections in 2011. Hichem Amri, a social activist, says the city is so far unimpressed by the system, though not for the reasons that sometimes gain currency in western capitals. What ails Tunisian democracy is not a fundamental incompatibility with Islam, nor some authoritarian strain in Arab politics. Rather, he says, it is something that has come to resonate more loudly in Washington and London over the past 10 years: a feeling that democracy as it is practised works only for an elite in Tunis and along the coast, without reaching far enough into communities such as Sidi Bouzid to give people a say over the forces that shape their lives.“There is democracy of form and democracy of depth. In Tunisia we practise the democracy of form,” Amri says. “All over the world, the gap between the elected and citizens is huge. And Tunisia is part of this world.”There is little that marks out Mohamed Bouazizi’s grave in an unfenced cemetery on the outskirts of his ancestral village. “This is the first time I’ve been here since he was buried,” says Mohamed Tlili, a former schoolmate. He spends a few minutes on an overcast afternoon searching the plain white tombstones for his friend’s name.Bouazizi became a symbol who inspired resistance in millions of people and, later, among some, resentment. When he finds the plot, Tlili pauses over it for some time, remembering Bouazizi, the man.“He died and other people won,” he says, referring to the former regime officials, exiles and political prisoners who have come to occupy Tunisia’s highest offices. “They never dreamed of being where they are. But because of him, they’re there.”• Additional reporting by Hiba Tlili"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/12923b42082eb0c8bed1e6dea6e23b2fd324ae4f/0_0_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=1b6882e998017bbc1262609355e0c384","title":"how can i find a balance my rugged dedication to optimism at times feels questionable","story":"We will never find satisfactory proof that things are going to turn out alright, writes advice columnist Eleanor Gordon-Smith. The trick is to look for something elseI’ve been an optimist my whole life with a rugged dedication that even I can see is, at times, questionable. My optimism mainly rests on a belief in the inherent goodness of people and, in many ways, I haven’t been disappointed. But over the last few years I had to face the fact that most of my significant relationships have been abusive and, clearly, there’s a tonne of evidence of hatred, ruthless greed and intolerance everywhere at the moment.These experiences have provoked something of an existential crisis in me. I still feel an optimistic outlook is, fundamentally, the only way to keep going – otherwise what’s the point? How can I find a comfortable and balanced place in my mind and heart to settle?Eleanor says: I am like you. Or at least, I used to be. I was doggedly, irritatingly, Pollyanna-swallowed-a-bubble-of-sunshine optimistic. I ran a blog called “Keep Smiling” and told people to count their blessings. I thought there were always reasons to be grateful, even if there weren’t always reasons to be happy. Then, like you, I discovered the ubiquity of abused power in relationships and in globally life-threatening problems and have been unable to look away since.It’s an accidental glance into the void. Because if bad things are going to keep happening, and if no one is completely trustworthy, then grief and dejection aren’t only inevitable, they’re rationally compelled. But having glanced into the void it’s hard not to stare we get preoccupied wondering whether things are evil all the way down.The problem is there probably just isn’t a settled fact of the matter. There is just too much – there are too many people, too many actions, too many years in our life in which to do both wretched and holy things to each other. And there’s too little information about what other people are thinking and feeling, too little opportunity to see what would have happened if we’d been put in bad situations, or raised with cruelty and without opportunity.It will drive you mad to keep looking for a settled verdict about whether things, or other people, trend towards the good. It will lock you in paranoia: but how do I know? But couldn’t you be lying? Won’t it just go away? We are not given very many gifts in this life. One way to destroy the ones we do get is by asking them to stand in as proof of something bigger – to ask a relationship to prove people are fundamentally good to hope that a stranger who helps us cross the road proves that there are pure hearts out there. It sets them up so they cannot fail to disappoint us, and then the disappointment only raises our need for the next thing to prove that it will all be alright in the end.But we will never find satisfactory proof that it will all be alright in the end. It is impossible to insulate the optimist’s beliefs from the doubt caused by hurt and inaction and tragedy and death.So the trick is to stop looking for proof. The thing we need to keep going isn’t belief – it’s hope. And hope is a choice hope doesn’t mind what has happened ‘til now, because hope lives in the thought the next moment might be different and better.Hope isn’t as easily deterred by evidence that goodness sometimes falters, because hope isn’t about evidence. It’s about possibility. Staring into the possibility of other people’s badness makes us rooted to the spot, transfixed with the worst interpretations of what’s going on around us. Looking back into imagination and possibility gives us something else to focus on it tears our eyes from the void. Don’t look for proof.

As winter hits, charities say it must be reprievedMick Norman, 51, who has a long history of alcohol and substance abuse and crime, had been living on the streets of east London “this time around” for 18 months. Norman had been homeless on and off since 2003. Everything changed when he was offered emergency accommodation in March as part of the government’s £3.2m “Everyone In” initiative to stop the spread of Covid-19. This saw around 15,000 street homeless people in England provided with hotel rooms or other emergency accommodation between March and April in order to reduce the spread of coronavirus.“I used to commit petty crimes to get arrested so I could get back in prison when it got cold,” Norman admits. But this time he says he couldn’t get arrested in spite of stealing more than 700 items in the 11 weeks before lockdown.Then the pandemic stuck. “I was sleeping behind the bingo hall in Stratford,” he recalls. “Thames Outreach offered me hotel accommodation in the second week of March but I didn’t want to go. I felt safer outside. They said if I didn’t get off the streets the police would come for me and more or less force me into emergency accommodation, so I took the room voluntarily.“I’ve spent 20 years out of 51 in 36 different prisons. It’s time for something new, and that hotel room in March was the start of it.”An address enabled him to register with a GP and his personal hygiene is much improved. “I’ve even been to the optician,” he says. “I will sort out my teeth next. I haven’t used any drugs for 10 weeks, and shopkeepers let me in their shops now.”Although the Everyone In scheme has officially finished, Norman’s temporary accommodation is not scheduled to end until March 2021 because, like many other local authorities, Newham council chose to continue the scheme.In September, the government allocated £91.5m to 274 of England’s 343 councils to fund their own inidual rough sleeper plans, known as the Next Steps Accommodation Programme. But most local authorities say this is nowhere near enough to cope with this winter. And the additional £151m announced in last month’s spending review for English local authorities to help homeless people won’t be available until April 2021, and none of it will go on Everyone In emergency accommodation this winter.Although Manchester city council got just over £3.5m of Next Steps funding, its director of homelessness, Mike Wright, says this is insufficient. “Everyone In was a success, and we have extended this work and carried on funding a hotel with 55 beds for winter,” he says. “We are funding 70 extra beds because we made a decision not to guillotine Everyone In.”“The unknown factor for this winter is how many new homeless people will need help,” says Wright. “The government’s recent spending review hasn’t made clear how many cuts we will need to make next year to our homeless services.”In November, Manchester warned that it might have to cut funding for rough sleepers as part of cuts to homelessness services totalling £2.8m. New figures show that waiting lists for accommodation in England are set to double to 2 million in 2021, while rough sleeping and homelessness is already rising.Homelessness charities believe a second round of Everyone In funding is crucial.“Despite the tremendous Everyone In effort, people are still having to sleep on our streets,” says Steve Douglas, the chief executive of homelessness charity St Mungo’s. “Although the Next Steps additional funds will provide longer-term accommodation and support funding, we are concerned that there is not enough self-contained emergency accommodation in place for everyone who will need it over the course of this winter”. Crisis chief executive Jon Sparkes agrees. “We cannot let the progress made this year unravel,” he says, pointing to figures predicting some 200,000 households are expected to be homeless this Christmas.Made homeless a year ago when her marriage ended, 54-year-old Margarita Alberg, previously a director of two companies, found herself on the streets when she rapidly sunk into depression and alcohol misuse. “I was offered a hotel room in March, and I stayed there for six weeks,” she says. It has helped her turn her life around.The homeless charity Caritas Anchor House then offered her temporary accommodation during July and August, which she left in September, having secured permanent privately rented accommodation. “I am in a nice flat, sharing a kitchen with three others. Without this, I would still be on the streets.” Alberg is now able to claim universal credit and volunteers at a charity shop. “Life is quieter now. I’m not drinking. I go for walks in the park and I am reunited with my daughter.”Somerset West and Taunton council used Everyone In funding to house its rough sleepers in disused halls of residence and spent the money helping them stop using drugs and alcohol. They employed a nurse and mental health services to support people like former teacher Alastair Smith, 55, whose alcoholism resulted in him sleeping in homeless hostels on and off for two years. He says he is drinking far less now having accessed help via Somerset Drug and Alcohol Service, and he knows of others who have quit spice and heroin. Smith moved into halls of residence run by the YMCA in April and is now volunteering for the council writing a database for the council of its rough sleepers. He is planning on looking for more permanent accommodation once he gains more confidence. “One silver lining of Covid is that homeless people are finally being noticed. Many have been able to get structure and stability in their lives from having access to help and support.”Before the pandemic there were 27 rough sleepers in the region. The number quadrupled after March and 110 people living on the streets have since been helped through Everyone In. The council is continuing to work in the spirit of the campaign, focusing on homeless people who are particularly vulnerable to Covid-19.Federica Smith-Roberts, leader of Somerset West and Taunton council, says: “I want other councils and the government to look at this as a model for a way of working.

We asked experts about their own Christmas plans.Professor of infectious diseases, Imperial College LondonWhen the Brexit vote happened, my parents offered to vote in line with their grandchildren’s views as the decision was going to have the greatest impact on the kids. In a similar vein, I left the decision on Christmas to them, knowing that although they value the annual gathering, they would be carrying the risk. Slightly to my surprise, they were clear they wanted to wait until they’d been vaccinated. So we’ll be staying at home as a family within our bubble and getting together later – my best bet being Easter. Hopefully without the need for turkey.Director of the Vaccine Centre at the London School of Hygiene \u0026amp Tropical MedicineBeing from Germany, our main day is actually Christmas Eve, and I will be fortunate to celebrate our late-night tradition with my husband and son in north-west London.There won’t be any change to the usuals as we tend to be just the three of us, with relatives living away from London, and we don’t like travelling across to various lunches over that period anyway. Hence we will be lighting the (real) candles on the tree on Christmas Eve, sit in candlelight and give each other small presents – before I head to the hospital on Christmas Day and Boxing Day as I have the joy of being on call for the paediatric infectious diseases services this year.Hopefully we won’t have many sick kids in the hospital and no Covid crisis, so we can let them all come out of their rooms to see Father Christmas – usually one of our colleagues dressed up. Christmas in hospital sounds bad, but actually, on the kids’ ward it can be quite a joyful experience too.A former regional director of public health for north-west England and the author of Blinded by CoronaWe’ll keep it small, and I look forward to that because I am really despondent about how commercial Christmas has become. Maybe this Christmas will get people thinking about this overconsumption as well, as people have begun to think about sustainability through the pandemic.Sadly I won’t be able to see my other sons and their families who are in France and in Liverpool. We’ll aim to Zoom or something. One of them will be kept busy as he is the director of public health for Liverpool.I will be working on Christmas Day. I am working in the Covid hub in north Wales. I am one of the lead consultants there overseeing the outbreak control and testing and tracing.Otherwise we will no doubt be watching films and having a modest family Christmas. We are very lucky, we have the fells and the open air, and just a natural, quiet Christmas.Senior lecturer and researcher in viral immunology at the University of BirminghamWe have two little boys who are going to primary school, so we had planned to forgo a Christmas dinner with the grandparents to protect them from infection. Our plan was to meet with them later, after the children were able to isolate for a few days.However, our children were asked by their school to isolate this week because of confirmed Covid cases in their year. The boys are missing out on Christmas celebrations with their school friends, but our relatives can now visit for Christmas dinner.We will be sensible and isolate before we meet with family, to make sure everyone is safe. Looking forward to it!Professor of primary care health sciences at Oxford UniversityI’ll be renting a cottage in the countryside with my husband. It’s got wifi and we’ll be connecting with family by Zoom.In non-Covid times we would certainly have done the rounds of the relatives – his family Christmas Day, mine Boxing Day or vice versa – and we may have had one or both of our children staying with their partners. But this kind of interaction is precisely what we all need to avoid right now.While the risk of any inidual passing on the virus to their loved ones is small, the overall risk across the country is huge since one becomes two, two becomes four and so on until the excess infections run into thousands.But to be honest I’m not too worried. It’s been a hard year for us scientists and I’ll be glad to enjoy the solitude!Professor of immunobiology at Imperial College LondonOur take on this is that controlling a lethal virus easily trumps the desire to celebrate religious festivals, so just like people over the past months have had to rein in their wishes to celebrate Passover, Diwali, Eid, Hanukah, we’ll be taking it easy so as not to risk contributing to a massive spike in horrific cases, as happened on a grand scale after Thanksgiving festivities in the USA and Canada. It’s so predictable and just not worth it.So we’ll be doing anything that’s compatible with a safe, socially distanced Xmas: no mixing of bubbles with other households, and all socialising beyond our immediate family will be by Zoom. There are loads of presents ready to wrap, all bought online. Doing our shopping online, we’ve been able to discover small businesses selling handmade cards and recycled wrapping. No Christmas tree this year as we deemed it non-essential shopping, so we may have a yucca as a stand-in. There’ll be lots of cooking and baking, and I’ve invested in various pairs of Scandinavian slipper-socks in the hope of a cosy, hygge, at-home Xmas.Associate professor at Leeds University’s school of medicineJust because you can do something it doesn’t mean you need to. Frankly, five days of mixing indoors with multiple households is bonkers. Our Christmas interaction is going to be as safe as it can be. My wife is shielding, she’s on the at-risk critical list, and we are going to see one person, my wife’s dad, who is also shielding. Our kids are at school, so that’s a risk we have to take. It’s horribly disappointing not to be able to see your family, of course. We’re not in a position where, for example, we’re expecting a family member to not last a year – so I sympathise with that but my perspective is it’s one year … I can wait until next year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d59bf0ae1f281c9dc231a1434e9702e1b27fdee1/0_252_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=57f553945fc1bbb8429a9f3f86731acc","title":"women behind huge increase in running and cycling in 2020","story":"Women led an unlikely global fitness boom in 2020 with large increases in the numbers running, cycling and walking during the pandemic, according to the world’s biggest online fitness platform.Strava, which tracked more than 1.1bn activities uploaded by its 72m users over the past year, found the number of uploaded runs and cycle rides nearly doubled compared with the same period in 2019, while the number of walks recorded tripled year on year.While some of this growth could be attributed to new users, Strava’s director of international marketing Simon Klima said the increase “was nothing like we’ve seen before and far surpassed our projections based on historical trends”. Much of it, he added, was down to women being more active.“We’ve seen a real boost from women in terms of overall activity levels during the pandemic year,” he said. “There could be several reasons for that but in the past our research has found that one of the biggest blocks for women to cycling is a perceived safety risk. But during the pandemic women perhaps felt safer to take to their bicycles, thanks to some temporary infrastructure improvements and quieter roads.”“As well as cycling, there’s also been a greater adoption of running, perhaps partly as an alternative for gym classes,” said Klima. “But working from home also gives some people freedom to be active during the day as they spend less time commuting to an office. It has allowed people to take control of their calendars a little bit more and to find more time for being active.”According to Strava, Britons were also comparatively more active than other nations during lockdown, helped by less strict regulations on exercising outdoors compared with countries such as Italy, Spain and France, where there were huge drops in outdoor exercise levels between March and May.Its data also shows that the average distance per run in the UK is 5.5km and the average time is 33 mins and 47 secs – compared with global figures of 6.3km and 38:48."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/13181821773c2b65bea27ea77b3084dc98210701/0_395_4215_2529/master/4215.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1090295b9ffb0dd74fdace6c3f2da75b","title":"choose your favourite uk theatre show of 2020","story":"Tell us about your standout show of the year – we’ll feature a selection of your favourites later this monthIt has been a tough year for theatre.

Chanté Joseph speaks to the people who make them – and the fans who can’t switch offThis year took a lot from us: birthdays, holidays, time with friends and family. Too many social interactions took place in tiny pixelated squares, where meetups started with the ceremonial: “Can you hear me? Is the mic on? Oh you’ve frozen. Oh wait, no, I’ve frozen.” Jittery wifi and pregnant pauses caused by weak connections made the steady, comforting flow of conversation more trouble than it was worth in many cases.Technology slowly became exasperating, trying to catch up with friends a chore. So it’s unsurprising that podcast consumption on Spotify doubled between March and July. During the course of this year’s first pandemic lockdown, podcasts provided an uninterrupted flow of voices and company that helped us feel less lonely. When we really needed them, storytellers and newsmakers were there to accompany us at the touch of a button.Molly Denton, a film-maker from Oxford, quit her job shortly before the furlough scheme was announced. When she began working at a local supermarket, podcasts helped her through the long night shifts. “Eight hours of podcasts a day from 2am-10am was survival,” she says.“I listened to every single episode of Where Should We Begin by Esther Perel, and I also listened to loads of crime podcasts like Chasing Cosby or Ronan Farrow’s The Catch and Kill podcast.”For Mariam Khan, author of It’s Not About the Burqa, podcasts help fill the space where the buzz of daily chatter would usually be. “Part of lockdown has meant enforced isolation for so many people, including myself,” she says. “I don’t miss anything grand, but I miss conversations with everyone from baristas to friends and family.“I’ve been listening to the Unlocking Us podcast with Brené Brown, which is soothing and gives me space for self-reflection. I’ve also been listening to The Sista Collective. It’s a conversation between a group of friends essentially. There is a sense of informality there, but that doesn’t mean it’s unprofessional! I guess podcasts feel like conversations, which is why they’ve felt so comforting. For me, they’ve become a way to find peace.”In these hyposocial times, podcast hosts Harry Pinero and Henrie Kwushue are bowled over by how many people have welcomed them into their lives. “The fact that so many people are listening to Who We Be TALKS_ is just incredible,” says Kwushue.The podcast is a spin off of Spotify’s Who We Be playlist – the UK’s biggest Hip-Hop, Afrobeats, Dancehall and R\u0026ampB playlist. With interviews from the likes of KSI, Common, Ms Banks and Megan Thee Stallion, as well as deep e conversations on everything from pineapple pizza to dealing with unfriendly in-laws, Who We Be TALKS_ has kept fans entertained since 2018.“I know that people’s attention s are very short,” says Pinero, who took over hosting duties with Kwushue in June. “So to have people hooked on to our show like this says a lot about the work we’re doing.”Kwushue adds: “I don’t think there has ever been a time in social media history where everyone is going through the exact same thing at the exact same time. We’re all consuming the same content, it’s a thread that ties us together.“From what I’ve been seeing on Twitter, a lot of people are enjoying the podcast. People will message me on Instagram demanding a video version as well, which is really cute. I enjoy the fact that people like listening to our long-form content.”They found their new rhythms with a little help from their own favourite podcasts. “When you live alone like me you use podcasts to make it feel as if there are friends in the room,” says Kwushue. “I listen to The Receipts, for example, and they remind me of my friends. Podcasts play an important role in keeping people connected.”It’s a sentiment that Pinero seconds: “Going through something and hearing other people you admire let you know on their podcasts that they’re going through the same does a lot of wonders.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/079919086a32e0754b893831838bf2d071ea8d38/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3ad1b525ccd6dd2b7d6a1245981ef3df","title":"lego gingerbread houses and micro scooters mother pukkas top christmas gifts for kids","story":"Anna Whitehouse, parenting blogger and mother of two, shares her favourite quirky, fun and crafty present ideasAs told to Kala Paul-WorikaChristmas Day for us is usually either spent at home, my parents’ place, or with my husband’s parents. We like to get the tree up on 1 December and we always let the kids decorate, with varying degrees of success. Last year, one side of the tree was dripping with glittery baubles while the other looked strangely bare. But so what? Christmas is all about the kids.No one knows what Christmas this year will be like, but if we’ve learned one thing in 2020, it’s to suspend expectations. Adapting the things we’d planned will ensure we have a happy and uplifting end to the year. Part of the fun will be making it all work.At the end of the day, Christmas is all about the memories we make, no matter how we make them. My favourite Christmas memory is of my sister wrapping me up in a box when I was six – and how my mum nearly had a heart attack when I jumped out. For me, a Mr Frosty slush machine was by far the best gift I’ve ever received. As a child in the 1980s, it just nailed it.But what will elicit that same sense of elation in 2020? Here are the gifts that are spot-on for the kids of today:John Lewis \u0026amp Partners Wooden Mini Kitchen, £35During the first lockdown, the kids did a lot of baking and we had great dinners as a family. This is the perfect gift for our three-year-old toddler who can’t quite be trusted with actually baking yet.Tonies Toniebox Starter Set, £62.95This is amazing because it gives kids control over bedtime stories. It’s for when you’ve had a hard day at work and you just want to be with your children but not necessarily read to them in a dark room. They can control the sound and you can sit there cuddling and listening to Pinocchio together. It’s more of a gift for us parents really.John Lewis \u0026amp Partners Wooden Train Set, £30My youngest is obsessed with trains, she’s three and she’s already a trainspotter – we have to stand on bridges and wait for trains to pass by. So this is a great gift for kids like my daughter.Mini Micro Eco Deluxe Scooter, 2-5 years, £79.95For kids who are in between the buggy and walking stage – when they can’t quite walk but don’t want to sit in the pram – the micro scooter is the perfect gift. And what kid doesn’t want their own set of wheels?eeBoo I Heard Your Feelings Conversation Cards, £11.99This set of cards teaches children to learn to read emotional situations. The 48 flashcards feature everyday scenarios such as being picked for a team or accidentally breaking a vase.Fitbit Ace 2 Wristband, Children’s Activity Tracker, £59.99My youngest exercises with me at home. We started in lockdown and now she’s really into fitness – in her own way. The Fitbit is a great way to put children in control of their own fitness and wellness.Nintendo Switch Console with Joy-Con, £279.99This has got to be a united gift for the whole family – because if you give it to one child, it’s bound to cause problems. It’s entertaining and brilliantly addictive. And there’s the nostalgia factor too – it brings me right back to my own childhood.John Lewis \u0026amp Partners 3D Rocket Children’s Backpack, £18  A rocket is just so brilliantly neutral – this is such a one size fits all kind of present.

And what we’ve found has been nothing short of remarkable. As well as discovering stores stocked with hidden gems, we’ve found that local shopkeepers can also be fountains of knowledge and helpful advice – bringing a genuine passion to their wares and their trade.So, to make the most of the myriad benefits of shopping locally, be sure to ask your local shopkeeper questions that draw on their wealth of expertise. Not sure where to start? Here, seven independent local retailers offer their suggestions.Sean Cooper is the owner of Weyfish, a harbourside fishmonger in the historic Old Fish Market in Weymouth, Dorset. Produce lands daily on the quayside oppositeIs it caught locally? Is it fresh? “Provenance is critical to buying fish, and if it is fresh the monger should be able to tell you what boat landed it or, if not, which market it was bought from,” says Cooper.Can you prepare that for me? “A good fishmonger will display whole fish to demonstrate their freshness,” he says. “That same fishmonger should then be able to gut, scale, fillet and steak the fish while you wait.”How would you cook that?“A lot of customers want ideas for how to cook their purchase. Should it be grilled, baked, pan fried?”Amanda Allan is the owner of Heavenly Sensations, a hair, beauty and aesthetics specialist salon in Kirkcaldy, ScotlandCan I see your portfolio?“Before getting an aesthetic treatment, ask to see a portfolio of the therapist’s work,” says Allan. “And ask for a consultation before booking the actual treatment if you are unsure of anything.”What are the risks and costs involved? “Be sure to know about these – and the cost of any upkeep – before venturing forward then realising there are hidden costs.”I have an existing medical condition, will that affect the treatment? “On arrival, you should fill out a record card with up-to-date medical information, and treatments should not go ahead unless this form is completed.”Rachael Johnson is the owner of The Yesterday Society, a vintage clothes shop in Newcastle upon Tyne, north-east EnglandWhat size is this in current sizing?“Over the years the measurements used for different sizes have changed a lot, so when shopping for vintage you can’t assume that the size on the tag will be the same as that size today. I always advise customers to try items on to be sure they fit how they like before making a purchase.”How would you wash this?“The materials used in vintage clothing can be different to modern ‘easy-to-wash’ materials. Once you find that perfect vintage item, it’s a good idea to research how best to wash it to ensure it survives for many years to come.”What decade is this from? How would you style this?“I have a lot of customers who at first are nervous about wearing vintage as they don’t know how to style it without looking costumey. I personally don’t limit myself to one decade and much prefer wearing hybrid outfits from a range of vintage styles. Any wardrobe can benefit from a vintage piece or two, and these can be mixed with modern clothing to achieve a more quirky and stylish feel.”Kevin Fernandez is director of family-owned Rafi’s Spicebox, established by his mother Rafi in York, in 1989How old is this spice?“There is a belief that as spices are dry they have a long shelf life,” says Fernandez. “However, we believe that they are the best as fresh as possible and not stored for too long.”Can I purchase spices whole?“Roast and grind them when required – this will ensure the best flavour, as ground spices deteriorate quicker than whole spices.”What about its provenance?“It is imperative that spices are sourced from countries that produce them for their own consumption, and that the quality is the best it can be. At Rafi’s Spicebox, the vast majority of our spices are sourced from India, and we are very strict on ensuring the best quality available,” says Fernandez. “This does come at a price but it is definitely worth paying that bit more rather than getting tempted by bargains.”Stuart Andrew is a second-generation toy shop owner who runs Hal Whittaker, an independent toy retailer that’s been in Knutsford, Cheshire, since 1970What’s in or popular at the moment? “The toy industry is so fashion driven nowadays with crazes and trends,” he says. “As an independent, we have the ability to react and be in on a trend as soon as it becomes big.”Sarah Atkinson has spent her career working with animals, which led to her opening Bunny’s Moggy’s Doggy’s Pet Supplies in Chorley, Lancashire, with her husband, Neil, in 2011I’m thinking of buying this pet, what do I need?“Many animal purchases are impulse buys so the new owner won’t have done the research into what owning that animal entails,” says Atkinson. “Come in before you buy and we can give you a good understanding of what it’ll cost and what cage or equipment they may need.”What’s the best food I can give my pet? I’m looking to change my pet’s food, what do you recommend?“Choosing the right food involves many factors, including animal age, breed, energy requirements, budget, storage considerations and availability,” she says. “These are not questions that you’ll get answered in a supermarket or discount store.”Where is this raw food from and what is in it?“Raw feeding has been on the increase for many years,” says Atkinson. “Unlike some of those selling on social media, all raw meats sold via retailers are produced by Defra-licenced manufacturers, which offers traceability and knowledge of composition and backup support.”Simon Broadribb dreamed about becoming an award-winning butcher as a young teen and achieved his goal by taking ownership of Uptons of Bassett butchers in Southampton, Hampshire, 26 years agoWhere is your beef, lamb or pork from? Is it local or specially bred? Older or younger?“The latter affects the flavour and how tender the meat is,” says Broadribb.I’m making a curry, what cut would you recommend? “Here the cheapest cuts, such as beef cheek, chuck steak, lamb shoulder or even mutton chop, offer far more flavour and are cheaper.”Since Martha Brown opened the doors to Forge Bakehouse in 2012, it has become a firm favourite in Sheffield, South Yorkshire, later expanding to bigger premises and adding a cafeIf you have specific dietary requirements, ask what exactly is in each product “This is a real selling point for bakeries,” says Brown. “We can recommend breads to try if you think you struggle with gluten, for example.”What do you recommend? “This will often be met with: ‘What are you going to eat it with?’ as a response,” she says. “As well as the obvious pairings, staff have their own favourites and personal recommendations that they are always happy to share.”No question is too small or silly“Shopping in a bakery for your bread and pastries, you are able to ask whatever you want.”Dipak Patel is the owner of Saltaire Wines in Shipley, West Yorkshire, a specialist supplier of wines, spirits and beers, many of which are craft beers brewed locallyThis is what I was thinking of spending, what do you recommend?“Often the decision comes down to price in the end anyway, so it’s helpful to know the budget from the start,” says Patel.This is what I’m cooking, what goes well with it?“We get asked this question a lot, like what goes well with fish or red meat.”What’s newly in?“As specialist merchants, we get excited about stocking new products and items that are unusual and can’t be found anywhere else,” he says. “It’s great when we can share this with customers.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/55be80aac1826f85f52b21ebaad7ea357e7e067f/0_213_4827_2896/master/4827.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=66c356a2f272ad3d43cfa2b8a058c391","title":"all uk nations agree not to change christmas covid rules","story":"Boris Johnson says there is ‘unanimous agreement’ but Scotland and Wales issue different adviceBoris Johnson has said there is “unanimous agreement” between the four UK nations over unified rules for Christmas gatherings even as the Welsh and Scottish government announced different guidance for the festive period.Wales issued advice recommending a limit of two rather than three households when families form a Christmas bubble. Scotland advised that a bubble – again, ideally of no more than two households – should not meet up for more than one day and avoid staying overnight together.Johnson was due to hold a Downing Street press conference on Wednesday afternoon, which was expected to include the latest guidance for Christmas plans in England.Following warnings from scientists and MPs over a likely surge in coronavirus infections amid an easing of UK rules at Christmas to allow up to three households to gather indoors, talks were held on Wednesday morning.After the call between devolved leaders from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, and Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, Johnson told the Commons that all parties had agreed to keep the same rules in place.There was, Johnson told Keir Starmer at prime minister’s questions, “unanimous agreement across all the UK government, across all the devolved administrations, including members of all parties, including his own, that we should proceed in principle with the existing regulations, because we don’t want to criminalise people’s long-made plans”.But in a sign that the government instead hopes to warn people against too much mixing, he said the public should “exercise extreme caution” when celebrating Christmas.Under the plan, originally agreed among the four nations in November, up to three households will be allowed to gather for five days from 23 to 27 December, or an extra day on either side to allow for travel to and from Northern Ireland.But in a break from the consensus, as Johnson was speaking in the Commons, the Welsh first minister, Mark Drakeford, announced different Christmas guidance, as well as fresh lockdown measures to be imposed in Wales beginning on Christmas Eve.While the Christmas rules will remain the same, the official advice of the Welsh government is that only two households should come together during the five-day Christmas period.Drakeford said: “Here in Wales over the Christmas period the clear message from the Welsh government is that only two households should meet. That is how serious it is in Wales.” Pressed over whether this was a rule or advice, he said: “The message is the same.”Under the Welsh lockdown all non-essential shops, plus leisure and fitness centres and close-contact services, will shut at the end of trading on 24 December. Hospitality premises, including pubs and restaurants, will close from 6pm on Christmas Day.France\u0026nbspreopened non-essential shops this month, allowing Christmas shopping to begin. But an uptick in new infections since then means that while travel is permitted from 15 December, a nationwide 8pm to 7am curfew will begin then that will be lifted for 24 December, but not Christmas Day or New Year’s Eve. Bars and restaurants will not reopen until January and private gatherings are limited to six adults.Germany\u0027s lockdown light, with bars and restaurants closed since November, has not proved effective and the country\u0026nbsphas shut down further, closing all bar essential shops (such as supermarkets and pharmacies) as well as hair and beauty salons until at least 10 January. A maximum of five people from two households may meet, except for 24, 25 and 26 December when up to four close family members from other households can be invited.Austria’s\u0026nbspstrict lockdown has ended and the country is carrying out a mass programme of 10 million tests over the next fortnight with the aim of allowing more families to reunite over the festive period. Christmas markets have been cancelled.Italy\u0027s prime minister has said tougher restrictions will be needed over the holiday period,but they have not yet been announced. Inter-regional travel is already banned from 20 December to 6 January except for work, health or emergency reasons, and Italians may not leave their home towns on Christmas Day, Boxing Day or New Year’s Day. Midnight mass on 24 December has been brought forward so worshippers can get home before a nationwide 10pm-5am curfew.\u0026nbspSpain\u0026nbsphas appealed for people to be responsible but will allow movement between regions “for family reasons” between 23 December and 6 January. Regional curfews, which range from 10pm to midnight, will be pushed back to 1.30am on 24 and 31 December, when the limit for gatherings will be raised from six to 10, a measure that will also apply on Christmas Day and New Year’s Day.The Netherlands\u0026nbsphas imposed a tough Christmas lockdown, closing non-essential shops and businesses, gyms, museums, cinemas and theatres for five weeks until 19 January. Bars and restaurants have been closed since mid-October. Schools are switching to online learning and people advised to stay at home. Households may invite up to two guests a day except for 24-26 December, when the ceiling is raised to three, excluding children under 13.\u0026nbspBelgium\u0026nbsphas said households may be in close contact with just one extra person over the Christmas period, although people living on their own will be allowed to meet two others. Fireworks are to be banned on New Year’s Eve to limit gatherings.Poland\u0026nbspwill allow people to spend Christmas only with their immediate family, with no more than five guests to be invited to each household until at least 27 December and travel banned outside people’s home towns.Britain\u0026nbspis relaxing restrictions over the holiday with “Christmas bubbles” allowing up to three households to mix\u0026nbspbetween 23 and 27 December.\u0026nbspScientists, government advisers and medical experts have called for an urgent rethink, suggesting the move could result in a disastrous third wave in the New Year.Separately, the Scottish first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, told her daily briefing that her government would be bringing out its own guidance later on Wednesday, “which we hope will be agreed on a four nations basis”. She said those discussions were ongoing.Sturgeon urged people to limit the number of households gathering: “If you do form a bubble you should not meet up for more than one day and not stay overnight, and keep it as small as possible – three is the maximum but two is better …“Unequivocally, the safest way to spend Christmas this year is within your own household and within your own home.”Asked about the apparent contradiction between the assertion of unanimity and the different messages from Drakeford and Sturgeon, Johnson’s spokesman said: “The prime minister was referring to the fact that all four nations have agreed there will be no changes to the laws around Christmas bubbles.”Any change to local guidance by the devolved leaders was, he added, “a matter for them”.A joint statement from the four UK nations is expected later in the day, as well as updated formal government guidance.There are already slight differences between the nations – for example Scotland has a maximum limit of eight people aged 11 or over – and these are expected to remain.The government and devolved administrations have been under intense pressure from scientists, medical experts and some MPs to reconsider the plan.On Tuesday, the British Medical Journal and Health Service Journal published a rare joint editorial saying the government could no longer claim to be protecting the NHS if it went ahead with rash plans to let households mix indoors, without social distancing, and travel across the country over Christmas.Jeremy Hunt, the former health secretary who chairs the Commons health committee, also urged ministers to consider changing the plans for Christmas, saying it would be “a very, very dangerous and precarious situation” for the NHS to enter January with high levels of bed occupancy from Covid."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4409770.1605434900!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"400 yes 400 irish retailers for all your online christmas shopping","story":"A number of Irish independent retailers describe how lockdowns and Covid restrictions have impacted their businesses - and what they’ve had to do to adapt. \t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIrish retailers are facing a tough Christmas with new Covid-19 restrictions closing non-essential outletsWe have been overwhelmed, in the best possible way, by the response to our original list, a few weeks ago, of 100 Irish websites where you can buy lovely, unique and good-value presents in the run-up to Christmas.Almost as soon as it appeared, business owners and many of their customers emailed us, tweeted us, sent us Instagram messages and contacted us on Facebook to champion more Irish companies doing the business online.That response matters, because we all know that the run-up to Christmas,\u0026nbspwith so many physical shops in lockdown,\u0026nbspis going to be incredibly hard for many businesses. It is also going to be a challenging time for shoppers, as they try to get organised for a Christmas like never before with more than 40 shopping days taken from them almost overnight.We know the problems all too well, but we know the solution, too, or at least part of it. The internet. But,\u0026nbspas we have said before and will say again,\u0026nbspshopping online comes with a caveat. As much as 70 per cent of Irish consumers’ virtual spending leaves the country as people shop overseas.It doesn’t have to be that way. As we are learning, there are many, many local sites that need our support this month and every month. If we could keep just 10 or 20 per cent of our online spend this year at home it would inject tens of millions of euro into our local economies. That would save jobs and keep businesses going.So our 100 became 200, and is now becoming 400.Jump to: Toys Food and drink Art and gifts Jewellery Clothes Books Music and tech Sporty stuff Health and beauty Everything elseTOYS nimblefingers.ie  A Dublin toyshop that has been making children and their parents happy for generations.

Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollinsTánaiste Leo Varadkar has suggested that “we have lost our way” in relation to the commemorations marking the decade of centenaries. Mr Varadkar suggested that the commemorations up to and including the Easter Rising centenary in 2016 had been marked in an “inclusive and respectful” manner. “Ceremonies were non-partisan. We commemorated what happened, sought to understand it, contextualise it, learn from it,” he stated. “Ceremonies were inclusive and respectful. They did not seek to challenge or change anyone’s loyalties. The violence of the period was recognised but was not glorified. “We honoured and remembered all the dead, combatants and innocent civilians - those who died in the GPO and Kilmainham Gaol and those who died in France and Flanders. “I think in the last year we have lost our way and we need to find it again. The decade of centenaries is not over.” In the opinion article published in The Irish Daily Mail, Mr Varadkar accused Sinn Féin of distorting the facts of Irish history. In reference to Sinn Féin TD Brian Stanley’s comparison between the Kilmichael ambush of 1920 and Narrow Water in 1979, Mr Varadkar suggested that Sinn Féin was involved in employing a “dangerous moral equivalence to normalise political violence in their pursuit of power on both sides of the border. “There is a profound difference between the War of Independence fought then and the campaign of violence waged by the Provisional IRA in modern times. “The War of Independence had democratic legitimacy. The IRA of 100 years ago answered to a civilian government and a democratically elected Dáil presided over first by Cathal Brugha, then Eamon de Valera and Arthur Griffith. “The violent campaign of the Provisional IRA did not command widespread public support north or south and its political wing was rejected again and again at the ballot box. “Furthermore the provisionals and Sinn Féin did not recognise our democracy. They refused to accept the legitimacy of our democratic institutions - our courts, gardaí, defence forces, the Constitution, even the Dáil itself which they boycotted. They dismissed the millions of votes cast by the Irish people. “This cannot possibly be explained away as standing up to the British government or defending marginalised Catholic communities. “Others like John Hume did so peacefully and achieved much more including civil rights.” Mr Varadkar pointed out that many parties in Ireland, including his home, can trace their origins back to the revolutionary period. General Richard Mulcahy, the chief of staff of the IRA, became Fine Gael leader in the 1940s. He said the “constant glorification of past violence” by Sinn Féin will only serve to make a united Ireland harder to achieve. He added that it also threatens the spirit of decade of centenaries as we face into the most difficult part with the centenaries of Northern Ireland, the Truce and Treaty and the Civil War coming up. In the article Mr Vardakar said he had accepted the apologies of Brian Stanley in relation to a tweet sent in 2017 which had been about him and was construed as being homophobic. However, Mr Varadkar expressed frustration that he had not been allowed to ask questions of Mr Stanley following the Sinn Féin’s apology in the Dáil on Tuesday.

Photograph: iStockAnticipated pay increases for public servants in the future are the key driver of the dramatic surge in the estimated costs of public service pensions over the coming years, according to a report published last night by the Department of Public Expenditure.At present, pay increases for public servants are also passed on to public service pensioners, though this is a matter for the minister for finance of the day, and not a legal obligation. According to the report if public sector pensions were increased by reference to inflation, the additional cost to the state would be much smaller.However, if the projections were based on a scenario where pensions increased in line with the consumer price index - rather than public pay increases - the bill would fall by €23 billion, to €127 billion. The findings are contained in an actuarial report on the cost of public sector pensions briefed to the Cabinet on Tuesday and published last night.The report also reveals that the expected level of annual wage increases for public sector workers is almost 3.5 per cent a year. This includes future public sector pay deals but also the salary increments that many public servants receive on either an annual or less frequent basis.For example, the 27-point incremental scale for teachers runs from €38,000 a year when they begin their career to €71,000, excluding additional allowances. By the time they reach the top of the incremental scale, the base pay will have been increased by public sector pay rounds. The Government recently negotiated a new pay deal with public servants which will see a one per cent increase in pay in each of the next two years.According to the report: “For defined benefit schemes the level of pension entitlements depends also significantly on future wage growth. The Irish public service schemes apply a formula to the member’s salary to determine the level of the initial pension. An overall wage growth assumption (including promotional allowance) of 3.48 per cent per annum has been set based on the Technical Compilation Guide and the 2021 Ageing Report.”The pension scheme for State employees was reformed after the last financial crisis, meaning that those taken on after 2013 have less favourable entitlements, with benefits based on average earnings over their career, rather than final salary, as is the case with those recruited earlier. Also when they retire, the annual pension increases of more recent recruits will be based on inflation rather than matching increases elsewhere in the public service. Public sector pensions remain significantly more generous than those available to the vast bulk of private sector employees, the bulk of whom now rely on defined contributions schemes, with no guarantee of a pension amount in relation to their salary. The rising deficit indicates that the cost of providing pensions to retiring public servants will require a significant amount from current spending each year, leaving less to spend in other areas. The bill may flatten out and then fall when public servants hired since 2013 start to retire on less favourable entitlements. The annual cost is expected to rise from 1.1 per cent of GDP now to 1.5 per cent by 2040 and to flatten out and start reducing after that."},{"url":null,"title":"market not state best placed to solve brexit issues committee hears","story":"The market is best placed to respond to the demands Brexit will make on Irish shipping links with Britain and continental Europe, an Oireachtas committee has been told.The head of the Irish Maritime Development Office, Liam Lacey, rejected a suggestion by Brendan Howlin of the Labour Party that the state agency had been “complacent” in its preparations for the disruptions that Brexit will bring.He said his office had been working “non-stop” on Brexit over recent years and he believed it had been good advice to let the market react to the changing situation. He told the committee that State intervention had the potential to cause lasting damage to the sector and could have led to a “chaotic response”. Responding to Ruairí O’Murchú of Sinn Féin, Mr Lacey said it was unhelpful in a functioning market to set out, a priori, that there should be state intervention.“It is in the interest of shipping companies to service demand,” Mr Lacey said, when addressing the Joint Oireachtas Committee on European Affairs. The sector was capable of increasing capacity in response to perceived demand.The huge reduction in passenger traffic on Irish ferries had freed up capacity for freight and this would provide some relief in the first quarter of next year when shipping may trying to deal with the initial effects of Brexit, Mr Lacey said.He also said he did not believe the crucial Dover-Calais route would be allowed “fail”, as that would not be in the UK’s interest.While every new system had “teething problems”, he believed the problems that might develop at Calais would be resolved. He had recently been assured on this point by the French ambassador to Ireland, he said.The “big question” was the extent to which the land bridge to Europe through England would continue to function. The shipping industry believed the problems at Dover and Calais would be resolved.He told Neale Richmond of Fine Gael that the transit times that the land bridge supplies cannot be replicated, so some exporters and importers will have to look at compromise, and changes to their supply chains.The land bridge existed before the single market was created, and there are technologies available now that can help mitigate the difficulties created by the UK’s departure from the EU, he told Mr O’Murchú.Mr Lacey told Seán Haughey of Fianna Fáil that the people who ran Dublin Port were very experienced and he believed they were best placed to deal with the traffic issues that might arise at or near the port.Mr Howlin, standing in for committee chair Joe McHugh of Fine Gael, said it was self-evident to say it was in the UK’s interest not to let the Dover-Calais route fail,. However, he questioned what would happen if French fishermen disrupted the offloading of freight from the UK. Mr Lacey said it was best left to the industry to respond to the problems of the market, and that there were a number of alternatives to roll-on, roll-off that could form part of importers and exports solutions.There was evidence that there was stockpiling of supplies in anticipation of Brexit and this, combined with the seasonal dip in freight that occurred every January, would help ease pressures.If difficulties did emerge, then there was an understanding in place that vital supplies, such as medicines, would be prioritised, he said.

He said there are almost 600 such facilities in the country, with some 78,000 residents and staff living within them. “If you look at those numbers, and you look at that initial cohort of vaccinators, you can start to think that that cohort might complete their vaccinations by mid-to-late February, for example,” he told Fine Gael TD Colm Burke, emphasising that this in turn would be dependent on the numbers of vaccines arriving. Prof MacCraith also confirmed that the current expectation is that several “shippers” of the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine would be arriving in the State before the end of the year, each containing some 5,000 doses. While he said there wasn’t “absolute confirmation” on the numbers, when pushed by Sinn Féin health spokesman David Cullinane, he said that before the end of the calendar year it is expected “small multiples” of that number would be delivered. “If you take that 4,875 (doses) per shipper, and we would expect a small number of shippers. It may be one, it may be two. We don’t know exactly that yet, it hasn’t been confirmed”. He said quarterly allocations there would be “hundreds of thousands” of doses allocated. Prof MacCraith told the committee that they did not have firm information beyond that there is likely to be a small supply of vaccines delivered before the end of December.He said the taskforce has seen “indicative schedules” but they have been “shifting” as the situation develops. “The only strong indication we have is a small supply of initial quantity of vaccines is likely to be delivered before the end of December to us”.Premature complacencyDespite positive news on the vaccine, Dr Ronan Glynn, the deputy chief medical officer, said there is a “risk of premature complacency” setting in as people will react to recent developments and “see hope and light on the horizon”.He warned that the State is “looking at a number of months before we see a vaccine having a significant effect on how we manage this disease in Ireland. ”Dr Glynn said the situaition in Northern Ireland is of “real concern” and that the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) would be discussing it at its meeting on Thursday. In the Republic, he said the situation is “very fragile, we’ve seen numbers tick up in recent days, and the indications are we have bottomed out… and we’re beginning to see a deterioration again”. The deputy CMO said there is no plan in place for mandatory vaccination of anyone in the state, and that the key to vaccine uptake is “information, trust, confidence and engagement”. Prof MacCraith also warned against “conflation” between a vaccine certificate and an immunisation passport, which he said is something “very different”. What is currently being examined, he said, is a “simple record of vaccination”. The committee heard that more information was needed about, among other things, how the vaccines interrupt transmission before an immunisation passport or similar approach could be mapped out. The committee heard that there are up to 15 potential sites for mass vaccination centres being considered around the country, including the National Exhibition Centre and Citywest in Dublin, and third level institutions such as Waterford Institute of Technology, NUI Galway and the University of Limerick. Dr Henry told the committee, however, that the initial phase of vaccination would “lean into” existing teams of vaccinators such as those involved in the school vaccination programme. PregnancyProf Karina Butler, the chair of the Naitonal Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC) said that there would be advice produced on immunisation for pregnant and breastfeeding mothers, as well as women considering becoming pregnant. She said it would be produced once conditional marketing approval for vaccines was given by the European Medicines Agency, but told Social Democrats co-leader Roisin Shortall that it may not be definitive when it is produced, as there is a lack of data on the impact on pregnancy. It is generally seen as unethical to include pregnant women in vaccine trials. Ms Shortall also raised issues around obtaining informed consent from those who are incapacitated, which would include some in nursing homes and other long term residential facilities. Dr Henry told her that for those who lack capacity, family networks or those involved in a person’s care would be involved in obtaining informed consent, and that there would be efforts to help those who are not computer literate or are of limited capacity through the self-registration system which will be used to sign up to be vaccinated. The Committee also heard there were “solid alliances” between the health service, Nphet and GP groups which had been developed over the course of the pandemic. With GP groups recently raising concerns over clarity on their role in vaccine rollout plans, Dr Colm Henry told the committee that a group has been established to furnish GPs with real-time information, and that the GPs will be particularly important as the phased rollout scales up. The challenge of rolling out a Covid-19 vaccination programme is “unparalleled” either in Ireland or around the world, due to the “scale, complexity and desire for speed” involved, the Committee was earlier told. Successful rolloutIn his opening statement, the chair of the Covid-19 vaccination taskforce, Prof Brian MacCraith, told Oireachtas health committee that the team set up to plan the rollout will be kept on and will play an “ongoing role” in overseeing and monitoring the implementation of the vaccination programme.“Successful roll out of the vaccination programme is dependent upon careful and precise coordination,” he said, between state agencies, the Health Service Executive (HSE) and a wide range of advisory, regulatory and other actors ning both private and public sector bodies. The taskforce will ensure that the rollout is “coordinated within a single integrated work programme”, Prof MacCraith said in his opening statement, “and it will play an ongoing role in the oversight and monitoring of programme implementation” with input from the wide cast of bodies represented on it – from government Departments, to the HSE and the Defence Forces. He said that due to the range of actors involved and the “level of responsiveness that will be required” as the programme progresses “there will be a need to augment and support existing arrangements”. He outlined the complex arrangements, which govern planning for the rollout, with different roles being played by the Department of Health, the HSE, the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC) and units of the HSE such as the National Immunisation Office and the Health Protection Surveillance Centre. The Health Products Regulatory Authority and the National Public Health Emergency Team also are involved, the committee was toldThe challenge of devising and implementing a vaccination programme “of this scale, complexity and desire for speed is unparalleled here and around the world,” Prof MacCraith said. The taskforce has been structured into seven different workstreams, each with a senior responsible officer, who combine with him and a programme director to form a working group, which ultimately reports to the Government. Activity is “well advanced” across each of the workstreams.The taskforce, which is set to meet again on Wednesday afternoon, has drawn up a strategy document and an implementation plan, which will change over time “as required to serve the overall goals of the programme”. Prof Karina Butler, chair of the NIAC, told the committee a redress scheme for those who have adverse reactions to the vaccines would be developed.“A further challenge is to finalise the development of a national injury redress programme to provide support and care in the event that any vaccine recipient develops a serious vaccine reaction as recommended by the The World Health Organisation,” she said.Prof Butler added that the speed at which vaccines had been developed was “inconceivable” but “has not been rushed or reckless”. She said ongoing monitoring of the vaccine is needed, and that the efficacy recorded in trials of the vaccines may drop a little in the “real world” roll out. Prof Butler said that some side effects, including short term reactions, can be anticipated, but that reports from regulatory agencies overseas “raised no significant safety concerns”.

Photograph: Bryan O’Brien A redacted version of the controversial report that led to the resignation of then minister for justice Alan Shatter in 2014, has been placed in the Oireachtas library.It replaces the original version of the review by senior counsel Sean Guerin which criticised Mr Shatter’s handling of allegations by Garda whistleblower Maurice McCabe into Garda misconduct.In a statement to the Dáil Taoiseach Micheál Martin said the paragraphs removed were conclusions in relation to Mr Shatter which the Supreme Court ruled were outside the scope of Mr Guerin’s terms of reference.The Taoiseach said that Mr Shatter had made clear in resigning that “Mr Guerin had not asked to interview him as he would have expected, if his intention was to reach conclusions about Mr Shatter’s approach with regard to issues raised by Sgt McCabe”.Mr Martin also said that the Court “emphasised that it was far from being critical of Mr Guerin’s conduct in carrying out the review in the prevailing circumstances”.But he said it was important that the Supreme Court’s decision was “properly reflected in terms of the information placed before the House”.The Taoiseach told former Labour leader Brendan Howlin who asked if Mr Shatter had been notified, that there had been ongoing correspondence with Mr Shatter on the issue “and this is the culmination of that correspondence”.An attempt was made in the Dáil in May to remove the report in light of the Supreme Court judgment last year, which upheld earlier judgments that Mr Shatter had handled the allegations correctly.But Sinn Féin, backed by other opposition parties said it was unprecedented to remove a report in this manner, and the matter was put back for further discussion. Outlining the history of the case in the Dáil Mr Martin said then taoiseach Enda Kenny appointed Mr Guerin to conduct a review of the Garda’s handling of Sgt McCabe’s allegations.Mr Guerin provided his report in May 2014 and following a meeting with the taoiseach Mr Shatter resigned from government.“Mr Shatter has made clear that in resigning he pointed out that Mr Guerin had not asked to interview him as he would have expected, if his intention was to reach conclusions about Mr Shatter’s approach with regard to issues raised by Sgt McCabe.“Mr Shatter commenced proceedings for judicial review of the report. In February 2019 the Supreme Court found that the conclusions regarding Mr Shatter in the Guerin report were outside the scope of the terms of reference of the review and were arrived at without an invitation to Mr Shatter to express his views.”The Taoiseach said the Court “granted a declaration that the conclusions in the report in respect of Mr Shatter were outside the scope of Mr Guerin’s terms of reference.“The court also emphasised that it was far from being critical of Mr Guerin’s conduct in carrying out the review in the prevailing circumstances.“In my view it is important that the decision of the Supreme Court is properly reflected in terms of the information placed before the House.“Therefore as a matter of propriety and fairness I recently placed a redacted version of the report in the Oireachtas library with those paragraphs which the Supreme Court found were out of scope of the review removed from the text.”Mr Martin said the “revised report is accompanied by the full texts of the Supreme Court’s judgments in order to contextualise the matter”."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4438494.1608129393!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"senior green party ministers united in backing eu and canada trade deal","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLeader of the Green Party  Eamon Ryan, deputy leader Catherine Martin, and Ministers Roderic O’Gorman and Pippa Hackett all set out reasons why they supported the Government decision to bring a motion before the Dáil to ratify the final elements of the trade deal with Canada.   Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollins.The four senior Green ministers have presented a united front in backing the trade deal between the European Union and Canada.In a long letter to Green Party members on Wednesday, party leader Eamon Ryan, deputy leader Catherine Martin, and Ministers Roderic O’Gorman and Pippa Hackett all set out reasons why they supported the Government decision to bring a motion before the Dáil to ratify the final elements of the trade deal with Canada. The letter means that the leadership of the party has come out jointly in favour of endorsing the treaty, which two TDs, Neasa Hourigan and Patrick Costello, have already said they will vote against. This is the first time the four senior ministers have made a joint statement and the show of unity is likely to draw a line under the issue and reduce the prospects of a difficult split over the issue. Most of the CETA treaty - which removes tariffs and barriers in trade between the EU and Canada - is already in operation since 2017. However, a controversial mechanism to resolve disputes has yet to be ratified. Environmental groups and public health campaigners have campaigned against this mechanism, known as the Investor Court System (ICS), because they argue it can supersede domestic law and allow companies sue countries in relation to environmental and public health laws on the grounds it has a negative impact on profits. In the letter the four ministers acknowledge it is “a sensitive issue for the Green Party because in the past we have campaigned against CETA, and in particular against the investment dispute mechanism.”The letter argues that the nature of the agreement has changed in a way that allays most of those concerns. The letter cites four grounds for those changes. It says the ICS has been improved and a decision by the European Court of Justice found it was compatible with EU law. “Contrary to certain claims, Canadian companies will not be able sue the Irish government simply for making new laws around environmental protection. This is made explicit in the text of the trade deal.”The letter also states the Government has been reassured about the climate impact, and both parties to CETA agreed to implement the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change. The four Ministers also argue that the Programme for Government has endorsed CETA, even though it is not specifically mentioned. This assertion has been challenged by those in the party who oppose it, saying it was left out because no agreement could be reached on CETA. The Ministers refer to a phrase that states “the Government will support new and existing trade deals”, arguing that the text represents “an agreement that all parties in Government will support deals already negotiated, such as CETA.”The fourth argument put forward is that ratification is politically important for Ireland, showing the EU can work with other countries especially at a time of Brexit and when international cooperation is under threat. “We believe that it would not have been possible to reopen the CETA agreement, but we will continue to fight for ongoing improvements in other trade agreements.None of this takes away from the fact that this is a difficult issue,” it states.The letter says the issue was raised three times at the parliamentary party over the past six weeks and that the party has now committed to defer the vote until January to allow more time for debate. The internal debate over CETA in the party has reopened some of the internal isions that emerged while the party was involved in negotiations on government-formation.

Cases are surging across the US. New York City’s mayor told residents to prepare for a shutdown of all but essential businesses soon after Christmas. California is stockpiling body bags, recruiting medical workers and considering whether to request a US Navy hospital ship.Cases in Tokyo rose to an all-time high and South Korea is mulling tightening restrictions after also reporting record infections. Hong Kong is also mulling extending restrictions on dining beyond Christmas.Global cases have now reached almost 73.5 million, while deaths have surpassed 1.63 million. Germany Germany recorded 910 coronavirus fatalities in the 24 hours through Wednesday morning, the most since the pandemic began, as a strict shutdown designed to stem a surge in infections comes into force.The daily increase in deaths was far higher than the previous record of 604 on Friday, and took the total to 23,544, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The number of new cases rose by 21,456 to 1.38 million.Chancellor Angela Merkel has warned that the country faces a new peak of Covid-19 infections next month, suggesting that the tougher restrictions will remain in place beyond January.The seven-day incidence rate has risen sharply in the past few weeks and currently is at a record of 180 per 100,000 inhabitants, according to the RKI public health institute. Officials have said the rate needs to come down to 50 per 100,000 and stay there to allow effective contact tracing.USHospitalisations for the coronavirus in the US increased by more than 1,200 patients a day in the six days through Tuesday, data from the US department of health and human services show.There were 112,483 Covid-19 patients in US hospitals as of December 15th, a 7.1 per cent increase since December 9th. California and New York accounted for almost three-quarters of the increase.New Mexico recorded 102 per cent occupancy in its intensive-care units, while Covid-19 cases accounted for more than a quarter of hospital in-patients in Arizona, Nevada and Rhode Island. The number of cases in California hospitals increased 70 per cent to 13,920 from December 1st-15th.As cases surge in California, governor Gavin Newsom is looking overseas to hire temporarily medical personnel. He said the state may ask the US Navy to send back the hospital ship Mercy and has sent 5,000 more body bags to hard-hit counties.Newsom warned in a press conference on Tuesday, a day after vaccinations arrived in the state, that the current wave of infections is still rising, and California could run out of intensive-care beds within weeks. Infections have soared since Thanksgiving, with an average of 163 Californians now dying of Covid-19 per day.The state asked the US department of defence to send 200 temporary medical personnel and may request another visit from the USNS Mercy, which docked off Los Angeles during the first wave of infections last spring. The ship’s highly trained personnel, Newsom said, were more important than its beds. He said the state has also stationed 60 refrigerated storage units at hospitals and morgues.Meanwhile New Yorkers can expect a shutdown of all but essential businesses soon after Christmas, Mayor Bill de Blasio said.If the city’s businesses close “right after Christmas, with good luck and hard work we could be out of that in a matter of weeks,” the mayor said.Although New York governor Andrew Cuomo will make the final decisions, closures will be similar to what the city experienced last spring, with the exception that schools will remain open, Mr de Blasio said.It will take weeks to reduce the number of people hospitalised- at 2.89 per 100,000 in the population as of December 13th - to the city’s established safety level of 2 per 100,000. The percentage of people testing positive for the virus stood at 5.51 per cent, also above the city’s threshold, which is 5 per cent. People admitted to hospitals on December 13th for Covid-19 symptoms stood at 160 - below the threshold of 200.VaccinePfizer rebutted comments by Florida governor Ron DeSantis that the company has had a “production issue” that’s delaying deliveries of its vaccine to the state.“Pfizer hasn’t had any production issues with our Covid-19 vaccine, and no shipments containing the vaccine are on hold or delayed,” company spokeswoman Amy Rose said. “We’re continuing to dispatch our orders to the locations specified by the US government.”Florida received 179,400 doses of the Pfizer vaccine this week. Two additional shipments totaling more than 450,000 doses are on hold, Mr DeSantis said at a press conference Tuesday. He said Florida expects to receive 370,000 doses of the Moderna vaccine next week, then 162,000 more by the end of the month.A Chinese drugmaker has secured 100 million doses of the coronavirus vaccine co-developed by Pfizer and BioNTech, as the country seeks overseas shots in addition to home-made ones to ensure immunisation for the world’s most populous nation.Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical Group, which in March made an agreement with BioNTech to develop and market the mRNA shot in China, will make an advance payment of €250 million for an initial 50 million doses. The German vaccine maker will supply no fewer than 100 million doses for China by the end of 2021, Fosun said in a statement filed with the Hong Kong Stock Exchange Wednesday.Meanwhile, the US is discussing helping Pfizer secure raw materials required to produce tens of millions additional doses of its Covid-19 vaccine for domestic market between April and the end-June, the New York Times reported, citing unidentified people familiar with the situation.The Trump administration is negotiating a deal to use its power to free up supplies of raw materials. The move follows Pfizer’s indication that it can make more doses if the government orders suppliers to prioritise its purchase requests.US states and territories will get $140 million to prepare for Covid-19 vaccination campaigns and $87 million for tracking and testing, the US department of health and human Services said.The first Covid-19 shots are rolling out but the latest funding for distribution has been stalled with Congress unable to agree on a new stimulus package since the summer. State health officials have sought more than $8 billion to distribute hundreds of millions of doses of Covid-19 shots in the months ahead.AsiaNearly half of the 323,000 migrant workers living in Singapore dormitories were infected with Covid-19, far higher than the official tally and indicating the virus spreads widely among people who may not have any symptoms.The city-state has reported more than 54,500 infections in dormitories since the pandemic began, making up more than 93 per cent of all confirmed cases. Another 98,289 workers were found positive through serology testing - which identifies past infections - contributing to an overall prevalence rate of 47 per cent, according to the ministry of manpower.South Korean authorities are reviewing the possibility of raising the social distancing to level 3 and are exchanging opinions with experts, health ministry official Yoon Tae-ho said in a briefing.The Asia nation reported a record 1,078 new coronavirus cases in 24 hours, up from 880 a day earlier, according to data from the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency’s website.Hong Kong is leaning toward extending current social-distancing measures, such as cutting off dining at restaurants from 6 pm local time and closing gyms and beauty salons until January 1st, Hong Kong Economic Times reports.Tokyo reported 678 new cases, surpassing an earlier record of 621, an all-time high according to an announcement from the city’s government.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com\"/polopoly_fs/1.4385961!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_940/image.jpg","title":"world view rebuilding notre dame with lara marlowe","story":"Paris correspondent Lara Marlowe on the destruction and salvation of the city\u0027s iconic Notre Dame cathedral, destroyed by fire in April 2019.

London and parts of the South East were moved to Tier 3 on Wednesday. There are, however, glimmers of hope: some areas have seen positive progress on the key Covid metrics since the last allocation of Tiers across England. Here are some of the main areas ministers deciding Tiers are likely to be grappling with:Hopes are high in the Greater Manchester area for a loosening of Tier 3 restrictions, after the region spent much of the summer and autumn under tough local lockdowns.Mayor Andy Burnham, on Wednesday morning, argued there was a “clear case” for moving the area into Tier 2, pointing to the region’s weekly case rate now being below the average across all local authority areas in England.However, the Government is casting a wider net when deciding Tiers, and a handful of badly performing areas may hold the wider region back.Although Greater Manchester’s case rate of 155 per 100,000, in the week to Dec 10, is below the 180 average for England, it’s still above the average case rate of areas that went into Tier 2 on Dec 3.Instead, it’s closer to the Tier 3 average, which came in at 175 per 100,000 - and indeed cases in four out of the ten local authority areas - the city of Manchester, Wigan, Bury and Rochdale - stand above this rate.Likewise, though cases have been in decline in the Greater Manchester area as a whole, the rates in a handful of areas are at best remaining stubbornly high and at worse beginning to creep up again. The city of Manchester has seen weekly cases tick up slightly to 179 per 100,000 from 175 on Dec 2, while Trafford has seen cases move from 96 to 106. Cases are also rising in the key, 60 and over, age group which further muddies the waters. Half of Greater Manchester’s local authority areas have seen a rise in infections among the elderly.This may mean ministers opt for a wait-and-see approach with Greater Manchester.Parts of the South West currently in the Tier 3, including North Somerset, the city of Bristol and South Gloucestershire, may have a better chance of moving down a Tier.None of these three local authority areas have a case rate above the Tier 3 average - with rates at 126, 115 and 153 respectively.But, cases are not declining uniformly in this region. South Gloucestershire has seen total cases rise, while infections among over 60s in the city of Bristol are up. North Somerset, on the other hand, has been heading in the right direction on both metrics.When England’s lockdown Tier allocation was announced, just two areas - less than one per cent - were placed in Tier 1, the level with the loosest set of rules.Very low case rates in Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly and the Isle of Wight helped keep these areas free of tough restrictions. Since Dec 3 their key Covid-19 metrics have continued to perform well, making a tougher tier doubtful. Herefordshire, currently in Tier 2, may be in with a shot of Tier 1 - the West Midlands county has seen 46 cases per 100,000 in the week up to Dec 10, down from 61 cases in the week up to Dec 2. The rate in Cornwall is 21 per 100,000 and the Isle of Wight’s, just 14. Cases are not rising in the over 60s in Herefordshire and the area’s so-called positivity ratio - the share of swabs that come back from labs with a positive result - has dropped below the important threshold of 5 per cent, suggesting testing there is keeping up with cases.A less likely contender could be the city of York, which has seen similar progress to Herefordshire and now has a case rate of 62 per 100,000. What may hold York back, however, is its neighbours.

This is particularly true in Europe, where Mr Trump’s combative approach on issues such as the disinclination of many European leaders to pay their fair share towards defending the Western alliance, as well as their protective trade instincts, has been the cause of transatlantic friction.Mr Biden’s impending arrival in the Oval Office will therefore be greeted with enormous relief in many European capitals in the expectation that his presidency will herald a return to the cosy consensus that underpinned their dealings with the White House during Barack Obama’s eight years in office.On issues ranging from China to Iran, Russia to North Korea, political leaders around the world will be hoping that Mr Biden will be able to restore America’s global role while at the same time forging a more constructive dialogue with its allies.Mr Biden has already intimated that he intends this to be his direction of travel, declaring that he wants to “renew the spirit and shared purpose of the free world” by creating a US-led coalition of liberal democracies to challenge the rise of authoritarian regimes. The prospect of Washington adopting a more inclusive approach to tackling global challenges is reflected in the incoming administration’s initial appointments.Antony Blinken, the new Secretary of State who previously worked for the Obama administration, describes himself as a multilateralist who is committed to the transatlantic relationship and “believes the world is safer for the American people when we have friends, partners and allies.” Jake Sullivan, the National Security Advisor, is another veteran of the Obama White House who, having worked on securing the Iran nuclear deal, now wants to revive it. Then there is General Lloyd Austin, the nominee for defence secretary, who was responsible for implementing the Obama administration’s military withdrawal from Iraq.The appointment of so many Obama-era political retreads in the new administration certainly lends credence to the view that Mr Biden intends to adopt a similar approach to his Democratic predecessor. The only problem is that the world has changed a great deal in the four years since Mr Obama left office. The woeful naivety that defined the former president’s approach to tackling Washington’s foes is simply no longer tenable.Take China. Even though Mr Obama acknowledged that Beijing posed the greatest challenge to American supremacy, and pivoted American policy towards the Pacific, he kow-towed to China’s communist rulers in the erroneous belief that this might somehow encourage the regime to mend its ways.Instead, four years on, Beijing stands accused of inflicting untold damage on the global economy by trying to cover up its role in the original coronavirus outbreak, persecuting the minority Uighur population and crushing the last vestiges of democratic government in Hong Kong.Russia, so long as President Vladimir Putin remains in power, is another lost cause so far as the incoming Biden administration is concerned. Mr Obama’s attempts to improve ties with Moscow, which resulted in the toe-curling embarrassment of former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton presenting Sergei Lavrov, her Russian opposite number, with a plastic “reset” button in 2009, ended with Moscow’s illegal annexation of Crimea and the Russian military committing unspeakable war crimes in Syria.Then there is the Iran deal, which Mr Obama still regards as the crowning foreign policy achievement of his presidency. Having wasted the tens of billions of dollars Tehran received for signing the deal on expanding Iran’s unwelcome influence throughout the Middle East, the regime is now intensifying its efforts to produce weapons-grade nuclear material. Moreover, under the terms of the deal the Obama administration signed off, Iran will be perfectly within its rights to build atom bombs within five years.Mr Obama, to judge by the preening self-regard that emerges from the pages of his latest memoir, The Promised Land (currently being serialised - where else? - on the BBC), would be the last person to concede the shortcomings of his approach.The lamentable failings of his administration, though, were clearly understood by Mr Trump, whose tenure in the Oval Office saw a dramatic shift in Washington’s outlook, one where extreme pressure was applied against America’s foes, instead of naive expressions of goodwill.Mr Biden would be well-advised to heed the lessons of the Trump legacy rather than seeking to overturn them. At a time when the challenge posed by authoritarian regimes, whether in Beijing, Moscow or Tehran, is clearly in the ascendant, we now live in a world that simply cannot afford another four years of Obama-style naivety.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"ferry passengers kept ship overnight crew test positive coronavirus","story":"More than 300 ferry passengers have been kept on a ship overnight after six members of the crew tested positive for coronavirus.The Stena Line ship, due to travel from Merseyside to Belfast, was held in dock at Birkenhead overnight on Tuesday.

Changing what is perceived as a default position of the major religions is critical in unpicking the support for this intolerable dicrimination.”The Rt Revd Paul Bayes, Bishop of Liverpool, who co-chairs the Commission alongside Rabbi Laura Janner-Klausner, Senior Rabbi to Reform Judaism, will say at the event: “Today is a landmark day in global faith and LGBT+ relations. “For too long, religious teachings have been misused – and are still being misused – to cause deep pain and offence to those who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer and intersex. “This must change, which is why we have joined forces to launch the Global Interfaith Commission on LGBT+ Lives which aims to provide a strong and authoritative voice amongst those who wish to affirm the sanctity of life and the dignity of all.”The Declaration recognises the harm that certain religious teaching has caused the LGBT+ community and asks for their forgiveness, before calling on all nations to end violence against LGBT+ people as well as a global ban on conversion therapy. It ends with a call for all to “celebrate inclusivity and the extraordinary gift of our ersity”The conference will hear from over 20 speakers from across the faiths and is being live streamed.It also features messages from the Bishop of London, Rt Revd Sarah Mullally, the Argentinian Ambassador to Italy, HE Roberto Manuel Carles and the UN Independent Expert for Sexual Orientation \u0026amp Gender Identity, Victor Madrigal-Borloz.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"government masterminding sell out brussels brexiteers","story":"\u0027Act in haste and repent at leisure goes the old adage. When it comes to a thousand-page international treaty on your country’s ability to self-govern, one would argue that remorse lasts in perpetuity.With news today that MPs may work until Christmas Eve to pass a deal with the EU, or, worse still, may not vote until next year and retrospectively correct domestic law to recognise an agreement, we can safely say due scrutiny of whatever Boris brings back is for the birds. That is extremely ominous indeed. Cast your minds back to the Withdrawal Agreement – the dreaded rehash of Theresa May’s subjugation that Johnson himself called vassalage – and you may remember that it was first revealed on October 17 2019, a luxurious three months before it actually became statute. An entire election campaign to get Johnson, and the Brexiteer family favourites, back in office was built around how fantastic this deal supposedly was. The Withdrawal Agreement Act was passed before Christmas by an ebullient Boris and put into statute on January 23, with freshly elected Brexiteers hardly able to recant their campaign compliance.The same legislation (in particular the appended Political Declaration) outlines the very framework of the future deal we await today. Brexiteer MPs claiming not to know what horrors lie in store are thus rather absurd.Wind the clock forward half a year and one time ERG Chair Steve Baker confessed in The Critic that he had no idea there would be a border down the Irish Sea. It’s one thing to miss small print, but accidentally annexing a constituent country to a foreign power is a monumental mistake. This precipitated the utter farce of having to draw up the Internal Markets Bill and breaking the international law enshrined in the Withdrawal Agreement to protect UK food supply chains – legislation only apparently needed in the event of No Deal and now alarmingly dropped.In giving up the contentious elements of the IMB designed to mitigate the worst scenarios emanating from the highly controversial Northern Irish Protocol, Michael Gove has essentially conceded that Belfast will be left in the Customs Union, despite repeated assurances that the UK would depart from the EU intact.To agitate now over the devilish detail of a coming deal is rather too little, too late. The damage was done last year, with the Withdrawal Agreement – readily extolled as hustings took place up and down the country – granting the Conservative Party major leverage over backbenchers and prospective parliamentarians. Hitherto pivotal voices joined in chorus to approve the oven-ready deal, such as that of Brexit-backing QC Martin Howe, who happened to vie to be the Conservative candidate, albeit unsuccessfully, in the seat of Beaconsfield vacated by Dominic Grieve.Howe today has rightly decried not having access to the draft legal texts, enabling any forthcoming treaty to be dumped as a fait accompli. But Howe should know what the deal will look like, having counselled Brexiteers into backing the Withdrawal Agreement and the Political Declaration during the election. All the unconscionable concessions are those being wrestled over today: paragraph 77 of the Political Declaration outlines a level playing field, paragraph 73 fixed fishing quotas and paragraph 131 the EU’s own Courts of Justice as arbiter of future disputes. For anyone to have asserted that a simple free trade agreement could somehow emerge from such a text was bizarre.We are now facing a situation where, as deadlines loom, the Commons may be forced to amend retrospectively domestic law to accommodate a dreadful deal, a move that Leader of the House and famed Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg admits would be hugely controversial and legally contentious, yet is seemingly happy to enable.Boris has checkmated the UK by legally enshrining mass concessions via the Withdrawal Agreement and failing to prepare thoroughly for a No Deal outcome. Yet he was aided and abetted by the very politicians now fearing a great sell-out to Brussels, who were complicit in cheerleading the oven-ready deal that spells out much of what is to come.The writing may not be in statute yet. But it is clearly on the wall.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"queen marys dolls house dining set expected fetch 30000 auction","story":"A miniature dining set designed for Queen Mary\u0027s dolls\u0027 house is expected to fetch up to £30,000 at auction.The 70-piece set, including serving dishes, tureens, bowls, dinner plates, side plates and platters, was made by tableware store Thomas Goode \u0026amp Co, which still has royal warrants with the Queen and the Prince of Wales.The dinner set, which is one twelfth of the normal size, is an exact replica of the set presented to the Queen in 1924.Thomas Goode \u0026amp Co made one copy of every commissioned piece for their own archives, where it has remained ever since.The London-based company was asked to create two miniature China dinner services, one for the dolls\u0027 scullery and the other for the main dining room.Johnny Sandelson, executive chairman, said the sets took two years to make.“Every piece had to be an exact, fully functioning replica, so the teapots flow and the dishes could be used,” he said.The doll’s house was commissioned by the nation to thank Queen Mary for her efforts during the war and was deemed a way of showcasing British craftsmanship.The house, one of the most popular tourist attractions at Windsor Castle, includes a library with versions of real books, a wine cellar containing real wines and a gramophone playing the national anthem.The replica dinner service will be sold with a copy of a handwritten letter from Queen Mary thanking “all the very kind people who have helped to make the dolls\u0027 house the most perfect present that anyone could receive”.Online bidding dates takes place between December 22 and January 8 at Sotheby\u0027s.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"10000 worth christmas presents being","story":"AdvertorialWhy £, worth of Christmas presents are being given to people who buy milkGraham’s The Family Dairy is surprising customers with hampers of fresh dairy products and vouchers to dine at top restaurantsmirrorShareCommentsByDave MastersHelena Pozniack:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC AdvertorialDr Robert Graham, chairman of Graham’s The Family DairyCows still need milking, even in the middle of a pandemic. And owners of Graham’s The Family Dairy in Scotland have continued to rise at am throughout this year to tend their  strong herd of Jersey cows and ensure customers as far away as the Highlands can get milk delivered to their doors.   But while dairy purchases have soared, Graham’s has seen the fortunes of local hospitality businesses plummet - and the family wanted to help out with a Christmas Advent of giving. Thataposs why every day in December in the run up to Christmas, Graham’s is giving away gts to customers - in the form of hampers of fresh dairy products and vouchers to dine out at some of Scotland’s best local restaurants - to the value of £, in all.  As part of our campaign with KFC, we are sharing stories of everyday people doing extraordinary things to help their community - those heroes who want to give people more of what they love. And today we salute Graham’s The Family Dairy for doing just that. “As a family of farmers, it’s not an option to stop milking our cows - le goes on. We soon realised people needed more help than ever,” says Dr Robert Graham, chairman of the dairy in Stirlingshire, who’s worked on the farm in the village of Bridge of Allan all his le, and still oversees the early morning milking. “Our teams have worked incredibly hard over the past few months, and with Christmas coming up, our business wanted to give something back to communities. “Eating good Scottish food with friends and family is such a pleasure,” says Dr Graham, who hopes the scheme will spread a little Christmas joy now and into the new year. “The past few months have been incredibly tough for restaurants and cafes as most of them are small family-run operations.”  When lockdown began earlier this year, Graham’s, which works with more than  farmers across Scotland, mobilised teams to deliver milk, butter and other fresh products direct to more people’s houses as customers stocked up on home baking staples such as butter, eggs and cream. Founded by Dr Graham’s father in , the business has grown from pony-and-cart doorstep deliveries to supplying shops, hotels and restaurants around the UK. Dr Graham works with his son , who’s now managing director and daughter Carol who leads marketing. It was Dr Graham who back in the s decided to buy some  Jersey cows from the Queen’s herd in Windsor - these produce the rich creamy milk for which the dairy is renowned. Keen to help out local cafes, the dairy has also decided to appoint a new milk ambassador in recognition of a café owner or barista whose community spirit shines through. Staff were won over by a local coffee lover and entrepreneur Michelle Kibaris, owner of Fallen Tree Coffee, who runs a mobile coffee truck around rural Blair Drummond near Stirling. She thinks the rich gold-top milk produced by Graham’s Jersey herd makes the best coffee and is delighted to receive free milk from the dairy for a year - worth some £. “I have so many ideas for the business,” she says. For many, food is more than just fuel to keep us going, it’s a way of showing our love and bringing comfort in a dficult time. This year may have been tough but it’s good to remember it has also served up some incredible stories of kindness, determination and joy in communities across the UK. And we think that calls for more…gravy! To add some festive cheer, and give us all more of what we love, KFC have created the new Gravy Burger Box Meal, featuring a fillet burger with added gravy!

You can unsubscribe at any time.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailAs Brexit negotiations drag on past the initial deadline, the prospect of a no-deal on  December is looming large. Boris Johnson has repeatedly said the UK should go for the ‘Australia option.’Yet an aposAustralia-style dealapos isn’t preferable to no deal - they are essentially the same thing. Under this arrangement, EU trading rules would cease to exist in the UK on January  at the end of our transition period. That will slap tarfs overnight on much of the £bn a year in trade which the UK enjoys with the EU. And it’s because of that huge amount of trade that it’s far too simplistic to just call no-deal the Australia option. We’re on the EU’s doorstep - not the other side of the world. So here is the Prime Minister’s potential ‘no-deal alternative’ explained - and some of the problems with it. What is an Australian-style Brexit deal   By seeking to negotiate a trade arrangement with the EU “Australian style”, Britain will adopt Australian terms. This means no trade deal with the EU. And it means Britain would mainly deal with the EU under the standard World Trade Organisationrules. Traded goods are subject to a range of customs checks, quota restrictions and tarfs. These include import tarfs from the EU on % of all food consumed in the UK. There would be % tarfs on imported trousers and blouses and % tarfs on car imports to the UK, adding £, to the average cost of a car from the EU. All this is another way of saying the UK would have no favourable access to the EU market. UK businesses would face the EU’s standard WTO tarfs when trying to export to the continent, and EU businesses would face the UK’s standard WTO tarfs when trying to export to the UK. Australia is not the only nation which trades with the EU this way. So why ‘Australia-style deal’  There are other nations which have more favourable trading terms with the EU. However, Australia is known for being a developed and prosperous country which has historic links with the UK. This is not the first time the government has looked to Australia for inspiration. The Conservatives have also used the phrase ‘Australian-style points-based’ to describe their new post-Brexit immigration system, despite grave human rights concerns about Australia’s immigration system. Why doesn’t the Prime Minister just call it a no-deal  By constantly referring to the outcome as ‘Australian-style’ arrangements, the Prime Minister is making a no-deal Brexit sound more palatable.It is a spin on the outcome of a no-deal because of the fears over the damaging consequences. The Office for Budget Responsibility predicts that a no-deal Brexit would knock around two percentage points off GDP growth in .And the governor of the Bank of England has said that the long-term effect on the UK economy would be worse than the coronavirus pandemic.What’s wrong with calling it an Australia-style deal, then   The EU is the UKaposs biggest single trading partner. This is partly because of the simple reason that the UK is a neighbouring country to the EU. Australia is on the other side of the world. Some £bn of our trade in  - almost half - was with the EU. By comparison, only one of the top  countries for Australian exports in  was in the EU - and that was the UK. It accounted for .bn in , according to research for the Parliament of Australia. The UK relies on the EU for the operation of just-in-time supply chains in sectors such as cars, pharmaceuticals and food. The border checks and delays which would happen much more with an “Australia deal” have far less impact on EU-Australia trade than they would on EU-UK trade. We don’t just have ferry and flight links with the EU that don’t exist for Australia - we also have the Channel Tunnel. Then there’s the question of the shock to our economy of a no-deal exit. Unlike Australia, we’ve gotten used to decades of tarf-free trade with our nearest neighbours. That means our economy - not to mention the customs systems at ports and so on - will have to adjust to a “new normal”we don’t get a deal. For Australia, things can only get better from here.

Ilie Para and Marta Para-Bloj, both , took pictures of the Audemars Piguet Royal Offshore Oak  carat rose gold watch at the luxury store five days before the theft. They then ed with their son to carry out the theft on September  this year. They managed to steal the pricey  carat rose gold watch by swapping it with a replica hidden in the boyaposs hood when the sales assistant turned her back to them, Southwark Crown Court heard. The Romanian couple were stopped by police days later at the port of Dover as they were attempting to go home. Para and Para-Bloj both admitted theft from a shop with Para being jailed for  months while his we Para-Bloj sentenced to eight months in jail. Judge Michael Grieve, QC, told the pair they had ‘groomed’ their young child to help them commit the theft. He said: ‘You took part in what has aptly been described as a sophisticated, well-planned and audacious plan to steal an expensive watch using your six-year-old child as a key part in its execution. Prosecutor Dominic Hockley said the couple were at Harrods five days before the theft, trying on ious timepieces. He said: When they found the watch they were interested in they took photographs, no doubt intending to obtain a realistic replica. When the pair ed the second time, they pretended to be buying a present for the woman’s father. The prosecutor said: When the sales assistant took the other watches and placed them back in the stacks, as she did that, Mr Para took off the genuine watch he had been trying on and swapped it with a fake that was concealed in his child’s coat hood. He immediately placed the fake watch on the display tray. The thieves then claimed they needed some time to ‘think about it’ before leaving the store. The sales assistant was not aware of the swap until the next day when a colleague noticed the watch’s dial was dferent and it was missing its serial number.  Police were alerted and the couple were stopped at the port of Dover with Para wearing the watch on his left wrist. Ioana Nedelcu, defending, told the court Para-Bloj was pregnant at the time of her arrest and had ‘suffered tremendously’ after miscarrying while in prison.

Cars pulled up to the vaccination centre at Hyde Leisure Centre, Greater Manchester, with medics administering the jab within minutes. The borough’s clinical commissioning grouphas worked with GPs and Tameside council to establish the first primary care network vaccine hub, with four more to come in the following weeks. The first batch of the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine arrived in the borough on Tuesday, with vaccinations starting at Hyde Leisure Centre today. Bosses say that the first to be invited for vaccinations will be over-s who are registered with a Hyde GP practice, with further invitations going out ‘as soon as possible’ as the programme ‘rapidly evolves’.The Hyde site is a drive-through model but chiefs are advising that, where possible, people who need the vaccine are not the ones driving, reports the Manchester Evening News.However,a resident does not have someone to drive them to the hub they will be able to park up and walk through to receive the vaccine and then wait in their car for  minutes afterwards. Residents will receive an invitation to come forward for the vaccine at the right time – which will most likely come in the form of a letter, either from their GP or the national NHS. It will include all the information needed to book an appointment, including the person’s NHS number. People are being urged not to contact the NHS or their GP to get an appointment until they receive this letter. All those vaccinated will also be booked in for a booster jab  days later.In a joint statement, the co-chairs of the Tameside and Glossop CCG, Dr Asad Ali and Dr Ashwin Ramachandra said: “Our staff have been working around the clock to prepare for the launch of the biggest immunisation programme in our country’s history. “Through partnership working we have quickly established the first vaccine hub in Tameside ready to carry out le-saving vaccinations for the most vulnerable, while more hubs are being prepared to roll out vaccinations across Tameside and Glossop.” Following extensive trials, the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine is the first safe and effective vaccine for Covid- to be approved by regulators. hiefs say that GP-led primary care networks will now begin vaccinating next week with more practices joining in on a phased basis over the coming months.  Larger vaccination centres will begin operating when further supplies of the vaccine are made available. Hubs will be set up in networks for Ashton, Glossop – which will cover Gamesley, Denton – covering Droylsden and Audenshaw, and Stalybridge – covering Dukinfield and Mossley. Those receiving the vaccine may not be protected until at least seven days after their second dose. People who are suffering from a fever-type illness or symptoms of Covid- should postpone having the vaccine until they have recovered.

Gabriela Damian, , environmental consultant, from Timișoara, Romania. When Laura asks Gabriela what she thinks about Brexit, Gabriela says that a “country should do what suits them.” She says: “I’m not a big fan of the European Union, it is very hard to match people in one family, so it is so much harder to match countries, we have dferent cultures, dferent interests, dferent backgrounds.  She adds: “I love England, but I think it has lost its own personality.” The pair also disagreed over mask-wearing. “I am very annoyed with wearing masks,” Gabriela says. “I don’t see the benefit, we can’t breathe properly and it is scary. It is like a science fiction movie. It is a limitation of our right to breathe fresh air freedom.” Laura is happy to wear a mask. She says: “I have lost people I know to Covid.” Gabriela says she won’t be getting vaccinated. “I won’t be something in my body that doesn’t belong there. The human body is intelligent and perfect.”  Ireland Greece   Jean Kelly, , musician, from south east London. Maria Pikni, , garment worker, from Athens.

Maria works for a clothing company. “I have a paper which says I am allowed to be outside my home from am to take the train and metro and I have to be back by pm,” she says. “The second lockdown is much harder than the first. It is like weaposre prisoners in our own house.” She will be alone on Christmas day because of the risk of infecting her elderly mother. “I am getting very really concerned about Brexit,” Jean says, “I feel like we’ve been hit very hard by the pandemic and now Brexit. I didn’t vote for it and I was very sorry when it went through. It now feels strange to be Irish in England for the first time.

Martina says she thinks schools in Germany should have remained open during the pandemic. “I could see some children were falling behind academically and some children didn’t have the necessary equipment,” she says. “There were also parents who were working in jobs where they just couldn’t look after their children.  “But I agree with you Alison, it shouldn’t come at any cost,the cases are really bad, they should close.” The pair say they will be keeping in touch with each other and hope to arrange another call.

We were seeing what was happening to you, in Italy but we were still too slow.

The situation has got so bad on the Brinnington estate that apospeople canapost even walk about nowapos. Residents say there has been a spate of incidents including thefts, vandalism and other cases of anti-social behaviour in recent months.Some told the Manchester Evening News they are scared to go out after dark.There have been numerous reports of police being pelted with missiles while trying to deal with gangs of youths. Force bosses say they take reports of anti-social behaviour aposextremely seriouslyapos. As such, people in the Brinnington area may notice an increased police presence while we respond to these concerns over the coming weeks, an inspector said in a statement. One woman said the youngsters responsible are aposintimidating the whole communityapos. She said delivery drivers and takeaway staff have been targeted. The woman, who asked not to be named, said: They are smashing windows to steal parcels or attacking takeaway drivers to steal food and money. Theyaposre also throwing bricks, eggs and rocks at taxis and buses. Peopleaposs Christmas presents are going missing. Some grocery deliveries wonapost deliver to Brinnington after a certain time in the evening. Certain takeaways wonapost deliver to the area at all any more.A Facebook post, said to have been penned by behalf of a local courier firm delivery driver, said he had his car window smashed and a number of parcels stolen earlier this month.It follows him reportedly having his car stolen earlier this year. I have tried to find another courier to cover this round while I get sorted, but alas, no one wants to, the post read.This really is your last chance to have me working this estate and serving the good people of Brinnington. I simply canapost afford to work at a loss. If I donapost, work I donapost earn, so not only am I having to pay for a replacement window, I canapost work until itaposs fixed. I know the people who will be reading this probably arenapost the ones who need to be, the consequences of breaking my window, stealing a few items of clothing that will be of no use to those that did it. I guess they can sleep soundly, I know I wonapost be. Another woman said a separate delivery firm asked her to come down from her to flat to collect her parcel from him outside - and that she was told it was now company policy, due to delivery vehicles being broken into and damaged.Several residents who spoke tothe Manchester Evening News said groups of youths congregate close to two shopping parades in the area - and in the Brinnington Park - aposintimidatingapos people.Earlier this year, David Kirwan, , had his garage broken into - and the back window of his car smashed. He said things started to get bad in the summer - and things have only got worse. Itaposs more torment than a nightmare as its so persistent, he said. They congregate in groups nearby. They are not old, probably between  and . The other day I saw some of them squirting some sort of liquid or gas at the concrete bollards then setting them on fire.A few weeks before, they got the codes for the gate [of his flats] and were coming inside, knocking doors and being a nusiance. They banged on one guyaposs window and said aposcome on, chase meapos, but he can barely walk never mind run. You canapost say anything to them or you just get a load of abuse. When the police came about my car at the start of the year, they were throwing stuff at them and we had to take cover in the garage. Itaposs unbelievable really. A  year-old mum said: There always tends to be a big group hanging around.They throw stuff and are intimidating to older people or people with prams. I was going to take my daughter to the park the other day, but decided against in the end because there was a big group and it just wasnapost worth it. I know a lot of delivery drivers have had their vehicles broken into. I know a lot of people who live in the flats and theyaposve had a big problem with it. It feels like itaposs getting worse and worse. Another mum said: It has got really, really bad.Everyone is talking about it, itaposs all over the Facebook groups. I donapost tend to go out after pm. But thataposs not the way we should have to live. Itaposs a shame because the community is amazing, the things people do for each other. But these kids are bringing it down. A woman in her s said: Itaposs appalling, it really is. Shameful, in fact. People canapost even walk about now. The other day a woman got attacked walking her dog on Northumberland Road. They kicked her dog, then tried to grab her bag and kicked her. Itaposs shocking. Thereaposs nothing to deter them. There is a big gang of them who always seem to be hanging around, lots of them on bikes.There was a group of  of them the other night, I counted. We tend to not go out at night now - and we certainly donapost take the car out for fear of it getting smashed up. Councillor Kerry Waters she and her colleague Coun Andy Sorton are aware of aposwhat’s happening in Brinnington at the minuteapos. I’m a Brinnington resident too, she said. We are in constant contact with Stockport Homes, the anti-social behaviour team and the police. I have been having meetings with an inspector and he has assured me we will be getting extra resources for Brinnington. My colleague, councillor Sorton, has been having numerous emails and calls about the town centre, too. Once again, I will be asking the police at the area committee [council meeting] on Thursday night - what is being done for Brinnington to help stop this behaviour   GMP did not confirm specic reports of officers being targeted with missiles.Inspector Ian Ashenden, of GMPaposs Stockport Division said: We appreciate the concerns that our communities within Brinnington have raised and we understand how disruptive anti-social behaviour can be.Tackling anti-social behaviour in the area is a priority for the Local Neighbourhood Policing team and weaposre working with residents and partner agencies to address concerns.We are utilising the aposEsapos approach regarding any breaches of the COVID regulations, especially around group gatherings as under current tier three regulations you are only allowed to meet up to six people while socially distancing from anyone not in your household, we have issued warning letters and will take further enforcement actionappropriate."},{"url":null,"title":"london drinkers out last pints","story":"NewsLondon drinkers out for last pints before it enters Tier  and pubs are closedFrom midnight, all pubs and restaurants in London and parts of both Essex and Hertfordshire are subjected to tougher restrictions so must close except for takeawaysmirrorShareCommentsByTalia ShadwellReporterLorraine King:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsA street party in Soho saw crowds flood the centre of London \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

From midnight, London and parts of both Essex and Hertfordshire are subjected to tougher restrictions to tackle an increase in coronavirus cases. The move has led to City workers holding tiny Christmas parties in Spitalfields Market in east London ahead of the rule change. While other drinkers took the opportunity for one last chance to meet workmates and pals in groups of up to six in outdoor beer gardens before the new rules bite at the heart of the festive season. From tomorrow, pubs, bars and restaurants in the city can only serve takeaway booze once again, as December brings a fresh round of pain for the British hospitality sector. The changes were announced by the Health Secretary Matt Hancock on Monday in a move that has sparked anger by people in the hospitality industry. Greg Mulholland, the spokesman for Campaign for Pubs, said the changes could sound the death knell for some businesses and slammed the Government for introducing them less than a fortnight before Christmas. The campaign manager and former MP told MailOnline: Itaposs devastating news for pubs and publicans in London and the home counties. To move into Tier  just a few weeks after opening again to get some restricted trade, and then this just a few weeks before Christmas.  This is a shocking way to be treating publicans and their families particularly in the run up to Christmas. The former MP for Leeds North West also added many businesses will be left with unused stock which had been ordered in for the Christmas rush leaving them financially crippled. Weaposre very worried about the impact this will not only have on livelihoods but also mental health, he said. According to the British Beer and Pub Association there are , pubs and , sector jobs in London.While Kate Nicholls, the head of UK Hospitality, said the effect on businesses will be catastrophic and will wipe off £.billion from Londonaposs economy in the last two weeks of December. The capital will join millions in England subject to the highest level of restrictions. The parts of Essex going into Tier  are reportedly Basildon, Braintree, Brentwood, Castle Point, Chelmsford, Epping Forest, Harlow, Maldon, Rochford, Southend-on-sea and Thurrock. The parts of Hertfordshire going into Tier  are reportedly Watford, Hertsmere, Broxbourne and Three Rivers.An estimated .million extra people will be affected by the move. The tightening restrictions come even as Ministers forge ahead with plans to allow the rules to be relaxed over Christmas. Three households can combine to make festive aposbubblesapos for five days when UK travel rules will also be loosened to allow families torn apart by lockdowns to reunite.  The four nations are in crisis talks as cases continued to rise, but they failed to agree on whether to curb the Christmas plans. There have been a further  coronavirus deaths in the UK and an additional , confirmed cases in the last  hours.

The tot, who was born eight weeks premature was the youngest person to contract the virus in Scotland. Peyton, who weighed just lbs oz when she was born, had to be transferred from a cot back into an incubator when a Covid test came back positive. First-time mum, Tracy, , said Peyton cried tears for the first time while being given a swab test, and said it was one of the hardest things she had ever had to see. Dad-of-two AJ, , was not allowed to visit his daughter due to the restrictions but the family are looking forward to spending Christmas together in Birkenhead, North Lanarkshire. Tracy said: Itt was kind of unknown for kids to have the virus and whether it would progress and get worse or be alright. She didnapost have any symptoms, just a bit of snfling and a few coughs. Itaposs the same as the adult test - they stuck a swab right up her nose and to the back of her throat. Itaposs the first time Iaposve seen her cry tears. It was so hard and one of the worst things Iaposve seen. Just five days after testing positive for the virus, Peyton was allowed to go home from Wishaw General Hospital, North Lanarkshire - in time for AJaposs th birthday on April  - when she began feeding on her own from a bottle. But despite ing home, Tracy and AJ were terried their baby girl would suffer long-term damage as a result of the illness. Tracy added It was the scariest thing in my le - Peyton had tested positive for a deadly virus. I had to get steroid injections to get her lungs up to scratch, she wasnapost ready to be born. I was worriedher lungs wouldaposve been prepared to deal with the virus. It took five to six months to get rid of that fear, but weaposre watching her grow now. We had only got to see her for an hour a day. The hospital tried to limit the amount of access at one time to parents. The nurses who came to see her were in full PPE. When I went in I learned how to do things I otherwise wouldnapost have learned, like tube feeding. She was able to feed herself her bottle within five days and we took her home. Now you wouldnapost know any dferent.  Sheaposs just a bit smaller for her age and sheaposs had bad colic, but apart from that sheaposs fine. When I think of her journey and all sheaposs been through Iaposm so lucky as a mum. Sheaposs a superstar. The family are now looking forward to spending Christmas Day together with personal trainer AJaposs son James, six, joining them. Tracy, an IT and administration student, added: My husband really suffered - he didnapost get to come to hospital to see her. I had support from nurses but he never had that.

The predictions come as millions of families wrestle with what arrangements to make for Christmas with safety fears abounding despite the Government allowing three families to form an exclusive bubble for five days. Hotspots in England currently include large swathes of the South East, as well as Northumberland, County Durham, and parts of Yorkshire.In Wales, the hotspots according to the map today include Pembrokeshire, Carmarthenshire and Ceredigion, as well as Swansea and Cardf.Edinburgh, Fe and North, East and South Ayrshire are marked as hotspots in Scottish. Everywhere in Northern Ireland, apart from Ards and North Down which sits at around - percent probability of more than  cases per week, and Belfast, at - percent, are also marked in red.  By December  some areas across the country are expected to improve - though much of the southeast remains the same following Matt Hancockaposs announcement that a newly-discovered iant of coronavirus is growing faster in the region.This includes all of London, which remains in the - percent range by Christmas Day. Parts of Scotland and Northern Ireland will begin to ease out of the red areas, as will Northumberland and County Durham.  Tier  hotspots, including Leeds, will move out of the red zone, and cases in previous areas of concern like Liverpool and Knowsley will continue to drop. By January , there is some movement in the southeast, with Windsor and Maidenhead dropping out of the red, according to the chart. However, major cities, including Birmingham, Manchester, Edinburgh, Cardf and Swansea, all stay in the highest probability range into .  This data will likely feature heavily in Boris Johnsonaposs mind as he plans to toughen up guidance for the Christmas truce for four days from December . The PM will hold urgent talks today with the leaders of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. He intends to toughen up guidance to families seeing elderly relatives over Christmas amid warnings the virus was again spiralling out of control.  Mr Johnson is expected to urge the public to “stay local” over the festive season to avoid spreading the disease across the country. Health experts warned the PM that sticking to his plan to allow households to mix was a “major error” that would overwhelm the NHS and cost many lives. From today, a total of .million extra people went into Tier  as cases continue to surge.

Should the five-day Christmas pause be scrapped  Scientists are calling for the easing of restrictions at Christmas to be ditched and there are signs the Government may reduce the number of days, or number of households allowed to meet. Prof Majeed says: “Because Covid- rates are at a very high level in many parts of the UK, it would be sensible to continue with the current restrictions over the Christmas period, rather than pausing them. “If we don’t pause the five-day relaxation of restrictions and people mix indoors in large numbers with people from other households, we will pay the price for this in January through increases in Covid- cases, hospitalisations and deaths.” Dr Tildesley believes changing the rules so close to Christmas could cause more harm than good. He says: “I would be really worried about the Government changing the rules now, as it may cause a massive drop in trust.” Should schools be allowed to close early so kids can self-isolate before seeing at-risk relatives  Prof Majeed says: “Closing schools should be a decision made by headteachers in discussion with their local authorities and local public health teams. I would allow schools to close early in areas where Covid- rates are high and there are clusters of cases in schools.” Dr Tildesley says that while he would “never advocate” closing schools, the measure would protect elderly relatives. He says: “If you have a vulnerable relative you should do what you can to keep them safe. Isolating for a few weeks before will certainly help minimise the risk.” Should households be allowed to mix during Christmas  Dr Tildesley says letting families come together could help mitigate the effects of the pandemic on mental health, but people must stay in their Christmas bubbles. He says: “We need to have some relaxations of the controls to allow families to be together. We need to think about the non-Covid impact, and wellbeing and mental health are two of those. Butthree or four households are allowed to be together, those households need to be exclusive. You can’t go to meet your mates down the pub then go home to see your granny.”  Eventhey can, should people have a big family Christmas  Prof Majeed says: “I would be cautious about large, indoor Christmas events – particularlyyou have elderly relatives or relatives with serious medical problems.” Dr Tildesley says people should “do what they can to be together and prevent loneliness”. But he adds: “People just need to be aware of the risks and take sensible precautions. “Just because the rule might say three households can meet, it doesn’t mean that number have to mix. “You can also minimise the risk by strictly following the rules in the run-up to Christmas to have as little contact with people outside your household as possible. And during the Christmas period, maintain physical distance, ensure that your home is well ventilated and practise good hygiene, such as regular hand washing.” Could the Christmas pause result in more Covid deaths  Dr Tildesley says yes, but we can reduce the risk by taking sensible precautions. He says: “Any increase in mixing is going to cause more cases, and ultimately, an increase in hospitalisations and deaths. “Butwe limit as much as possible the amount of interactions we have with others in the run-up to Christmas, then hopefully we can keep the risk of that extra mixing as low as possible.”  Won’t going back to a tier system after Christmas make up for it  Dr Tildesley thinks what we do before Christmas is more important. He says: “You do need to tighten up afterwards, but what you really want to do is minimise the risk of elderly relatives getting infected. If you do have a particularly vulnerable relative and you feel you really want to be with them, isolate for a week or two beforehand to really minimise the risk that you yourself are infected,you can.” ,],totalVotes:,votesToShow:,mentometerId:,publicationId:,callbackUrl:https:www.mirror poll-ws poll  status,voteActionUrl:https:www.mirror poll-ws poll  vote,closed:,closedMessage:This poll has been closed!,hideResults:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,tcfVersion:,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,codesplit:,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,loginRadiusAPIKey:d-da-d--ccee,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,delayAdsUntilConsented:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,videoPlaylistEnabled:true,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,pubmaticDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,loginRadius:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,prebid.sendHBKeys:,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,enableUserProfile:true,sovrnDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,smartAdServerDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,verizonDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,enableAboutTopics:true,GDPRConsentEnabled:,viafouraComments:true,swipeNavigation:true,flagsFromDataLayerForFBIA:true,fundingChoicesEnabled:true,customAdExperience:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,fbia.converse.enabled:true,irisClientToken:,disableAHS:true,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,LoginRadiusDomain:https:reachplc.hub.loginradius,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,ixDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,commentCountEnabled:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,og.image.for.section.and.topic:https:s-prod.mirror @trinitymirrordigital chameleon-branding publications mirror img logo-mirror-socialsharing.png,video.suppressDates:true,delayVideoAdsUntilConsented:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true\" Isn’t Christmas too important for many people to deny them the chance to celebrate it as normal  Prof Majeed says Christmas is “a very important part of our social fabric”. He says: “We need to think how we can allow people to celebrate without risking their health and the health of more vulnerable people.” Dr Tildesley says: “We do need to think about the negative impact of lockdown as well as the public health impact of Covid and acknowledge the fact that severe lockdown is very harming for a lot of people. “We should allow some small relaxation at Christmas for people’s health and wellbeing.” Should churches stay open for Christmas services  Dr Tildesley says: “There’s always going to be an increase in risk, but Christmas shopping is also a risk – the question is how much of an increase are you prepared to accept, and what are you going to do to minimise the risk. “There’s got to be social distancing between family groups and restricting the number of people to allow for that.” Prof Majeed thinks churches should only be allowed to open in areas with low infection rates. He says: “Any indoor mixing poses risks and activities such as singing in indoor spaces have been shown to lead to increased risks of infection.” "},{"url":null,"title":"worlds biggest selection box 80000","story":"NewsWorlds biggest selection box with , calories raffled for childrens hospitalThe incredible ft x ftboasts  dferent treats, weighs an enormous st lbs and would see the owner scoff more than , caloriesmirrorShare boasts  dferent treats, weighs an enormous st lbs and would see the owner scoff more than , calories\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.mirror incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _PAY-HUGE-CHOCOLATE-SELECTION-BOX.jpg\" data-tracking\"facebook|share|\" boasts  dferent treats, weighs an enormous st lbs and would see the owner scoff more than , calories\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.mirror incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _PAY-HUGE-CHOCOLATE-SELECTION-BOX.jpg\" data-tracking\"twitter|share|\" boasts  dferent treats, weighs an enormous st lbs and would see the owner scoff more than , calories\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.mirror incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _PAY-HUGE-CHOCOLATE-SELECTION-BOX.jpg\" data-tracking\"whatsapp|share|\"CommentsByAbigail OLeary:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsMyla, , with the huge selection box \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Join the Secret Elves to discover the best shopping deals and things to do this ChristmasSpread the Christmas cheer!When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Lorna Whiston, , had previously suffered from cancer, but thediagnosis means she now fears she may never see her twins go to school, friends say. She was diagnosed with breast cancer in February , and had a double mastectomy, followed by egg preservation, six months of chemotherapy and three weeks of radiotherapy. The heavy treatment programme paid off, and in January  a scan showed no evidence of cancer.She fell pregnant two months later in March, but last month the -year-old from Haslington, near Crewe, went to AE after a conversation with  CheshireLive reports.She had been suffering from breathlessness, a change in her voice and a cough. A scan later revealed a mass on her chest. To allow for treatment that was needed, Ms Whitson decided to have the twins delivered early. But on the Friday following the birth, she received the heartbreaking news that her breast cancer had ed and was now stage . Stage  cancer is classed as incurable.Now, one of Lorna’s best friends from school, Sam Irlam, has set up a GoFundMe page to raise money for Lorna, her partner Johnny, her three-year-old son Mason, and twins Arya and Reuben. Sam said: Originally, I set up a small Messenger group with literally just me and the girls that were all friends at school so maybe we could get her some gts to cheer her up a little bit which would be nice. But I made that bigger and made it more of a whole year group thing, got everyone to add everyone from school and then I just decided, right, this can go bigger. We need to really muck in and try and do something really good for her. So I just opened it and itaposs just kind of blew up really. The page has already raised more than half of the £, target, and Sam said the dream would be that the donations could secure a deposit for a house for the family. This would allow a safety net for when Lorna passes, helping Johnny, her partner, as he brings the three kids up on his own.

There are growing fears the relaxation of rules could cost thousands of lives. Number  is coming under increasing pressure over its five day Christmas bubble plan for the whole of the UK, which will next week see up to three households allowed to mix indoors. Boris Johnson is standing firm over the measure, in which people in any tiers can travel and gather from December  to . With coronavirus infections rising fast in parts of the UK, it has prompted fears of a third wave.Today Professor Graham Medley urged people to think about trying to avoid younger and potentially asymptomatic people mixing with older relatives over the festive period. But he said there will be benefits with schools and workplaces closing. He told BBC Radio aposs Today programme: It will mean that there will be more transmission in older peoplewe have a normal Christmas because it is the younger people, who are more likely to be asymptomatically infected, mixing with older people. Thataposs the thing that most people regard as being the highest risk. People thinking about what they are doing, itaposs that that they should be trying to avoid. He added: There are two things happening over the period: one is that most workplaces and schools are closed, so that will result in reduced contact.  On the other hand,we all mix together and have a normal Christmas then we know that in a normal year most respiratory diseases and hospital admissions increase after Christmas anyway in a non-Covid year, so thereaposs clearly a risk, but it really very much depends on what people do. Itaposs very hard to predict and say aposoh yes, this is going to be a disasterapos or aposnothing is going to happenapos because it really does depend on what people decide to do.A top Tory today urged Brits to make “Easter the new Christmas” after it emerged the Prime Minister is refusing to tighten the rules.Robert Jenrick said people should “come to their own judgements” about whether to meet family next week - despite scientists begging the government to cancel a bubble plan.  The Communities Secretary said his own wider family have changed their plans and will now meet on video calls instead of in person. And he said others may “think on this occasion let’s just keep it small and we can meet up in the Spring - Easter can be the new Christmas for some people”. It comes as the four nations of the UK hold fresh talks today about the way forward after medical journals warned the five-day relaxation is a “blunder” that will cost “many lives”.

Photos emerged of a tiny white house on the island of Elliðaey, a remote island south of Iceland. Being the only building on the deserted island, it has attracted several myths. According to one rumour, the house was built by a billionaire who planned to move to the remote island in the event of a zombie apocalypse. Other people suggested a religious hermit may be living there. Another popular theory - which was later debunked - said that the Icelandic government had gted the island to singer Bjork. Some even claimed the house did not exist but it had been photo-shopped before the pictures were published online. Elliðaey, part of the Vestmannaeyjar archipelago, is now completely deserted but it was inhabited about  years ago. Five families who lived there relied on fishing, hunting puffins and raising cattle.But by the s, the last residents left the island which has been deserted since. The reality surrounding the mysterious house on the island is far less exciting than the theories around it.It was built by the Elliðaey Hunting Association as a base to hunt puffins which feast on the abundant supply of fish in the waters below. The house serves as a hunting base for the group to support their activities on the island. Being on the remote island, the property does not have electricity, running water and indoor plumbing.

The imposing property has suddenly appeared in a billionaire’s village and is protected by huge secrecy, says Russian newspaper Sobesednik. The two main buildings are said to run to , square feet, with , square ft stables. The “classical style” palace in a -acre walled estate during its construction phase was owned by a company called Property-V, and the newspaper suggests that ‘V’ stands for Vladimir, concluding that the sprawling estate must belong to an inidual with the highest Kremlin connections. The sumptuous residence is listed as belonging to the Russian Federation, which the report claims is a “cover” used by “owners of palaces and penthouses associated with the countryaposs leadership”. The report suggests the property is either his or belongs to someone exceptionally close to him. A “housewarming” was held for the Property-V palace last month - but without ostentatious fireworks, said the report.  Another gigantic pad on a clf top on the Black Sea known as the  billion Gelendzhik Palace complete with its own vineyard has been linked to Putin as a bolt hole in the south, despite Kremlin denials. So far there has been no response from Putin’s spokesman to the Sobesednik claims, the latest in a series of “revelations” on his wealth, health and private le in recent weeks, leading to suggestions he is under unprecedented “information attack” from foes. But Putin is due to face the media in a major annual marathon press conference later this week.  The recently completed palace is at Greenfield village which offers “a new standard of country le” with an “impeccable style of elite suburban le and the independence of serene nature”, according to a publicity blurb. It comprises “stately residences, reminiscent of country castles”, and is home to a number of billionaires. The village boasts “beautul parks and bouleds  metreswide….fountains, sculptures, flower beds” and is surrounded by “vast forests”.  Before the palace’s construction was complete the village was said to house the “most expensive house in Russia”, owned by Jordanian billionaire Ziyad Manasir. He was reportedly a guest at the wedding of Putin’s younger adult daughter Katerina Tikhonova, , to the country’s youngest billionaire Kirill Shamalov, , a match that ended in orce. The new palace may be worth some £ million, reports Sobesednik.  Andrey Ertman, representative of the company which was constructing the palace, refused to name the owner “hiding under the pseudonym ‘Russian Federation’”, said the newspaper. This is confidential information. Buyers of such assets do not always strive for publicity. This is their right,” he explained. Companies tied to the new palace and its financing are closely linked to the Russian elite and other stunning properties, it is claimed.

I will consider the views of the other nations. If we can come to a four-nations agreement, that would be preferable. If that is not possible, the Scottish Government will consider what we think is appropriate.#Nicola SturgeonBut the inter-governmental talks were held as concern grows about a new strain of the Covid virus that was first detected in the south of England but has since been discovered north of the border.At Holyrood, Ms Sturgeon said nine cases of the new strain had been identied in the Greater Glasgow and Clyde health board area, which dated back to November.Ms Sturgeon also announced that Aberdeen City, Aberdeenshire and East Lothian would face tougher restrictions from Friday – moving from level two to level three of the Scottish Government’s tier system.South of the border, the second wave has resulted in millions of people in London and parts of Hertfordshire and Essex moving into England#s toughest tier of coronavirus rules this week.Further concerns about Christmas triggering an acceleration of the virus were raised by two leading medical journals. The Health Service Journal and the British Medical Journal warned people might see the lting of restrictions “as permission to drop their guard”.Speaking ahead of her call with Mr Gove, Ms Sturgeon told MSPs she will not be entering the discussions with a “fixed view”.But the first minister signalled that shortening the period for relaxing restrictions or further limits on the size of bubbles was under consideration. She also said the Scottish Government would not shy away from taking a separate approach to the rest of the UK,it was felt to be necessary.“There is a case for us looking at whether we tighten the flexibilities that were given, in terms of duration and numbers of people meeting,” Ms Sturgeon said. “I will consider the views of the other nations. If we can come to a four-nations agreement, that would be preferable. If that is not possible, the Scottish Government will consider what we think is appropriate. Of course, I will update parliament as soon as there is anything to update parliament on.”Ms Sturgeon has argued that easing restrictions would be a pragmatic response to people’s desire to meet up over the festivities.

It’s a project that looks like it’s dead now for the reason, that we were told, that Celtic have pulled out.“The message really is that, putting this project aside, we’ll stick our heads in the sandwe don’t think there’s going to be cross-border leagues or European super leagues with isions.“What we have to do, as a country and a group of clubs, is be at the table looking at these opportunities.“Some of them may be appropriate to look at. Some not.

Martin Bonar replaced Scott Johnston for Saints while Chris Hart made way for Innes Meikle for the hosts.The deadlock was broken in the th minute from a quickly-taken free kick by Cammy Hill after Martin Bonar had been brought down in the centre circle by James McGuiness.Hill spotted Aaron McKay in space on the right and sent him scurrying forward. McKay cut into the box and picked out the run of Craig MacEwan who was foiled from six yards by Ally Lewis.The young keeper#s good work was undone when he couldn#t hold MacEwan#s shot allowing the ball to spin away from him.Ben Forbes was on hand with a sliding challenge to knock the loose ball away from MacEwan but only as far as Gavin Forgrieve, who gleefully tapped home from four yards.Lewis saved again from MacEwan three minutes later this time managing to hold onto the ball at the second attempt before a neat Matty Kelly turn on the corner of the Star -yard box wrong footed Ben Forbes creating the space for Kelly to curl a ball to the far post a matter of inches in front of the outstretched boot of Scott Maitland.Maitland got forward again in the st minute finding Gavin Forgrieve in front of goal. He took the ball down well only for Innes Meikle to get back with a vital challenge at the expense of a corner kick.Martin Bonar climbed well at the back post to meet Forgrieve#s delivery from the right but couldn#t direct his header on target.Despite being unable to hit the target himself Bonar was able to claim an st minute assist for the second and final goal.The big midfielder, a key member of Red Star#s  Scottish Amateur Football League Premier Division Two title winning side, won possession well in the centre circle and opened up his former team mates with a perfectly weighted pass for the forward run of skipper Craig MacEwan.Top marksman MacEwan comfortably beat stranded Red Star keeper Ally Lewis with a deft chip from  yards into the unguarded net.Referee Jimmy Litster, who ensured the two local rivals remained on friendly terms throughout, called time on proceedings after three added minutes with both sides satisfied to complete another  minutes while the majority of their respective league rivals remain side-lined."},{"url":null,"title":"in praise of john campbell factor mor","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The town on its present site would be taking shape by the time young Zachary began his schooling.His education, however, was said to be #rudimentary#, so young Zachary began teaching himself Latin and Greek as he absorbed English classic literature.Employed from the age of  in a merchant#s office in Glasgow, historical references describe him falling into #bad company# and indulging in excessive drinking.At the age of  in  he emigrated to Jamaica to take up a role as a book-keeper, effectively a slave overseer, on a sugar plantation. Such was his horror and disgust at the way in which slaves were treated on the plantation that he became an implacable opponent of the slave trade.He gave up his job in Jamaica # by this time a #model book-keeper# # and ed in  to Britain and secured a position in London. His sister Jean had married Thomas Babington of Rothley Temple, Leicestershire, a country gentleman and ardent evangelical. Babington took MacAulay under his wing and introduced him to the Clapham Sect # a group of Tories against slavery.Among them was William Wilberforce, founder and leader of the anti-slavery movement.Through working with the Clapham Sect, MacAulay was invited in  to visit Sierra Leone # the West African colony established to provide a home to emancipated slaves from the United States who came to Sierra Leone via Nova Scotia.In , aged , he was promoted to the post of governor and remained in the post until .Returning to England on a slave ship, he brought with him  African children, with the hope of finding them a better le in the Clapham Sect community.He settled in Surrey following his marriage to Selina Mills on August , .Having witnessed the misery of slavery, MacAulay became a member of the Society for the Abolition of the Slave Trade, working closely with Wilberforce, and soon became a leading figure in the parliamentary campaign. He later became secretary of the committee, which became known as the African Institution.The campaign succeeded in , with an Act of Parliament making the slave trade illegal throughout the British Empire. The practice, however, was to continue despite this victory.Many abolitionists had thought slavery would fade away once the slave trade was stopped, but that failed to happen.MacAulay continued in his activism, helping seize a slave ship in . On this act, William Wilberforce commented in a letter to MacAulay, #you really deserve a statue#.In the s MacAulay turned his attention towards securing the total abolition of slavery itself. He helped found the Society for the Mitigation and Gradual Abolition of Slaveryin , and was editor of its monthly publication, the Anti-Slavery Reporter from its launch in .His major contribution was the collection and collating of a huge volume of evidence showing the true scale of slavery # a role to which he was ideally suited as a skilled statistician with a meticulous approach and an exceptional head for figures.It was also during this period that MacAulay co-founded University College London.Publication of the Reporter continued until , but by the end the work had worn MacAulay out and he had got into debt.In  Selina died and, with his finances in disarray, MacAulay was exiled to Paris in  # the year the Slavery Abolition Act came into force which ended slavery throughout the British Empire.He ed to England once his debts were liquidated and died on May , . He was buried in a London cemetery, but after the site became a public park # St George#s Gardens # the exact location of his grave was lost.MacAulay is commemorated with a le-sized memorial bust in Westminster Abbey.To mark the th anniversary of his birth in , a memorial plaque was unveiled in the gardens, donated by the Royal Statistical Society, the Friends of St George#s Gardens, University College London and the Clan MacAulay Association.William Wilberforce said of Zachary MacAulay: #My sober and deliberate opinion is that you [Zachary MacAulay] have done more towards this consummation [abolishing slavery] than any other man.#For myself, I take pleasure in acknowledging that you have been my tutor all the way and that I could have done nothing without you.#"},{"url":null,"title":"a family passion for scotlands beauty","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Frances and Ross depict the ever-changing and often harsh weather conditions which frame their Argyll home.A Family Affair explores their shared artistic tropes as they both represent the landscape of Scotland’s islands and west coast, working in nature, directly inBoth use oil paint and other media, drawing with the brush or palette kne to make urgent, swt marks that capture the fleeting effects and drama of changing weather.They also share Crinan, where the Ryan family has run the Crinan Hotel since the mid-seventies, from where Ryan left for school, then art school and set out on extensive travels. But the beauty of Argyll # and his boat Sgarbh # drew him back.Earlier this year Ross held his second solo exhibition with The Scottish Gallery, but due to lockdown not a single person was able to attend.Frances has been a regular exhibitor with the gallery for years with her distinctive Hebridean seascapes and landscapes showing the repeated mots of Iona, The Mull of Kintyre, the bays around Crinan and the view across to Jura and the Corryvreckan.Like a good modernist Frances is reluctant to give any commentary on her works but Ross, on the other hand, makes extensive notes on his journeys allowing others to understand how hard-won the paintings are, particularly in winter when the harsh conditions create privations and huge physical problems. Each painting becomes a manestation and record of time and place.His affinity with the natural world is reflected in his long-term project of setting messages in bottles on the ocean, which brings him encounters as he journeys to meet the people who find them, and make new works at the location of the find.A Family Affair will be presented concurrently with Mark Hearld’s Menagerie, which will transport visitors to an animal-filled world with a series of prints, woodcut and linocuts inspired by the artist’s love of British flora and fauna.A Family Affair and Mark Hearld’s Menagerie will be at The Scottish Gallery in Edinburgh between Saturday November  and Wednesday December ."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column november 20 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

All representatives who are isolating or unable to attend must be able to speak up for their voters.We noted as early as June that the abrupt shut-down of remote participation was bound to leave communities unrepresented as the pandemic continued to rage. The Commons took a step backwards in ending this too early.MPs and voters need consistency and transparent standards for how these crucial democratic decisions are made.We can#t have ato the conga line chaos we saw in June, or the decisions simply being made on a whim by a minister.MPs need clarity about how they can continue to represent their voters during this stark second wave and beyond.There must be far greater transparency over how these decisions on participation are made, rather than ministers being forced to act at the last moment.Since some MPs may be isolating or not safe to travel in person, there’s a real threat for democratic representation and political equalityremote participation continues to be strictly limited or indeed denied. Virtual proceedings in the summer were a real success in bringing parliament into the st century. Let’s learn from that and ensure all voters are heard.Darren Hughes, chief executive, the Electoral Reform Society.Sir,SNP ministers must outline how they are planning for a Covid- vaccine rollout across Scotland.People are understandably feeling positive about a potential vaccine for coronavirus, which is why it is critical for the SNP government to lay out the detail of its roll-out plans as a matter of urgency.We can ill-afford to repeat the same mistakes we saw with the flu vaccination earlier this year.Ministers need to set out what infrastructure is being put in place right now so they are ahead of the game when it comes to rolling out any vaccine across Scotland when it becomes available, and doing so fairly and effectively.Getting this right will be particularly important for the Highlands and Islands with our dispersed population and challenging geography.We must be assured that our region does not end up playing catch-up with the central belt which is an understandable concern locally, given the track record of this government in other matters affecting us.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSP and Shadow Health Secretary.Sir,In the recent storms  houses at Bruach Gorm, Port Charlotte, using the communal West Highland Housing Association satellite dish lost half their sky channels including BBC  and STV.As I write, it#s been  working days since at least three of us that I know reported the issue to West Highland, but not a word of a fix date.The dish has done well for  years, but things degrade over time. I had an inkling this year there would be a dish problem and in the summer I bought a TV aerial kit for £ # a lot cheaper than fitting a dish.I put the aerial in the loft and there is a good reception, with BBC  and STV back. It is storm proof in the loft, though was disappointed with the lack of channels from the Bowmore transmitter.I Googled it and the mast is a Freeview Light and lacks channels other UK areas enjoy. I use Sky HD freeview channels but with Sky you have to navigate the TV guide through all the blocked subscription channels to find the one you want to watch. Via the Bowmore mast the TV guide just lists the the Freeview channels, which is great.Freeview said that there were more channels available on main transmitters than there was on relay transmitters, which play a vital role in providing more remote areas with TV coverage.There are a lot of aerials on houses and I think Islay#s TV transmitters should get an upgrade to the same channels as other areas expect.I will also raise this issue with those elected to improve our lives, including our MSP, MP, council leader Councillor Currie and Councillor Horn.Colin M Campbell, Port Charlotte, Isle of Islay.Sir,I think we all need a boost of positive news, so I would like to appeal to your readers to give a brave and special young person in your area the credit they deserve by nominating them for the  WellChild Awards.We are looking for inspirational children and young people who have defied the odds in the face of serious illness and the selfless nurses, doctors, brothers, sisters and friends who help care for them.This is your opportunity to give them the recognition they deserve at a prestigious event regularly attended by WellChild Patron, The Duke of Sussex.Nominations are open now so please get yours in before the closing date on Monday December  at noon.

Usually we look forward to the Christmas lights and decorations brightening up the dark winter nights and bringing hope and cheer.This year, we wait and wonder. We wonder what level our area will be in, we wonder what level our family and friends will be in, we wonderwe will be able to see them or have them in our homes or go to their homes.We wonder.

The current bus stop and car park at the head of Glen Croe would also be bypassed. This is an important public transport link for local residents.The consultation launched by the Scottish Government’s Transport Secretary, Michael Matheson is a muddled exercise. It confuses the urgent need to decide on an alternative route for a new road through Glen Croe with the much longer-term strategic transport options for improving connectivity between Argyll and west-central Scotland.Most of the strategic options involve a number of new civil engineering challenges including the construction of bridges over Loch Long and Loch Fyne and extensive road building, both new and upgraded. For reasons of cost and complexity, none of these options are likely to be implemented within this decade.Whatever long-term strategy options may be investigated for their feasibility, there remains the urgent need to build a new road in Glen Croe. It will always be necessary to link the communities of Arrochar Tarbetwith Loch Goil, Cairndow, north Loch Fyne, Inveraray and beyond with the A.I note that both my local community council in Loch Goil and Argyll and Bute Council support the route that follows the existing forest track on the opposite side of the glen from the Rest and Be Thankful without a similar risk of landslides. Compared with the strategic options, this is a modestof road to construct.The sooner that steps are taken to realise this solution the better it will be for all who currently suffer the increasingly frequent road closures due to climate change and the unstable hill.Alastair R Moodie, LochgoilheadSir,Every year thousands of children contact Childline about being bullied online and tell us that they feel it is hard to escape from.Lockdown has intensied these feelings for many and since April we’ve counselled more than , children and young people across the UK about online bullying.Children have told us about people sending threatening or abusive messages and being pressured into engaging in sexual conversations. Others have shared that they’ve been excluded from online games by other children, while some spoke of online identities being stolen to embarrass or cause trouble while using their name.Before lockdown measures were first introduced this year, the average monthly number of counselling session with children about online bullying was . Between April and October that value increased by  per cent to a monthly average of .This is worrying, particularly as we continue to adhere to strict social-distancing restrictions across Scotland and children continue to spend more time online. Bullying can have a long-term impact on the mental wellbeing of a child and, as we mark Anti Bullying Week this month and beyond, it’s important to ensure that every child knows who they can turn to for support.If a parent thinks their child is being bullied online, it can be hard to remain calm, but it’s crucial not to overwhelm a child with questions. Taking their device away is likely to make them feel like whatever has happened is their fault instead, it’s helpful to listen to their worries, suggest they take some time away from certain apps, and provide them with reassurance.Adeniyi Alade, service head of Childline at NSPCC ScotlandSir,Boris Johnson’s comment that devolution has been #a disaster north of the border# and #Tony Blair’s worst mistake# should hardly come as a surprise to anyone.The Tories have never been great supporters of devolution, vehemently opposing both the referendums in  on establishing a Scottish Assembly and in  on the Scottish Parliament.Most recently the devolution power grab that is highlighted in the Internal Market Bill simply reinforces this stance.The Scottish Social Attitudes surveyon constitutional preference found that only seven per cent favour abolition of the Scottish Parliament and it found that trust in the Scottish Government sits at four times that of the UK Government. This points to it hardly being a disaster.For those accused of scaremongering that there is a threat to Holyrood, Mr Johnson’s comments are clear vindication. The irony of all this being that devolution has given new le to the Scottish Conservatives after its wipe out in  and it is now the opposition in the Scottish Parliament.Be under no doubt that the Scottish Parliament, which was hard fought for, is under threat and we must do all in our power to defend it.Alex Orr, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures november 27 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Why  Because this modication very effectively protects moths from becoming bat-fodder.Butterflies are active during the day but moths are mostly nocturnal. And under the night sky moths make a tasty meal for insectivorous bats. These tiny mammals detect their prey by echo-location, a method of hunting that involves emitting repeated ultrasonic squeaks, generally with a dominant frequency range of - kilohertz . Their prey is then located from the direction of the ing echoes.Moths have evolved ious mechanisms to evade these predators: some have developed ears that detect bat echolocation calls, allowing them to take evasive action, but others, the earless moths, have to rely on passive defences – so-called acoustic camouflage # that is, their hairy thoraces.Comparing tomographic echo images from two species of earless moths with two species of diurnal butterflies, the Bristol scientists found very little effect on the ultrasound echoes from the thin layer of thoracic scales of butterflies. In contrast, the hair-like scales covering moth thoraces absorbed around  per cent of the ultrasonic sound energy in the broadband - kHz. This provides clear protection from hunting bats and consequently is a very signicant survival advantage.Addressing the mechanisms behind the ultrasound reduction achieved by moth thoraces, the scientists found that the hair-like scales form a connected network of air pockets, which act as porous ultrasound absorbers. Sound waves entering the network cause air molecules in the pockets to vibrate, thereby dissipating energy and reducing echo reflection.The overall arrangement and microstructure of hair-like moth scales closely resembles man-made fibrous materials designed to absorb sound but, interestingly, the Bristol team showed that the moth scales have a considerably higher absorption capacity. So perhaps we could learn lessons from these small hairy creatures.* J. R. Soc.

There are plainly the financial resources to deal with this.It is an inexcusable dereliction of duty on their part and will not be forgiven or forgotten by people whose jobs and livelihoods are being threatened by this ongoing crisis.Donald Cameron MSP, Highlands and Islands RegionSir,I am delighted that the Scottish Government is taking forward my campaign for greater fire safety precautions in social housing.Guidance is now going out to the building industry, ahead of installing fire sprinklers in all new social housing with new regulations coming into effect next year.The sprinklers will be a requirement in new flats, maisonettes and larger multi-occupancy dwellings, including where care is provided.Fire sprinklers have  proved time and time again to be effective in the fight against fire and I know that this move will save lives.There has always been strong backing for these plans from the public, the industry and other MSPs, especially in the light of the Grenfell Tower disaster.I would still like retro-fitting sprinklers in older properties to be considered and, although that is my longer term hope, I understand the problems this would pose.I am delighted this is coming in before I retire as an MSP at next year#s election – what better than a le-saving #present# at Christmas David Stewart MSP, Highlands and Islands RegionSir,Can I please, through the columns of the Argyllshire Advertiser, say a very big thank you to all the wonderful staff and their manager Nan Anderson at the council#s Ardfenaig care home in Ardrishaig.These people have, since the lockdown and well before that, given those in their care love and affection that is second to none.On a daily basis they put themselves in harm#s way, to the benefit of not only the residents but also the relatives of the residents, and may I personally say they do it in a professional and loving way.On behalf of those in your care, especially those who cannot say it for themselves, #Thank you and a very merry Christmas to you all#.Leonard McNeill, MinardSir,I congratulate the Scottish Government on its recent commitment to a bill that will give the role of local government legal status in Scotland.The European Charter of Local Self-Government Bill has been proposed and fought for by Andy Wightman of the Green Party. It aims to incorporate the European Charter of Local Self-Government into Scots law, setting out certain rights for councils and protecting them from centralisation.It’s been strongly supported by local government body COSLA, whose president, Councillor Alison Evison said: #This is a good day for democracy in Scotland. It is a good day for our communities.# It’s also a good day for our hard-pressed local government.Here in Argyll and Bute, I think we recognise the absolute necessity of so many of the services provided by local government for our day-to-day wellbeing.We also recognise the increasingly challenging responsibility involved in the delivery of those services, not least in the face of Covid- and the climate emergency, which both have tested us all this year.Our comings and goings have been adversely affected by both these #events#, as our social relations are constrained by the first, and our movements, our access and connectivity by the unprecedented scale of the A Rest and be Thankful landslides.Andy Wightman’s Bill,enacted, will give people a stronger voice in the conduct of their  affairs, and we will increasingly need that stronger voice to advocate for our present and our future in Argyll and Bute.Mary MacCallum Sullivan, ArdrishaigSir,The much-loved Erskine Tree of Honour was dedicated and lit in fine style last week.Every year the Tree of Honour dedications lead us into the festive season.This year, in spite of the pandemic, we embrace the opportunity to remember those who will be missing from our lives this Christmas.

It can also be spread by contaminated feed and water or by dirty vehicles, clothing and footwear.The avian influenza virus changes frequently, creating new strains, and there is a constant risk that one of the new strains may spread easily among people. But there is no evidence that any recent strain of avian influenza has been able to spread directly between people.Avian influenza is an airborne disease.

It cost the lives of  British servicemen and severe injuries to many more but it made Blair a rich man, resulting from his popularity in America where many of my friends still think the sun shines from his posterior.I would agree, however, that allowing the electorate in Scotland to vote in favour of devolution, was undoubtedly Blair#s second biggest mistake.His motivation was to placate those crying for Scottish independence, following the discovery of North Sea oil, but the irony was that it led to a series of disastrously incompetent Labour Lib Dem coalition governments.These in turn resulted in the electorate choosing, in , a minority SNP government, enabled by support from the Greens.My letter would be far too long were I to dwell on all the areas of incompetence in Holyrood government since , so I#ll confine my evaluation to education, upon which the future of Scotland depends.In , Salmond#s election promise was primary school class sizes of under  but, two years later, Fiona Hyslop changed that target to fewer than  pupils. That was just before Salmond sacked her and Mike Russell admitted smaller class sizes might not be possible before .Those councils that did enforce the limit of  only did so by refusing places to children whose siblings were at the same school.The #attainment gap# between children from poorer backgrounds and those from more affluent areas has continued to widen rather than diminish, as Nicola Sturgeon promised, while older students cannot find places at Scottish universities because these have to be allocated to foreign students, whose fees are a necessity to fund the universities.Meanwhile, I hate to think what Scotland#s deficit is now. It was around eight per cent of GDP before Covid decimated so many areas vital to Scotland#s economy.Doubtless, Alex Orr will remind me Scotland cannot legally have a deficit, but an independent Scotland could and it would prevent the dream of Scotland rejoining the EU from ever being attained.Brian Gee, Carradale East.In the recent storms,  houses at Bruach Gorm, Port Charlotte using the communal West Highland Housing Association satellite dish, lost half our Sky channels, including BBC  and STV.As I write, it’s been  working days since at least three of us that I know reported the issue to West Highland, but not a word of a fix date.The dish has done well for  years, but things degrade over time. I had an inkling this year there would be a dish problem and in the summer I bought a TV aerial kit for £ – a lot cheaper than fitting a dish. I put the aerial in the loft and there is a good reception, with BBC  and STV back. It is storm-proof in the loft, though I was disappointed with the lack of channels from the Bowmore transmitter.I Googled it and the mast is a Freeview Light and lacks channels other UK areas enjoy. I use Sky HD freeview channels but with Sky you have to navigate the TV guide through all the blocked subscription channels to find the one you want to watch. Via the Bowmore mast, the TV guide just lists the freeview channels, which is great.Freeview said that there are more channels available on main transmitters than there is on relay transmitters, which play a vital role in providing more remote areas a TV coverage.There are a lot of aerials on houses and I think Islay’s TV transmitters should get an upgrade to the same channels as other areas expect.I will also raise this issue with those elected to improve our lives, including MSP, MP, council leader Councillor Currie and Councillor Horn.Colin M Campbell, Port Charlotte, Islay.I think we all need a boost of positive news, so I would like to appeal to your readers to give a brave and special young person in your area the credit they deserve by nominating them for the  WellChild Awards.We are looking for inspirational children and young people who have defied the odds in the face of serious illness and the selfless nurses, doctors, brothers, sisters and friends who help care for them.This is your opportunity to give them the recognition they deserve at a prestigious event regularly attended by WellChild Patron, The Duke of Sussex.Nominations are open now so please get yours in before the closing date on Monday December  at noon.

So there will be one window on st December , two windows on December  and so on – and they should stay in place until Twelfth Night.Everyone is invited to walk or drive around the parishes and spot the decorated windows.

Having access to toys and entertainment, when recovering or waiting for treatment, or using play as a distraction for procedures can help to alleviate pain, aid recovery and bring joy back into children’s lives.At the children’s charity Starlight, thanks to our supporters, we provide hospitals with boxes filled with toys, games and puzzles to be used on wards.This year, Starlight’s fundraising income has fallen due to many cancelled events, which is why we have started our Time to Play campaign. Our goal is to raise £, before the end of the year to help , children get access to play in hospital and limit the negative effects of illness on their childhood.It’s easy to support and our website has fun ideas of how to take part, including our Stream for Starlight fundraiser for computer gamers.Or,you are able to, please considering making a simple one-off donation.

Others have shared that they’ve been excluded from online games by other children, while some spoke of online identities being stolen to embarrass or cause trouble while using their name.Before lockdown measures were first introduced this year, the average monthly number of counselling sessions with children about online bullying was . Between April and October that value increased by  per cent to a monthly average of .This is worrying, particularly as we continue to adhere to strict social-distancing restrictions across Scotland and children continue to spend more time online. Bullying can have a long-term impact on the mental wellbeing of a child and, as we mark Anti Bullying Week this month and beyond, it’s important to ensure that every child knows who they can turn to for support.If a parent thinks their child is being bullied online, it can be hard to remain calm, but it’s crucial not to overwhelm a child with questions. Taking their device away is likely to make them feel like whatever has happened is their fault instead, it’s helpful to listen to their worries, suggest they take some time away from certain apps, and provide them with reassurance.Adeniyi Alade, service head of Childline at NSPCC Scotland.Boris Johnson’s comment that devolution has been #a disaster north of the border# and #Tony Blair’s worst mistake# should hardly come as a surprise to anyone.The Tories have never been great supporters of devolution, vehemently opposing both the referendums in  on establishing a Scottish Assembly and in  on the Scottish Parliament.Most recently the devolution power grab that is highlighted in the Internal Market Bill simply reinforces this stance.The Scottish Social Attitudes surveyon constitutional preference found that only seven per cent favour abolition of the Scottish Parliament and it found that trust in the Scottish Government sits at four times that of the UK Government. This points to it hardly being a disaster.For those accused of scaremongering that there is a threat to Holyrood, Mr Johnson’s comments are clear vindication. The irony of all this being that devolution has given new le to the Scottish Conservatives after its wipe out in  and it is now the opposition in the Scottish Parliament.Be under no doubt that the Scottish Parliament, which was hard fought for, is under threat and we must do all in our power to defend it.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.While this year Christmas is going to be dferent from usual for many of us, it is still a time for preparations and extra food.

For every dozen sold, p will be donated to the girls# fund.When staff at Jura Community Store, one of the shops selling the eggs, found out about the appeal, they decided that for every dozen eggs they sell in pink boxes, they will donate an additional p to Children st.Wearing T-shirts bearing the Children st logo and colours, the girls set off from Aqualibrium last Sunday morning, and were joined throughout their journey by Jessica#s big sister Adelle and her friend Jade McCallum, as well as Jessica and Adelle#s parents.Many friends and family members turned out to cheer and clap for the girls and there was even a special, hand-made banner which read: #Well done, girls!#Despite a drizzly shower, the weather was largely pleasant, meaning the girls could enjoy a few pit stops on their journey.They were welcomed at the finish line with balloons, cake, hot chocolate, medals and gts.The girls# parents said: #They smiled, danced and sang the whole way and, as they did, they spoke about the children and families they would be helping and how their Christmas might be now, as a result of the fantastic amount of money raised.#They were absolute stars and did so well. We could all see the pride bursting out of them which was lovely.#As always, friends, family and our community have just been so kind and supportive. Thank you to everyone who cheered them off, supported them along the way and welcomed them in at the end, it made the event so special for the girls.#And thanks again to everyone who has sponsored, we know the money will make such a dference.#There is still time to sponsor the girls as their online fundraising page # search #Friends walk for Christmas# on the JustGiving website # is being left open until the end of the month so the Deliciously Scottish Eggs donation can be added to the total."},{"url":null,"title":"law book not just for legal eagles","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

What started as a personal challenge for David Brown has motivated not only himself but many others to raise money for charity as they keep fit.Many members of the charities for which David has raised money in  have supported him by completing their own runs and walks, the latest being Tom Donnachy, who features on our back page.The fundraising efforts of the three young girls who completed a K walk last weekend also inspired two businesses # Deliciously Scottish Eggs and Jura Community Stores # to donate money to Children st.Finally, it is heartening to hear of the community coming together to help dog Rogan who suffers from cancer.No matter what le throws at us, we can be sure our community will support us."},{"url":null,"title":"letters december 4 2020","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

This is especially dangerous when lorries are on the road as they take much longer to stop or slow down.This has frustrated me for some time but enough is enough.

There are only two criteria: the narrative of the short story must take place on the island and the story should have a link to one of the many myths and legends about Jura.The finished product will be published on the Isle of Jura#s website.TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGOShip launch boost for CampbeltownAn estimated £, was pumped into the Kintyre economy last weekend with the naming of a new class of Stern trawler at Campbeltown shipyard.Around  guests travelled to Campbeltown for the naming of the latest addition to the fleet of Peterhead-based George Moodie and Sons Trawlers Ltd, Shemarah II.They came in coaches and occupied a large number of hotel rooms in and around Campbeltown.The . metre trawler was named by Mrs Jenner Moodie. It was the th addition to the family#s fleet she has named.Piper Derek Wilson of Kintyre District Pipe Band played a selection of tunes before the naming took place.Mr Douglas Moodie said at the naming: ‘She is lovely. We had a number of quotes from overseas to build her but we wanted to keep the work in Scotland.’Other guests at the naming included Sir William Lithgow and his we Lady Lithgow, Argyll and Bute MP Mrs Ray Michie, Argyll and Bute District Council chairman George McMillan and district Councillor Archie McCallum.FIFTY YEARS AGOUnique legal historyMaking his first appearance as a solicitor at Campbeltown Sherf Court on Friday was Mr Patrick Stewart, son of procurator fiscal, Mr A I B Stewart.Mr Stewart is the third generation to act as a solicitor in Campbeltown. His grandfather was Mr Archibald Stewart.Appearing with him was Mr John Mactaggart, son of Mr Charles Mactaggart. Mr Mactaggart is the fth generation in direct descent to work as a solicitor.There are older legal firms in Scotland than C and D Mactaggart, but none with a record of five generations in direct descent.Campbeltown is probably the only town in Scotland with such legal history. The stability of the legal profession in Scotland owes much to such family tradition.ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOCampbeltownIn the gale of third December, a boat of the Campbeltown fishing fleet belonging to Mr James Wareham was totally lost at Lochranza.The crew had just discharged the cargo at the pier when the gale burst upon them. The sea was so heavy that the crew had to jump ashore for their lives and look helplessly at the boat being smashed to matchwood.The only salvage is the motor engine. Given the present state of the fishing industry and the high cost of boats, the loss will be seriously felt.Gigha A meeting of the education authority for the County of Argyll was held in Glasgow on Thursday November th. Major AJM Bennett, Dunoon, chairman presided.The committee agreed with the Kintyre District Education Committee that it is not desirable, in view of the present cost of building, to erect a cookery room at Gigha public school as recommended by the local school management committee.JuraThe sad news of the death of Neil Cameron, youngest son of Mr and Mrs Cameron, Skervuile Lighthouse, Jura, has caused the greatest sorrow among his many friends on the island and at Oban where he was employed for two years on the Northern Lighthouse steamer Hesperus and held in high esteem by the captain and crew.Anxious to advance in his calling, he joined the SS Strathlore of the Strath Line in July last and made a voyage to the West Indies where he accidentally met his death.The deceased was a young man of excellent character and genial disposition and his abilities would doubtless have brought him to a high place in his profession had he been spared.Many expressions of sympathy have been received by his sorrowing father, mother, sister and brother in the great and sudden sorrow.CAPTION:A  advertisement encourages Courier readers to get their pocket lamps #put in order# at MacGeachy#s in Union Street.

When you then think of other celebrities earning mouth-watering sums from the BBC, this gives clear evidence that the BBC could quite easily continue with the free television licences for the over-s.My income does not qualy for pension credit by a small margin but I have now had two communications from TV Licensing reminding me to pay the fee.Each time it encloses a brochure and ious forms to complete in the hope that I feel empowered to pay the £. required to watch TV.So far, I have decided to weather the storm and not pay. My hope is that thousands of over-s do likewise and Auntie will realise that expecting us to fall into line is not as simple as it expects.Silver Voices continue to pressure the BBC to think again and reinstate free licences for the over-s.It has my full support and will continue to do so until the BBC bites the bullet and cancels its continued harassment of OAPs.Keith Abendroth, Campbeltown.For many of us, the festive season is a time for giving and sharing, which is why we’re inviting you to celebrate Giving Tuesday.I’d like to take a moment to share with your readers how, in choosing to give to our charity, Revitalise, you’ll be making a real dference to the lives of the disabled people and carers that we support.As a charity we know that however tricky this past year has been, le is about spending time with the people we love, and everyday le can so easily get in the way of that. Hilary has cared for her son Shaun since he had an accident on holiday in Ibiza, aged .Caring is simply something she does for the person she loves. As she explains: #For the last  years I’ve been caring for Shaun but I definitely wouldn’t call myself a carer, it’s just something I do as his mum.#I’m never, ever, going to give up on my son. Le is too short you know you need to keep fighting.#On top of the dficulties this year has presented, disabled people and the elderly have also been left with far less support than usual, as the Emergency Coronavirus Act allowed local authorities to axe their duty of care responsibilities. Feeling vulnerable and abandoned, many carers are close to breaking point.#This is why we have launched our campaign, Care For Carers and the fundraiser Raise a Million, aiming to raise £ million to support carers and their loved ones to access respite care breaks following lockdown.We have provided respite care breaks # a vital leline to so many unpaid home carers and their disabled loved ones # for over  years.So, in celebration of Giving Tuesday this month, why not pledge to give something special to our charity this festive season I am so proud to work for Revitalise as we amply the voice of carers, and will continue to do so until carers stories are heard. Please support our campaignyou can, and help us spread the word about the struggles carers are facing right now.To find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or the ways that we may be able to support guests, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Devon Prosser, Revitalise"},{"url":null,"title":"paving the way for a future in sport","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The moon lit up the landscape and the whole earth breathed peace.The only sound was the quiet lapping as the ocean rolled its waves once again to the shore. The darkness was penetrated by billions of pinpricks of light, reminding me that light has the last word.We are waiting for the lighter nights. We are waiting for the ening days. We are waiting for the light. We are waiting for the light, and for the le light.We wait quietly in a cosmic silence. Waiting can bring peace as we find God’s presence in the present. Waiting can bring hope as we know the light will come.But it’s hard to stop and wait it’s not easy to pause and ponder it’s dficult to take time at this time. We’re busy with the bargains and not so bothered about the baby.We’re busy with the tinsel but haven’t time for the truth. We’re busy with the mince pies and we will get round to the manger.We’re busy trying to fix the tree lights but have forgotten about theWe’re busy with the cards but have pushed away the crib.

Instead, we often do a night tour of the streets looking at the Christmas lights so many people have made the effort to display.Weekends have become our time to explore the woods and on Saturday the weather allowed us to venture out, after a few days of rain. We knew it would be muddy, and the trees bare of leaves, but we were on the hunt for holly and ivy to make our Christmas wreath and decorate the house.Itrsquos only when you venture into a wood in winter time that you fully appreciate the display of green that holly and ivy provides. They are naturersquos Christmas lights of colour, a gt of green in a sleeping wood that has lost most of its colour.I have written before about the mental health benefits of ldquoforest bathing, and for me regular visits to nature and walking amongst trees have always been a vital part of my mental wellbeing. And so as we ventured forth to a wood in East Lothian after days of being cooped up inside, I could feel my spirit lt.We arrived as the sun was already lowering in the winter sky. We had just two hours for our adventure and so we headed down into the wood.The sound of the Sauchet Water, which runs through the wood, reached us before we could see it. The rain of previous days had turned it into a tumbling river. I had hoped for this, as the sound of running water in naturersquos setting is so therapeutic. The kids stood by the bank, watching and listening to the river as it flowed past them, mesmerised by the sight and sound of it. I watched them as they stood together, saying nothing, but sharing the moment.After a few minutes, they came out of their trance and headed deeper into the wood to seek adventure. Our task was to find nice branches of holly and some ivy, but also to seek out the stories of the wood.And they found a story. A tree was in danger of falling because the river had eroded the bank. One side of its root system was exposed, with nothing to hold on to, so the tree was leaning towards the water, in danger of falling. But a neighbouring tree looked asit had come to the rescue. Its trunk was bending towards the tree in danger, giving it something to lean on.The kids called them the lsquoslipping treersquo and the lsquohelping treersquo. And when we looked at the roots of the two trees, we could see that they were, as my son described it, ldquoholding hands. I could see what he meant, for the roots of the lsquoslipping treersquo looked asthey were indeed holding onto the roots of the lsquohelping treersquo.Perhaps this was all their creative imagination, although there is clear scientic evidence that trees in a wood need each other and help each other in many dferent ways, especially via their underground root system. Andyou really look at trees, you will see the stories of their challenges, and of their resilience and survival in the face of them.The kids moved on in their adventure, but I paused for a moment at these two trees. There was a story here that spoke to me so directly in this most challenging of times: that we need to hold hands like this sometimes, by seeking and accepting the help of otherswe feel ourselves slipping. But also, we need to be able to recognise when someone  is quietly slipping and help them hold on.ldquoCome on, dad, we have found a perfect holly bush, the kids called out. My we Kate and I scrambled up the muddy slope to see, and sure enough they had.There is understandably a wealth of folklore and tradition about holly. Itrsquos said to be bad luck to cut the tree down but taking a small branch is OK, as long as you thank the tree.By this time, darkness was falling and the wood was feeling eerie, but in a good way. Part of exploring nature should be the enchantment of it, the mysteries it holds, and it being a bit scary at times is part of this.The bare branches of the trees silhouetted against a darkening sky was the perfect theatre to end our adventure, as the kids kept an eye out for faeries and malevolent magical creatures, which they knew would be kept at bay as long as they held onto their holly branches.We emerged from the wood into the dying light of the winterrsquos day, decorated with holly and ivy like figures from mythology ourselves.Such was our adventure last weekend. I felt so much better after the walk. Yes, it was the physical exercise and fresh air, but it was also the spiritual uplt a visit to the woods always gives, even in winter.And part of this,we choose to notice and listen, will be naturersquos stories, which can speak directly to us."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-peeps-past-december-8-11-1995-1970-1920","story":"A FAMOUS landmark atop North Berwick Law was in need of repair, reported the East Lothian Courier of December , .The whalersquos jawbone at the summit of North Berwick Law is to be repaired at a cost of about pound.The condition of the well-known local landmark has deteriorated over the decades and the townrsquos community councillors are keen to ensure it is saved for posterity.They approached the district council with their concerns and Macmerry-based specialists Ralph Plastics was contracted to do the job.They will restore the jawbone with fibre glass, and the protective railings around it will be repaired by Daw Engineering of Fenton Barns.Scaffolding will have to be used to carry out the work and the equipment will be taken up the hill by a tractor vehicle ndash a far cry from the mode of transport used to get the jawbone to the top in the s.lsquoWANTED,  beds for touring cyclistsrsquo was a headline in The Haddingtonshire Courier on December , .The Scottish Milk Race will again be passing through Dunbar on July , .The race took Dunbar into its tour of the country two years ago and caused great excitement.The only problem is where to put all the cyclists, race officials and representatives of the Milk Marketing Board when they arrive ndash  beds are needed.Co-operation is being asked for from local people and those living within a -mile radius of the town.MEANWHILE, power cuts hit the county.Scenes reminiscent of the wartime blackout were re-created in East Lothian this week when ious parts of the County were suddenly plunged into darkness by power cuts.Ironmongers, grocers and little general dealers shops found themselves almost besieged by customers clamouring for candles, paraffin and flashlight batteries.Those in the Tranent area were the first to feel the effects.A NEW bus service was introduced in Tranent, the first of its kind.

You must house your birds to protect them from #AvianInfluenza. Birds like #Ducks  #Geese that cannot be easily housed must be kept in netted enclosed areas. See Scotlandrsquos declaration https:t.co XysTYvGyQ @RuralMattersSG pic cePuUsgZHow to spot bird flu Avian influenza viruses can be classied according to their ability to cause severe disease as either highly pathogenic or low pathogenic.Low pathogenic bird flu is often dficult to detect, with very few clinical signs.According to the Scottish Government, an infected flock might show signs of respiratory distress, diarrhoea, or a drop in egg production.Highly pathogenic avian influenza will often form symptoms more suddenly, with affected birds developing swollen heads, a blue colouration of the comb and wattles, respiratory distress, diarrhoea, and a signicant drop in egg production.The Scottish Government guidance saysyou are suspicious your flock has any form of avian influenza you must contact your local animal health office immediately.What to doyou find a dead or sick wild birdAccording to Scottish Government guidance, wild birds can carry several diseases that are infectious to people, so do not touch or pick up any dead or visibly sick birds that you find.If you find a single dead bird of prey, gull or wildfowl species , or find five or more birds of any other species in the same location and at the same time, you should report these incidents to Defrarsquos national telephone helpline .How is bird flu spread The disease spreads from bird to bird by direct contact or through contaminated body fluids and faeces. It can also be spread by contaminated feed and water or by dirty vehicles, clothing and footwear.The avian influenza virus changes frequently, creating new strains, and there is a constant risk that one of the new strains may spread easily among people. But there is no evidence that any recent strain of avian influenza has been able to spread directly between people.Avian influenza is an airborne disease. It can also be spread by wild birds and rodents whose movements change in response to flooding.How can I find out more Full details are available on the Scottish Government website here."},{"url":null,"title":"families-eligible-free-school-meals-get-extra-payments-totalling-100","story":"The council said that two additional payments would be made in the coming weeks, totalling pound per child.A payment of pound per pupil will be made to cover the Christmas holiday period when schools are closed, representing the cost of free school meals during this -day period.The payment will be automatically credited to parentsrsquo bank accounts from December , the council said.A second winter support payment of pound per pupil will be made next week.Households already registered for free school meals will have the money automatically credited to the bank account details that the council currently holds on file ndash no further action or application is required.Councillor Shamin Akhtar, cabinet member for education and childrenrsquos services, said: ldquoThis will be welcome news for many families who have faced financial challenges over the course of this year.\"These payments mean that families who most need support with food will not miss out over the Christmas period when our schools are closed for the break.\"The winter support payment will be useful for warm clothing and other necessities to help them through the season.ldquoIrsquod urge anyone who is eligible for free school meals but has not yet registered to do so now.Free school meals are offered for children and young people from P to S.

It makes an interesting contrast to Jann Wennerrsquos book- interview, Lennon Remembers, made a decade earlier. The Lennon Sheff meets is less bitter and more at ease with himself, though never far from a contentious outburst. The points when he talks about the future, looking forward to all the years he could have ahead of him, are especially poignant.MEDALS AND PRIZESJohn Metcalf Born in Carlisle and emigrating to Canada as a young man, John Metcalf has enjoyed a distinguished career as an author, teacher and editor for five decades. But until now hersquos never been published in the land of his birth. This collection pulls together eight stories which highlight his skill and versatility. His talent for finding exactly the right detail to deflate a characterrsquos self-importance, or undercut an emotional moment, is apparent from the opening to the first story, Single Gents Only. Metcalfrsquos somewhat chilly view of humanity is explored more thoroughly in pieces like the bleakly comical computer-dating story, Girl in Gingham. The novella- Medals and Prizes, following the erging paths of two boys who want to grow up to be cultivated and ldquomildly louche, shows him developing character through some quite y scenes. Metcalfrsquos meticulousness, combined with an unsentimental eye and shot through with acerbic satire, brings forth some masterful stories.DESPISEDPaul Embery The Toriesrsquo establishment of a ldquoblue wall in former Labour strongholds in the General Election was just the most recent sign of the widening chasm between the Labour Party and its traditional constituency. In this fiercely-argued polemic, a Brexit-supporting firefighter and trade unionist from Dagenham examines how this schism opened up and how it might be bridged. He sees a Labour Party run by ldquoan arrogant liberal and cultural elite promoting ldquocosmopolitan liberalism while holding their working-class constituentsrsquo concerns in contempt. To reconnect with its base and start winning elections, Embery argues, the party has to become more economically radical and more culturally conservative. Therersquos a lot here that Labour should take on board but with it comes the recognition that Embery is playing on exactly the same ldquofears of cultural erosion and longings for ato traditional values that a wave of right-wing authoritarians across the world have exploited with great success.ALASTAIR MABBOTT"},{"url":null,"title":"scots-olympian-sir-chris-hoy-says-cyclists-drivers-less-tribal","story":"The Edinburgh-born Olympic champion track cyclist said the UK had taken great strides in making its cities more accessible for bikes but said there was some way to go before cyclingwas \"normalised\" in the same way as in other European countries.In placeslike Holland, he said cycling was \"just a way to get around\" with provision so well established and safe that many dont wear helmets, while here it is still associated with lycra and expensive kit.He said the biggest hurdle in getting more people on two wheels was a belief that the roads are still not a safe place for cyclists.: Cycling soars by % in Scotlands most polluted city as infrastructure plan gathers paceTemporary lanes created by local authorities to accommodate extra cyclists and social distancing during lockdown have now been made permanent in some Scottish cities while Glasgow is currently overseeing the biggest cycling infrastructure project in the UK.\"For so long itsbeen the answer to all our problems and its staring us in the face,\" said Sir Chris.\"The positive spin-offs from cycling....reduced congestion, reduced pollution, the general health of the nation, work-forces arriving at the start of the day alert and ready to go...the politicians are starting to understand that.\"My dream is, that in  years time we can look back and see the same thing that happened in Holland or Denmark or Germany where you arent a cyclist, you are just someone getting around.\"People need to be less tribal about it.

One of the major issues has been the disruption to normal teaching and learning brought on by Covid affecting all involved in our schools: pupils, teachers and support staff. Repeatedly I have read of the need to recruit additional teachers to assist in these unique times.One area which, as far as I know, has not been sourced is staring the Government in the face. Our Inspectorate is currently not inspecting schools. This looks likely to be the continuing scenario well into  and possibly beyond the summer recess. Seven more months, at least, of these highly qualied and well respected teachers not performing the tasks they normally carry out.What an opportunity to bring their expertise directly into the classrooms. They would bring great skills, breadth of experience and the love of young people which they clearly will have demonstrated to attain their present positions. To have such highly qualied and skilled practitioners at the disposal of our young people but not to utilise them borders on negligence.Taking the possibility one step further, what an opening to place such expertise and experience into the most disadvantaged areas. Closing the attainment gap is an aim constantly sought. Utilising the Inspectorate with such a focus must present a heaven-sent chance in these hellish times.Having worked closely with Inspectorate colleagues in more than  years of senior leadership in secondary schools, I can attest to the quality these colleagues have to offer our young people.Rod OrsquoDonnell, Milngavie.IN TUNE WITH THE TIMESREGARDING Christmas songs : we will not be Driving Home for Christmas because Therersquos Something in the Air.Thank you.

Anti-semitism clearly was an issue, though a relatively marginal one. Labours equalities spokeswoman, Dawn Butlers view that ldquobabies arent born with a sex didnt help. Nor was it Labours ambitious socialist policies that lost it support in the red wall seats of Sedgefield, Bolsover, Workington it was its approach to the national question, the English one.What did for Labour, says Blue Labour trades unionist Paul Embery in his book Despised: Why the Left Loathes the Working Class, was its refusal to accept the result of the  Brexit vote. This he says was ldquoa genuine democratic revolt by the English working class. Labour became identied with the ldquometropolitan liberal view of Brexit voters as ldquonarrow nationalists, ldquonativists and even ldquobigots. Emily Thornberrys Tweeted image of ldquowhite van man with his house draped in Cross of St George flags.ldquoThe left, says Embery, a socialist who grew up in Dagenham, ldquohave been so blinded by their prejudice against even the mildest forms of nationalism that they have been hobbled in their attacks on neoliberalism. Most of Labours socialist policies, like nationalisation, taxation, borrowing, public spending, green investment, were rather popular. So popular indeed that the Tories seem to be implementing a lot of them.Now of course it wasnt only working class people who voted for Brexit ndash most of the southern Tory middle classes did too. Here, a lot of working class voters support the SNP which is militantly anti-Brexit. Labours dilemma is that it has become unpopular in Scotland and England for apparently contradictory reasons. But there is a unying thread here and it is the partys attitude to the nation, to patriotism and identity.Scottish Labour, which has been in an even worse state this year than its UK counterpart, also lost because of its aversion to nationalism, albeit its Scottish version. Working class voters who had been alienated from the democratic process for years turned out in large numbers in  to vote Yes in the independence referendum. Given the chance to vote for change ndash to vote for their own country, their own people ndash they grasped it with both hands.Labour had for years tried to portray the Scottish National Party as ldquonarrow nationalists, ldquonativists and even ldquobigots. Labour politicians like Alistair Darling, leader of the unionist Better Together campaign, regarded nationalism as a right-wing ldquoblood and soil creed akin to racism.Unfortunately, for Labour, many working class voters didnt. Scots dont share the lefts instinctive aversion to patriotism and symbols of national pride. For them, the nation is their community, their people, their solidarity. It is also a bulwark against the anonymous forces of international capitalism threatening their jobs and way of le.After the  referendum, support for the SNP didnt falter ndash it exploded, as support for independence became a kind of national craze. In the tsunami election of , Labour were destroyed as the SNP took all but three Scottish seats. Suddenly, even left-wing people in Scotland were talking the language of nationalism, of putting Scotland first. Cutting adrt from the UK union even as they were arguing to remain in the European Union.Scottish nationalists hate to hear comparisons between Brexit and independence. Nicola Sturgeon believes that Brexiteers like Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage are right-wing, populist rabble-rousers. She has wrestled with her own aversion to nationalism, even as the leader of a nationalist party. In , she told the Edinburgh Book Festival that she would prefer not to have ldquonational in the partys name. In recent years she has shunned the mostly working class-supported independence marches while attending demonstrations in favour of causes like LGBT and Remain.But it was Alex Salmonds genius back in the s to splice together Scottish nationalism with left-wing internationalism. He reversed the SNPs opposition to the European Union, expunged anglophobia and made it firmly a party of the left, supporting multiculturalism and opposing Trident and foreign wars. This allowed Scots to celebrate their national identity because that very identity now encompassed non-nativist values, like support for greater immigration.SNP leaders fool themselvesthey think Scottish voters are supporting them because of transgender reform or love of the European Union. Nicola Sturgeons success is built on the very nationalism she says is ldquohugely problematic. It is why % of Scots approve her handling of the Covid pandemic, despite Scotlands record being little better than Englands. Scottish people are saying increasingly that they trust their ldquoown government in Edinburgh to look after them.There is no sign of Labour freeing itself from this nationalist double bind. Internal surveys suggest that the removal of Jeremy Corbyn is not winning back many supporters in the north of England. This may be because Sir Keir Starmer, an Islington lawyer, is a fully paid up member of the metropolitan liberal Remain faction, and a leading anti-BrexiteerMeanwhile in Scotland the failing leadership of Richard Leonard suffered another blow this week with the departure of the general secretary, Michael Sharpe, to spend more time with his family. Mr Sharpe had been a key figure in heading off a leadership challenge to Mr Leonard earlier this year. It bodes ill for Labours chances in the May Scottish parliament elections.The apparent decision to roll out the former Labour leader Gordon Brown, to offer his latest reconfiguration of federalism, is another measure of the problem. Brown is a formidable politician, but he is of another age ndash the age of Labour unionism. The very word nationalism sticks in his craw. The SNP has cornered the market on national identity and Scottishness, leaving Labour the party of nowhere.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

It was clear that canine guests were the priority andwe had a problem, we should take a hike.Those of us who do not have dogs are starting to feel out of step. Pet-friendly, and especially dog-friendly hotels, self-catering accommodation and BBs are booming. If you complain about being caught in the cross-hairs, you are viewed as a kill joy or obsessive compulsive, the kind of weirdo who does not melt at the sight of an Andrex puppy.Lockdown saw a surge in pups, bought to keep people company, and give them something to do in the long, empty hours. If I lived alone, perhaps I would have done the same. Nothing fills the day like a dog. In fact, thatrsquos the reason I donrsquot have one. If a stray spaniel appeared on the doorstep I might relent. But, barring an emotional ambush, making the clear-sighted decision to add an animal to the household is no small matter. Not just the effort but the responsibility of looking after it is a lot to contemplate: constant hoovering , training, exercising, poop-scooping, deworming, tick-picking, bathing and towelling, brushing, feeding. Not to mention vetrsquos bills...Yet it seems not only are there countless animal lovers whose day revolves around their pets, but the place of dogs in society is set to be given an even higher profile. Lucca, one of the loveliest medieval towns in Italy, is the first city in the world to become officially pet-friendly. Its council, in tandem with the veterinary science department at Pisa University and Lucca Crea, which runs the wonderful annual comics festival, is devising a five-year trial in which smart technology will be integrated into town planning measures to enhance the experience of animals and their owners.Their vision is for a ldquohuman-animal smart city, in which pets are part of the picture, not an afterthought or nuisance. ldquoThe idea is to transform Lucca into the first European city with an integrated policy on human-animal cohabitation, says Francesco Di Iacovo, professor of agricultural economics at the university. Others ndash not me! ndash he hopes, will follow their lead.The Lucca project is not focussed entirely on dogs and their owners, but includes ways in which other citizens, such as the elderly in care homes, or children in schools, could benefit from canine companionship. Another question to be solved, they say, is how animals can better use the transport system. Now, I have heard of a Morningside cat that regularly boarded a bus and travelled two stops before alighting and crossing the road when the lights turned red. But could a dog be trusted to do this Having often visited Lucca, I can attest that it is dog-crazy. I have photos of a dog-marathon, where animals dragged owners over the finishing line. The town is encircled by a high, wide wall, around which cyclists, joggers, dog-walkers, amblers and wheelchair users make their way all day long, beneath plane trees and horse-chestnuts. It is an Italian version of a Sempeacute cartoon in the Jardin de Luxembourg, a definition of civilised city le. Less charming are encounters in the narrow back streets which, dimly lit at night, are like excremental mine fields. But that is a universal problem, no worse in Lucca than Paris, Naples or London. Donrsquot blame the dogs.There are about  million of them in Italy, while in the UK they number around . million. Thatrsquos a lot of Pedigree Chum. I recently read a vet recommending owners spend as much as they can afford on their petrsquos nutrition because, just as with human health, the quality of what they consume matters.For those with access to the countryside or a beach where they can run free, having a dog makes sense. Less so in a built-up environment, even one as attractive as Lucca. Looking at it from the animalrsquos perspective, what sort of le is it constantly to pad about on concrete and stone, to be forever tied at the end of a leash tugged at their masterrsquos whim  Scents and smells are a dogrsquos fragrance counter or thermidor but, unless they trespass on a garden or are let loose in a park, there is nothing in a city that can compare with undergrowth, woods and scrubland, teeming with multarious creatures designed to sharpen their appetites and wits.There is no doubt we are losing the plot, letting the relationship between human and dog get out of hand. Nowhere is this imbalance better illustrated than in an Edinburgh park I know well. Waiting for the bus some weeks ago, I killed time by its gates. It was exercise hour, and hounds abounded, some genetically designed to pull sleighs, others to terry intruders. This particular park is a well-kept precinct of mature trees, grass and shrubbery in the midst of upmarket villas. In its centre is a railed-off section, roughly a postage stamp to the parkrsquos envelope. This is not reserved as a spot for dogs to do their business, as you might expect, but as a cage for children. While toddlers are kept safely away from the roving creatures beyond the rails, squeezed into a confined space, the dogs have the park to themselves.

It did not take any sort of genius to work out that the  World Cup was going to see Scotland in a pool in which they would have their work cut out to make it to the group stage.I warned before last yearrsquos World Cup that failure to make it to the quarter-finals would put Scotland in dire dficulties in the  version of the tournament in France, simply because I was aware of one single fact ndash that the seedings for  would be based on the world rankings on January , .Scotlandrsquos failure to beat Ireland and Japan meant we ended  ranked number nine in the world, and that decided we would be seeded in Band  for the draw that took place earlier this week and which has seen us in a real Group of Death with Ireland and the world champions South Africa with two more qualiers to join us. Given that those qualiers should be Samoa or Tonga and Romania or Georgia, I am happy to say now what Scotlandrsquos aim should be ndash at least beat the minnows and qualy for the  version as one of the top three in Pool B. Forget beating Ireland and South Africa, itrsquos just not going to happen.And yet, and yet hellip how many people reading this would have predicted last year that several nations would not even play this year  How many of you would have guessed that Wales would go into reverse  Who really would have predicted that Argentina would beat New Zealand  Above all, who could have even dreamed ndash that should be ldquonightmared ndash of the coronavirus pandemic The unfairness of the World Cup draw is manest. Almost three years before the tournament takes place the draw has been decided, based on standings that were already way out of date.Take Wales, for example. On January  they stood at number four in the rankings, but their disastrous run of form means they are now ninth. Yet there they were in the draw in Band . Scotland have risen to seventh in the rankings and have overtaken Japan who were still in Band .Largely as the result of that historic win over the All Blacks, Argentina are now one behind us in eighth having overtaken Wales. England may have beaten France to win the Autumn Nations Cup, but that was the French nd XV practically, and does anyone doubt that Les Bleus are the current form team in the world  They are now ranked four but were ranked seven in January, and so we face the prospect of the All Blacks taking on France in Pool A when France, to my viewing, will show long before the time the tournament starts that they deserved Band  status instead of Wales.It is all so unfair and terribly premature and I am glad that World Rugby has agreed to review the timing of the draw for future World Cups. Might I suggest cutting the ldquonotice period to one year , of course, we are back to any sort of normality.So, can Scotland make it to the quarter finals in France in   My immediate reaction is no chance but look how much has changed since last yearrsquos World Cup. Yes, Ireland and South Africa will be strong favourites to beat Scotland on current form, and nobody could argue with that unless they have a Trumpian approach to reality.Gregor Townsend is in charge to the end of the World Cup at least and thatrsquos a good move by the SRU as it least assures us of a consistent approach to developing the squad. If they both have a bad day, South Africa and Ireland can be beaten, but Scotland must play way beyond what they are achieving just now. There are some signs of development though not enough at the moment ndash but the one advantage of the premature draw is that Townsend and co will have plenty time to conceive of a winning approach."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-scotland-christmas-imperial-college-map-reveals-covid-hotspots","story":"Devised by Imperial College London, the website predicts which parts of the country have the greatest probability of seeing cases rise above  per ,, which it classes as a hotspot.Clackmannanshire was deemed to be the most likely in the country to become a hotspot between December  and Boxing Day, sitting at %, according to the tool.North Ayrshire and Fe both have a high chance of becoming a hotspot over that period, at %.The Imperial College London coronavirus hotspot mapEast Lothian, which the First Minister confirmed will be moving into Level  from December , is deemed to be % likely to have more than  cases per ,.And Glasgow, which recently moved out of Level  into Level , has a % chance.Meanwhile heading further west, Inverclyde is ranked at %,West Dunbartonshire at % andArgyll and Bute at %.Some areas, including Orkney, Moray, Shetland Islands and Dumfries and Galloway are all deemed to have a % risk of becoming a hotspot over the festive period.The website uses data on daily reported cases and weekly reported deaths and mathematics modelling to report a probability that a local authority will become a hotspot in the following week.The predictions do assume no change in current interventionsin a local authority beyond those already taken about a week before the end of observations.From pm, Friday  December, new #coronavirus protection levels will apply to some local authority areas across Scotland.Make sure you know which level applies to your local area # https:t.co TIeCyNohIThread: Changes to coronavirus levels # pic qPklCXSfKIt comes as Nicola Sturgeon and other UK leaders held four-nations discussions over the relaxation of rules over the Christmas period, following the discovery of a new coronavirus iant in the UK.There are at least nine cases of the new strain detected in Scotland, all in NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde.Under the current plans, eight people from three households will be able to mix indoors between December  and December .However a new position over the rules was not yet agreed, with further discussions due on Wednesday before a potential announcement on Thursday.A Scottish Government spokeswoman said: ldquoThe four nations call was a good opportunity to review the position on Christmas and discuss whether the messaging or guidance requires to be reinforced.Here arethe chances of a hotspot in your area, according to the study:"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-scotland-talks-devolved-nations-christmas-continue","story":"A UK Government source has acknowledged the four UK nations may take dfering approaches, but insisted there would be no change in the law in England.The UK Government is to press ahead with the easing of coronavirus restrictions over Christmas even though it will lead to an increase in the infection rate.Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick said that it would be up to people to make a ldquopersonal judgment whether they wanted to meet up with vulnerable family members over the holiday period.He suggested that some people may decide to ldquokeep it small and put off larger gatherings until the spring, saying: ldquoEaster can be the new Christmas.It comes after two leading medical journals warned an easing of restrictions would ldquocost many lives, while the British Medical Associationechoed Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer in demanding an urgent rethink.:Christmas rules could be tightened as talks heldMr Jenrick said that people would need to think carefullythey wanted to risk large family gatherings, pointing to the example of the United States where there had been a rise in cases following the Thanksgiving holiday.ldquoWe all need to use our own personal judgment thinking about our own families whether we have particularly elderly or clinically vulnerable relatives who might be round the Christmas table and also looking at the fact that the rates of the virus are rising in many parts of the country, he told Sky News.ldquoOur position is clear that the legal framework will continue but because the infection is rising in many parts of the country, because we can see these international examples like Thanksgiving, it is incumbent on each every family across the country this morning and in the days ahead to have that conversation round the breakfast table, lsquoIs this right for our family rsquoldquoThis is a virus that thrives on social interaction so bringing more people together, even over this short period of time, is not cost-free.

Ofgem agreed to look into the concerns raised, and reiterated that all customers must be treated equally and have a right to switch regardless of their meter. The parliamentarians have welcomed Ofgem willingness to investigate matters but have warned this must not be “a token gesture”.Ms Wishart said: “This was a constructive meeting. Ofgem seemed to finally recognise that poor practices in the energy market are not isolated incidents. Instead there are wholesale issues with price increases and customer service affecting too many customers. Ofgem agreed to investigate matters further and I look forward to further discussion with them in the New Year. The regulator has reiterated that everyone has a right to switch, even with a restricted meter – and that energy suppliers who suggest otherwise are wrong.“Agreeing to this action cannot be a token gesture. We need to see a serious probe into unfair practices affecting people in the Shetland.”Mr Carmichael said: “Today’s meeting was a step in the right direction and I look forward to hearing on future progress from Ofgem in the coming weeks and months. Islanders deserve fair treatment and confidence that the regulator is keeping a close eye on suppliers. This may not be the end of poor behaviour by energy companies but I am hopeful that we will see a more hands-on approach from Ofgem as we move forward.”An Ofgem spokesperson said: “Ofgem’s rules require energy suppliers to treat all customers fairly.  “Customers with restricted meters should be able to shop around for suitable single-rate tarfs without having to change their existing metering arrangements.“Suppliers must offer their single rate tarfs to customers with restricted meters who meet the necessary requirements of those tarfs.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

He therefore called for similar support to be made available to protect the future of Orkney’s leline ferry services.In response, Mr Wheelhouse said that through discussions between Transport Scotland and local authority ferry operators it was decided that funding pressures as a result of COVID- should be addressed through engagement with COSLA. This was part of a wider ask from local authorities on COVID-related support, which he understood was still ongoing.Afterwards, Mr McArthur said: “The board of Orkney Ferries made crystal clear in a letter to the Scottish Government in August that there is a grave risk to the future of these leline services due to the level of losses sustained this year.  However, despite the severity of the situation, the appeal has so far fallen on deaf ears.“While emergency support has rightly been provided for other transport services, Orkney’s ferry services continue to face considerable uncertainty and instability.  That is no way to treat a service that is a leline to our island communities.“Losses at this scale are entirely unsustainable and urgent action is needed. However it is provided, Ministers must ensure that Orkney Ferries gets access to the same emergency support as other transport operators.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

On Tuesday, as part of an “urgent item” added at the very last minute to the agenda of an OIC general meeting, councillors agreed to top this up with an additional payment of £ for each child.This payment is per child, not per household, and for those families on a low income — anyone whose P- children receive a free school meal due to the universal provision will not be eligible. Therefore, for a family with three eligible children, the payment would be £.This comes after the council was offered a discretionary grant of £,, ring-fenced for tackling food poverty in the county.Proposals to immediately award a portion of this money to some of Orkney’s lowest-income families gained unanimous support from councillors.OIC Leader Councillor James Stockan said: “These are extraordinary times we are living through and our most vulnerable families in Orkney are likely to be worst hit. That is why we as a Council have universally decided to make a supplementary payment of £ on top of the Government grant.“This additional £, will come from a discretionary grant we hold from the Scottish Government. Our officials are to be commended for their swt response in ensuring this additional money will be with our most vulnerable families ahead of Christmas.Councillor Stockan also appealed for families who may be eligible for free school meals in Orkney to come forward to check to seethey qualy.“We are fearful there are families out there who are missing out on free school meals, and now these additional payments, due to a misconception of there being a stigma attached. Please be reassured the system we have in place has already been commended by other parents and carers who have applied as being subtle and ensure complete privacy.“I would urge people to please check to seeyou qualy – more people are entitled to this – this is our chance as a Council to do something additional to help iniduals.”Applications can be made online at the Council website –  http:www.orkney.gov.uk School-Benefit or by calling  for a paper application form.Further information is available on  https:www.orkney.gov.uk Service-Directory S School-Meals-and-Clothing-Allowances.htmcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This includes users of all ages and levels of mobility – cyclists, walkers, runners and wheelchair and mobility vehicle users.The route has been chosen to promote active travel, link communities, improve local access, and act as a springboard for an island-wide network of safe paths.The project group has lodged a planning application for the Skye Bridge to Ashaig Airstrip section of the route, following the old A road where possible. And they are now starting on a detailed consultation for a link between Ashaig and Broadford.In March the project group held a community consultation on the three possible routes for this section. It was concluded that the single track ‘committee road’ option running through Breakish would give the best compromise between a quiet, scenic, low-traffic area, and the straightest, most direct route. This was the link most favoured by public consultees. met with supporters of the project outside Breakish Hall to find out what the Skye Cycle Way would mean to them.Broadford Primary pupil Krista said a cycle path would allow her and other children to do what they loved without any worries.She said: “For little kids that want to do more cycling it would be safer because just a little slip off the pavement could lead to a road accidentthere’s a car coming, so I think the cycle path would be really handy.“It wouldn’t put me at risk of traffic and it would mean I just go out and cycle.”Breakish resident Lis Phillips felt the cycle way could help recapture the feeling of safety for cyclists experienced during the lockdown.She said: “I cycle back and forth to my work at Broadford surgery, and during the lockdown, I noticed people on bikes who I’ve never seen cycling before because there were hardly any cars on the roads.“There is obviously an appetite for people to be able to cycle but they don’t feel it is safe, so they don’t do it.”The project group has been working with engineering consultants and main funder Sustrans, to come up with a design proposal for the route that will meet their requirements.The plans involve separating cyclists from pedestrians and other users. Cyclists would share the single-track carriageway with motor traffic, and pedestrians would enjoy a new . metre wide footpath. that the safer environment would help pupils thrive.“There is no way to avoid traffic when you are living here in Broadford, it is so busy – all the traffic that comes through Skye comes through us. So for the children, it was quite daunting to let them out on their bikes through the village.“However, during the lockdown, they were out on bikes, and more of them were cycling than ever before. You are seeing fitter and healthy children with just that bit more independence and freedom.“The cycle way is a wonderful thing.”Kyleakin resident Ian Sikorski, who has a family house in the area, earmarked the best route between Ashaig and Broadford through the community consultation and said: “Hopefully people will see the necessity for it. We have the house at the end of the ‘committee road’ beside the cattle grid.“My auntie lived there, and at that time there weren’t many houses at all. Now look at the number, and in another  years there will probably be twice the number – and you have seen the state of the road, so it badly needs a footpath.“Highland Council should have put in a footpath really. It is definitely needed. If people with families are going to build houses then it would be greatthey are able to walk and cycle along to Broadford or Kyleakin.“I used to cycle up that main road, regularly. I haven#t cycled it for years now. It is too dangerous.”﻿‘Future users’ group to be launched to help shape design of cycle way﻿The Skye Cycle Way project group secured funding from Transport Scotland via Sustrans to develop the detailed design proposals for the whole route, secure access permissions, and planning consents, and work up its strategy for finding the estimated £. million required. Match funding will be needed as this accounts for  per cent of the overall project costs.This builds on earlier feasibility studies, concept designs, and community consultation undertaken during , also funded by Transport Scotland and Sustrans. that a ‘future users’ group will be launched in the new year to ensure that all sections of the community have the opportunity to help shape the design of the path.They added: “We want this to be a safe, shared-use path for everybody, an asset for our communities, our environment, and our economy.”Due to Covid restrictions, the group have been unable to hold any face-to-face public consultations since March but are hoping this changes in the new year..

As well as the council, the plan involves Highlands and Islands Enterprise and the Scottish Futures Trust.All three agencies will help identy funding, once the list of projects has been agreed under five broad headings: Strengthening communities, health and education, sustainable tourism, digital and transport infrastructure and a erse and green economy.This week, following an online area committee meeting, Skye and Raasay councillors welcomed the progress to date .Tourism body SkyeConnect also welcomed the potential for the plan to deliver material benefits for the island.A spokesman added: “The priorities for SkyeConnect are, unsurprisingly, additional toilet facilities, road improvements, car parking and a greater provision of ’stop-over’ locations for campervans with appropriate basic infrastructure. In addition, SkyeConnect is working with a number of bodies to develop a so-called ‘internet of things’ which will greatly assist in managing the flow of visitors around the island.”The ‘internet of things’ concept sees digital infrastructure providing real time information on traffic flow and footfall at key locations. This can then be used to send mobile alerts to visitors with suggestions for alternative sites that are not too busy.John Gordonwas pleased the plan was “progressing well” as it had been a priority for Skye and Raasay councillors for some time. He also thought that upgrading Portree harbour would be an ideal project.“This update is encouraging and is an exciting development for Skye and Raasay,” he added. “Over the last few years we have seen some great partnership working at ious tourist hot-spots that has attracted some investment which has made a signicant dference, but we acknowledge there is much to do, and major investment is still needed.“The local area committee and partners are ambitious for Skye and Raasay and this investment plan which spells out actions for coordinating and securing funding and for the implementation of the plan.”Calum Munro highlighted the redevelopment of Uig harbour as a possible candidate for inclusion.He added: “The development of the Skye and Raasay investment plan is at an important and exciting phase as over the next two months stakeholders gather to engage with all the potential projects which will be part of that plan. It will be great to look at projects and see which ones best achieve the outcomes we want to see for Skye and Raasay in terms of infrastructure, strengthening communities, health and education, developing a green and erse economy and sustainable tourism.“Looking at these projects and identying interconnectedness and partnership opportunities is crucial and it’s clear that to bring in the required investment there needs to be an approach which is strategic and cohesive.“We are now at the stage where virtually the whole of Skye and Raasay have formed community trusts so I’m really looking forward to seeing some of these communities building on the work they’ve already done and achieving some of their other ambitions over the next two-three years.”Calum MacLeod said: “I’d like to see a collaborative economic recovery plan continuing with all relevant stakeholders’ involvement that is essential to address the Covid impact, and also a continuing plan to address at pace more attainable affordable housing. “The plan would also be a great opportunity to improve sustainable green tourism including better public transport infrastructure and the Skye cycle path.“It is a necessity to see trunk road agencies working closer together in achieving better and safer measures for all road users and residents working with councillors. The good work and investment that has been established to date on improving ious key projects should continue going forward towards full development.”For John Finlayson, a place-based and joined up Skye plan is “long overdue” and it was essential that the public sector, businesses, community interests and the wider community “work together to support economic recovery and development taking account of the unique challenges and the unique opportunities” in the Eilean a’ Cheo ward.He added: “The key areas of focus in what has to be an outcome driven plan and which were included in the report to the area committee are strong starting points for further community discussion and engagement. But I doubt many willargue that strengthening communities, health and education, sustainable tourism, digital and transport infrastructure and a erse and green economy are not areas we need to focus on.“I personally have a strong commitment to ensuring the best for our young people. This of course means that we need to make sure that our children are educated in st century buildings which provide safe, healthy and modern learning environments and I will continue to champion the need to build new schools at Broadford and Dunvegan.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/CROFTING-SHEEP-1.jpg","title":"the rams are out to mark the start of the crofting","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineWith most now looking ahead to the year-end celebrations and festive reflections, the shortened daylight hours of late autumn and winter actually mark the start of the crofting year, certainly for those whose main interest is livestock, which is the vast majority.This is the time when the rams go out with the ewes, everything bar breeding stock has more or less been sold and it’s time to hunker down for the long winter ahead.Sheep have a natural production cycle which fits the seasonal patterns. As the days shorten, they naturally come on “season” ready for the ram, so that their lambs hit the ground with the new flush of spring grass. Mother Nature never ceases to amaze.Cows, on the other hand, can breed all-year, with the same gestation period as humans, though most calve in or around the spring, for much the same reason as sheep.But late autumn is when you start with a blank canvas. The next few weeks and months are all about ensuring everything has enough feed and reserves to carry it through the cold and wet – but especially the wet.I’ve heard many an old-timer say that the cold and wind rarely bother the animals. It’s the wet that really has an impact, as the lack of a dry lying area just saps their reserves.The financial s from a few animals are just too low to justy expenditure on large sheds and then there’s the cost of bedding. In conversation with a mainland farmer, I happened to remark that it cost us in Lewis north of £ for a big bale of bedding straw, sometimes £. He was getting it at £. He was in no doubt that at these prices it was completely unsustainable to have cattle inside for anyof time.If it’s a crisp, frosty winter, the cattle aren’t much of a problem. But the incessant rain can become a depressing drudge as you constantly battle the mud and dampness. With most crofters having a full-time job, you can see why so many just concentrate on keeping a few sheep – they don’t poach the ground nearly as much and, for quite obvious reasons, require much less feeding.For my own part, I’ve noticed a huge improvement in the grazing and ground since introducing cattle and they’re also vital for accessing environmental funding streams aimed at increasing bioersity.When the better weather finally does come, they’re much less selective in their grazing, meaning they will consume a lot of the harsher grasses, leading to greater rejuvenation of sward. Their dung is an extremely proficient fertiliser that attracts a myriad of insects which, in turn, brings more birdle – a very important consideration in today’s environmentally-conscious times.It’s all pros and cons and weighing up what’s right for your own personal circumstances, time and available infrastructure.But, whatever, it’s crucial to get the winter maintenance regime right so the animals can get off to the best of possible starts and, with a bit of luck, we can settle down to the festivities in a relatively rested frame of mind, however muted the celebrations might all be this year.WHILE we look back on what has been the most tumultuous of years, I hope we don’t forget the massive extra volunteer effort that was needed to carry us through. It was rather gratying to see the best of selfless human endeavour coming through in the worst of crises.At one stage it looked like there would be no livestock sales in the islands. In the greater scheme of things it would hardly have been the worst of outcomes, but it would nevertheless have created huge logistical problems. Fortunately, it did not materialise.The commercial aspect on sale day is overseen by Dingwall and Highland Marts, in the case of Stornoway, Portree and Lochmaddy, and United Auctions in Lochboisdale and the Argyll islands. But it still requires a huge amount of volunteer effort at local level. Even in normal times it is a thankless task to ensure all the animals are in their correct pens and the sale keeps moving along efficiently.Considering social distancing rules and that livestock owners were not allowed to be present on sale day, it must have been all the more challenging this year. So a huge debt of gratitude is owed to all those who ensured the sales went ahead – and relatively smoothly into the bargain. The fact that the prices were so good was a bit of an extra boost, just when we all needed it most."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Dining-Room-2-.jpg","title":"business spotlight priory hotel","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe Priory Hotel is a three-star VisitScotland rated hotel in the picturesque village of Beauly, no more than a short drive north of Inverness and just off the North Coast  driving route.Ownership of Beauly’s Priory Hotel is in the hands of its employees.

Ive never made proper jewellery before.I made one for myself saying IVY and then when I wore it people started asking could I make them one with their kids names on it. It just went from there.Its not dficult to see why Erinns bracelets have become so successful. Blending contemporary designs with traditional gold and silver, her now signature personalised name bracelets have proved to be most popular.From modern stacking bracelets, in gold filled and sterling silver beads, to personalised designs for both adults and children, her bracelets are quickly becoming the perfect gts for family and friends.Erinn is grateful for each and every order she receives and is particularly thankful to those who have helped her along the way.Erinn commented: My husband has helped me endlessly. He made my website and logo and has been so supportive when things have been stressful, even writing envelopes at times. “Though I havent got him actually making bracelets yet.Anna from Blossoming Birds has also been a huge supporter. She helped me get some beautul imagery to help me get started and has given me loads of great advice.Im so grateful to everyone who has ordered a bracelet from me.CHANGES has been quite a year for Erinn becoming a new mother, grappling with a worldwide pandemic as well as standing down from her busy job at the BBC.Erinn said: Its hard for me to compare le at the BBC with le as the owner of a small business because so much has changed all at once. I became a mum for the first time just a few months before the pandemic really hit and at the same time I started this business. So, le before Ivy, Ivy and Gold and the pandemic all go hand in hand and to be honest its like a totally dferent world.I can barely imagine leaving Ivy to drive up to Belfast every day after months spent locked down and not even allowed to go to the shop because of shielding for her condition.I loved my job at the BBC, but after Ivys diagnosis, coupled with the pandemic and shielding, my priority was staying home with her, doing all of her treatments and keeping my family safe.Ivy and Gold has allowed me to do that and Im so grateful.Christmas sales have been crazy, so much so, that I closed the website to new orders on November .I will be working right up to December , the last posting day with Royal Mail, to get all the orders out.You can view Erinns bracelets at Ivy and Gold Bracelets on Instagram and facebook, or by visiting her website www.ivygoldGt cards only are available now for Christmas.

He said he had not had any Covid- symptoms.“I felt unwell on Friday a week ago. On the Saturday it got worse and on Sunday I went down to hospital. I had a burst appendix,” he told BBC Radio Ulster’s Farming Matters programme.“So, late on Sunday night I got operated on, and just before I went for the surgery, I was told I had Covid-, but I had no symptoms of it, haven’t had any symptoms of it and it’s not something that is causing me any grief whatsoever.“Thankfully, I am recovering from the operation and very grateful to all of the staff at the Royal Victoria Hospital for their care and the surgical team who provided the le-saving surgery.”Mr Poots said he took two paracetamol on Saturday to “grind out the pain”.“But the pain didn’t go away and probably I should have went on Saturday at some stage. Then the appendix burst, so I would encourage others to be wisethey have something which is deeply unusual because you know your own body,” he said.Mr Poots insisted he remained focused on his surgery when he was told he had tested positive for coronavirus.“I was gowned up and ready for surgery and the only thing that I was interested in was getting surgery because I knew that my appendix was leaking poison into my system. That was my only concern at that moment in time,” he said.“Covid- was only a distraction in that respect.”Mr Poots said he would be “out and about as usual” today after being “very obedient” about self-isolating.Belfast Most ReadUse of Seamus Heaney#s image in NI centenary campaign #deeply offensive#, says EastwoodChaotic scenes outside Antrim Hospital as patients treated in ambulances in car parkCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Robin Swann to propose further restrictions as six deaths and  new casesNI physio Kirsty Moffett killed in New Zealand crash #had a heart for everyone#PSNI branded a #Grinch# for pulling over Belfast Santa sleigh Latest CoronavirusCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Arlene Foster warns of #serious situation# as eight deaths and  new cases confirmed Christmas restrictions, closing pubs and schools to be discussed by NI ExecutiveConfused by all the coronavirus rules  Here#s what you can and can#t doChief Medical Officer says travel limitations #won#t work#Latest from Belfast Micheal Martin urges vigilance over Northern Ireland’s rising Covid- numbersSmaller, shorter Christmas celebrations recommended by JohnsonFamilies of Hyde Park bombing victims to challenge High Court rulingUS Secretary of State Mike Pompeo quarantines after coronavirus exposureNo doubt an intervention is required over Covid- – Michelle O’Neill,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

But, in an exclusive interview with this newspaper, Fiona Kane, of St Ronan’s College in Lurgan, said that just one positive case involving a pupil would take some four hours to properly manage.“A parent generally contacts the school — on one occasion I got a call on my mobile very early on a Sunday morning,” she said.“We have to record the last date the pupil attended school, the date they became symptomatic, list the symptoms, tell PHA the date the pupil was tested, the day the test results came back,any other family members are symptomatic.“Then we have to contact trace we print off their timetable and we literally have seating plans for every single period of the day for every child — you can imagine the work that went into that for a school like ours which has , pupils on split sites.“We have to then trace within two metres of every child who has been a close contact of them, check how they travelled to school,they were in a bus who was beside them, how long was the journey... or did you go by car, were there any other students in the car  “And how long was your journey  Who did you eat with a break time, at lunch time.”Mrs Kane added: “It literally takes hours. At the start, one case was knocking out three to four hours of my day, and I’ve dealt with  since the first lockdown.”Other principals have expressed their anger at having to make themselves available for Track, Trace and Contact duties while PHA staff go on holiday from December  at pm.“No one is telling us what the expectations of us are over the Christmas period,” said Fiona, who has a -year-old son, Ronan, a student, and a daughter, Aoe, who’s .“Quite frankly, we all deserve a break,” she added.“We’ve been expected to do this without any training.“We’ve got the pressures of Covid to deal with — but principals like me have still got a school to run.“We’re absolutely exhausted. We’ve got families too, Mr Weir. That gets forgotten at times.“It’s certainly feels like we’ve been doing this   when you’re getting calls all the time and it’s eating into your family and personal time. We’re getting hammered as a profession and it’s unfair.”Mrs Kane stressed: “I really don’t want to pick this up again until we come back to school on January .”Earlier this week, Diane Dawson, principal of Braniel Primary School, criticised the “defiance” of Education Minister Peter Weir in putting staff in this position.“We’ve been put in the completely untenable position of having to tun Track, Trace and Contact over the Christmas holidays without vital PHA support,” said Ms Dawson.And Graham Gault of Maghaberry Primary School told this newspaper it was “completely unacceptable that our Minister has now left many principals carrying this responsibility through Christmas with no support”.The PHA yesterday confirmed that their education team, which deals with Track, Trace and Contact issues, will not be available after pm on December .“While schools are closed over the Christmas period, the service provided by the education team will continue to be delivered through our Health Protection Duty Room and on call service, and the Contact Tracing Service,” a statement said.“The Duty Room provides public health management advice to a range of professional organisations for all reported infectious diseases, including those that occur in a school setting.“All schools will receive a reminder of the contact details for support in a letter that will be issued this week.“It is important to emphasise that schools will receive the support they need throughout the Christmas and New Year period.”Reiterating his call for Northern Ireland schools to close ahead of schedule, Alliance MLA and Education Committee chair Chris Lyttle said the Education Minister must recognise the signicant sacrices that teachers have made during the pandemic.“They have had to become risk assessors  , contact tracers and remote learning coordinators,” he told this newspaper.“If schools aren’t closing until December , it seems that school leaders could be responsible for contact tracing of cases that occur after December  — over Christmas Eve, Christmas Day and Boxing Day.“The Minister could limit cases by ensuring all schools finish on Thursday or Friday this week.”Belfast Most ReadUse of Seamus Heaney#s image in NI centenary campaign #deeply offensive#, says EastwoodChaotic scenes outside Antrim Hospital as patients treated in ambulances in car parkCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Robin Swann to propose further restrictions as six deaths and  new casesNI physio Kirsty Moffett killed in New Zealand crash #had a heart for everyone#PSNI branded a #Grinch# for pulling over Belfast Santa sleigh Latest CoronavirusCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Arlene Foster warns of #serious situation# as eight deaths and  new cases confirmed Christmas restrictions, closing pubs and schools to be discussed by NI ExecutiveI didn’t have time to fret about Covid news, says Edwin Poots Confused by all the coronavirus rules  Here#s what you can and can#t doChief Medical Officer says travel limitations #won#t work#Latest from Belfast Smaller, shorter Christmas celebrations recommended by JohnsonFamilies of Hyde Park bombing victims to challenge High Court rulingUS Secretary of State Mike Pompeo quarantines after coronavirus exposureNo doubt an intervention is required over Covid- – Michelle O’NeillRod Stewart’s Florida assault case ‘very close to resolution’, US court told,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The total spend hit £.m - up from £m.Beer and lager sales had the strongest percentage increase of the three types of booze tracked by the information company.Figures shared with this newspaper show wine sales grew by nearly a fth to £.m in the  weeks. But cider fell out of favour for those drinking at home, with sales down nearly % to £.m. The period included six weeks of lockdown for restaurants and bars serving food, aimed at containing the spread of Covid-.Bars serving drink only were open for just three weeks within the period. At the moment, bars can only open where they serve food from a kitchen on the premises.Kantar monitors sales in supermarkets like Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury#s and Lidl, as well as convenience stores like Spar, Centra and Mace, and off-licences. But it does not track sales of spirits.Retail analyst Emer Healy from Kantar said that as well as buying alcohol to compensate for closures, customers may have been stocking up for Christmas. Colin Neill, chief executive of pub trade body Hospitality Ulster, said it was no surprise the closure of bars was driving up sales of alcohol. But he said it also meant an increase in social mixing and a less controlled environment for drinking, where the risk of Covid- transmission was potentially greater. While we#re closed, we#re not only driving up alcohol sales but house parties too, he said.That#s going to increase over Christmas, but hospitality will end up paying the price by being locked down. Our traditional pubs have only been opened for three weeks since St Patrick#s Day... I appreciate while we#re closed, people will obviously want a beer or a gin and turn to the off-sales market for that. It#s not us complaining about customers and their behaviour, but it#s depressing in that our pubs have spent so much and put measures in place and have not been allowed to be open. He said some pubs permitted to open under the current lockdown were weighing up whether to stay open and lose money, or stay closed and lose money. We need to have adequte compensation from the government wherenot in a position to be open, he said.Belfast Most ReadCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Robin Swann to propose further restrictions as six deaths and  new casesUse of Seamus Heaney#s image in NI centenary campaign #deeply offensive#, says EastwoodChaotic scenes outside Antrim Hospital as patients treated in ambulances in car parkPSNI branded a #Grinch# for pulling over Belfast Santa sleigh NI physio Kirsty Moffett killed in New Zealand crash #had a heart for everyone#Latest CoronavirusCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Arlene Foster warns of #serious situation# as eight deaths and  new cases confirmed Christmas restrictions, closing pubs and schools to be discussed by NI ExecutiveI didn’t have time to fret about Covid news, says Edwin Poots Confused by all the coronavirus rules  Here#s what you can and can#t doChief Medical Officer says travel limitations #won#t work#Latest from Belfast Families of Hyde Park bombing victims to challenge High Court rulingUS Secretary of State Mike Pompeo quarantines after coronavirus exposureNo doubt an intervention is required over Covid- – Michelle O’NeillRod Stewart’s Florida assault case ‘very close to resolution’, US court toldMajor rail line back on Tube map after -year absence,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueThe Falls Road SantaEimear McGovernTwitterEmailDecember   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailA west Belfast Santa has labelled the PSNI a Grinch after police stopped him on a sleigh tour.But locals say they won#t let it spoil their Christmas cheer as families and children are visited by the man in the red suit in an event organised by the Falls Residents Association. Officers were criticised for stopping #Father Christmas# on Monday night after receiving a complaint over the safety of the pony and trap he was on.A video of the incident shows face mask-wearing officers speaking to Santa for several minutes, saying: You must have a white light in front and a red one at the back. You#ll have to wrap it up. It#s a breach of the Highway Code.Lisa Lynn of the Falls Residents Association said it was unfortunate the sleigh was stopped in light of the fact it had communicated its plans to the local community policing team, who seemed happy enough. Ms Lynn added that Santa#s sleigh will be back out tonight delivering selection boxes after the requisite measures were put in place. We contacted themagain and they gave us the go-ahead to continue once we had the correct lights, she explained.It seems like a big misunderstanding, and although we had to briefly suspend the parade, we were back up and running again very quickly and no children missed out on seeing Santa.Santa himself, aka Robert McClenaghan, said: We were told there#d been a complaint about Santa#s sleigh and the cop said we had to have a white light on the front and a red one on the back. I thought it was a bit like the Grinch, to be honest.It#s a pre-planned route and we#ll be back out tonight and tomorrow to get up as far as the Grosvenorto bring a little joy to the community.We#ve the Falls ided in three and we#ll be starting at Albert Street tonight. So far we#ve delivered  selection boxes to local kids and you should see the smiles on their faces.It#s been a tough year and we#re bringing some happiness to people#s lives, so to have someone quoting traffic legislation at you in the middle of it is a bit #Bah humbug!#.That#s not what I want to think about, though. It#s the positivity of all the hundreds of kids we saw last night, that#s the main thing.On social media the officers were described as Scrooges and were met with shouts of killjoys for halting proceedings.This my friends is the wonderful local police force trying to stop Santa from talking to around   kids and parents, said one post.This is happening ALL OVER BELFAST and they come tonight to Hamill John Street and say no to Christmas carols, no to community spirit. Grinch wouldn#t even do this to kids.Another wrote: Couldn#t believe it. Kids standing watching them, all excited for Santa.Were kids standing watching this happen  asked another.That#s awful, they#d be needing to take a red face.The PSNI said officers responded to a report from a member of the public regarding a concern for safety of a pony and trap.Police attended and issued advice and guidance regarding the Highway Code and were content that the event was properly marshalled. The event was not stopped and was allowed to continue, it added.Belfast Most ReadUse of Seamus Heaney#s image in NI centenary campaign #deeply offensive#, says EastwoodChaotic scenes outside Antrim Hospital as patients treated in ambulances in car parkCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Robin Swann to propose further restrictions as six deaths and  new casesNI physio Kirsty Moffett killed in New Zealand crash #had a heart for everyone#PSNI branded a #Grinch# for pulling over Belfast Santa sleigh Latest Northern IrelandMicheal Martin urges vigilance over Northern Ireland’s rising Covid- numbersSmaller, shorter Christmas celebrations recommended by JohnsonFamilies of Hyde Park bombing victims to challenge High Court rulingNo doubt an intervention is required over Covid- – Michelle O’NeillBeattie hits out at PPS for not appealing #incredibly lenient# sentences for republican terrorists Latest from Belfast Micheal Martin urges vigilance over Northern Ireland’s rising Covid- numbersSmaller, shorter Christmas celebrations recommended by JohnsonFamilies of Hyde Park bombing victims to challenge High Court rulingUS Secretary of State Mike Pompeo quarantines after coronavirus exposureNo doubt an intervention is required over Covid- – Michelle O’Neill,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Ballinascreens Aine McAllister played both camogie and football for Derry this season. She tells Michael McMullan about her love and passion for playing both codes. *** With a day of teaching in Eglintons Broadbridge Primary School done and dusted, Aine McAllisters mind is still racing. Her voice remains charged with energy. A passion for sport hugs every dancing word. Its much like her all-action playing career. She empties the tank every time she pulls on the jersey. The colour is irrelevant. Red or maroon. It doesnt matter. Since the early U days with Ballinascreen, football and camogie have been a constant. Her parents Mickey and Maria supported every move and ferried their sons and daughters around the corners of Derry. googletag.cmd.push Now , nothing has changed for Aine in her eighth season on the Derry senior squad. In the months after Derrys  All-Ireland intermediate title, the county held their annual presentation. As part of the minor squad, Aine was there in the Wild Duck that night to bring down the curtain on the season. It was then senior manager John A Mullan who asked her about stepping up to senior level. The following year, aged , she joined the squad under Joe Baldwin and vividly remembers her first training session. Slamming sliotars against the wall of Magherafelts Meadowbank complex, they honed their striking action, reflexes and handling. A whos who of McAllisters idols. googletag.cmd.push She always dreamt of playing for Derry and here she was rubbing shoulders with the likes of Katie McAuley, Grainne and Meabh McGoldrick. It was far from daunting. Eiliacutes Niacute Chaiside was there too, a fourth year at St Marys Belfast when McAllister came in as a Fresher. They played on the team that reached the Fr Maher Final, a competition Aine would win with The Ranch in her final year. “That helped break the ice and I knew the faces from Ballinascreen. Bronagh McGillian wouldve been involved that year,” McAllister remembers of that first training session. “They were great,” she said of how the younger players were treated. “Katie McAuley wouldve scared the bejesus out of me for club camogie, but they were all very welcoming. They wanted girls no matter what club you were from, which was great.”     Of Derrys  Ulster championships, Aine has four winners medals and scored two points in the  decider at Swatragh, during current manager Ciaran Cunninghams last stint in the Oakleaf hotseat. In football, she reluctantly joined the county squad in recent seasons. It wasnt that she didnt want play football. “I wouldnt have wanted to have came in at that point, not having trained all year,” Aine said of Paul Croziers invite to come on board. “It wasnt possible, training on the same nights and there was a lot on top of each other. I didnt want to be at camogie and not fully committed to camogie...it was the same for football.” An all or nothing person, with half measures not sitting well. Crozier and some of the football squad, who were soon on the phone, assured Aine she was welcome. “They knew I was flat out trainingand not lying at home doing nothing,” she points out. Aine did join the  and this year the schedule had a dferent pattern. With Covid- forcing a split season format, her involvement with Ballinascreen was complete by the time the county scene rolled around and Aine was able to throw her lot into both camps. “We always played both,” she said of her career. “Butyoud asked me when I was younger, Id have said camogie was my first sport. As Ive grown up, they have just gone alongside each other.” There was always ladies football in Ballinascreen, so it just went hand and hand , demanding constant communication between the camps. Already, camogie manager Reamann Tam Kennedy and his football counterpart Conor McGarvey have touched base. With the experiences of last year consigned to history, they have picked through the rubble to plot a better path to take. “Tam was on the phone the day after the Slaughtneil game,” she reveals. “Telling me how we were going to improve for next year...he never switches off.” Growing up, it was a constant wrestle between Screen and Swatragh for honours. Aine, with the benefit of a good birthday, availed of a fruitful extra year, with U, U and minor glory coming her way. “In my school year, Swatragh were always a step ahead of us,” Aine remembers. “I was lucky enough to be part of the when we won the  All-Ireland Feacuteile in Kilkenny. Two years later we got down to Galway, but we didnt win it.” At St Marys Magherafelt, her teams were in the shadows of Cross and Passion, Ballycastle and rivals St Patricks Maghera. She decided to repeat her Upper Sixth year to get the grades for her teaching degree. “I refused to leave,” she can now joke. She needed a medal before calling time on her Convent days and they stopped the Maghera dominance to land the  title. “Out of all the medals, thats one of the best ones because of the long slog of school camogie and to finally get over the line was just great,” beams McAllister, placing much of the credit at her coach Reamann Kennedys door. “He did tactics and St Pats didnt have a clue what was going on and by the time they did, we were in the lead and it worked to our advantage.” *** What a dference a year makes in sport  Twelve months after watching Steelstown celebrate the  ladies title through their own tears of devastation, it was Ballinascreens turn to shine. The years of playing both codes would eventually pay idends. Again it was Steelstown in the final, but it took every sinew to pull Screen into dreamland. Louise Murphy grabbed two goals, with Casey McKenna bagging a third in a - to - win. They still needed goalkeeping heroics of Kathryn Conneryin a player of the final performance. It sparked pandemonium in the celebrations, as history was made with a first title. Lauren McKennas movement for Connerys kick-outs was another factor. So too was Aine McAllisters input at midfield, it a team that included her sisters Rachel and Sarah. Ballinascreen celebrate winning the  senior ladies championship, a first in their history  They retained their title last season, with victory over Ballymaguigan in a Sunday night monsoon at Owenbeg. It was Aines second game of the weekend, having played with Derry camogs  hours earlier. Having the football moved allowed her to play for both teams. Last month, she did the same – playing for Derry camogs and footballers in the same weekend. The refreshing thing was how much energy she was able to expend going down the final stretch of the second game. For McAllister, the split season had a huge impact on not only her own availability, but the rest of the county players. In the case of camogie, Ciaran Cunningham was able to boast a more competitive squad. “We didnt have the pressure of club football and camogie.” Aine states. The county titles were long dished out. “County is great and I really enjoy it, but I am sure there are people who say their club comes first. The one thing that sometimes bothered me, was that when you were playing county you were missing out on club training sessions, which was always the way it was going to be.” McAllister and Megan Kerr are Derry camogs representative on the WGPA. They recently circulated a survey to the rest of the , one that will be collated across all  counties in both bodes. Figuring prominently was the questions over keeping the split season. Speaking with both passion and reason in equal measure, Aine feels keeping the club and county seasons apart is the way forward. Everyone is a winner. “There are occasions that girls have turned down playing for Derry camogie, because they have a lot of pressure on from their club management, not wanting them to miss club training,” Aine points out. “Some girls are put into the situation where they cant win. Its not fair,you are playing for a club you should have the opportunity to represent Derry. “Its a pitygirls are not coming outit a case of support from clubs not being there...they would make a dference to Derry.” The split season or not, McAllisters schedule remained a busy one, training virtually every night of the week with at least one game at the weekend. It is something she accepts, butthere is a bit of give and take between both management teams, it can work. “It is about good communication between managers, and players being honest and taking the rest, they need to have their own responsibility for their own performance,” she adds. One group of people she feels need all the credit in the world are the fixture committees. “I dont know how they manage it,” she said. “When it comes to the championship, they do the best they can, but there is a big overlap with ladies football and camogie, Im sure it is the same for hurling and football. “I know Teresa McKenna has done so much for Derry football, with some of the fixtures that have been clashing.” But, in the long run, Aine feels the club championship season needs to be looked at. Ballinascreens entire football team are dual players. It prevents them from perfecting any last-minute preparation. A challenge game to work on tactics, or a few nights off to keep the limbs fresh. Aine in football action for Derry  “You have to give them credit in Slaughtneil for how well their camogie team have dominated not only Derry camogie, but across Ireland. “I can imagine their preparations and being down southand all the stuff Id love to do, but being dual it just doesnt work. It is not possible and girls have been burned out and that has been the case for some of the girls by the championship and they look more unfit.” That said, she wouldnt change being a dual player for the world, with the more positives than negatives. *** After their defeat to Meath in the All-Ireland series, Ciaran Cunningham praised the efforts of his team. Aine McAllister has a similar train of thought, having held all the aces for much of the first half. In recent seasons, Derry have more than held their own with Tipperary, Kilkenny and Cork, backing it up with four Ulster titles since . Former manager John ODwyer said the same. On their day, Derry can beat anybody. “If you are to go, player by player, when we come up against Down - I wouldnt swap anyone,” Aine admits. “Its like Slaughtneil camogs, they have learned how to work together as a unit. That is something we are missing. “Its not that girls wont pass to anyone, thats not it. I think we are just missing that link up, thats the dference between us and the so called stronger teams.” Down have had the core of their team playing together four or five years and they know each other inside out. Clonduff had been another shining light at club level. “But they really do live and breath for county camogie,” Aine adds.” “In Derry camogie, we have missing girls who are not out representing their county. It is as simple as that, some girls dont have the same interest as others. Its a pity, as the talent is there. Slaughtneil wouldnt have got as far as they have without their obvious talent.” The gap is closing in the Derry scene. Swatragh won the league in recent times and took the Emmets to a replay this year. Lavey pushed Swatragh all the way. And Ballinascreen, like Swatragh, have threatened to topple Slaughtneil. When it comes to the Derry squad, the same drive just hasnt been there. “We have struggled for numbers in Derry camogie and that shouldnt be the case...there is the pick of four or five girls in each club,” Aine stresses. There are the excuses of not committing due to club, but it doesnt wash with Aine. If the fixtures fit, it can work. “You can manage it,you want to play,” she added. The  season has proved it. “At the start of the year, I was the only Screen girl representing Derry in camogie, which is ridiculous when you see how close we are in the championship. “They all came out and these are girls were starting on the team...they realised how much they can get out of Derry camogie and how much they enjoyed it. “Then there are is Swatragh, Lavey and Slaughtneil,you look at Ceacuteat McEldowney, she such an asset to Derry camogie.” What she wouldnt do for having the full  to pick from, chomping at the bit to push for a start. ”Its a pity, its the only word I can say,” Aine continues. “When I was growing up all I wanted to do was to play for the Derry camogie team and better myself. I dont think there is any other way than going to the county, you are playing against better opposition and with better girls around you.” She longs for the day, when there are enough girls putting themselves forward that it requires trials. With players pushing to even make the . “If everybody would buy in, the damage wed do in intermediate camogie, never mind senior. When I started we competed at senior level. “Losing Katie, the McGoldricks, Aileen McCusker, who are massive misses but there are young girls out there who should be making up for some of the players, but are not coming on board, but hopefully that changes.” One thing wont change, Aine McAllisters love for sport. She knows nothing .  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Oakleafers host Armagh this weekend in a repeat of last years clash. Lee Brady, Donncha Gilmore, Calum Downey, Matthew Downey, Charlie Diamond and Adam McGonigle remain from Derrys - to - win, thanks to a goal from PJ McAleese. Gilmore wont be part of Derrys plans, after sustaining a serious knee injury earlier in the season. googletag.cmd.push Thanks to four points from Lachlan Murray, three Charlie Diamond points and a penalty save from goalkeeper Kian McGonigle, this years Derry crop were winners over Monaghan in horrendous conditions in Clones in the league opener in February. With a depleted squad, due to St Patricks Magheras involvement in the Paul McGirr semi-final, Derry lost to Down in the only other game played before lockdown. In recent weeks they have played training games, but – like the other seven teams – go into the unknown this weekend. Only Monaghans preliminary round win over Cavan made the cut when the championship began in October, before it was once again closed down. googletag.cmd.push Sundays opponents Armagh also beat the Farney county in the league, after losing their opener to Antrim . From last years team Michael McConville is underage and was selected as captain by manager Ciaran McKeever. Midfielder James Walsh also started in , while Adam Garvey and Niall Dummigan – who came on as substitutes – are full back and centre back respectively. Another player Derry must plan for is Derrynoose dual star Mattie Lennon, son of Tyrone hurling boss Mattie. He bagged - in their win over Monaghan, with Darragh McMullen also a threat. The early league games feel almost like a dferent season entirely and Martin Boyle admitted Derrys management doubteda ball would be kicked again this year.     Boyle leads a management team that includes Darren McShane, Diarmuid Scullion and Stephen McGuigan. They have been ratied for next season, with one change – James McNicholl moves up from the U squad to take the place of Scullion who has opted out for . In October and November, the players were going to leisure centres to follow gym programmes and getting their running done on their own at club pitches in the dark. “It was really tough on the lads, but not once did they show it, not once,” Boyle stressed, in no uncertain terms. “When we were able to get together in pods, we had parents driving around the county to the dferent venues. You really appreciate that and you felt the GAA needed to make a decision, when you look at how many people are implicated by this. “But there was never anything but positivity from the lads and we got great energy from their attitude and appetite. It never waned once, which was remarkable.” “I just know that these boys want their opportunity to compete. They have been desperate to play this year and they have committed so much to the training regime.” Such was the drive for work in the squad, the management was caught between two stools of balancing the desire with rest, while factoring in their studies with the lingering thought of the season being pulled from under them. “We made a decision to take a break and it was the best thing that happened,” outlined Boyle. “There are a number of these boys and it was a good opportunity to tell them to rest. They got out of training for two or three weeks and it has helped them. They didnt want to...but they were told.” Oisin Quinn has been responsible for their strength and conditioning programme, but new senior conditioning coach Peter Hughes – who helped Derry beat Tyrone in a minor final during his playing days – oversaw any injury rehab. “We resumed back into training last week and its all good,” Boyle added. Derry are going to have to plan without Dara McGonigle , while Darragh Wades medial ligament injury could keep him out until at least a semi-final, should Derry advance. Joel Lynnand Ryan McEldowneyare also on the sidelines. Initiually, there was been better news with Niall McGonigle progress from a back injury, but a hamstring injury on Saturday makes him a doubt for Sunday. Calum Downey got an MRI scan on a groin injury that he had been managing during Laveys run to the minor title and is now going through a period of rehab. “You have to balance playing against his rehab,” Boyle points out. “We have told him there is no pressure from us . There is chat of MacRory after Christmas and then the Us. I could be selfish and say you are playing...which he willdo. “You have to look at the bigger picture, they are  year-olds and they hopefully have another  or  years playing for Derry. As Derry men, thats what we all want.” Boyle was with the development squads  years ago, before getting involved again last season. He has noticed both unity and togetherness coming back into the county scene. “The players are there and these lads...they want to play for Derry. The energy they have consistently given us at training and the quality they produce, all you want for them is this opportunity to produce on the big stage and show their worth in a Derry jersey, which they take serious pride in.” In October, Covid- ravaged his squad, on top of the bumps and bruises of club action. Speaking last week, only one member of the  was isolating due to being a close contact. “I think we are in a better place now,” Boyle feels. “When we got back to training, it was about playing football. The boys are in a better place physically and mentality. We will have to see how it goes, they are chomping at the bit and it is a very competitive .” Without the usual level of footage from minor league games, there isnt the same chance to suss out opponents and factor in match-ups. “You are going in blind, but for lads of that age, it was a competition that was nearly gone. Its a case of...get out, throw in the ball and let them play football. “Lets go and give it a rattle. There are numerous good teams in Ulster,” he concludes. “There is plenty of quality . If we get a bit of luck with injury and the bounce of the ball, who knows.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Members of the ‘Into The West’ group met with Eamon Ryan, who is also the leader of the Green Party in the Republic, on Friday. Among the topics discussed were a proposed new rail service from Derry to Letterkenny and a new direct rail line from Derry to Dublin. Into The West was founded in  to campaign against a Stormont decision to close the Derry-Belfast railway line west of Coleraine. Since then the group has also successfully fought for an hourly service between Derry and Belfast, as well as the new station at the Waterside. googletag.cmd.push Into The West co-chair, Steve Bradley, said they were grateful for Minister Ryan for meeting with them. “Our region is the forgotten corner of the island when it comes to infrastructure, and Donegal and Tyrone have been left without rail for decades,” said Mr Bradley. “Whilst there is still much to do before any firm commitments could be given, the Minister reacted positively to the case for a new commuter rail route from Derry to Letterkenny, and also to the possibility of a direct route to Dublin from Derry and Letterkenny. “Such a service would run via Strabane and Omagh, so would really help bind the north-west city region together physically. googletag.cmd.push “We also discussed our longer-term ambition of extending rail from Letterkenny all the way through Donegal to Sligo, to connect with the proposed new ‘Western Rail Corridor’. “That project seeks to create a direct rail link between Cork, Limerick, Galway and Sligo. By adding Letterkenny and Derry to that corridor you would not only connect every main town in the western half of the island by rail – you would also create a necklace of rail linking all the key population centres in Ireland: from Dublin north to Drogheda, Dundalk, Newry, Lisburn and Belfast west to Derry and Letterkenny south to Sligo, Galway, Limerick and Cork: and then back up to Dublin via Waterford and Rosslare Europort.     “It would be a game changer for the island’s economy and connectivity, and also a huge asset for Irish tourism.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Devastated in the floods of August , Swan Park, which is a popular destination for walkers from Derry, is currently being restored to its former glory. Local councillor Rena Donaghey said she was happy with the progress. “Regarding the upper section of the Park, Westbrook gate to Nelson’s lane gate, Donegal County Council has appointed a contractor to reconstruct the eye of the bridge and all associated walls around the structure. “Initial works will commence early December. This will involve the removal of debris and plants to prepare the site for major works in January. googletag.cmd.push “The upper part of the park will remain open over Christmas and the holidays to accommodate public access, however this part of the park will then close in early January, as the temporary [Green] bridge, which is in place needs to be removed to repair the main bridge. This contractor will be on site for five months and after that the Council will then complete the paths and landscaping in the upper section of the Park, work which will take a further two months to complete. “In terms of the lower section of the Park, Nelsons gate to Castle Bridge, Donegal County Councils direct labour will be in the lower section of the park repairing paths and drainage, from early December. googletag.cmd.push It is intended to have this section accessible to the public in early January. Cllr Donaghey added that additional landscaping would be required in Swan Park come the drier weather. She said: “However, the public should be able to walk through and enjoy the park. It is great to see the project progressing, given the Covid- pandemic and I feel the Council will be close to the initial deadline for completion.”       --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Sharon Tosh, project co-ordinator, said Thrt has got off to a great start. This a charity shop with a dference, said Mrs Tosh.

The Novena to the Divine Child runs from December  to . In many Carmelite monasteries or convents across Europe and beyond, a tradition grew over the centuries of placing the image of the infant child Jesus that would later be placed in the crib at Christmas in a nun or monks cell for one night. This symbolic act will be echoed in the Termonbacca novena. The image of the infant child Jesus will be carried to nine dferent homes, in nine dferent parts of the Derry area, by an escort of volunteers. googletag.cmd.push It will stay overnight in these homes each day of the novena. This journey recalls the journey of Mary and Joseph to Bethlehem to be counted in the census. The novena has traditionally had a strong emphasis on protection from harm and on the family and young people - much needed in the time of Covid- and the social upheaval and disruption, harm, havoc, serious illness and death it has caused. Joy might be in short supply this Christmas time but the Carmelites hope the novena will highlight the real, joyful meaning of Christmas - that Christ has come among us. googletag.cmd.push It presents for us all, as believing Christians, an opportunity to be still and ponder the incarnation and what that event means to us today, they say. It provides time for personal and family prayer and allows us to refocus our attention on the Christ Child, the nature of His coming and, importantly, why He came. The answer to that question is provided in the gospel of John: Yes, God loved the world so much that he gave his only Son, so that everyone who believes in him may not be lost but may have eternal le.  The novena itself will comprise of nine evening Masses, celebrated at .pm by the Carmelite Fathers and followed by the public novena prayers.     This will be streamed live from Termonbacca Monastery each evening on its YouTube channel and Facebook page. Prior to the Christmas Eve vigil Mass at pm, the image of the Christ child will be installed in the crib at the Derry retreat centre.   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Peter Cunnah who topped the charts with anthems like Things CanOnly Get Better and U R the Best Thing came home to help look after his mum Monica, who sadly passed away last November. He has spent lockdown living by the sea in Fahan where he is working on a new album with his former D:Ream bandmate Al McKenzi. Speaking as a guest on the podcast All Change Please, which is co-hosted by Derry journalist Jeananne Craig, he revealed how he is enjoying the change in pace after nearly  years in the music scene in the English capital. googletag.cmd.push Peter, who grew up in Dove Gardens before moving to Carnhill and then Clarendon Street, said he discovered his love of performing as a teenager in Derry. “We cut our teeth in the sticky carpet in the Gweedore, we put together these gigs and cut our teeth playing live, he said. You learnt how to print the tickets, how to put the posters up, get the word of mouth going, we didn’t have the internet and you learnt from the ground up.” “I got to do a foundation year in Belfast University of Ulster and used the printer to do cassette covers and posters for the band.” googletag.cmd.push From the outset Peter knew what music he was into. “I never wanted to get up and entertain people by strumming my pain and hitting them over the head telling them they’re going to hell in a hand cart, that’s not what music’s ever been to me, he explained. When I got involved in early house music that optimism and hopefulness, I just wanted to encapsulate that, make people happy and make them dance, just as we did when growing up, that element of fun and hope, and D:Ream was a catalyst for me to do that.” The former St Columbs College boy moved to London aged  where launched a highly successful music career as the front man for DReam whose smash hit Things Can Only Get Better became the anthem for New Labour.     Peter says the song still follows him: “I have a thing called the swear box and I make people put a pound in it every time they say, ‘you know what they say Pete, things can only get better!’ Interestingly I was only two weeks into my new house in Donegal when I opened up a euro swear box, and I had  euro from builders, moving agents, they were all at it, he laughed.COMING HOME After the break up of his first marriage Peter met his new we Ruth Pilkington five years ago and they married a year later. The couple decided to move to Fahan last year to help care for Peters mum Monica and dad Leslie. “My kids are old enough now to hop on a plane, he explained. I learnt to swim on Buncrana beach, we had a caravan down here in Buncrana and spent summers chasing rabbits and going swimming, back then Buncrana was like a mini Las Vegas with all these slot machines. I have great memories of that. I’ve been keeping my eye on this spot forever and when the time came to move, we were going to buy a plot and build a house but then this house came up. It’s great because I’m looking out over Lough Swilly, Inch is just across the way from me. This is my forever home, I’m back home where I want to be. I came home to look after my mum and dad, she passed there last November but the idea I could be here and be around for them was just great and my kids could come over. Peter said he has completely overhauled his lestyle since moving to Fahan and has even taken up bird watching. What I didn’t plan on is what this place has given me. I feel connected again, I’ve recharged my batteries, the air is clear, I’ve turned into a bit of a twitcher! We’ve got nesting house martins in the summer, I can see starlings, I know the dference between geese and brent geese - don’t tell anyone, I’m supposed to be a house musician. It’s wonderful, I absolutely love it. For me it’s been a revelation.” “It’s a magical place and as yet undiscovered. And long may it be so!” Peter was speaking to Derry journalist Jeananne Craig on her new Podcast All Change Please.  Jeanne worked in London and Dublin for more than a decade, reporting on breaking news and showbiz red carpets. But after the birth of her second child in , the Rosemount woman decided to relocate to the city where she grew up. “I had a great time in London and some amazing experiences there, but like many Derry people living away from home, I always missed it,” Jeananne said. With a growing trend for people looking to leave built-up cities for quieter, more affordable locations post-lockdown, Jeananne decided to share her experience and that of other ‘city quitters’ in a podcast. All Change Please is co-hosted by Jeananne, who now works as a freelance journalist and copywriter, and her friend and fellow journalist Jayne Cherrington-Cook, who left London for Kent. All nine episodes are available now and interviewees in series one include s music royalty-turned-designer Pearl Lowe, Irish presenter and illustrator Maggie Molloy, and original Big Brother winner Craig Phillips, who reveals he once rented a room from the shows notorious Nasty Nick. We cover all sorts of topics, from the practicalities of moving, to working from home and making friends somewhere new - and whether people have any regrets about leaving a big city, said Jeananne. The podcast is available on iTunes, Spoty and Acast, and is on Twitter @allchangepod.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The landmark Earth nightclub at the junction of Strand Road and Rock Road is to be replaced by  apartments. Seeing the building before torn down will feel like an end of an era for many local people. For years, the Earth complex was at the heart of Derrys nightle. Before being Earth, it was called the Strand Tavern and the complex also housed the Andy Coles bar. In July, Derry City and Strabane District Councils planning committee granted planning approval for the building to be demolished and replaced by  apartments . googletag.cmd.push  The apartments will be used for social housing and will be, according to the company behind the plans, aimed at over- active elderly persons. Some local residents had objected to the plans because of the lack of parking. However, planning officials considered the application acceptable and in accordance with the Derry Area Plan  and were satisfied that the proposal demonstrated a quality residential environment. Communal open space will be provided on the ground floor level. Speaking in July, the chair of the councils Planning Committee, Councillor Christopher Jackson, said he welcomed the fact that this development would see the enhancement of a derelict site that will in turn bring about positive economic prosperity to the area. googletag.cmd.push “I am delighted this premises will be used to house elderly members of the community who will be located in the heart of the city centre with access to all the local amenities and facilities, he said.      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It was a bit surreal,no doubt.Down went into the game with the pain of a one-point semi-final defeat to Westmeath last term still very much in their minds.That was a heart-breaking reversal for the Mourne girls, but one that they were able to use to fuel their bid for glory this time around.Caitriona said that despite the stadium being bereft of fans the players knew there were so many cheering them on from afar.ldquoThe early goal at the start of the game really helped to settle us down, she said. ldquoIn those stages I was thinking of my mummy and the nerves she would be feeling watching us. But as a team, we needed to get switched on early, get those nervy jitters out of our system quickly, because we knew the challenge that Antrim would pose to us.ldquoEverything went great from early on in the game for us. The communication was good, the flow of the moves worked, and on the day thankfully it all clicked.She also told of how in the days leading up to the final the players spoken about the heartbreak of having come so close in the past. That was something that they knew they could not allow to happen again.ldquoWe did talk about the defeats and the funny thing is, in a way those defeats can actually work to spur you on a bit more, she revealed.ldquoIt played a big part for us psychologically for last weekend, especially for the older players on our . The older you get, you donrsquot know how much more often the chances will come around I suppose. For girls like Catherine McGourty and Fionnuala Carr, they have been there for such a long time, since I was a wee girl really.ldquoThe satisfaction that they must feel, having been there for thatof time, is probably a dferent type of satisfaction to what the younger players must be experiencing now in the wake of what we have done.ldquoAll of this has been a long time coming, but the progress of Down camogie for a while has been brilliant. The numbers participating are going up all the time, there is a great junior structure.ldquoEveryone who was in our team at the weekend, has bettered themselves as players and gone from strength to strength. The bond that has developed with us as team mates has been unbelievable.All of the Down camogie camp are also acutely aware of the wider positive impact their success has had on people within their own communities. With many people feeling the implications of the restrictions placed on le by coronavirus, it has been a dark time for many. Caitriona said she and her fellow All-Ireland winners feel very lucky.ldquoWe have been in a fortunate position. When I think back I suppose only a matter of weeks, none of us were really surewe would get much,any, camogie action for the remainder of the year.ldquoTo go from that, to being All-Ireland champions, it really is just dficult to put it into words what that means.ldquoCastlewellan has been brilliant in supporting us all the way too. I have had so many messages, both wishing me luck before the final and congratulations since. It shows how much our success has meant to the community.She added: ldquoThis year, of all years, we were lucky the championship even went ahead. To go from that position, to be sitting here now talking to people as an All-Ireland champion, well it just doesnrsquot get much better to be honest with you..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th December 2020 A team.jpg","title":"A team effort%2C says Niamh  ","story":"DOWNrsquoS Niamh Mallon has paid tribute to everyone in the successful camogie camp after they were crowned All-Ireland champions.Derek Dunnersquos side swept aside the challenge of Antrim in Saturdayrsquos showpiece in Cavan to clinch the Intermediate title for the first time since .The Portaferry player said the win had been a long time in coming with the final win secured by a group of players who have been together for almost a decade.ldquoWe have been on the road and this journey together for a long time, said Niamh. ldquoI suppose it hurt in the past couple of years how we came so close, but just couldnrsquot quite get the title. But after that hurt, I suppose the big thing now is relief.The win was the crowning of an unforgettable journey for Down camogs, led by their manager and Laois native Dunne, with Niamh explaining that it has been a year they will never forget.ldquoItrsquos a big win for all of us as iniduals but it was all about doing it for Down, said Niamh, playing down the crucial role she played in scoring two girls to propel her side to the coveted title.ldquoFor the two goals I was in the right place at the right time, she said. ldquoWe worked all week on how we would be able to get on top of Antrim. We knew they were young and a bit inexperienced, but a seriously talented team.ldquoWe knew we could not afford to let them into their stride but, I suppose, in that first half we were guilty of letting them do that a little bit. At half-time, it was about getting in, regrouping and we really drove home the game-plan and swamped the middle third of the pitch.Niamh said she and her team-mates were convinced that once they were able to open up a gap it could prove too much for the fledgling Antrim side to overcome.ldquoThat is what we hoped, she continued. ldquoIn many ways, we have been hurt by our results at this stage in the past, but it also does make you stronger and the experience we gained from the past undoubtedly was a help going into this final.ldquoThat was something we knew we had over Antrim and had to use to our advantage. We knew once we got that little edge on them on the scoreboard, we were on our way to the win.With the title secured, the Down camp can look forward to some well-earned rest and reflection over the Christmas period with Niamh admitting for a iety of reasons that it will be a year that will be impossible to forget.ldquoWithout any doubt it has been a mad year but,you know the Down camogie set-up, yoursquoll know we never do anything by half. Winning in  in a pandemic is just like us. Itrsquos great to get over the line with the win and great to get our hands on the title. We will enjoy this one for sure, she said.Having joined the squad as a gted -year-old in , Niamh has endured junior final reverses disappointment in  and  along with a number of her teammates, admitting that after knocking on the door it was terric to finally lt the title.She continued: ldquoWe won the junior title in  and a lot of girls then stepped away. We regrouped then in  and  and changed our approach this year. We didnrsquot look at the bigger picture and took it game by game. Obviously with the restructure after the pandemic you had to adapt and go again and we did and wersquore just delighted.Niamhrsquos scars of battle are very evident with a cut on the nose but the Portaferry sharpshooter is understandably unconcerned. She has spent more time in deeper roles this year, making her harder to pick up when drting inside to often stunning effect.This was evidenced on Saturday with - of her tally of - from play arriving within six minutes of Maeve Kellyrsquos magnicent th minute goal that gave Antrim the lead. That speaks of a big-game player, but Mallon reiterates her managerrsquos assertion that this a truly collective achievement.Modestly, Niamh doesnrsquot mention herself in her checklist of those the team used to lean too heavily upon, acknowledging the privilege of being allowed to congregate and socialise as elite sportspeople in the midst of COVID- when many are confined to their quarters.Niamh added: ldquoDown is no longer reliant on Sara-Louise Carr [Graffin], Fionnuala Carr and Karen McMullan ndash itrsquos an overall effort from  to  with the title win coming straight from the training ground.ldquoItrsquos been massively enjoyable and I have been based from home since the pandemic struck. From a camogie playing perspective itrsquos been great. Irsquove just been around home and able to train.ldquoWe havenrsquot taken for granted the situation we found ourselves in. We have been massively privileged as a lot of people have not had the opportunity to socialise like we did over the past couple of months.

Mr Bidenrsquos links with the area are very recent and local.Cllr Brown said Mr Bidenrsquos great, great grandfather Patrick Blewett left Mayo in  to become a sailor in the USA, settling in Scrampton, Pennsylvania, while his great grandfather, James Finnegan, arrived in New York in the late s after travelling from Warrenpoint.He added: ldquoWhile Mr Biden visited Ireland as recently as , there is every reason why Ireland and the UK would be top of his travel list when circumstances allow. Mr Biden has unwavering support for the peace process, given the instrumental role his party played in bringing it together.ldquoWhat better place for the incoming president to visit than our district to trace his ancestral routes in Louth, visit the port his family emigrated from and see the resting place of St Patrick in Downpatrick.SDLP councillor Gary Stokes said the man who will become the th US president ldquoclearlyvalues his Irish heritage and believes thatthe local authority works alongside Louth County Council, there is a better chance of him visiting the Newry, Mourne and Down area.The DUPrsquos Glyn Hanna suggested that the incoming president had made himself a ldquoisive character with his ill-advised remarks about Orange and Green.He also argued that a man who has spent  years in politics was either badly briefed or totally ignorant of the situation in Northern Ireland, given his remarks which he should apologise for.Cllr Hanna added: ldquoMr Biden should stop looking through his Irish American tinted glasses and see the reality of the situation that there will not be a united Ireland without the consent of the people of Northern Ireland. I would suggest that he is reminded of this.UUP councillor David Taylor said the motion ldquotook the local authority into US politics which it had never done before, arguing that itrsquo was not a unorm view that everyone welcomed Bidenrsquos victory.ldquoThe incoming president and his vice-president are more than welcome in Northern Ireland at any time. The leader of the free world should be more than welcome to come here which could be beneficial from an investment point of view, he said.ldquoWe acknowledge Mr Bidenrsquos ancestral links to the area and it is not the case that we donrsquot welcome any US president.Sinn Feinrsquos Declan Murphy said that while he understood where his unionist colleagues were coming from, he did not necessarily agree with them.He said he was not supporting the motion for sentimental reasons, explaining it is primarily an opportunity for the island of Ireland to access the White House and to provide more leverage, as it has done in the past, when it comes to dealing with some dficult issues including legacy which politicians here have found it dficult to sort out.Cllr Murphy said he believes that Mr Bidenrsquos election provided ldquogreat opportunities for investment, particularly given the uncertain times ahead as a result of Brexit, adding: We are going to need all the support we can possibly get..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th December 2020 Boost.jpg","title":"Boost for Dunleath development plans  ","story":"AMBITIOUS plans to redevelop Dunleath Park in Downpatrick as a centre of sporting excellence have taken a step forward.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council committee is to examine the proposal and is being encouraged to establish a project board to take the development further and unlock the facilityrsquos full potential.At Monday nightrsquos monthly meeting of the local authority, a proposal calling for the revitalisation of the huge sports facility was referred to the councilrsquos Active and Healthy Communities Committee for further debate and analysis.Politicians are being asked to establish a development plan that will include cycling and walking trails, the provision of new sensory gardens and upgrading existing sports pitches.The suggested project board mdash comprising council officials and Downpatrick area councillors mdash is expected to focus on all options, including the potential for a new G pitch and so-called bubble facility to allow outdoor tennis to continue in all weathers.Dunleath Park has been at the heart of local sport for many decades catering for soccer, gaelic football and hockey, but little cash has been spent on it, apart from annual maintenance costs.This week, three local politicians have called for the park, which is adjacent to Downpatrickrsquos poundm ultra-modern leisure centre, to be developed as a centre of sporting excellence, insisting that the work is regarded as a priority.Cllrs John Trainor, Gareth Sharvin and Dermot Curran say they recognise Dunleathrsquos potential has been lying untapped for too long, with the trio delighted that the future of the facility has now been formally included on the local authorityrsquos agenda.On Monday night, Cllr Trainor said he was delighted that the proposal for a project board to progress the development of Dunleath Park for sporting excellence, health and wellbeing and recreation was to be discussed by the Active and Healthy Communities Committee.ldquoThis is an essential next step in the development of Dunleath and Gareth, Dermot and I are incredibly proud to lead from the front here. Dunleath Park offers much potential which must be realised, he added.Cllr Sharvin said that given that the council had committed to the proposed development being included on its agenda, it was vital that a project board was appointed to focus on the development and identy key projects for Dunleath.He said local councillors appreciated the potential redevelopment of Dunleath Park has for Downpatrick and the importance of the site for sport in the area, particularly for the Downpatrick Youth Football League and several senior clubs who use the pitches.ldquoThere can be no question that this project board must be led by Downpatrick councillors, insisted Cllr Sharvin.ldquoWe were elected by the people of this area to represent them on council and that is exactly what we have been doing and will continue to do through this board.Cllr Curran cautioned that plans to redevelop Dunleath Park would not happen overnight as there were a number of obstacles that need to overcome.ldquoWe recognise the need for flood assessment for this location but are confident that there are local wins for the community to be had in the short term, he continued.ldquoThere is no reason why we could not develop a walking and cycling path around Dunleath while plans for the larger development continue.

She was a key figure in Downrsquos success.The Portaferry ace claimed two goals and three points from play, and was a key figure in Downrsquos success.Down had too much firepower for Antrim, with Sara-Louise Graffin proving a very influential foil to Mallon. The likes of Sorcha McCartan, Lauren Clarke and Aimee McAleenan were selfless in their toil.Further back, Graffinrsquos sister Fionnuala Carr thundered into the fray in the last ten minutes of the first half.The -year-old marked her  years of representing Down at adult level in stirring fashion alongside fellow co-captain Karen McMullan.Former dual star McMullan was in Australia when Down lost the  final. However, she ed after three years away last term, when the Mourne women fell short by a point at the penultimate hurdle to subsequent victors Westmeath.They would not be denied this time around though, despite the shock of conceding a goal after less than  seconds.It took five minutes for Derek Dunnersquos side to regain their composure, but they were in front by the th minute after Mallon, McAleenan, Paula OrsquoHagan and Graffin all raised white flags.Antrimy hit four of the next five scores to establish a two-point advantage that could have been even greater had Catrine Dobbin not just dragged her ground shot wide with Catherine McGourty coming out quickly to narrow the angle.The Down response was notable. Three points came, including a wonderful effort by McCartan. Then, after Nicole OrsquoNeill pointed a free at the other end, Graffin hit the net with a goal in the third minute of first-half injury time. She showed tremendous strength to make space and finish in trademark fashion after brilliant play out wide by Clarke.That made it - to - at the interval but Paul McKillen got the ideal response from his Antrim team.Dobbin pointed early in the second half before Kelly drilled a fantastic goal home in the th minute.The -year-old took a shoulder from Dearbhla Magee with ease before unleashing a shot that was just too strong for Downrsquos custodian McGourty to repel.Drain denied McAleenan a quick riposte, but it came shortly after as Mallonrsquos piledriver ed her side to the lead. She followed up with a point, as did OrsquoHagan from a free.When Mallon concluded some deft footwork with a resounding finish after Clarke had done tremendously well to win possession, the writing was on the wall for Antrim.They continued to battle, but Down were dominant in too many sectors now.Their know-how shone through as they ensured that there would be no goals conceded, unafraid to relinquish frees to that end. OrsquoNeill converted a few but as time ran out, major scores were required.In the end, it was Clarke who raised the gamersquos final green flag, a fair reward for her tireless efforts.There could be no doubt about the merit of Downrsquos win however. They had done it at last, and the final whistle brought their celebrations.Down: C McGourty, C Caldwell, D Magee, D Harrison, K McMullan, F Carr, B Fitzpatrick, A Keown, P OrsquoHagan , S McCartan , S L Graffin , N Mallon , C Cowen, L Clarke , A McAleenan .Subs: C Rocks for Fitzpatrick , C Fitzpatrick for Cowen , I OrsquoHare for Clarke .Antrim: E Boyle, C Patterson, C Drain, C Conlon, N Donnelly, M Connolly, A Boyle, E Laverty, L McNaughton, Christine Laverty, M Kelly , C Dobbin , R McCormick , Ciara Laverty, N OrsquoNeill .

Please note that recycling bins containing wrong materials will not be collected.Workers manned pickets outside Downshire Civic Centre and the councilrsquos Strangford Road depot in Downpatrick and at sites in Newry.Administrative workers also joined in the strike and did not process any new applications for wedding or burials received that day.GMB regional organiser Alan Perry this week described the strike and its impact on ratepayers as ldquoregrettable but stressed that workers remained determined.He said: ldquoThe strike was highly successful but also highly regrettable that we have got into that situation where members have to take to the street.lsquoWe believe we can get a resolution but it takes management to engage with us. Our members are very much resolute and are quite prepared to take further days of actionrequired.Last night a council spokesperson said: Talks between Newry, Mourne and Down District Council and the joint trade unions, conciliated by the Labour Relations Agency are currently ongoing. Therefore, no further comment can be provided at this time.The strike went ahead despite the councilrsquos offer to increase pay scale of refuse workers employed by the former Down District Council to match those employed by the former Newry and Mourne District Council area.However, in a joint trade union side statement, GMB, Unite, NIPSA and SIPTU representatives laid the blame for the ldquoavoidable industrial dispute at the feet of council management.The statement said: ldquoThe trade unions engaged with the council management team in last minute and intense talks mediated by the Labour Relations Agency to seek a resolution to this dispute.ldquoWhile some progress was made in relation to job evaluation, job deions and a timetable for the completion of the negotiations, we failed to secure what was needed in relation to pay equality.ldquoThe point in contention is that for those workers whose pay grades are re-evaluated upwards, they will lose all pay progression accrued and will start at the bottom of the new grades.A statement issued last week by the council refuted that management had failed to engage and said it had met with trade unions, conciliated by the Labour Relations Agency , several times last month.It said that management presented proposals to the trade unions which would mean all refuse collection employees being employed on the same pay grades.It added: ldquoUnder the proposals, refuse workers in the former Down District Council area would increase to pay scales matching those in the former Newry and Mourne District Council area. Acceptance of these proposals could see wages for refuse workers in Downpatrick increasing from December , which has since been ratied.ldquoThe councilrsquos management also agreed to negotiate on additional payments to refuse employees in both Newry and Downpatrick for implementation of new Refuse Operating Procedures and associated practices, which would standardise working practices across the entire district. Pending negotiated agreement, existing practices and associated payments will remain unchanged.The council said that while it regretted that the trade unions were unwilling to call off the strike, it respected the right to take industrial action.The statement ended: ldquoNewry, Mourne and Down District Council remains fully committed to resolving this dispute, to ensuring fair pay, transparency and equality for all its employees and to delivering value for money for all rate payers in the Council area, especially at a time when many are experiencing signicant financial hardship.ldquoThe

She has been cancer free now for around a year, the -year old revealed.ldquoSeeing her, and what she has come through, has encouraged me though to keep going with things. My wonderful mum is an inspiration to me and all of our family. She has fought the disease, and had a lot of treatment and has just done so, so well.Four years ago, at the Rio Paralympics, Bethany made her mark on the world stage. A series of superb displays saw her take home three gold medals and one silver. She would become Team GBrsquos most decorated athlete of the Games.In , whilst competing for Ireland in her first Paralympics, Bethany won a gold medal at the Games in London in the S  metres backstroke final. At that stage, Bethany had been swimming for only three years. She went on to win three silver medals at the  IPC Swimming World Championships.It remains to be seen whether Bethanyrsquos family will be able to go to Tokyo next year to cheer her on, just as they did in Brazil.ldquoI would love my family to be there, Bethany admitted. ldquoI remember each time before I swam in Rio, they would tell me where they were seated and I would look across and could see them. It was like that important piece of comfort because I was so far away from home.ldquoWhen you see them, it is such a great support. My family are so good. At the moment, we donrsquot knowany spectators will be at the events. Right now, we are just hoping that the Games will go ahead.ldquoIf they take place without spectators it will be hard, but at least we will be able to compete. I was in Japan in January and got to sample what the country is like out there. That has made me even hungrier to be there next year.ldquoThe facilities werenrsquot completely built, but we saw where the athletesrsquo village would be and it looked great. Japan is an amazing country with an amazing culture and I would want to be there to represent myself and my country.Should Bethany claim more medals, it would only cement her already-assured status as one of the great Paralympians.Having to wait the extra year for the Games, due to the spread of coronavirus has, however, brought its own dficulties.ldquoWhen I heard earlier this year, that the Games had been called off, it was very hard to take because it is something that you are working towards for four years, she said.ldquoWe do other competitions of course in between though they are never as big as the Paralympics.ldquoHowever to be told they were postponed was really challenging.You have to look at the positives though.ldquoIt has given me an extra year to train and to prepare. Training was probably the hardest thing.ldquoObviously, the pools closed at the start of lockdown, so it meant Ibasically had to go out into a paddling pool in my back garden and I was on a bungee chord to get a feel for the water.ldquoSport NI and the Sports Institute Northern Ireland made up a good programme of daily things to do, so I was on the bike and running. Irsquom definitely more of a pool girl, but I canrsquot run to save my le, she joked.ldquoIt was nearly the end of the first lockdown when we were allowed to train and I had to travel to Dublin three times a week.ldquoI am now training in Ards because, thankfully, elite athletes have been allowed to train here, which is a big positive.Asthose challenges were not enough, Bethany has also been on the road to recovery from injury.ldquoI had a shoulder problem, and had to go and get that injected, so that put me out of the water for a bit a few weeks ago. But I am back in now and building the work back up.ldquoMy team and I have also looked at other areas of sport science to try and help me improve, such as tracking my sleep and making sure I am always recovered between sessions.ldquoThe British trials will be held in April and that is the main event I am focusing on at the moment. In total, I could do up to six events , but I donrsquot think I will do that many. I will definitely do four, but I am not sure about the others.ldquoI have such a love for swimming and I am really excited for the Games. Hopefully I can regain some of my titles and perform strongly again.Speaking about her link-up withthe Lidl Sport for Good programme, she said: ldquoWhat Lidl are doing is fantastic. They are giving  secondary schools pound, worth of sports equipment. It is an amazing idea to get people into sport. There are so many physical and mental benefits that come from it.ldquoIt is something that benefits the whole community, and sport can make such a positive impact on peoplersquos lives.ldquoAfter the year we have had with lockdown, and people being apart, sport can undoubtedly bring people together, and I am delighted to be able to be a part of that..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/12125047.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Panels along Bangors Brompton Road siteIn a unique collaboration between Bangor’s Seaside Revival Vintage festival, a small team of local historians and NI Water, the safety hoardings around both construction sites have been hung with an exclusive exhibition of old photographs and postcards. Each image is historically signicant to the area, compiled, researched and outlined on the hoardings, and on the project website, by local historian Robin Masefield, with contributions from Betty Armstrong, Ian Wilson and North Down Museum.Some of the main topics were introduced here last week - the Ladies Diving Board at Skippingstone Jenny Watt’s Cove the old Malayan-style Bungalow Tea House at Stricklands Glen the Girl’s Home of Rest at Brompton Road and the former all-Ireland ing champion and first ever Ladies Captain of Carnalea Golf Club, Marguerite Absolum McMurry.

But it won’t be neglected, particularly in these trying times when it’s safer to meet up,you must, in the open.“Just a snf of Bangor air makes you frisky, young and fair,” the old  postcard proudly proclaims.Robin Masefield particularly likes its message, amongst a number of old Bangor postcards on the hoardings. He told me that the note written on the back of the card reads “it’s a pity you weren’t here to get a snf of this air. I have tried it and it is grand!”\"Desertmartin Parish ChurchFrom Bangor’s fresh sea breezes to the invigorating country air of Desertmartin, at the foot of Slieve Gallion in County Londonderry.“The year  should have been the year that Desertmartin Parish Church celebrated the th anniversary of the opening of the current church building,” Honorary Church Secretary Sam Hudson’s email began, adding sadly “the Select Vestry had a series of events planned but Covid- put paid to all of those.”Sam’s note continued “However, during lockdown John Woodward, a churchwarden, has written a book of poems and reflections, with photographs of the church.” The  page book is in full colour and “it’s great,” said Sam “once you start reading it’s very hard to put it down!” It costs £ “and will make an ideal Christmas gt,” he added “and all proceeds go to Parish funds.”He included an outline history of the church in his email, and several of John Woodward’s poems, one opening with the evocatively seasonal lines:Our lovely wee Church lies quiet and still,On this cold Winter’s morn at the top of the hill,Christmas is near, there’s a chill in the air,There’s a frost on the grass but the sky’s blue and fair. Desertmartin Parish Church boasts a long and fascinating history. The present church was built in the townland of Dromore in . A loan of £ was obtained from the Board of First Fruitsto finance its construction.Down the years many alterations and additions have been made. In  it was enlarged at the Drapers Company’s expense in  the gallery was removed and in  the Venerable E.J. Hamilton placed reredosin the chancel. In  the Select Vestry resolved to carry out all the expensive improvements ‘deemed necessary to make the church worthy of its sacred purpose.’Old wall plaster was replaced with ‘handsome wainscoting’ and pine moulding, and new floors and tiles were laid. The heating was overhauled, expensive brass oil lamps were donated and hung from the ceiling, and the pulpit was raised and much improved.The church was regarded as “one of the most handsome in the Diocese.”In  tilly lamps replaced the oil lamps electric light was installed in  and the original brass lamps of  were incorporated in the electric system.The church porch was also renovated in , the church roof was repaired in  and a stained glass east window was presented in .

The choice was certainly bold – glamping in December.The rural location she found advertised a Christmas-themed event with sparkling lights, open fires, crafts, reindeer food, marshmallows, hot chocolate and mulled wine. The children were intoxicated with excitement, the adults not far behind.It rained the night before we left. As I packed a bag, I considered how much of the success of the venture lay outside of our control. Going glamping just days before the winter solstice was a risk. A wet and windy day would signicantly curtail our ambitions. As I folded my underwear, I watched drops of rain roll down the window.Saturday is dferent. The watery red sun, while low in a cloudless sky, is determined and fierce. There is barely a breath of wind.We find the glamping pods at the end of a warren of puddle-pocked lanes deep in the countryside. The little huts surround a squelchy patch of grass. We are the only people on the site and the children love it, dashing excitedly from shed to shed, too animated to concentrate on any activity for long.The boys spend hours running around in the midwinter air until they are breathless. They play football and tennis, compete in races and chase each other, indulging fully the freedom and the novelty.A fire is quickly built. My son and two nephews toast marshmallows, the grown-ups having to slightly temper their enthusiasm lest they should bite into the soft mallow while it is still bubbling hot. The gooey melted insides of the sweets bring gasps of delight and leave pink and white trails running down chins.The lower the sun sinks, the higher we build the fire and the closer the adults huddle around it. Pizzas are ordered, delivered and devoured, with the enhanced appetite that being in the open air brings.Then, once the darkness of the night is absolute, we appoint ourselves expert astronomers. None of the children, all reared in a world of streetlights and urban settlement, have ever seen the stars in such numbers or majesty, a vast carpet of twinkling and shimmering orbs. Little necks risk being strained from gazing upwards for too long. We proclaim that we see Venus, Mars, The Plough, Betelgeuse, Santa doing a test run in his sleigh, The Big Dipper. Perhaps we did.The night remains still and dry and we explore further the area by torchlight, stumbling along country lanes while urging the little ones to keep their hats and gloves on and their coats zipped as our breath forms clouds in front of us.The evening grows colder yet and my previous policy of rationing fuel for the fire is abandoned as I load it high with the remaining logs. The adults, with the stench of smoke on our hair and clothes, drink wine and beerwhile the children retreat inside to play with their iPads. We murmur to each other about our remarkable luck with the weather.The lure of being outside soon brings the boys into the open air again. They ask me to play with them and a game is hastily improvised where they are wild animals and I, the hunter.By the glare of the torch I chase the three boys around the damp field in the dark, reluctantly at first, and then with enthusiasm as the simple joy of the game affects me. The kids whoop in fear and excitement each time I get close and the long, wet grass snakes around my ankles and soaks my toes.We play this game for a long time. When we begin the flames from the fire are still reaching into the darkness by its conclusion, all that is left in the pit are some leless grey ashes.Eventually, against the reluctant protests of the indefatigable youths, we retreat to our separate pods, remarking on how special the day has been, and again on our outrageous luck with the weather. We agree a departure time for the morning.Our hut is cold and the little electric heater too feeble to make a dference.The three of us cuddle into bed together. I, for the first time in my adult le, wear socks in bed. As we all drt towards sleep I hear my boy mumbling to his mum about it being the ‘best day ever’.I wake later. At first I think it must be morning but when I check my phone I see that it has only just passed midnight.All is still at first. But then I hear a rustle of leaves. The wind soon gathers pace, howling as it blows around trees and through hedges. Shortly after, a patter of raindrops begins on the roof. It is gentle at first, but then develops into an urgent rush of falling fat drops. The shower seems to go on for hours.And I lie there awake throughout it all, in the cold little wooden shed in the middle of a muddy field, listening to my we and son’s contented snores beside me while the fingers of the rain tap persistently and impatiently on the roof.A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis morning it was announced the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agencyhad authorised the first vaccine as safe and effective on the basis of detailed independent expert review of evidence from large scale clinical trials.The Pfizer Biontech vaccine has become the first to receive MHRA clearance in the UK and  million doses of the vaccine will shortly be available for delivery across the UK, with Wales getting its allocation based on population.Approval from the MHRA is the first step of Walesrsquo roll-out plan, which has seen preparations on-going since May.There are still a number of stages which need to happen before the vaccine reaches those in highest need and is ready for use, but this process is expected to happen over the next week.These stages includeThe Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisationfinalising and publishing their guidance for the whole of the UKFinalising training materials for staff and patient information leafletsTraining of experienced immunisers for this particular vaccineFinal legal frameworks to allow registered health professionals to administer the vaccine to patients need to be authorised by each Health Board in Wales.The vaccine - which needs to be administered in two doses - will initially be prioritised and available for those aged  and over, care home staff and residents and those working within health and social care.As further supplies become available and additional vaccines receive MHRA approval, a staged approach will see other groups offered the vaccine, based on risk of serious complications and deaths.Iniduals in the priority groups for a Covid- vaccine will receive an invitation from their employer or health board, providing information about the vaccines, telling them where to go and what to do on the day of their appointment.People are urged to wait to be invited, and not to ask their pharmacist or GP.The chief medical officer for Wales, Dr Frank Atherton, said: ldquoIt is fantastic to finally say that the first Covid- vaccine has been given the green light.\"We know now that we have a safe and effective vaccine for use across the UK - this is the positive news I and so many across the country have been waiting for.ldquoAll our NHS organisations across Wales have embraced the challenge presented to them and are at the advanced stages of planning for the arrival of a vaccine.\"We have tested distribution and storage arrangements to ensure we can get vaccine safely to every part of Wales.ldquoTherersquos still a few stages we need to work through but once all these safeguards are in place, vaccination can begin.\"There will only be relatively small amounts of the vaccine at first, those who have been advised as most needing the vaccine first, through approved delivery mechanisms.\"A full announcement around the timetable for roll-out in Wales will follow in the next few days.The effects of the vaccine may not be seen nationally for many months and the advice on keeping Wales safe remains the same for everyone, warned the first minister.Mark Drakeford said: \"Todayrsquos news is a small glimmer of light at the end of what has been a long and dark tunnel.ldquoWe know some people within our communities are much more at risk than others from the serious complications of Covid-, which is why the new vaccine is being prioritised to protect them first.ldquoWhilst these first doses are given at fixed sites and occupational settings, and to protect our NHS and social care services, we must all continue to do our bit to prevent the spread of coronavirus: regular hand washing, social distancing, and wearing a face covering where required to protect yourself and others.Pfizer Biontech vaccine needs to be stored at ultra-low temperatures. These centres have already been decided by health boards and are in the process of being prepared.The development process for coronavirus vaccines has been as stringent as any other but the process in the face of the pandemic has been sped up by prompt, world-wide funding and a reduction in paperwork.Theof the trials have not been shortened, and the usual safety measures remain in place.The vaccine will not be mandatory and people will be able to choose whether they take up the vaccine or not.Information will be provided to people before vaccination to reassure them about patient safety and robust consent processes will be in place.Vice-chairman of the Covid- Vaccine Programme Board, Richard Roberts from Public Health Wales, said: ldquoIt is a signicant achievement that only  months after WHOannounced the global pandemic that we now have the first safe and effective vaccine available for use in Wales, and other vaccines to follow.\"Everyone has been preparing for months to deliver the Covid- vaccine programme, and it is very exciting that we will be able to begin, once the final steps have been put in place so that the programme can be delivered safely. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I wouldnrsquot be surprised to see a spike in cases as a result of this decision.All pub and bar owners that spoke to the Penarth Times said they are concerned about what happens after the next review on December , with the majority saying they do not believe pubs will be able to serve alcohol until January.Health minister Vaughan Gething said he understood why companies in the industry are upset, but admitted there is \"no perfect balance\" between protecting public health and businesses.Health minister Vaughan GethingBut Brains CEO Alistair Darby told the Penarth Times he feels the government has got the balance wrong.Brains pubs including the Windsor and the Star Inn in Dinas Powys will close on Friday.ldquo, people have come through our doors since the start of the pandemic ndash seven staff members have tested positive in that time and test and trace have contacted us five times, said Mr Darby.ldquoI wonrsquot question the science behind the government decision, but it seems to me wersquove shown what wersquove done has worked.ldquoWersquove worked tirelessly to make sure people are as safe as possible in our pubs, and people have been safe. Our findings show that.ldquoThe scarring effect this will have on the economy will be brutal and long drawn out. We have already been operating at a  per cent deficit compared to .ldquoWersquore a business that is well run, looks after its workers, pays its taxes and contributes a lot to the economy to support the NHS.ldquoIrsquom aware there has to be a balance. But itrsquos imperative we donrsquot crush our economy in the process. I think this time that balance has not been achieved.John Bassett, who owns The Golden Lion on Glebe Street which will also be closed, said: ldquoAre they going to say we can open for Christmas after this  Irsquod be surprised.John BassettldquoIrsquom resigned to an awful period financially ndash my only focus now is to try and keep all  of my staff. I havenrsquot laid any of my staff off yet, and donrsquot intend to, but this is really becoming testing for us now.ldquoYet again we received hardly any notice before this comes into effect. I would question how the whole industry has been treated throughout this period.ldquoMark Drakeford says he talks to stakeholders ndash yet I know nobody who has ever had a conversation with a representative of the Welsh Government on this issue.Natasha Rees, new landlady at St Fagans on Windsor Road, has worked tirelessly since she took the pub over in the autumn to make it a family friendly place.

Better for them to be in school.\"But there was pressure from teaching unions for a sht in position.The National Association of Headteachers Cymruwrote to the minister for education, Kirsty Williams, to call for the closure of schools ahead of the Christmas holiday.They said: ldquoParents will undoubtedly vote with their feet and children will be kept at home.\"That choice will not be afforded to school staffschool leaders are not supported in closing school sites.\"No direction from the government on this issue risks large numbers of families making their own decision to take children out of school and once again will result in a mixed economy across Wales, with local authorities making their own decisions based on local circumstances. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Shops, hairdressers, restaurants, places of worship and hotels are among the places that will be able to re-open from December . Pubs selling drink onlywill remain closed and an additional financial package will be put in place. The Executive has also agreed Christmas household bubbling arrangements from December -. Three households will be able to come together for this period in domestic settings, outdoor public spaces and places of worship. One of the households will be able to include their existing household bubble. First Minister Arlene Foster said: “Through our collective efforts over recent weeks we gained enough space in the transmission of the virus to relax a signicant number of restrictions, including the opening-up of non-essential retail, close contact services, sport and leisure activities and our places of worship at the end of next week. “These decisions will give families, businesses and employees some much-needed certainty and comfort in the run-up to Christmas and beyond. “This is a special time of the year and we want to support people to have a good Christmas, but also a safe one. “Signicant work has been completed with business sectors, faith groups, local government and police on new mitigation measures to reduce the risk of transmission. “I urge everyone to be Covid-aware and to make careful and sensible decisions when out and about or mixing with others. We need to make sure we continue doing all we can to protect ourselves and our loved ones.” Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill said: “The Executive wants to give people as much notice as possible on what the situation will look like from next Friday when the current circuit breaker comes to an end. “We have given detailed consideration to which restrictions need tobe maintained, and what we can open up, in light of the scientic and medical advice. “A package of measures that will see signicant relaxations to the current restrictions has been agreed, with maximum mitigations in place to minimise risks to the greatest extent possible. An additional support package will be put in place for traditional drink-only pubs that unfortunately will not be able to reopen at this time. “We appreciate how important Christmas time is for many families and the Executive has agreed arrangements that will allow families and friends to come together in a limited way between  and  December. “It’s important for people to understand that with any increased contact comes increased risk. Everyone needs to think very carefully about the risks posed to them, and their loved ones, by coming together over the Christmas period, particularly to those who are vulnerable. Some may choose not to form a Christmas bubble but for those who do, we encourage them to keep their bubbles small and limit the numbers of people gathering, as much as possible.”  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_befbdbadbbbbca   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_bbefaabbaebfccfde   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
