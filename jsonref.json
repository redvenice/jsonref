Can you see it?”Of course I can’t see it. My head is filled with all things apple the central concept connects with myriad associated topics: orchards, trees, red apples, rotting apples, cider, blossom, an endless web that spreads along more and more tenuous connections. But of course I can’t see it. I usually say yes, though, because I assume it’s a figure of speech.Then a year ago, I read an article online about aphantasia and all at once I understood that pretty much everyone visualised their thoughts all the time!That was a shock. I understood the concept. Like the large majority of aphantasics I see pictures when I dream. (Dreaming comes from a different part of the mind.) But it sounded like great fun to be able to summon moving images to the mind. I felt suddenly robbed, as if I had missed out on some universal treat. And that’s how the language frames it – you “suffer” from aphantasia. A swift Googling gives us this description: “Aphantasia is neurological defect that affects the brain without any serious health risks.” A defect. Well … damn.People I tell are amazed. They want to know how I even function, how I imagine anything. There’s a distinct vibe of pity. I have a severely disabled daughter, so I in no way want to overplay this card – I know what disability is – but, in some sense, I felt momentarily that I was disabled, that I lacked a significant ability that I should have had.I’ve discovered since that there are people who don’t hear an inner voice. At this point I shared the incredulity others experience regarding aphantasia. It’s hard for me to imagine life without an internal voice. I also discovered that some people have other internal senses, such being able to smell, touch and taste in their minds. I can’t do those things either.I don’t have a problem with imagination. I write books that are often praised for clear and evocative visual description. I’m asked by people if I’ve climbed rock faces, fought with swords or even had cancer, because my descriptions of these experiences have convinced people who have actually lived them that I must have, too. (I haven’t.)It’s very hard to know if aphantasia has an impact on my writing. I tend to avoid lengthy visual description, but I feel that’s a matter of taste. I’m currently going over a forthcoming book with my editor, who uses the “praise sandwich” to feed criticism past the author’s ego. So she takes the time to compliment lines she admires, such as this one:Wings rose above the holothaur’s back, a black suggestion of flight, reaching to the vaulted ceiling to merge with the shadows there.Now this is a wraithlike creature, so harping on about veined leathery wings or midnight feathers or whatever wouldn’t be appropriate. But I guess I do tend to stretch the language in a manner that brushes against poetry, such as in “a black suggestion of flight”, which focuses on a feeling, rather than specific physical details.These days, I reject the description of aphantasia as a defect. I see it as an alternative. You see a horse if asked to imagine one. I find this rather limiting. I imagine a web of horse-stuff that leads me down many paths. The idea of seeing one particular horse actually lacks appeal. What if it’s not the horse I want? What if I want something larger, more fundamental than an image? From the outside all we see are results the interior workings are hidden. The idea that the qualitative experience behind each inidual’s existence can be so different is a new and fascinating one. I suspect that we have much to learn about quite how unique each of us is in the handcrafted virtual reality we all maintain behind our eyes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a15f19c4b0f69825ee6ba82ff4ea3eee2c149ca5/0_164_5025_3014/master/5025.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cd56b2145cac24803d22028853724008","title":"british american tobacco plant based coronavirus vaccine","story":"Cigarette maker says tobacco plants offer potential for faster and safer drug developmentBritish American Tobacco, the maker of brands including Lucky Strike, Dunhill, Rothmans and Benson \u0026amp Hedges, has said it has a potential coronavirus vaccine in development using tobacco plants.BAT has turned the vast resources usually focused on creating products that pose health risks to millions of smokers worldwide to battling the global pandemic.Government to back £330bn of loans to support businesses through a Bank of England scheme for big firms.

One such alternative use is the development of plant-based vaccines.”BAT said it had cloned a portion of the genetic sequence of the coronavirus and developed a potential antigen. The antigen was then inserted into tobacco plants for reproduction and, once the plants were harvested, the antigen was purified. It is now undergoing pre-clinical testing.The tobacco firm is more typically on the receiving end of criticism from campaigning groups, including the use young and attractive models to entice younger demographics to try e-cigarettes and vaping technology."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b0b15be7aa98927a12bdf52f35c16466a37eb57/0_200_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dcaaef91784ff247ab9f5e641e4a3152","title":"lengthy lockdown unrealistic says former bank of england governor","story":"Offer self-employed swifter help, Mervyn King says, and consider a Covid-19 lockdown exit planMervyn King, the governor of the Bank of England at the time of the 2008 global financial crisis, has warned that an indefinite Covid-19 lockdown is unrealistic and ministers need to work on an exit strategy.Lord King said he understood the reasons for quarantining most of the population, but that there would be a backlash if the restrictions were kept in place for too long.Speaking at a webinar organised by the Policy Exchange thinktank, King said: “The idea that you can have a lockdown that goes on for months on end is unrealistic. The government needs an exit strategy, which may be gradual and initially involve those who have had the virus and are able to travel and go back to work. If we have a lockdown for too long there will be a rebellion against it.”King said it was pointless to speculate on the extent of the health and economic damage caused by the crisis, but emphasised that there would be significant costs in terms of failed businesses, lost jobs and increased unhappiness.“It is understandable that health officials focus on the broad-brush aspect of this – the need for a lockdown to diminish the spread of the virus,” he said.Government to back £330bn of loans to support businesses through a Bank of England scheme for big firms.

Small firms can claim for state refunds on sick pay bills.Local authorities to get a £500m hardship fund to provide people with council tax payment relief.Mortgage and rental holidays available for up to three months.But the former Bank governor said it was also important to think about the mental health of people being made unemployed, or whose businesses were going bust.“There are people struggling to get out to buy food and who are stuck on their own. Young people are having their university education and school exams cancelled, and that it is going to have a significant impact of their wellbeing and future careers.”King added the government had made a deliberate decision to lock down the economy and so had a responsibility to ensure cash flow to businesses big and small, and to act as the customer of last resort.The Treasury needed to speed up its plan to offer financial help to the self-employed because the target date of early June would be too late for many, he said.Alistair Darling, the chancellor responsible for bailing out stricken banks at the beginning of the 2008 crisis, said the government was failing to provide a consistent message on testing for Covid-19.“It is critical in any crisis that the message has clarity”, Darling said. “At the moment we don’t know whether the government is going beyond NHS staff to the public as a whole. Unless we know who has got it or who has had it, we are always going to be on the back foot.”Darling also said the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, needed to make sure measures were having an impact where they were needed.“It is very easy to announce a policy, but much more difficult to get it delivered. The economic measures are absolutely vital, but for the self-employed delivery is going to take longer than people have got in many cases.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a50c45e36cb168a78688f44fe69cdac7aff6de11/0_116_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=536168f9100de857e85fb5215d0fc10e","title":"markets covid 19 recession factories uk banks cancel dividends coronavirus business live","story":"Airbus and Rolls-Royce are pushing the UK government to help Virgin Atlantic survive the Covid-19 crisisThat reflects ongoing concern that the Covid-19 pandemic will hurt global demand, and that Saudi Arabia will maintain its price war and keep pumping.It’s a challenge for oil majors - and BP is responding by slashing billions of dollars off its spending: Here’s my colleague Gwyn Topham on the push to rescue Virgin Atlantic:Virgin Atlantic’s quest for a state bailout has been backed by some of aviation’s biggest companies, with the aerospace giants Airbus and Rolls-Royce as well as Heathrow all lobbying the government on the airline’s behalf.The trio have sent letters to the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, this week urging state assistance for Sir Richard Branson’s airline, which is seeking hundreds of millions of pounds in loans and credit guarantees with planes grounded and bookings vanishing because of coronavirus.Virgin has ordered a fleet of Airbus 330 aircraft, with Rolls-Royce engines, whose wings are made at the Airbus Broughton plant in north Wales. The airline also had plans before the coronavirus to expand at London Heathrow.In one of the letters, according to Sky News, John Harrison, the general counsel and UK chairman of Airbus, said that Virgin’s “collapse could have an extremely negative impact on the A330 programme”.He added: “As you will be aware, all wings for these aircraft are designed and manufactured in the UK, and orders from airlines like Virgin are vital for the continuation of our business.”Rolls-Royce has also stressed the “significant importance” of Virgin’s custom to the company and its UK supply chain.A Heathrow spokesperson confirmed that the airport had written on Virgin’s behalf, and said: “The government must take urgent steps now to safeguard the future of the sector or it will risk undermining the recovery of Britain’s economy once we beat the virus.”Here’s the full story:In other Airbus news.... the company has loaded more than 400,000 surgical masks destined on to trucks at its HQ in Toulouse, France, to help deal with the UK’s shortage of protective equipment for healthcare workers. The cargo is part of a batch of 6 million that have already been brought to Europe from China using several Airbus test aircraft. Airbus said it had established an air bridge to China to bring large quantities of surgical masks to Europe to support governments in the fight against COVID-19. The first UK consignment is due to arrive at Airbus’ Broughton site in North Wales on Friday. Here’s some footage of the masks being loaded.Construction Leadership Council, an industry body, is calling on construction companies to help the NHS by providing urgently needed protective equipment, such as face masks, visors, goggles, hand sanitizer and full body suits.But, it’s worth noting that some building sites are still open and workers have complained of having to work in crowded conditions, with little or no hand sanitizer available on site.Some have taken to social media to voice fears over their health and jobs. After the worst quarter since the financial crisis, US and European stock markets have made a poor start to Q2:Every European market fell, while Wall Street is deep in the red too.David Madden of CMC Markets explains that fears over the Covid-19 pandemic in the US and Europe are hurting shares.Stocks are sharply lower as health fears continue to loom over the markets. The first quarter was dreadful and the second quarter is starting off on a negative note. The Covid-19 related death toll in the US has overtaken that of China, and President Trump has warned about a ‘very, very painful two weeks’ ahead.The surge in stocks seen on the back of various stimulus plans from central banks, and rescue packages from governments around the globe seems like a distant memory, and traders are bracing themselves for a deepening health crisis.Germany has extended the nationwide lockdown until 19 April – it will prolong the economic pain in Europe’s largest country. He also points out that clouds are gathering over the airlines (Virgin is not alone!):Investors may need a swift drink from Beer Is Here, given today’s stock market action.Airlines aren’t the only industry struggling right now, of course.Britain’s brewers have also been hit, hard, by the government’s lockdown rules and the forced closures of pubs.But all isn’t lost, thirsty readers. A website called Beer Is Here is trying to keep small breweries alive, by connecting them with customers.Type in your postcode and it pulls up a list of breweries near you that deliver or do takeaway, and who may be very grateful for the business right now....A group of civil society organisations have written to the Chancellor of the Exchequer to demand that any bailouts for the airline industry come with strict conditions.They argue that airline workers need to be protected, but that the industry must be forced to address its contribution to the climate emergency, and to local air and noise pollution.It’s a timely intervention, given the pressure building to rescue Virgin Atlantic.The group, including Greenpeace, Amnesty International, Common Wealth and Friends of the Earth, say: While all of our minds are rightly focused on the need to protect ourselves and our communities against the serious health threat of COVID-19 and its wider economic impacts, the climate and nature emergencies have not gone away and are quietly getting worse. Indeed, aviation sector carbon emissions are increasing globally, and airports are a major contributor to local air and noise pollution, risking public health.Any bailouts that are granted must be used to address these challenges together, and avoid exacerbating them.Therefore any support packages for airline companies must set conditions to protect workers’ rights, prevent public money from being erted into the pockets of shareholders, and reorientate the industry towards helping to meet the Paris climate agreement. Demand reduction measures should be implemented gradually over time to bring the sector within safe limits for the climate.The group also want the government to take a controlling stake in any airlines it rescues, so it can drive through change, and to guarantee workers rights - including no lay-offs during the coronavirus emergency.A petition has been set up on the UK parliament website, urging ministers to decline any requests for bailouts from the airline industry.It argues that aviation should not be supported with government investment or subsidies, given it is a cause of climate change. Employees should be helped to move into ‘greener’ transport instead.It’s currently got 1,476 signatures -- the government must respond if it hits 10,000.....Travel website The Points Guy reported on Monday that Virgin had drastically cut back its routes, with most planes grounded:For most of April, Virgin Atlantic will only operate three routes in its route network. Between 29 March and 19 April 2020, the carrier will only operate flights between London Heathrow (LHR) and New York (JFK), Los Angeles (LAX) and Hong Kong (HKG). My colleague Gwyn Topham wrote last week that Virgin was pushing for a state aid package:The airline declined to comment, but was understood to have approached the government and bankers, Rothschild, who are handling negotiations, for a package worth hundreds of millions of pounds in commercial loans and guarantees.The loans would cover fixed costs rather than staffing. Credit guarantees would allow passenger revenues for future bookings to be passed on to the airline rather than retained by credit card companies – removing one of the issues that helped sink Flybe as its financial woes became apparent.The Financial Times reports that Virgin Atlantic is seeking a £500m bailout package of commercial loans and guarantees to survive the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic. They also confirm that Airbus and Rolls-Royce are doing their bit!In the letters, seen by the Financial Times, Warren East, chief executive at Rolls-Royce, wrote on Wednesday that “Virgin’s business is of significant importance to Rolls-Royce, our extensive UK supply chain, and manufacturing operations.”  Meanwhile, John Harrison, general counsel at Airbus and a board member, warned that Virgin’s collapse could have an “extremely negative impact” on the manufacturer’s A330 aircraft programme, which has its wings designed and manufactured in the UK. The Covid-19 crisis is putting all airlines under severe pressures, including Virgin Atlantic - who has been hit by Donald Trump’s travel ban, and flight restrictions elsewhere.Now, Sky News reports, a “frantic lobbying campaign” to secure taxpayer support for Virgin Atlantic Airways is underway.Apparently it involves two of the aviation industry’s biggest manufacturers, Airbus and Rolls-Royce Holdings, and Heathrow Airport - who are also all suffering from the crisis.These businesses have separately to Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, to urge the government to “do all it can to support Virgin in these extremely difficult times”. “As you will be aware, all wings for these aircraft are designed and manufactured in the UK, and orders from airlines like Virgin are vital for the continuation of our business,” Mr Harrison wrote. Similar messages are understood to have been communicated by Heathrow and Rolls-Royce, both of which are also significant customers of Virgin Atlantic. One industry source said the letters had been written at the instigation of the British airline.The airline industry has been making increasingly vocal noises about needing help for weeks, with potential lost revenue from Covid-19 spiralling into the hundreds of billions of dollars.But rescuing airlines is tricky territory for governments. There’s no certainty when flights will resume as normal. Should taxypayers really help keep planes in the air anyway, given the climate crisis?Newsflash: Output across America’s factories slumped at the fastest rate since the financial crisis last month.Data firm Markit reports that US manufacturing output declined at the fastest pace since August 2009 in March, as the COVID-19 outbreak intensified.New orders and employment also contracted at the fastest rate since the financial crisis, and business confidence slumped (which largely mirrors the picture in the UK and eurozone!).Chris Williamson, Chief Business Economist at IHS Markit says there’s worse to come:“Growing numbers of company closures and lockdowns as the nation fights the COVID-19 outbreak mean business levels have collapsed.While some producers reported being busier as a result of stockpiling and anti-virus activities, notably in the food and healthcare sectors, these are very much the minority, and most sectors reported a rapid deterioration in demand and production. Not a good start to April:The New York stock exchange has begun the new quarter as it ended the old one - with a wave of selling.Donald Trump’s warning of a “very, very painful” two weeks lies ahead as the COVID-19 pandemic continues has clearly alarmed investors, crushing any lingering hopes that the outbreak could be contained easily."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98fb69ef4ba2701bde80f4f81d0ba2864fefbd26/0_251_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cac62ffe7641ea706d3cee70fe37b4da","title":"doctors choose life saving treatment ethical rules","story":"Robust ethical rules on coronavirus are vital to guide us to the right decision, however agonisingThe headlines are stark: a “tsunami” of Covid-19 patients moving inexorably toward London’s hospitals and then spreading out across the rest of the UK. Despite heroic efforts to increase supply – and reduce demand – there may come a point when this tsunami will simply overwhelm intensive-care beds, ventilators and life-support machines. Although we hope this will not be happen, it is important we begin to think now about how we would respond should that situation arise. As in Spain and Italy, heart-wrenching decisions may need to be made, agonising choices about who gets access to life-saving interventions. Should there be a disjunction between need and resource, these decisions will become unavoidable. The question is how do we ensure decisions made are ethical?Over recent weeks, we at the British Medical Association have worked with leading medical figures to put together guidelines to ensure just this. This guidance is clear, authoritative, ethically robust, and developed with a broad range of input and opinion designed to support doctors as they approach these most trying of decisions.Sadly, these guidelines do not preclude the necessity to make enormously challenging ethical decisions. Guidance can indicate how to proceed. It cannot stop the choices being brutal or relieve decision-makers of their moral distress.Looking ahead to the coming weeks, if hard choices are required, we know they will be contested. There will be anger and pain. People who, in normal circumstances, would receive intensive treatment may instead be given palliation – pain relief without a cure - in order to favour those with greater likelihood of benefiting. Nobody wants to take these decisions, but if resources are overwhelmed, they will have to be made.In taking them, we need to begin with justice or fairness. If everyone matters equally, but we cannot treat all of those in need, what does a fair allocation of resources look like? In times of plenty, fairness means allocating resources according to medical need. The greater the demand, the greater the resources provided – as long as the patient will benefit. Even before Covid-19, the NHS was not amply equipped. Resources were being rationed by way of waiting lists and brevity of consultation. But – generally – the more ill you were, the greater a priority you were.For a time, Covid-19 may overturn this approach. The question will no longer be how best to meet inidual need, but how to maximise benefits from severely stretched resources. To the criterion of medical need, must also be added the patient’s likelihood of benefiting. It is preferable to save the lives of three patients with high need and a high likelihood of benefiting than one patient with high need and a low – but nonetheless real – chance of benefiting. The principle that everyone matters is in tension with the requirement to maximise overall benefit. This is the heart of the moral challenge.The BMA’s guidance addresses the ethical aspects of these difficult decisions. It is designed to support doctors. But, at this time, there will undoubtedly be challenges. Objective clinical standards can be indirectly discriminatory. We know that the presence of comorbidities – having more than one illness or condition – or underlying frailty is associated with higher risks for patients with Covid-19. An approach based solely on clinically relevant factors may, statistically, prioritise the younger and, where clinically relevant, it may discriminate against those with underlying health conditions. We need to be alert to this. We need to keep practice under regular review and modify it as more evidence and feedback become available. Neither age nor disability in themselves will be criteria – only where they impact on a patient’s capacity to benefit.And what if there are more patients with capacity to benefit than life-saving resources available? There are two options, neither of them ideal. More likely is a modified queueing system based on the widely accepted principle “first come, first served”. Patients who become critically ill earlier will be more likely to be admitted to intensive care or receive mechanical ventilation than those who become similarly ill later on, even though they may be offered intensive support for a defined but limited period. While such an approach is procedurally simple, and arguably fair, it is not without its challenges. It gives priority to those who are mobile, who have access to transport or who live close to hospitals. The alternative is some form of lottery, but pity those who would have to manage it.These are unprecedented times. Our health system – like our society itself – is facing its gravest challenge since the second world war. Given the vital importance of these decisions – and the inevitability of dissent – there must be a national debate now, in advance of these decisions having to be taken. Public acceptance requires an understanding of why these decisions must be made, and the rationale for the way in which they are made. I write in the hope of contributing to that debate."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/72e53cef3f973e3e605584b9b5d33157d8796dab/0_0_8192_4915/master/8192.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c1de0c62638b55e75a7ee541ab6cdaf2","title":"lockdown buys time virus mass testing coronavirus uk","story":"Instead of endless mass isolation or just waiting for a cure, the UK needs a data-driven, targeted approach to coronavirus testing After squandering valuable time to prepare for the spread of Covid-19 in February and the first half of March, the government made a dramatic U-turn and put the country into lockdown two weeks ago. But amid the drama of shutting down our entire way of life – with kids out of school, shops closed and millions working from home – we appear to have forgotten that lockdown itself is not the solution to coronavirus. It is simply a means of slowing its spread and buying time – while we race to catch up.The real question facing Britain now is how to most effectively make up for lost time: what can we really do to fight this instead of simply cowering in our homes and waiting for it to blow over? If things carry on much as they are now, one possible scenario is that we will find ourselves in an endless cycle of lockdown and release over the next year – while the population slowly acquires the virus and hopefully gains immunity.The burden on the NHS will be tremendous, especially given concerns about lack of appropriate personal protective equipment, and this will have knock-on effects on other services it offers: routine surgery, cancer treatment, the ability to deal with emergencies such as heart attacks and strokes. The decision whether to extend lockdown will be made by looking at the modelling of NHS capacity in three weeks’ time as well as assessing public willingness to comply.In an optimistic version of the above, over the next three to four months an antiviral therapy would be discovered while we hold out for a vaccine. Antiviral therapies would give doctors an additional tool to treat critical patients with, while vaccines would provide a prevention measure so iniduals can build up immunity and the necessary antibodies before being exposed to Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. Effective therapies have helped with how we deal with HIVAids (antiretrovirals), malaria (antimalarials) while vaccines have been effective against measles, mumps and rubella. Repurposing a drug that has already been tested for safety in humans would be the quickest path, and clinical trials are taking place for antimalarial cocktails (chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine), remdesivir and plasma therapies, which involve extracting antibodies from recovered patients and injecting them into ill patients.The endgame would be a vaccine that is widely available, effective and affordable. Currently there are about two dozen vaccine candidates, with several being tested on animals and one imminently due to begin testing on humans. However, time is the problem, as vaccines require three phases of clinical trials to test for safety, side effects and whether they actually work. It will take about a year to 18 months even if all goes to plan – and even then, given all countries would be looking to acquire the vaccine, manufacturing enough of it would present a further challenge.But instead of quarantining the entire population, the most pragmatic way out (and assuming anyone could be carrying the virus), would be via a more nuanced and data-driven approach of mass-testing 75-100,000 people per day. This would not be testing random people but rather those presenting with symptoms, and then tracing all of their contacts (household members, colleagues, flatmates) to ensure they are also tested. All those who are virus-carriers would be put into a mandatory two-week quarantine in their homes, enforced through tracking and fines. This will allow the public health community to identify where exactly the virus is, to break further chains of transmission and to keep case numbers low and within the NHS capacity limit. It would also allow most of society, and the economy, to continue on a somewhat more “normal” basis.The testing capacity could be built up through using private and university labs, as well as working with South Korea and other partners to bring in rapid diagnostics as quickly as possible. SD Biosensor, a company in South Korea, is making 350,000 test kits a day and is scaling up, but currently is prioritising the US, United Arab Emirates and Indonesia. When a reliable antibody test is available, one that shows whether someone has had it or not, iniduals with high likelihood of exposure should be tested to see what percentage of immunity has built up and ensure they can be kept in the workforce.If we want to work towards the best-case scenario, then we need to place the highest political priority on acquiring the testing kits, while drawing on apps and big data to support contact tracing. Through this path we can start quarantining only those carrying the virus, and not the entire population. The economy, society and health all win in this plan, and it seems the best way out of our current situation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/821fa35dbf124cfa1e34a5e4530a4c2467342d29/50_0_4400_2642/master/4400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=65d0f09cc9d9f0accc86181f666ffba8","title":"policing under coronavirus the real test is yet to come","story":"As the pandemic wears on, how long will we allow ourselves to be policed by consent? At the end of The Long Goodbye, Raymond Chandler’s detective Philip Marlowe bids farewell to his readers and to the characters in the novel. “I never saw any of them again – except the cops,” muses Marlowe. “No way has yet been invented to say goodbye to them.” Chandler was expressing a wider truth. In the words of the British criminologist Robert Reiner: “Welcome or unwelcome, protectors, pigs or pariahs, the police are an inevitable fact of modern life.”Especially, we are again learning, in a national emergency. The Coronavirus Act 2020 has given a ratchet to three of the most persistently controversial themes in British policing history: police powers, police discretion and police coordination. All three are back in the spotlight in the Covid-19 lockdown. But this week’s arguments, prompted in part by the former supreme court judge Jonathan Sumption’s warnings about the growth of a police state, are only the start. The real test for the policing of the pandemic is yet to come.Ever since the creation of London’s politan police in 1829, issues like these have been recurrent in the often volatile evolution of relations between politics, the police and the people. When the state took wide new powers last month they again became a source of argument. Police chiefs have not always appeared in control of events at a time when government is itself struggling to coordinate public discipline over travel, exercise and shopping.The Coronavirus Act is in some ways a recognisable descendent of the draconian emergency legislation that Britain adopted at the start of the world wars of the 20th century. But in some ways it is different. By and large, the wartime emergency legislation granted wide new powers to central government, which was then free to make regulations to apply them. But the 2020 act also gives many powers to the devolved authorities and confers other powers directly on public health, immigration and police officers at local level. As a result, a degree of potential inconsistency between nations, localities and even inidual services was baked into the legislation at the start. Devolvers will approve. Centralisers will not. Much remains in need of sensible clarification.The different approaches so far are often arbitrary. Derbyshire police have used drones to highlight people walking in the Peak District and dye to deter swimmers from a quarry pool near Buxton. This attracted the wrath of Lord Sumption, who called the policing disgraceful. But other forces are also doing things that, in other circumstances, would be highly controversial too. North Yorkshire are using soldiers to conduct roadblocks. Cumbria issued a unilateral decree that the Lake District was “closed”. Devon and Cornwall police asked the public to report “illegal gatherings”. The politan police are challenging users of the London Underground to justify their journeys. Some of these acts can reasonably be justified, but others are plainly excessive.Some of these interventions echo wartime restrictions. At some stage in the current outbreak there may well be a protest picket somewhere against, perhaps, a supermarket over food prices or a bank for not lending to small businesses or the self employed. The picket may comply with all the physical distancing guidance and be dignified and orderly. But it would probably elicit the same response as a protest reported by the civil rights campaigner Ronald Kidd in his wartime book, British Liberty in Danger. In June 1940, police tried to ban a meeting in south London against high food prices because, the police said, “it was undesirable that ‘ill-feeling should be stirred up at a time of crisis’”. That meeting eventually took place. A protest today might run up against the same response and be banned.Today’s events are reminding a new generation of police chiefs and officers that relations with the public are always contingent. For generations, police in this country have set great store by the notion that they police “by consent” rather than by imposition. They like to think it distinguishes them from an un-British “gendarmerie”, against whom the Chartists protested in the early days of the Met. But “policing by consent” is often used, by both police and their critics, in unrealistic and idealised ways. Margaret Thatcher, for example, once said the police need “support and not criticism”. Approaches like that bear no relation to complex social realities, not least in emergencies.Policing is a public good, but it is simultaneously a confrontational activity. It is a mistake to dismiss all policing as authoritarian. But nor is it the case that policing is just another public service. Consent, whether to policing or anything else, is always conditional. Consent has to be won and given, negotiated and sustained. Consent routinely involves invoking and accepting some degree of power. What is consent for some may be imposition for others. That goes with the territory. Consent may be problematic, but it is nevertheless crucial. Today’s police chiefs properly invoke policing by consent. Greater Manchester’s chief constable Ian Hopkins, in his public statement this week said, rightly, that mistakes had been made in policing the lockdown and that some officers would get things wrong. The Met’s assistant commissioner Neil Basu did the same thing when he wrote that policing by consent remained the mantra even in “a period of readjustment to our new responsibilities”.No one should be surprised that the appropriateness of various forms of policing has come to a head again in a time of pandemic. The state, after all, has just claimed unusual powers to direct our lives for the common and inidual good. Those powers need to be debated – which parliament did not do – before they receive consent. The entire episode embodies what the philosopher Benedict de Spinoza wrote in 1670. “It is not, I contend, the purpose of the state to turn rational beings into beasts or automata, but rather to allow their minds and bodies to develop in their own ways in security and enjoy the free use of reason …. Therefore, the true purpose of the state is in fact freedom.”These early days of the policing of the pandemic are nevertheless relatively straightforward. Public consent is currently high. Most of us probably think that it is irresponsible to test the law to the limits by, say, heading off in the car to climb Snowdon.The much more difficult and demanding test will come in a few weeks, when someone in authority says that we have probably reached a stage where some of the restrictions can be lessened and aspects of the old normality resumed. That will be the point when Spinoza’s “free use of reason” will pose a far larger threat to the state’s coronavirus policy. That will be the moment when the policing of what is normal and abnormal, responsible and irresponsible, good freedom and bad freedom will become more complex, chaotic and confrontational. It could be a long hot summer. We all need to start thinking about it now."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a0188aad78e4e216b932a687ee9fb01623935e74/0_72_3500_2102/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0d77d36df4ac97c5c2525afcc86d4f98","title":"populist right coronavirus","story":"Science and welfare are at the heart of this crisis – which is bad for right-wing populists. But they won’t be wrongfooted for longThe populist right has built their electoral strength on boisterousness and arrogant self-confidence. Yet, amid the coronavirus pandemic, figures such as Donald Trump, Boris Johnson and Jair Bolsonaro seem to be confounded. They are either desperately clinging to a narrative of normality (it’s just a flu), or have already been forced to make embarrassing U-turns acknowledging the gravity of the crisis.Boris Johnson had to abandon the government’s “herd immunity” strategy when new scientific evidence made apparent its horrific human cost. He recently tested positive for the virus and is now accused of complacency and lack of leadership. In Italy, Matteo Salvini, leader of the far-right League party and former deputy prime minister, appears downbeat, unable to wear the robes of the responsible statesman this emergency calls for his unabashed criticism of government has even earned him the label “unpatriotic”. In France, Marine Le Pen seems to have vanished altogether from the media, while Bolsonaro’s persistence in denying the crisis is leaving him increasingly isolated.The difficulties experienced by national populists are unsurprising given they are no friends of the issues at the heart of this crisis: health, welfare and science. On the health front, the crisis reveals the folly of decades of underfunding and privatisation of the health system. Trump, Johnson and Salvini have embarrassing questions to answer in regard to their record as enemies of public healthcare. Furthermore, the crisis calls for a sea change in economic policy that is at odds with the ideological premises of national populism, which combines chauvinism on the cultural front and ultra-neoliberal policies on the economic front.The glaring need for state protection of strategic national industries, starting with health equipment and pharmaceuticals, is no anathema for national-populists who have already embraced trade protectionism. But the populist right has strongly opposed welfare measures that are becoming a matter of necessity to avoid social catastrophe. Having repeatedly branded these policies as “dangerous” and “anti-patriotic”, these politicians find themselves in the embarrassing situation of having to espouse them.Another skeleton in the closet is national-populists’ disparagement of science. The coronavirus emergency confronts us with a threat that is best understood and measured through the lens of science. Epidemiologists and virologists have acquired media prominence and the public has been diligently following their recommendations. It is not clear whether this will lead to greater public trust in science and an erosion of the anti-science attitudes that national populist leaders have toyed with. However, it can be expected that citizens will take more heed of the risks flagged by scientists, including the climate emergency, which is also bound to exacerbate the spread of diseases.National-populists are well known for stoking people’s fears. But the fears now prevalent are not of the kind these leaders are best positioned to exploit. Due to the urgency of health and economic worries, migration – the populist right’s main enemy – has fallen in the list of priorities. Travel bans, and the fact that Europe and the US are the present focus of the pandemic, are leading to a drop in migration to these regions. In fact, we are now witnessing a historic reversal, with Mexico aiming to block the border with the US and African countries suspending flights from Europe, while UK farmers are organising charter planes to fly in farm workers from eastern Europe to prevent fruit and vegetables being left unpicked. However, if the global economic crisis results in a new wave of migration like that of 2015, this scenario could drastically change – national-populists will try to validate their narrative of cosmopolitan globalisation as a dangerous vector of all sorts of ills.If the coronavirus crisis has momentarily disoriented the populist right, this does not mean it is vanquished. It would be misguided for the left to believe that this crisis will work out in its favour. The health crisis is bound to be followed by a deep economic crisis, more similar to the Great Depression than to the 2008 financial crisis, and the populist right has already demonstrated its ability to prey on popular despair and find social scapegoats for economic ills. It can be expected that it will go down the same road, if anything becoming even more vicious.Given the ties among national-populists, including their botched attempt to establish a “nationalist international” under the auspices of Bannon’s Movement, this synchrony should not be taken as accidental. It has all the look of a coordinated strategy to channel the rage and despair caused by the crisis’s brutal human and economic toll towards a racial and ideological enemy conveniently identified in the Chinese government. Along with self-proclaimed socialists, all opponents are likely to be smeared as “Chinese collaborationists”: centrist US presidential candidate Joe Biden has already been termed “China’s choice for president” by the conservative National Review.What may be in store is thus something much worse than the populist right of the 2010s: an extreme right using the whole arsenal of the red scare and rightwing authoritarianism to intimidate opponents and defend its interests from demands for meaningful economic redistribution. Though it has been confounded by this crisis, the populist right has not been suppressed. It is just mutating.• Paolo Gerbaudo is a political theorist and the director of the Centre for Digital Culture at King’s College London"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc30987deaaf8e205bcdd4e2f949e80d01b2070f/0_273_5906_3544/master/5906.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=052d79cf3ed2aa686cd2f1696415497e","title":"public inquiry coronavirus mass testing pandemic","story":" Any self-respecting pandemic crisis team should have realised the importance of mass testing from the outset • Anthony Costello is a former director of maternal and child health at the World Health Organization • See all our coronavirus coverageWill the inevitable public inquiry into the UK’s Covid-19 response pin the blame on a few scapegoats? I hope not. Britain’s failure to move quickly and effectively is the symptom of a more comprehensive system failure. More than three months after the virus first appeared in Wuhan, England and Wales still lack the necessary testing capacity and surveillance infrastructure to shut down the epidemic. Crucial frontline workers are still doing their jobs without adequate personal protective equipment. Public Health England (PHE) seem unable to increase the daily number of tests in line with European neighbours. As other countries acted swiftly to contain the epidemic, the UK appears indecisive and delayed, shifting late in the day from a controversial herd immunity strategy to a lockdown. History won’t look kindly on Britain’s response.We must ask at least five far-reaching questions about how our health system deals with a pandemic. First: who’s in charge? Many actors have been involved in devising a response to coronavirus – Downing Street and its advisers Cobra the Department of Health and Social Care NHS England PHE and its Scottish, Northern Irish and Welsh counterparts the National Institute for Health Research the chief medical officer, Chris Whitty the chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance and the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (UK Sage). Coordination appears chaotic. I’ve reliably been told that leaders across these various bodies often don’t know what each other is doing.The second question concerns history. The UK’s haphazard coronavirus response wasn’t just a result of chaotic planning. The groundwork was laid years ago. During the last decade, funding for public health has been fragmented and downgraded. In 2013, the Lansley reforms created PHE, a new executive agency within the Department of Health and Social Care that was separate from the NHS. Its mission was to protect and improve the nation’s health in order to address inequalities. Its funding came from local authority budgets as local authorities suffered the sharp end of austerity, funding for PHE stagnated. Spending on the public health grant in 2019-20 was £850m lower in real terms than initial allocations in 2015-16.Today, the repercussions of fragmentation and underfunding are clear. Scaling up Covid-19 testing requires a community surveillance system that integrates PHE local outbreak management teams with NHS primary care facilities and laboratories. In its 3 March Covid-19 action plan, PHE assured us that “once a case has been detected, our public health agencies use tried-and-tested procedures for rapid tracing, monitoring and isolation of close contacts, with the aim of preventing further spread”. By all accounts, this didn’t happen at scale. On 12 March PHE stopped all community testing as part of the government’s delay strategy, instead focusing its efforts on patients and health workers.The third question is political. This epidemic has tested the reigning political emphasis on market mechanisms and public-private partnerships, and found it wanting. During a national epidemic, our system of outsourced providers and internal markets simply doesn’t work. As one senior British doctor close to the Covid-19 crisis organisation told me, the chaos of the UK’s response has “reflected the wholesale destruction of a coordinated and focused state sector. Outsourcing, delegated powers, internal markets … have made a single response impossible. It is affecting every aspect of policy.”Maybe it is already too late in the day for the government to remedy these mistakes. Pandemics move fast if you don’t get ahead of a virus, it quickly spreads. The government stuck stubbornly to its delay policy to “flatten the curve” through social distancing alone, despite the evidence of epidemic suppression through testing in South Korea, Singapore, Hong Kong, China, Taiwan and Germany, which have all recorded lower death rates.• Anthony Costello is professor of global health and sustainable development at UCL and a former director of maternal and child health at the WHO"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8170860645ffa83def0e0b764e1e14882ce8a99a/0_14_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e8b38897509ea85be48392c67bb9e73b","title":"why uk coronavirus testing work catchup","story":"Pursuing a controversial herd immunity strategy put the government on the back foot. Now it’s struggling to catch upTo stop a virus, you need to test for it. So why is it taking so long for the UK to increase its testing capacity? Although Public Health England is now aiming to conduct 10,000 tests per day, the UK’s response still pales in comparison with Germany, which is reportedly managing to test about 70,000 people per day.The government’s inability to increase the number of tests is down to several factors. The kits have to be purchased in a global marketplace where demand has now exceeded supply. This raises the question: why didn’t we prepare sooner? According to some reports, the problem isn’t just one of availability, but timing. The government’s initial controversial policy of mitigation focused on the elderly and vulnerable, and mass testing was a secondary concern. At the point the government shifted its strategy to suppressing the virus and decided to roll out testing, it was already playing catchup. The government had made no preparations to increase the supply of testing kits or expand laboratory capacity – and the UK found itself at the back of the line in a global queue for tests. Sorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen https:audio.guim20200327-52465-Covid-19_+how_do_we_test_for_it.mp3 Historic factors have also shaped the UK’s current testing capacity. Over the past 20 years, the number of laboratories and testing facilities has shrunk. The public health laboratory service, a network of local and regional laboratories that was established as part of the NHS in 1946 to respond to the threat of bacteriological warfare, was subsumed by the health protection agency in 2003. Many of the laboratories in the old network were shut down, taken over by local hospitals or merged into a smaller number of regional laboratories.So even if it did have enough kits, the UK would no longer have the capacity, equipment or biomedical scientists to match the testing capacity of its European neighbours. But what if the tests could be done at home?This brings us to the question of the kinds of tests the UK will be conducting. Part of the confusion about testing has arisen from the fact there are two different types of test, which measure very different things. One detects the presence of the virus, and is sometimes referred to as the “antigen” test the other detects the presence of antibodies, sometimes referred to as the “serology”, or “antibody” test.The antigen test relies on molecular methods to detect the presence of the viral genetic material, usually in a nose or throat swab. This test is used to tell whether a person is currently infected and possibly infectious, and it needs samples to be sent to a testing laboratory. The antibody test, that will be available to conduct at home, detects whether the person actually had an infection at some time in the past – and indicates whether they are likely to be immune to further infection.This test is usually done on a spot of blood. Antibody tests typically do not become positive for a week or so after the beginning of an illness, so they are not much use for quickly diagnosing an acutely ill person – and won’t detect those who have only recently caught the virus.Criticisms of the UK’s testing numbers mainly concern the antigen tests. Several other countries, which have arguably been more successful at controlling their own epidemics – Germany, China and South Korea – have done many more antigen tests than the UK. South Korea has been running 20,000 tests a day. Even the US has completed more tests than the UK – 2,248 tests per million compared to the UK’s 1,923, according to the Covid Tracking Project. Importantly, the antigen test can show whether someone may be infectious to others, so it can be used to screen essential workers who may have only mild coronavirus symptoms, or who are asymptomatic.For now, the antigen tests are crucial for controlling the spread of the virus. But as we get over the peak of the epidemic, antibody tests will help us recover a semblance of normality. By detecting which iniduals are immune from the virus, they could allow them to return to work. Essential workers with immunity would not need to worry about getting infected or passing the virus to their families. Carers, social workers, the police and priests officiating at funerals could carry out their work as normal.Perhaps an even more important use of antibody tests is to fill some of the biggest gaps in our knowledge about the pandemic. How many people get only mild illness, or even do not get ill following an infection? Are younger people getting infected at the same rate as older adults? This information will be vital in helping us decide when and how the current social distancing measures can be relaxed, and when we can finally return to normal life."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/135be18d34aa19207fc23f5d4a8d8bdb7b6fd54d/0_66_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=83dbd40857530203216b503bf3806942","title":"financial help for airlines should come with strict climate conditions","story":"Former EU climate chief Miguel Arias Cañete fears end of Covid-19 will bring higher carbon emissionsFinancial help from taxpayers to airlines hit by the coronavirus crisis must come with strict conditions on their future climate impact, the former EU climate commissioner and a group of green campaigners have said.A group of 26 civil society groups in the UK have written to the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, demanding “stringent conditions” on any rescue, including strict targets on greenhouse gases in line with the Paris agreement and measures to help workers. “Public money must be used to address social and environmental priorities, as well as economic needs,” they wrote.Aviation has all but ceased in some countries and flights are vastly down in most others, owing to the lockdowns and other suppression measures. Airlines have been appealing to governments for bailouts as fleets have been grounded.But campaigners and experts fear that after the Covid-19 outbreak has waned, the sector could bounce back with the aid of public money and send emissions soaring.In their letter to the chancellor, the campaigners – including Greenpeace, Flight Free, the IPPR and New Economics Foundation thinktanks, and Tax Justice – call for the government to take equity stakes in airlines rather than handing out cash or loans. They want to see social benefits with workers’ rights enforced, including a living wage and no mass redundancies a condition of any rescue. In the longer term, they want to see support for a “just transition” for workers to move to jobs in lower carbon industries.Rebecca Newsom, head of political affairs at Greenpeace UK, said: “Emergency funding must be used to tackle emergencies, not to support business as usual. Conditions are needed to protect workers’ rights, prevent public money from being erted into the pockets of shareholders, and reduce demand gradually over time through a frequent flier levy, so that the sector operates within safe limits for the climate.”Attaching conditions to any bailout could take several forms. Cañete wants to see a carbon tax or emissions trading system such as the one operating under the EU. “Market mechanisms are needed,” he said.Airlines UK, a trade body, said the industry was already taking steps to reduce their environmental impact before the coronavirus crisis hit. “The UK aviation sector has already committed to achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050 – the only national aviation industry to do so,” said a spokesperson. “This will be achieved via a range of measures, including airspace modernisation, the development and commercialisation of sustainable aviation fuels, new cleaner planes, and the UN carbon offsetting scheme Corsia.”Airlines face difficult choices ahead. More efficient aircraft will help to reduce emissions, but the impact will be limited. Biofuels offer a possible answer, but they are still expensive and there are difficulties in ensuring that the sources are environmentally sustainable. Electric planes are still some way in the future, and solar-powered flight a distant dream.“We need to stimulate research and development into things like hydrogen fuel,” said Barbara Buchner, managing director of the Climate Policy Initiative. “We need more proactive thinking from airlines – they can’t imagine we will go back to the way they were before.”The coronavirus disruption may also bring about permanent changes in people’s habits, some experts hope. Business flying has stopped meetings from happening, but people have found ways to work with video conferencing and other cheap technology, forcing businesses to question whether their staff need to fly as much in future.These eight companies are among those who will help you offset your carbon emissions. Here is an indication of the cost, and where the money will be spent:Climate CareCost: £17.61 for 2.35 tonnesProjects: Safe drinking water in Malawi, fuel efficiency in Ghana, landfill energy in Thailand, rainforests in BrazilAtmosfairCost: £106 for 5 tonnesProjects: Energy efficiency in South Africa, biogas in Nepal, wind and hydro powerCarbonfund.orgCost: $47 for 2.24 tonnesProjects: Water treatment in Kenya, hydroelectric in IndiaClevelCost: £38.74 for 2.6 tonnesProjects: Restoring grasslands in Mongolia, reducing deforestation in TanzaniaFlygreenCost: £20.79 for 2.4 tonnesProjects: Solar panels in IndiaMyclimateCost: £72 for 3.1 tonnesProjects: Energy efficiency in Africa, reforestation in NicaraguaCarbonfootprintCost: Between £7 and £30 a tonneProjects: Borehole rehabilitation in Uganda, hydroelectric in ChileGold StandardCost: Asks you to calculate your own emissions and choose a projectProjects: Water purifiers in Cambodia, fuel-efficient stoves in Sudan“We are not flying as much – why not keep not flying?” asked Kevin Anderson, professor of energy and climate change at Manchester University. “Why not reinforce the good things that are coming out of Covid-19?”One effect of the coronavirus crisis has yet to be felt. Under the Corsia (Carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation) system adopted by the International Civil Aviation Organisation, airlines would have to curb their future emissions using efficiencies, alternative fuels and offsetting, such as investing in forests, renewable energy or other carbon-cutting projects.Before the coronavirus crisis emerged, airlines pushed for the average emissions in the years 2019 and 2020 to be used as the baseline by which future emissions would be judged. In any years from 2021 onwards, when emissions from the sector exceed the average of 2019 and 2020, the difference between actual emissions and the baseline will have to be offset, meaning airlines will have to buy carbon credits from carbon-cutting projects.Choosing 2019 and 2020 should have made those targets easy to meet for airlines if air travel had continued to rise this year as it has in recent years. With the Covid-19 pandemic, however, the disruption to travel means emissions are likely to be drastically lower than envisaged for 2020 – meaning Corsia’s future carbon targets will be much tougher for them to reach, if the scheme goes ahead without changes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a9f904b3bc22746f570dd2e72725740c8843595b/0_186_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b33cdf03ccfef24e541c4773a51e65b0","title":"government set to make decision on uks largest coalmine","story":"Verdict expected after four years of protracted talks as production of the fossil fuel fell to record lows of 2.9m tonnes Ministers will decide this month whether to give the green light to plans for the UK’s largest coalmine after years of fierce opposition from environmentalists.A letter from the government’s lawyers, seen by the , said the government will draw a line on the protracted battle to develop an opencast mine at Highthorn in Northumberland by giving a verdict on the plans by Tuesday 7 April.The decision is expected over four years after the Banks Group, a Durham-based infrastructure firm, first put forward its plans to produce 3m tonnes of coal from the opencast mine for Britain’s steel and cement sector.The company’s lawyers wrote to the government earlier this month demanding a decision on the “vital” coal project, saying it could help meet the “important national need for industrial coal”.A spokesman for the company added that the “corona crisis” could threaten the UK’s imports, although there is no evidence that coal shipments have been impacted so far.The UK’s reliance on coal to generate electricity has fallen to record lows in recent years but the fossil fuel is still used to make steel and manufacture cement, requiring imports of coal from Russia and the US.The UK used 7.9m tonnes of coal last year, down by a third from the year before according to official figures, while domestic coal production fell to record lows of 2.9m tonnes.Environmentalists are strongly opposed to the plans to open new mines in the UK while it moves towards a ban on coal-fired electricity from 2025.Tony Bosworth, a campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: “It is distastefully opportunistic to use a public health crisis to argue for a new coalmine.”“Coronavirus is rightly the world’s priority right now, but that doesn’t mean we can afford to make another crisis worse. And to deal with the climate emergency we need to leave the vast majority of the world’s coal in the ground,” he added.The plan was rejected two years ago by Sajid Javid, the former minister for communities and local government, after an 18-month review concluded that the environmental impact of the mine would outweigh its economic benefits.The decision was overturned by the High Court eight months later after a judge ruled that Javid’s reasoning for disregarding the support of the planning inspectorate, which backed the project, was “significantly inadequate”.The Banks Group argues that mining coal domestically would have a smaller carbon footprint than importing coal by sea and rail. The same argument was put forward in favour of UK shale gas development, but failed to win over energy ministers who announced an indefinite moratorium on all fracking in England last year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c15b6e00b7a07c6040d86ff2f6e1c8a8e3f6fef/0_32_3700_2221/master/3700.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=12653a1ad3a7c864eee533b5c2477c96","title":"oceans can be restored to former glory within 30 years say scientists","story":"Major review reports recovery of marine life but a redoubling of efforts is still needed The glory of the world’s oceans could be restored within a generation, according to a major new scientific review.

But conservation successes, while still isolated, demonstrate the remarkable resilience of the seas.The scientists say there is now the knowledge to create an ocean renaissance for wildlife by 2050 and with it bolster the services that the world’s people rely on, from food to coastal protection to climate stability. The measures needed, including protecting large swathes of ocean, sustainable fishing and pollution controls, would cost billions of dollars a year, the scientists say, but would bring benefits 10 times as high.However, the escalating climate crisis must also be tackled to protect the oceans from acidification, loss of oxygen and the devastation of coral reefs. The good news, the scientists say, is a growing awareness of the ability of oceans and coastal habitats such as mangroves and salt marshes to rapidly soak up carbon dioxide and bolster shorelines against rising sea levels.“We have a narrow window of opportunity to deliver a healthy ocean to our grandchildren, and we have the knowledge and tools to do so,” said Prof Carlos Duarte, of King Abdullah University of Science and Technology in Saudi Arabia, who led the review. “Failing to embrace this challenge, and in so doing condemning our grandchildren to a broken ocean unable to support good livelihoods is not an option.”Prof Callum Roberts, at the University of York, one of the review’s international team, said: “Overfishing and climate change are tightening their grip, but there is hope in the science of restoration.“One of the overarching messages of the review is, if you stop killing sea life and protect it, then it does come back. We can turn the oceans around and we know it makes sense economically, for human wellbeing and, of course, for the environment.”The review, published in the journal Nature, found that global fishing is slowly becoming more sustainable and the destruction of habitats such as seagrass meadows and mangroves is almost at a halt. In places from Tampa Bay, Florida to the Philippines, the habitats are being restored.Among the success stories are humpback whales that migrate from Antarctica to eastern Australia, whose populations have surged from a few hundred animals in 1968, before whaling was banned, to more than 40,000 today. Sea otters in western Canada have risen from just dozens in 1980 to thousands now. In the Baltic Sea, both grey seal and cormorant populations are soaring.“We’re beginning to appreciate the value of what we’re losing and not just in terms of intrinsic beauty of the wildlife but in terms of protecting our livelihoods and societies from bad things happening, whether that be poor water quality in rivers and oceans or sea level rise beating on the doorstep of coastal areas,” said Roberts.However, progress is far from straightforward. Pollution from farms and plastics still pours into the oceans, the waters are reaching record high temperatures, and destructive fishing is still taking place in many places, with at least one-third of fish stocks overexploited.“The Mediterranean is still pretty much a basket case,” said Roberts. “And there is horrendous overfishing throughout large parts of south-east Asia and India, where fisheries are just catching anything they trawl on the seabed to render into fish meal and oil.”The global heating of the oceans has driven the few hundred surviving northern right whales along the coast of the western Atlantic. Here, amid busy shipping lanes and lobster fisheries, they are killed by collisions or drowned in a tangle of ropes, according to Roberts, though new regulations are starting to help.The Gulf of Mexico suffers massive dead zones owing to huge amounts of manure and fertiliser running off midwest farms, and elsewhere albatrosses continue to be snared by long-line fishers, despite simple solutions being available.But examples of the benefits of restorative habits were growing, Roberts said, from the return of once abundant oyster beds that can clean huge volumes of water, to marine protected areas that can boost fishery catches nearby, such as by the Scottish island of Arran.The scientists’s review concludes that restoring the oceans by 2050 is a grand challenge that, with a global redoubling of conservation efforts, can be achieved: “Meeting the challenge would be a historic milestone in humanity’s quest to achieve a globally sustainable future.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f259ccc6f9e0cb344c168b193f52539e93890bcf/0_131_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a1b09fdaf5987ca2b0d644936f48761e","title":"what wildlife can you see from your home coronavirus","story":"If you are locked down in an urban area due to coronavirus, we want to know what flora and fauna you can see from your homeLocked down in a city?

But I know what it’s about – don’t I?I’ve never seen a Jean-Luc Godard movie. Or, I hadn’t, until this assignment. I know, embarrassing, especially for a so-called film critic. I’ve long blamed this gap in my knowledge on the fact that I didn’t take a first year university course in French New Wave cinema, but I know as well as anyone you don’t need to be a student to study. It’s not even that the Nouvelle Vague is a blind spot, necessarily – I’m an admirer of other films from the movement, such as Alain Resnais’s Hiroshima Mon Amour, Agnés Varda’s Cléo de 5 à 7, François Truffaut’s Jules et Jim and Jacques Demy’s The Umbrellas of Cherbourg. I’ve been known to treat my lack of interest in Godard’s filmography as something of a comedy bit, joking that I simply prefer Truffaut (he’s less of a basic bitch).With French film journal Cahiers du Cinéma (RIP) back in the news after its writers quit en masse this February, it feels like an appropriate time to revisit some of the film-makers made famous by the magazine following its launch in 1951. Rohmer, Rivette, Chabrol, Truffaut, and, yes, fine, Godard, were early champions of auteurism, the theory that the director is king. Now the most widely accepted way to read a film, at the time it represented radical rejection of commercial cinema, which tailored to a studio’s whims and centred on the screenwriter. And so, with some trepidation, I cued up Godard’s first and most famous film, his 1960 debut À Bout de Souffle.I know this film, I thought, despite never having watched it. I know the monochrome imagery, the jump cuts, the cigarette dangling from Jean-Paul Belmondo’s mouth. I know Jean Seberg’s Breton stripes, her gamine pixie haircut and her New York Herald Tribune T-shirt. What I didn’t know was what the film was actually about. Something about a guy, and a girl, and a car, I’d guessed. Turns out, I wasn’t far off.Michel (Belmondo) steals a car and shoots a policeman attempting to lay low in Paris, he ends up in the hotel room of former fling Patricia (Seberg), an American studying at the Sorbonne. The plot is inspired by film noir, but the vérité-style handheld camera, real locations and naturalistic speech transform it from a pulpy gangster thriller into a hangout movie. There’s sex, betrayal and an antihero to anchor the narrative, but hard-boiled dialogue is swapped for digressive, philosophical rambling, in-jokes and winking addresses to the audience. “I’m a sonofabitch,” Michel says, direct to camera. Ah, I realised. This is what people mean when they say Godard changed the grammar of cinema.Godard’s influence on New Hollywood cinema and directors such as Martin Scorsese, Robert Altman and Brian de Palma started to become clear, especially in the constant chatter and casual violence. And, I guess, the sexism. Michel is a self-described scumbag but it doesn’t quite let him off the hook for declaring all women drivers “cowardice personified”, refusing to pick up two female hitchhikers because they’re “too ugly” and the fetishisation of Patricia’s constituent body parts. I imagine Godard thought it romantic to describe the lovely “gleam” in Patricia’s eyes that emerged when she was “afraid and confused”. I found it disturbing. In another scene, Patricia is trying to have an intelligent conversation about William Faulkner. “Show me your toes,” replies a horny, distracted Michel (hello, Quentin Tarantino).Still, I didn’t hate it. I didn’t hate it at all. I found myself drawn in by the irrepressible buoyancy of its narrative rhythms. I liked how the improvised jazz score creates the feeling of spontaneity. I was into the spirited sexual energy that animates the film and, clearly, the film-maker as Paris entered a new decade after the stifling conformity of the 1950s. Which Godard film shall I watch next?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7395900246f284212b3b1d07ca7d629e55c47a4/0_303_3072_1843/master/3072.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=65cb2a9c4daf970113bc88b536a4dc47","title":"hop to it researchers pinpoint why belgian beers dont keep","story":"Study finds fashionable hoppy brews lose their characteristic taste while sitting on the shelfIt will be music to the ears of Belgian beer enthusiasts: drink up.Scientists studying how well the fashionable hoppy-tasting beers of today keep in the cupboard have highlighted the particular propensity for them to lose their flavour over time.According to a paper produced by the Catholic University of Louvain, the humulones and cis-humulinones compounds vital to their hoppy taste degrade dramatically within two years of storage.The finding will have particular resonance for some in this period of stockpiling. In the days that immediately followed the coronavirus lockdown in the UK, the website of the retailer Majestic Wine crashed amid fears of a shortage of alcohol.The academics from the Belgian city of Louvain behind the study, Ferreira Silva Guimarães, Antonio Carlos and Sonia Collin, examined the changes in the “bitterness units” in 21 Belgian dry-hopped beers.While it has long been known that the flavour of beer changes over time, the impact of age on highly hopped and especially dry hopped beers has not been examined. In recent years, sales have been on the rise for beers made with strongly flavoured hops derived from the Humulus lupulus plant, or with whole hops added in the fermentation process.The scientists report that humulones, cis-humulinones and hulupones are key to the “sensory and measured bitterness of these beers”.Belgium is Europe’s biggest exporter of beer, according to the latest statistics produced by the Brewers of Europe federation, with exports of 15.8m hectolitres followed by Germany, the Netherlands and the UK. Germany consumed the most beer in 2018, followed by the UK, Spain and Poland.A number of Belgian brewers and distilleries, including Stokerij Rubbens, De Moor and Filliers, have switched to the production of disinfecting hand gel in recent weeks."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd7b4ad41faea2e05234866e9c8d4e2b93ecbfb3/0_1084_6742_4045/master/6742.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=49802319a3df051d55c192f4f5355930","title":"how to cook pad thai recipe","story":"A step-by-step guide to the Thai roadside noodle stand favouriteThough they’re one of Thailand’s most famous culinary exports, these stir-fried noodles are neither traditional, nor even particularly Thai, but a Chinese-influenced dish created in the 1940s as part of a campaign to foster national unity. Delicious to eat and quick to cook, it’s easy to see why pad thai has been so successful at bringing a country together.120g rice noodles, ideally 2-3mm wide flat rice sticks, but any will do really60ml fish sauce, or light soy sauce mixed with a little lime juice or rice vinegar60ml tamarind water (or tamarind concentrate thinned with a little water)60g palm sugar, or maple sugar, maple syrup reduced until caramelised, or dark brown sugar1 pinch chilli powder, to taste2 garlic cloves, peeled100g extra-firm tofu, drained8 large prawns2 large eggs25g preserved salted radish (optional)4 stalks Chinese chives, or spring onions50g roasted peanuts80ml groundnut or vegetable oil1 tbsp small dried shrimp (optional)100g beansproutsLime wedges, chilli flakes, fish sauce and sugar, to garnishPad thai cooks in minutes, so it’s essential to have all the ingredients prepped and ready before you so much as look at the wok. Begin by soaking the rice sticks in cold water for about half an hour, until pliable but still al dente, rather than soft. Drain well and set aside by the hob alongside a small glass of cold water.While the noodles are soaking, make the pad thai sauce. Put the fish sauce, tamarind and palm sugar in a small pan and heat gently, stirring to dissolve the sugar, then turn off the heat. Season with chilli, then taste and adjust the balance to suit your palate. Prepare the remaining ingredients and set them out near the hob in the order they go into the pan (as below). Finely chop the garlic and cut the tofu into bite-sized cubes. Devein the prawns, if necessary (I like to leave them unshelled, but it’s up to you), and crack the eggs into a small bowl. Roughly chop the radish (if using), chives and peanuts.Before you turn on the hob, get ready your serving dishes, cutlery, accompaniments and any dining companions, because the cooking process is very fast. Put a wok on a high heat and, once hot, add half the oil, followed by the garlic, and stir-fry for a few seconds, until aromatic.Add the drained noodles to the wok, along with a splash of the water from the glass, tossing to break up any clumps. Fry until they start to dry out, then add the sauce and cook, tossing continuously, until the noodles are almost done (they should still be slightly chewy, ideally, but it’s a matter of taste just bear in mind that they’ll be cooked a little more before you’re finished).Push the noodles to the side of the wok, so they’re no longer over a direct heat, then pour the remaining oil into the pan. Add the tofu and prawns, and cook, stirring, until the prawns are pink and the tofu starts to colour, then push these to the side of the pan along with the noodles.Pour the eggs into the wok, then break the yolks with your spatula, or whatever implement you’re using to stir-fry. Once the eggs are beginning to set on the bottom of the pan, scramble them roughly and cook until they separate into dry curds.Push the noodles, tofu and prawns back into the middle of the wok and add the radish (if using), dried shrimp, beansprouts, chives and peanuts. Toss together, until everything is well combined, then serve up either in inidual portions or on one big platter, along with the garnishes for diners to add as they wish.This is an easy dish to make vegan, if that’s your preference: fish sauce substitutes are fairly widely available these days (as are gluten-free ones, incidentally), and you can add extra tofu to make up for the animal products (scrambled soft tofu can stand in for the eggs), or add a vegetable of your choice instead, cooking or blanching it first, if need be."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/abb1dcaeb2f6b52eb63e60026b6c5352764478c0/0_30_4047_2428/master/4047.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9ef2d15a232b16861d7877e1c8097e1e","title":"limoncello locktails delicious drinks holiday booze","story":"Do you have bottles of ouzo and curaçao lurking at the back of your drinks cupboard? There’s never been a better time to use them – Britain’s best bartenders explain howIn that spirit (sorry), we asked some of Britain’s best bartenders for simple tips on how best to use up holiday souvenir liqueurs, cocktail party leftovers and collections of sticky, obscure spirits. “You don’t need fancy equipment,” insists award-winning drinks whizz Jack Wakelin. “No jigger? Use an egg cup – it’s about 30ml. No cocktail shaker? Use a cafetière – it’s got a built-in strainer. No long spoon? A chopstick works as well.” With all that in mind … cin-cin!Max Venning, co-owner of Dalston’s Three Sheets, riffs on a Collins, suggesting a large measure of this sweet Italian lemon liqueur and a squeeze of fresh lemon – “it adds brightness” – topped with sparkling water, soda or tonic. Slosh in a vodka for an extra kick.Frequently coloured vivid blue, this bitter orange-flavoured sweet liqueur is, arguably, the last word in naff. But bartenders like Wakelin, who is working on a new Sheffield bar, Bench, relish such a creative challenge. He would combine three parts curaçao, triple-sec or Cointreau with two parts leftover white wine and one part soda over ice. “If you have one, add an olive.”This elderflower liqueur lends itself to what Yann Bouvignies, head bartender at the Rosewood hotel’s Scarfe’s Bar in London, describes as a “wet martini” with the “floral sweetness making it more approachable”. Stir 15ml each of St-Germain and dry vermouth over ice with 45ml of gin, and wave goodbye to all mortal concerns.“This is like a mashup between a bramble and a G\u0026ampT, with a liquorice twist that reminds you of blackcurrant cough sweets,” says Holly Tudor, cocktail development jedi (seriously, that’s her job title) at the Alchemist bar group. Take 15ml of any aniseed spirit (sambuca, raki, pastis), 35ml gin, 15ml lemon juice, 25ml blackcurrant cordial and top with 100ml of soda. “I’ve kept it light – feel free to adjust it to your tastes.”“When you’re sick of making caipirinhas, here’s a Brazilian twist to your aperitif fizz,” says Tudor: 25ml each of fermented sugar cane cachaça, amaretto and lemon juice are mixed and topped with sparkling wine. “The wine’s dryness cuts the cachaça’s sweetness.”Bouvignies would utilise this Hungarian fruit brandy in something akin to a horse’s neck cocktail (50ml pálinka, two dashes of Angostura bitter, ginger ale). Meanwhile, Erik Lorincz, owner of London’s Kwãnt bar, sets it to work in a sour. Take 60ml of preferably peach or pear pálinka, 30ml lemon juice, 15ml sugar syrup (two parts sugar to one part water), an optional half an egg white, shake everything over ice and serve. Venning takes a different approach, mixing pálinka with a squeeze of lemon or orange juice over ice and topping that with chilled, sweetened earl grey tea: “A really refreshing iced tea as the weather warms up.”Wakelin swaps fresh mint for crème in his take on a southside cocktail. Combine 45ml gin, 5ml crème, lime juice and a pinch of salt, then stir in sweetener: “I’m using one spoon of honey I’ve had for ages. Sugar is fine.” Add ice top with tonic. At London’s Darby’s, bar manager Wes Yeung uses crème in Irish coffee. Whisk 10ml into double cream, brew 150ml of coffee, stir in a teaspoon of brown sugar and 35ml of whiskey. Then: “Over the back of a spoon held against the glass just touching the coffee, float cream over the top.”That pine-powered retsina you loved in Crete can taste like a slap in the chops back in Britain. Take the edge off it in a spritz. Add 25ml each of retsina and elderflower cordial, says the Goring hotel’s Tiago Mira, a splash of soda and top with prosecco. Garnish with cucumber. For sweeter versions of retsina cocktails, Benoit Provost, manager at the Stafford London’s American Bar, advises you use Greek mastika instead, a liqueur with a “slightly pine, cedar-like flavour”.This South African cream liqueur “is a good alternative to Bailey’s, if you like that sort of thing,” says Provost, who, like Mira, uses it in a take on the espresso martini. Mira’s recipe has 50ml of vodka, 25ml Amarula and a shot of espresso shaken over ice and served garnished with coffee beans.This family of herbaceous, bitter Italian liqueurs, running from Campari to Fernet-Branca, is enjoying a moment in the UK. Often drunk neat, they are also the basis of Wakelin’s version of a garibaldi, a simple drink of fresh orange aerated with a stick-blender until “nice and fluffy”, spiked with 50ml of your preferred amaro."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5108f3d0365de539c26c9af9817d32f7844d631f/0_81_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dfd32ed10158bcd0d503d40aadb8668d","title":"champions league and europa league could be completed in august","story":"Uefa has called off June’s round of international fixtures, including the Euro 2020 play-offs, and has postponed the current Champions League and Europa League campaigns until further notice amid the coronavirus crisis. It is understood that one option under consideration is that the two club competitions could now be completed in July and August.The governing body of European football met on Wednesday with general secretaries or chief executives of all its affiliated 55 national football associations, including the four British FAs, to receive updates from two working groups formed on 17 March to plot a way the game can resume following the total shutdown of professional sport this past month. The outcome was an almost complete suspension of activity until further notice, from youth competitions to the continent’s most prestigious tournaments in both the men’s and women’s games.With this summer’s men’s European Championship having already been postponed until 2021, pressure to complete the play-offs – which include Scotland v Israel, Bosnia-Herzegovina v Northern Ireland and Slovakia v Republic of Ireland – is not imminent. England’s two scheduled friendly matches in June, in Austria and at home to Romania at Villa Park, are also off.The question of what to do with the Champions League and Europa League, however, is more pressing. Both competitions were suspended in March with four ties remaining to be completed in the Champions League last 16, including Manchester City’s with Real Madrid and Chelsea’s with Bayern Munich. In the Europa League, none of the eight last-16 ties have been completed, with two first legs yet to take place.The women’s Champions League had reached the quarter-final stage but none of the four first-leg ties had been played.While a proposal to play the remaining matches in both men’s competitions in the summer months was one plan put under consideration, it is also accepted that the later they are delayed the more preference must be given to the completion of domestic seasons.A Uefa representative said the working group set up to examine rescheduling possibilities discussed different scenarios only on the basis that all matches will be completed, by the end of August at the latest. The meeting, held by video conference as all of Europe’s football and club administrators are in effect working from their homes, did not discuss the different decisions that the game could face if the current season cannot be concluded by August.With an acceptance that finishing by the end of June is now in effect impossible and even starting by then is optimistic, the working group is understood to have modelled different possibilities for restarting competitions, if an end of June date is possible, or July, and finishing them by August. The group has not modelled stripping back the remaining Champions and Europa League ties, for example by reducing two-legged rounds to one match. Different ways of trying to conclude competitions have been considered such as trying to finish domestic league seasons first then completing the Uefa competitions rapidly, all in one go, after that.Uefa stressed, as it did when the Euros were postponed, that many of Europe’s FAs will suffer a severe financial hit from missing out on international football, including friendlies, whose TV rights are now mostly sold centrally by Uefa, which distributes the money to the member associations. All FAs will now lose or have delayed this TV and matchday income, and for many of the smaller football countries’ FAs such revenues are very important to funding their administration costs and development programmes.An effort will be made to reschedule all the postponed friendlies next season, possibly by squeezing international breaks to take in three matches rather than the two that have been standard for years. Doing so will require a slight lengthening of international breaks to enable three matches to be played with the required 72 hours between them, and for clubs to agree that players can be released to play three matches.The English Premier League is set to discuss its own contingency plans at an extraordinary shareholders’ meeting on Friday. One plan involves completing the domestic season during June and July, should conditions allow. While it is also just one of a number of potential solutions set to be discussed, it would have consequences for any plans made by Uefa.At this stage, ho wever, potential rescheduling remains only so many marks on a piece of paper. With coronavirus cases and deaths continuing to rise in Europe and across the world, no one can say with any confidence when professional sport will resume or even in what form."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/df3d02cb6e4f11e6e196cea4940498b379b0d121/0_5_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4c0a0816d956e936a829ac09e0ee9cc7","title":"premier league clubs accused of being in moral vacuum over pay coronavirus","story":"Premier League football has been accused of operating in a “moral vacuum” after clubs cut wages or furloughed non-playing staff but continued to pay players their full wage.Before a meeting on Wednesday at which the Premier League, English Football League and Professional Footballers’ Association will continue talks regarding pay, there was outspoken criticism from politicians.Julian Knight, the chair of the digital, culture, media and sport committee, said: “It sticks in the throat.

Three European teams – the Netherlands, England and Sweden – have qualified for the Olympics after finishing as the three best European teams at the Women’s World Cup in France last summer.The postponement of the tournament will ease pressure on the qualifying calendar. England have qualified for the women’s Euros as hosts of the competition.

With the play-off draw initially scheduled for 25 September and those matches due to take place in October, there was little wriggle room for a rescheduling of the June matches.The additional year gives the FA time to help women’s football recover from the effects of the coronavirus pandemic but will leave them with a decision to make over the future of the manager Phil Neville, whose contract expires in 2021.

You have to differentiate time.”Ramsey suggests limiting your exposure to TV news. “The constant news is such a dynamic change at the moment and it’s all negative,” he says. “Picking it up once a day will give you time to do other stuff.” He also stresses the importance of exercise. “If you are healthy physically, you will be healthy mentally. I used to exercise with dumbbells in my cabin, which was tiny. And keep mentally fit as well. It’s about reading books and doing something different. This is an ideal opportunity to learn something new.”He describes a submarine as “a steel tube with 130 people in it” and admits there can be friction on a long deployment. “De-conflict early,” he says. “Have a chat find out what the issues are.”His final piece of advice is to “enjoy what’s there”. Focus on what you have got rather than what you are being denied. “Try to stay off the topic of what happens next,” he says. “You can only control what you can control.” Jamison is president of the English Benedictine Congregation and author of Finding Happiness: Monastic Steps for a Fulfilling Life. Drawing on almost 50 years experience as a monk, he has helped set up a website, alonetogether.org.uk, which addresses loneliness and self-sufficiency raised by the current crisis.“The whole country is going through waves of different feelings,” Jamison says. “One that came up most in the early stages was anger. People were angry with people in supermarkets angry with people who were stockpiling angry with people who didn’t stay at home. There is also a lot of fear around and, later, people will feel lonely and bored.”How does the monastic tradition help counter such feelings? “If you just leave the day undifferentiated, it can get on top of you. But if you create your own rhythm, you’ll find that the day is more sustainable, bearable and enjoyable.”Jamison draws a distinction between boredom and lethargy. “Boredom is when there is absolutely nothing to do. Lethargy is when there are things to do that you can’t be bothered doing. Most people suffer the latter, but they call it the former because it lets them off the hook. In the monastery, people are always ringing bells telling you what to do next, so you don’t have time to be bored.”Positivity is the key. “Do not begin the day by rehearsing your grievances. Begin by remembering you’re alive and there are good things still. You may have to do tough things later, but take it one step at a time. Begin with gratitude then ask for the grace to face the day and its difficulties. Then go and address the difficulties.” Doesn’t all that presuppose a belief in God? “You can,” Jamison insists, “be grateful without believing in God.”In 1969, Knox-Johnston became the first person to make a nonstop single-handed circumnavigation of the globe when he was the only competitor in a round-the-world yacht race to make it home. He was in his late 20s, and sailing a 32ft yacht the journey took 312 days. Ten weeks into the voyage, Knox-Johnston’s radio broke down. “It was very frustrating,” he says. “I could hear people calling me, but I couldn’t respond.” For four and a half months, nothing was heard of him. The Times prepared an obituary.How did he keep himself together mentally? “That worried me,” he admits. “I took to learning poetry. I had a lovely anthology by Field Marshal Wavell called Other Men’s Flowers. I committed all these wonderful poems to memory. I’d sit there steering while reciting to myself.“I tried to keep to a regular schedule. Sleep during the night, although obviously at times you couldn’t because you had to be on deck. I’d make myself dinner, check everything was all right, then go and have some sleep, wake three or four hours later, check things, go back to bed again. Then, as the sun rose, I’d get up, have a cup of coffee, make breakfast, check the boat and take my sights to work out where I was.” Food was fairly basic, but he had taken 12 bottles of whisky, 12 of brandy and 120 cans of beer, and he enjoyed a whisky or brandy with a cigarette before dinner. Did he ever get drunk? “You’re on your own,” he says emphatically. “That would be pretty stupid.”Did he miss company? “Oh God, yes,” he says, just as emphatically. “Going past Australia with my receiver working and picking up dance music on a Saturday night. You thought: ‘What the hell am I doing out here on my own?’ But then you think: ‘I’m still in this. I’m not giving this up for anything.’” And sex? “You have to put it out of your mind,” he says. “You need all your energy for the boat.”Byrne has lived with her husband on the island of Colonsay (population 135) in the Inner Hebrides for more than 40 years, first running a hotel and now a bookshop.  It is one of the most isolated communities in the UK. For Byrne self-sufficiency is a way of life. “Other people are used to shopping every day for what they’re going to eat,” she says. “We shop for a month. It’s a completely different mindset.”There are pros and cons to island life. “There is no crime, and people look out for each other. On the other hand, people know everyone else’s business.” Does the isolation ever get her down? “No”, she says. “I am a very easy person. But for some people it’s almost impossible. That’s why we can’t sustain much of a population here. It’s heaven on a spring morning, but for weeks and months in the winter it’s really hard.”Byrne says the years-long feuds that used to characterise island life have lessened. “People have their opinions and sometimes it would make your hair curl listening to what people say, but overall we do realise we’re all in this together.” She also says the drinking culture is not what it was. “People have woken up to the fact that having at least one car in the ditch every weekend is not a good idea.”Her tips for the newly isolated? “Keep busy. Don’t slouch around. Get up in the morning, get dressed, have a plan. It’s too easy to fritter away your time, and that is very soul-destroying.” Does she ever get bored? “I don’t really,” she says. “There’s always a good book to read, especially if you own a bookshop.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad183acc3f81d16c084096aa04e9e9c92fa1c1e4/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ecde454562a1be3aadb5a939a5fa1eba","title":"big issue to be sold in stores for first time after street sales paused","story":"Magazine will be sold in McColl’s and Sainsbury’s outlets to raise money for homeless vendorsThe Big Issue is to go on sale in supermarkets for the first time in an effort to make money for vendors left without income during the coronavirus outbreak.The magazine, normally sold on the street by homeless people, is to be sold in selected Sainsbury’s and McColl’s stores after sales were paused on 22 March to protect the health of its vendors.John Bird, who set up the Big Issue 29 years ago, said: “The future of the magazine is at risk if we don’t get £60,000 through subscriptions for the magazine or digital issues. If we don’t get that within a month or two we will have nothing, as all our income comes from the street sellers. We have never built up large banks of money, and all the money raised has gone back to the product.”He added: “For health reasons we stopped selling it on the streets the weekend before last and we have been campaigning to turn the magazine into a digital magazine or one you can buy through subscription or at supermarkets and newsagents.”Bird said the money would be given to homeless vendors around the country, and the organisation was trying to track down around 500 sellers. It has already been in contact with 1,000 iniduals.“It will take longer for the vendors to get money than it normally would, but it will start to flow once the system is up and running. At the moment we are building the system,” he said.Customers will be able to purchase copies in 164 Sainsbury’s stores initially, extending to 315 over the coming weeks, and 1,430 McColl’s stores, for the price of £3. The Big Issue is also going to be launching an app. “You can also buy a magazine online or subscribe for three months whilst your vendor isn’t on the street,” Bird added.Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury’s commercial director, said: “We are proud to be supporting a cause as important as The Big Issue Group, which exists to offer homeless people, or iniduals at risk of becoming homeless, the opportunity to earn an income. Coronavirus has affected everyone in the UK, and it’s important that we show our support for each other in these increasingly challenging times.“We hope that by providing a means for our customers to purchase a copy of the Big Issue, we can encourage people to continue to buy the magazine, which so many vulnerable people rely on.”Since the Big Issue launched in 1991, more than 200 million copies have been sold by more than 100,000 vulnerable people.

But it is willing to consider following other European countries and implement a funding model “linked directly to an existing common household bill” such as an internet connection, council tax, or electricity supply.“This would be a significant change for the UK and we are not, at this stage, advocating it,” the corporation said in its submission. “It does however raise an interesting question as to whether the current system could be made much simpler, more efficient and more automated. We are open to exploring this further.”The consultation on whether to decriminalise non-payment of the licence fee closes on Wednesday, with the BBC warning that the initial cost of creating a new system where non-payment is enforced as a civil debt – similar to a utility bill – would be almost £300m.The former culture secretary Nicky Morgan launched the consultation on decriminalisation two months ago, in the aftermath of a rancorous general election campaign in which the BBC’s news output came under fire from across the political spectrum. At the time, Downing Street was picking a fight with the BBC, stopping ministers from appearing on major political programmes and warning of a forthcoming upheaval and a need to cut the corporation down to size.The approach has changed substantially since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, with Downing Street making peace with news outlets and the BBC – along with other broadcasters - attracting enormous audiences for its programmes featuring prime ministerial press conferences and providing public health advice.The corporation argued strongly that the existing criminal sanctions should remain in force until the BBC’s royal charter is renewed in 2027, arguing that – unlike a civil system – magistrates had the flexibility to impose appropriate fines that take into account an inidual’s circumstances.About 130,000 people were prosecuted in 2018 for non-payment of the licence fee, with the substantial majority being women who are more likely to live alone or be at home when enforcement officials knock on doors. Five people in England and Wales were ultimately sent to prison for failing to pay court-ordered fines.“The BBC is a universal service – one to which everyone contributes and everyone receives something in return,” said the BBC in its argument to maintain the current system. “Any system based on a universal contribution must have a sufficient deterrent and sanction to ensure that principle holds up and the system is fair to those who do pay, as well as those who don’t.”It also pointed out that the current system indirectly subsidised the court system, through the estimated £28m a year charged in magistrates’ fees to people prosecuted for non-payment.The BBC is already facing a financial black hole, having suspended this summer’s planned introduction of the licence fee for most over-75s by at least two months, to ensure older viewers do not feel threatened or cut off. Cuts to BBC News staffing levels have also been postponed, while the national lockdown has also led to the suspension of visits to homes by TV licensing officials, meaning evasion is likely to increase as people suspected of watching television without a licence are no longer being chased for payment.Many iniduals in the corporation view the lockdown as a chance to show ministers what a public service broadcaster can do for a country in crisis, especially with commercial media outlets facing a dire outlook due to a collapse in the advertising market."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ee1c2bc0787f87636cf193387dab43124022f02/87_250_5965_3582/master/5965.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=559bb5c656298f728662c42316d4d088","title":"from houseparty to zoom our digital lives in lockdown","story":"The lockdown across the world has led people to desperately seek out new tools for maintaining their work and social lives online.

That night it started to fall.“To my surprise, it did not come back,” she recalls of the fever. “My body finally began to fight it off and the next day they told me I could go home the day after if everything stayed stable.“I was so relieved. I had kept thinking I should’ve been admitted earlier and feared it was too late. It was the most terrifying experience of my life.”More than 29,000 people across the UK are confirmed to have contracted Covid-19, and it is thought that thousands more have it. The disease has killed 2,352 people in the UK so far.Meanwhile, 174,019 people globally are known to have recovered. The number in the UK remains unclear, but heartening reports are beginning to emerge.“I actually got out of bed today, which is huge,” says 51-year-old Lou, in Chalfont St Peter in Buckinghamshire. “I thought I was dying Wednesday last week, when I couldn’t take a breath and was losing consciousness.”Paramedics who came to Lou’s house found that her temperature exceeded 104F and her blood pressure and oxygen intake had dropped. She was rushed to hospital along with her husband, who was also symptomatic. She was tested for Covid-19 on Friday and is still awaiting her results.In hospital she was put on a drip and given a variety of drugs, and her condition stabilised. She was discharged several days later as the choking feeling began to ease and her fever subsided.“It makes you think: sod bloody work. When this is over, we are having fun,” she says. “It’s baby steps, but we are slowly getting there.”Only patients with the worst symptoms are being admitted to hospital, and 22-year-old Ryan is among many whom 111 call handlers have told to stay at home and self-isolate unless they have severe difficulties breathing.“I’m very relieved I recovered,” says Ryan, a third-year engineering student at Imperial College London, telling of coughing red phlegm, exhaustion, night sweats and nausea. “I couldn’t get out of bed when the fever was at its worst. I lost my appetite and could barely drink water.”He says he is usually healthy and that the ordeal has been a big shock. Now he just wants to return to his home country, Malaysia. Jenny, 59, a former GP in Falkirk who has multiple sclerosis, isolated herself from her vulnerable family and has since been able to resume normal life.Although she is still quite fatigued and has to stop to catch her breath while walking through her village, she has now returned to caring for her partner, who is undergoing chemotherapy, and her father, who has dementia.Jenny stresses her desire to give people optimism about recovery and the importance of isolating if you have symptoms. “Every single one of us can make a difference in the flattening of the epidemic curve,” she says.For Ati, the episode has given her a new sense of community.“We started to see messages from neighbours, my GP and friends offering help,” she says. “It was so comforting to see how society comes together.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fcfc7df46df365dbee9a06a2de008089b4c4704e/0_191_4290_2572/master/4290.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8119c0a85cec9e333b2956e525110cb5","title":"my favourite game graham gooch v india lords 1990","story":"On that day, when Test triple hundreds were still extremely rare, it felt as if we were watching history in the makingI was 17. The end of the summer term had been dominated by Italia 90 and Friday nights dabbling in snakebite and black. I had little idea what I was doing with my life, apart from extra shifts behind the bread counter at Sainsbury’s and getting down to the business of failing my first driving test, thanks to Guildford’s dystopian Stoke roundabout.Meanwhile cricket rumbled on. Following England had become quite the cathartic wallow. Since the dazzle of the 1985 Ashes, their performances had limped from unfortunate to woeful. They had won only two series – an Ashes away romp in 1986-87 and a one-off Test against Sri Lanka.The nadir had come the summer before, when the selectors had shelled 29 players during the 4-0 Ashes thrashing and the side had been decimated by a rebel tour to South Africa. That winter, out of favour or pushing stout, David Gower and Ian Botham were left out of the touring party. Cricket was teetering into irrelevance.The early visitors that 1990 summer had been New Zealand, a series overshadowed almost entirely by the World Cup – though Michael Atherton did make a maiden Test century. But the hosepipe ban months smouldered on and India arrived, led by the (pre-disgrace) Mohammad Azharuddin and including the young Sachin Tendulkar.My dad had secured tickets for the Friday of the first Test, at Lord’s, and off we trundled on the train with my brothers, meeting a couple of uncles and cousins in the queue. Graham Gooch, skipper since the disastrous summer of the four captains, was 194 not out overnight and we speculated, over doughnuts, as to whether he could make it to 200.We didn’t have to wait long. His casual acknowledgement seeped into the mood and the early part of the first session passed in fairly relaxed style, with Gooch and Allan Lamb palming off India’s bowling as people mooched through their broadsheets. But as he reached 250, collective ears pricked up. On he went, past Wally Hammond’s 251, Glenn Turner’s 259, through the 260s, overtaking Graeme Pollock and Zaheer Abbas on 274, past Compton, May, Richards IVA, and Bradman, again, to reach, after a hiccup of hesitation, a triple hundred, which brought with it the outrageous gesture of removing his helmet.Twitter would have had a field day but in the analogue age all the work was done by the knowledge of the crowd itself and TMS, who knew the beauty of a slow burn through a Walkman, and allowed the excitement to bubble and foam.The glut of Test triple hundreds was yet to come, no one had passed 300 since Lawrence Rowe in 1974. Gary Sobers had held the highest Test score since 1958, his 365 a stat imprinted on every fan’s mind. As Gooch inched towards it, the crowd’s nerves showed not in bedlam, but skittish silence, superstitions bloomed and even the champagne corks knew their place.All those training runs round Chelmsford had done their job as Gooch ploughed on, a most unlikely record breaker in his white cycle helmet, his short-sleeved shirt and droopy moustache. But with Bradman’s 334 and Wally Hammond’s 336 in spitting distance, he got an inside edge from a tired drive and was bowled. After 10 and a half hours he trudged modestly off, the crowd let out a collective sigh, and he was gone, applauded through the wicker gate and right up though the Long Room.The collective joy of having been there and the wonder of English cricket having a tiny moment in the sun lasted a long time and to those of us who had watched on television the fall of the Berlin Wall the previous winter it felt like we, too, had witnessed our own little bit of history."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9c57efb5699635f3522a2ebc05ed3463d8005179/0_0_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=86e944789ef85164ebe345c5a6ba084a","title":"uka urged to gift tokyo anniversary games to ease tension with west ham","story":"UK Athletics can end its spat with West Ham United over whether the Premier League club can stage the Anniversary Games at the London Stadium in July by gifting this year’s event to Tokyo free of charge instead, says the UKA’s former chair.Ed Warner, who led UK Athletics from 2007 to 2017, said his “radical” proposal would not only save millions of pounds that could be erted towards fighting the Covid‑19 pandemic, but would also be seen as a “gift from London to sports fans around the world”.The war of words between UKA and West Ham over what will happen to the London Stadium if the football season has resumed by July has become increasingly heated with West Ham rejecting calls from UKA’s chief executive, Joanna Coates, to waive tenancy rights so the stadium can be reconfigured to stage the Anniversary Games on 4-5 July.While the contracts that UKA and West Ham hold with the London Legacy Development Corporation call for an element of “reasonableness”, West Ham made clear this week that when the Premier League resumes the London Stadium will be configured for football “and not inappropriately set up for an athletics meeting or a concert”. With no solution to the impasse in sight, and UKA facing a crippling financial blow if its flagship event is not staged, Warner has urged both sides to think laterally and creatively and send a goodwill message to the Olympic host city that has seen its Games postponed for 12 months.“The ill-advised cost-saving exercise when the stadium was revamped after the London 2012 Games means that reconfiguring the seating takes around two weeks,” Warner said. “This is a hugely labour-intensive exercise reported to cost up to a staggering £8m a time, and social distancing guidelines militate against a nonessential project like the stadium seat move.“Tokyo should be encouraged to revert to the Anniversary Games’ original structure and add a third day of elite Para athletics, so creating the tastiest of appetisers for both next year’s Olympics and Paralympics.”Warner, writing on the iSportConnect website, said he was convinced that the World Athletics president, Sebastian Coe, would recognise the value of the switch. He also believed the BBC, UKA’s broadcast partner, would be delighted with an event likely to pull in an audience of “maybe five or 10 times its usual two million viewers”, while Müller, the headline commercial partner, “would receive unimagined global exposure”.“The Legacy Company would save the exorbitant costs of moving the London Stadium’s seats, more than enough to make a payment equal to the average profit UKA made from the event in recent years,” Warner said. “This would shore up the governing body’s fragile finances and remove the virus uncertainty hanging over it. The mayor’s remaining saving – perhaps as much as £5m – could be committed to a fighting fund for community sports clubs in Newham and the other London Olympic boroughs to help them weather the effects of the pandemic.“West Ham, given a clear run at completing their season at home, should be encouraged to top up this fighting fund, or instead commit additional resources to the excellent community work already undertaken by the club’s charitable foundation.”Warner said that such an event would also help Tokyo prepare for next summer’s Olympics. “A two- or three-day Diamond League event in its shiny new National Stadium would prove the hottest ticket anywhere in the world this year and a guaranteed money-spinner. Has there ever been a better test event for an Olympic venue?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9475d7c1406be31fb6442fe5a7256f8bbce92b06/0_14_1920_1152/master/1920.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e373b0d9dea9230ca6defb8094ed1c1b","title":"cabin fever agenda for housebound olympics","story":"Amateur pastimes provide fair entertainment when the alternative is staring at the wall or, worse, watching the newsIf you know one thing about CB Fry, it’s that he was a man of many talents. He made a Test century against Australia, tied the world long‑jump record, took a five-wicket haul at Lord’s, won a cap for England at right-back, started an FA Cup final for Southampton and played three games on the wing for the Barbarians.His CV reads like a schoolboy’s daydream. But there is nothing in it quite so unlikely as his ability to make a standing leap on to a mantelpiece. Fry is the man who declined the throne of Albania and tried to forestall the war by teaching the Nazis to play cricket but, when all is said and done, that party trick was his pièce de résistance.According to Fry’s biographer, Wallis Myers, Fry would “face the mantelpiece, crouch down, take a leap upwards, turn in the air, and bow to the ‘gallery’ with his feet planted on the shelf”. The way Myers tells it, “persuasion would occasionally get him to perform this ‘turn’ at country houses, much to the interest of guests”. Others who knew Fry say he didn’t need all that much persuading.Years later the playwright Ben Travers recalled that Fry, in a fit of enthusiastic reminiscence, had to be talked out of demonstrating it in the library at Lord’s. He was in his mid-70s at the time.I was thinking about it the other day, when, in the first stirrings of cabin fever, I found myself eyeing the living room mantelpiece like it was some distant mountain, 110cm tall, with a scented candle, a clock, and a picture of the kids on top. A domestic Everest. “Challenge is what makes men,” said Edmund Hillary, 20 years after he had become the first person to make the summit. “When men stop looking for challenges, we human beings will be in a very bad way.”Hillary would be heartened to know that even in the thick of the lockdown people haven’t quit yet. New challenges abound, even within these four walls.Here’s Pan Shancu, running an ultra-marathon around two dining tables in his living room in Hangzhou, 6,250 laps, or 50km, in 4hr 48min 44sec. “I have not been outside for many days, today I cannot bear sitting down any more,” he explained. And Elisha Nochomovitz, who swapped the Barcelona marathon for a run back and forth along the seven-metre strip of balcony outside his flat in Toulouse. “I needed to assure myself I could still run 40km.” He finished in 6hr 48min and said his neighbours were “very understanding” about the sound of his feet pounding up and down.And James Page from Sidcup, who just completed his in 873 50-metre laps of his back garden. “I’ve trodden down all the grass, from out the window you can see a perfect trek of the loop I was running,” he said. “My wife’s not too happy.”There is sport to be found in the most unlikely places. Like the viral clips of the two men playing paddle tennis between their neighbouring windows on the fourth floor of their apartment block (their rally lasted 28 shots) and the pair playing ping pong with frying pans and a net made out of pasta boxes. Or Ian Bell lacing a bog roll down the corridor for four (“Don’t bowl there, son,” he tells his kid) or Lionel Messi doing keepie-uppies with one (which brought to mind Michel Platini’s line: “What Zidane does with a ball, Maradona could do with an orange.”).There is a whole world of this nonsense out there to revel in and the beginnings of a roster of desperate events for a housebound Olympics to fill the gap left by Tokyo 2020. There are new sports waiting to be invented, new heroes to be discovered.Heroes such as Silvio Sabba, who holds 234 Guinness world records. Many of them seem eminently breakable until you try. Among them, the tallest toilet roll tower built in 30 seconds (28 rolls), and the greatest number of eggs held in one hand, palm down (eight), the most pairs of underpants put on in 30 seconds (16), the most uncooked grains of rice moved with chopsticks in one minute (38), the tallest tower made out of Ferrero Rocher stacked on top of each other (12), the most sugar cubes balanced on the chin (17), and most coins stacked in one minute (69).Sabba also holds the world records for the highest standing jump made on one leg (1.364m) and the highest standing jump on to a balance board (1.213m). He apparently considers that last one his masterpiece, but then he hasn’t yet attempted a standing leap on to a mantelpiece."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/56b3b1b2654e92a94268fd1b271c98fc41e8f644/0_318_3082_1848/master/3082.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c5680a7c9a0d7ebdd90257a60fb8f06f","title":"reading shakespeare book plays emma smith","story":"With theatres closed, now is the time to find pleasure in Shakespeare’s texts. His first fans used them for chat-up lines – and read the plays without the baggage of BardolatryThat Shakespeare wrote for the theatre and that his plays should be enjoyed on the stage not the page has become the standard rallying cry of directors, teachers and academics. “I don’t think people should bother to read Shakespeare. They should see him in the theatre,” Sir Ian McKellen advised in 2015. And if actors bring Shakespeare to life, according to Royal Shakespeare Company director Greg Doran, the benefits are mutual: advocating a “Shakespeare gym” earlier this year, Doran suggested that without proper opportunity to perform Shakespeare, the craft of acting itself could “diminish or get lost”.But this is a modern perspective. Powerful advocates for Shakespeare in the past were less convinced by the medium of theatre. Samuel Johnson, the great 18th-century lexicographer and editor of the plays, felt that while comedy was often better experienced in the theatre, tragedy rarely was. Charles Lamb, who with his sister Mary wrote the popular children’s Tales from Shakespeare, suggested that “the plays of Shakespeare are less calculated for performance on a stage than those of almost any other dramatist whatever”. When we watch King Lear, he suggested, we see merely the mundanely pitiful “old man tottering about the stage with a walking-stick”, but when “we read it, we see not Lear but we are Lear”. Deep engagement with the plays meant private study, not public spectacle.This Titus reader was certainly not in awe of Shakespeare – and perhaps hadn’t even heard of him: the play, like the others printed over the next four years, was issued anonymously. But by the end of the decade, 13 other plays had been printed, in more than 20 separate editions. These playbooks often advertised their origins in performance – the first edition of Romeo and Juliet has as a blurb “often (with great applause) played publicly” – but they clearly also established their place in the print marketplace. Gradually, some of the apparatus we now take for granted in a printed play began to be more standardised, and playbooks offered lists of characters and more descriptive stage directions to aid readers. Title pages frequently claimed that the texts were “newly corrected and augmented”: the second edition of Hamlet told buyers that it was “enlarged to almost as much again as it was”. More was definitely more when it came to Shakespeare’s readers.That doesn’t mean that early readers necessarily slogged through entire plays from start to finish. Copies of the first collected edition of Shakespeare’s plays, the First Folio of 1623, often show great enthusiasm at the start of the volume, which tails off with readers’ best intentions. Ideas of reading in this period were, in any case, less immersive and more strategic. The educated reader harvested from the play useful or exemplary phrases with which to enhance their own writing, marking them in the margin of the book with a symbol or line. This activity of commonplacing cherrypicked from literary texts in order to create reusable fragments. Reading was effectively a stage in verbal recycling.In some ways this anticipates our own culture of Shakespeare quotations, but with one major difference. For us, the mark of the quotation is its utter distinctiveness. Early modern readers were looking for something that was a bit more adaptable to their own context. No one seems to have had much everyday use for now-famous highlights such as “To be or not to be”, or “A horse, a horse, my kingdom for a horse”, whereas flowery phrases for use in letter-writing in Love’s Labour’s Lost are frequently commonplaced. One copy of The Tempest marked by an early reader does not seem to notice Prospero’s lyrical: “Our revels now are ended”, but is deeply impressed by Ferdinand’s cheesy chat-up lines to the unworldly Miranda: “Tis fresh morning with me When you are by at night.” Early modern readers of Shakespeare felt no embarrassment about taking from the plays what they wanted, and no obligation to the author’s larger intention.Perhaps we could recover that liberated form of reading as we return to the plays on the page while the theatres are dark. Early modern readers encountered Shakespeare’s plays without the cultural baggage of centuries of Bardolatry. I like the simple pathos of one early woman reader, Frances Wolfreston who lived near Tamworth, who wrote on her copy of Othello: “a sad one”. Shakespeare’s first readers engaged in acts of rewriting where they felt the original was lacking or could be improved. They took from their reading the aspects that were most relevant to their own lives, or the phrases they felt they might be able to use or imitate in their own writing. They enjoyed the texture of verbal detail rather than an overall narrative arc. Although we know that many early readers of Shakespeare were also enthusiastic playgoers, they found that the pleasures of reading were distinct from those of the theatre. Maybe we can too."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5917f9514253fb0dba9f05f00ab9ba841a6cff31/0_903_4541_2725/master/4541.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0bda899d46cc81ad48c37c6bc6a063fb","title":"how do you feel when you wake up in the morning","story":"Having the right mattress is key to a good night’s sleep. Choose yours wisely, says sleep expert Dr Rangan Chatterjee Do you wake up with an aching back? With pain in your neck? Or an acute need for high-strength coffee? How you feel the second your alarm goes off tells you legions about how well you slept. And the underlying cause of your sleep issues could be literally lying under you: your mattress is the foundation to a good night’s rest.“One of the big problems with sleep is that we underestimate the importance of getting eight quality hours,” says Dr Rangan Chatterjee, M\u0026ampS sleep ambassador and author of The Stress Solution. “Once you prioritise your sleep, it automatically improves.” Sleep is fundamental to how we feel in the day. If you look in the brain after a bad night’s sleep, says Chatterjee, “you see a collapse in memory, attention, cognitive function, decision-making capacity and the ability to learn new things.” And an increased likelihood of exploding when there’s an unexpected item in the bagging area at the supermarket, because a bad night’s sleep is synonymous with a bad mood.Admittedly, we all have a few big nights out and accidental midnight Netflix binges, but sometimes we’re unable to sleep well through the night at no fault of our own. And a common culprit? That old mattress you’ve been making do with. “When your mattress is so comfortable that you can’t wait to get into bed in the evening, you send a powerful message to your body and brain,” says Chatterjee. Think of finding the right mattress as an act of self-care, up there with going to yoga or cooking a healthy dinner.Waking up covered in sweat isn’t necessarily a symptom of nightmares. The answer is more practical than that, says Chatterjee: “Being physically hot at night will wake you up. Being cool is critical to good sleep, so keep your bedroom at a cool, well-ventilated 17C.” If keeping the window open isn’t an option, or you’re still overheating, treat yourself to a cooling mattress topper or a luxury mattress with thermoregulating properties.If you often wake up feeling stiff, a memory foam mattress can feel like a miracle. The material is also supportive if you’re tossing and turning, or you have joint problems. “For some people, memory foam can be absolutely life-changing,” says Chatterjee. “The material adapts to your weight and body shape, so it’s very personalised.” As your body sinks into the mattress, you may even feel your spine start to stretch out. It’s the restorative antidote to hunching over a desk during the day.So how do you know you’ve found the right mattress? Simple, says Chatterjee: “When you lie down and you don’t want to get up.” Sweet dreams.The natural option: Made using cashmere, silk, pashmina, lambswool and cotton, the Natural Plus 1500 Medium mattress (from £499) is a pocket spring mattress with an enhanced natural and supportive feel.The M\u0026ampS Sleep Shop has everything you need for a great night’s sleep.

The secret to a good night lies in your evening routine, says  Alexandra Jones“We all have our own unique relationship with sleep, but two things are true for all of us: to sleep soundly we need to feel safe and settled in our environment,” says sleep therapist Nerina Ramlakhan, author of Fast Asleep, Wide Awake. The solution is multi-sensory. “Creating a pre-bedtime ritual, incorporating visual, physical or olfactory cues can be a good way to foster those feelings,” she says. “So my most important tip is to find a routine that helps you to drift off and to stick to it.”And it’s not just about the 20 minutes before bedtime. “From the moment you step through the door in the evening, start making the transition from the busyness of the day to a relaxed state that’s ready for sleep,” says Ramlakhan. “There are a few small tricks that can be incorporated into anyone’s evening, no matter how busy.”But where do you start? “Lighting is paramount,” says Ramlakhan. The hormone melatonin is responsible for making us fall asleep the pineal gland in our brain naturally starts to release more melatonin into the bloodstream at night. However, bright lights, especially screen light, can delay the production of melatonin by stimulating a nerve pathway connecting the retina in the eye to an area of the brain called the hypothalamus. “Candles are a good option if you don’t want to delay the onset of melatonin release,” says Ramlakhan. She recommends two hours of low light, giving the brain plenty of time to start pumping the sleep hormone into the system. Opt for the Calm Candle, £7.50, which releases a gentle fragrance mix of clary sage, lavender and sweet orange – formulated to promote relaxation.In fact, lavender has long been used as a natural sedative as far back as the 14th century, Charles VI, king of France, is said to have demanded that lavender be stuffed into his pillows to help him sleep.“My own bedroom is scented with lavender,” says Ramlakhan. Over the past 10 years, several studies have found that, neurologically, the smell of lavender oil has anti-anxiety and analgesic properties. “The scientific benefits of aromatherapy interventions are still being understood, but incorporating them into our night-time routine can make us feel calm from the associations we have with the smell.” As well as lavender, Ramlakhan uses eucalyptus because, as she explains: “It was used in my childhood a lot – and that memory makes it a potent relaxant for me. Adding something with a strong aromatherapeutic smell into your night-time routine can act like a trigger, telling your brain that it’s time for sleep.”When you’re sleeping away from home, bring your bedtime routine with you to reduce the unsettling feeling. So, if lavender is part of your night-time ritual, says Ramlakhan, “the associated behaviour and smell is likely to help you relax and create feelings of safety.” Ren Pillow Spray, £19, is blended with essential oils, including lavender.Alternatively, switching your regular shower gel to something like L’Occitane Aromachologie Relaxing Shower Gel, £16.50, could work just as well. It has a blend of essential oils that infuse the steam with a relaxing scent. “And if you’ve got time for a bath in the evening, salts are a great way to relax tired muscles,” says Ramlakhan. As well as washing away tension, This Works Deep Sleep Bath Soak, £22, smells ine and will leave your skin feeling soft and hydrated.The trick is not to leave showering or bathing too late. Like light, body temperature plays an important role in preparation for the night the process of rapid cooling after a hot shower is proven to aid sleep, but it takes about 90 minutes to reach peak drowsiness.

The government talks about abolishing the licence fee. Certain newspapers compete to haul the programme makers over the coals for various crimes, from “woke” casting to “mucking around” with classics. There are rumours of declining ratings and mutterings about the muscle of Netflix and Amazon. Add to that a pandemic that has forced some of the corporation’s biggest dramas – including Line of Duty and Peaky Blinders – to cease production and it would be no surprise to find Piers Wenger in a pessimistic mood. In fact, the opposite is true.“It’s been a really mad time,” says the head of BBC drama. “But it’s also been inspiring in terms of the ingenuity creators, producers and casts are showing to get their shows on screen.” He’s been holding “daily calls to talk about the longer term impact this crisis will have on the kind of story audiences are most in need of”.There have been talks, too, about how to protect the BBC’s huge swath of freelance talent. “I’ve spent the day talking about how the BBC will support small and medium-sized production companies who will find the closedown particularly challenging – and how we work with established industry bodies to support freelancers, through a hardship fund or some other means. It’s something we’re taking seriously because, yes, people expect the BBC to do the right thing – and quite rightly, given the way we’re funded.”Wenger is clearly pleased with the swiftness of the corporation’s wider response to the pandemic, from the extended news coverage to an array of educational, health and cultural programming, not to mention the decision to bring back old favourites such as Spooks to iPlayer. “We need to shape the output – whether you’re school age, seeking escape, looking for drama at 9pm, or want a comedy that really makes you laugh and reflects the soul of the nation, like This Country.”That said, it’s clear the past few days have brought a sea change. When we first talked, pre-lockdown, Wenger stressed the importance of “drama for me”, as he called it. “Not me personally, but rather for particular demographics instead of a broad mainstream.” This is theme close to the 47-year-old’s heart. Since leaving Channel 4 as head of drama in 2016, he has worked hard to overhaul how the BBC commissions drama, shifting from the general to the specific, to fulfil “bespoke” viewer needs.“If you look at work we’ve got coming up this year and compare it with what might have been commissioned for BBC One five or 10 years ago, you would see how we are making drama for a very erse range,” he said pre-virus. “We would never underestimate the power of communal viewing, but we have to be flexible in the terms of the way we platform our drama. I feel that our current slate is serving the whole population rather than just super-serving the heartlands.”Speaking now, he admits to a different focus. “It’s very interesting to see the extent to which audiences are coming together to enjoy shows that have a really strong universal appeal. Whether it’s The Repair Shop or Ant and Dec’s Saturday Night Takeaway, I think people are taking great comfort from watching together, and knowing they are watching along with the rest of the nation – whereas up to now, the general trend was to seek out stories that were more bespoke. Audiences will continue to want those very particular pieces, but this period will also be a reminder of the sense of community that television can bring to the nation.”So he’s particularly pleased about two upcoming adaptations: David Nicholls’ take on his bestselling marriage-in-crisis novel Us, starring Tom Hollander, Saskia Reeves and Sofie Gråbøl and Normal People, which tackles Sally Rooney’s much-admired young-and-in-love second novel. “Us might not be a super-tanker of a show, but it has a lot of heart and a lot to say about family. While Normal People is both a thrilling ride and incredibly emotionally honest. I think audiences will enjoy losing themselves in the lives of its protagonists.”Not that he’s back-pedalling his support of the year’s most innovative dramas, including the sleek period crime thriller The Serpent Michaela Coel’s provocative contemporary drama January 22nd and Small Axe, Steve McQueen’s anthology series about black British history. Interestingly, all will air on BBC One.“Why should a voice like Michaela’s be confined to the margins?” Wenger says. “Stories like this and Small Axe haven’t been given the big platform they deserve. We’re looking to give the mainstream audience as much stimulation as we can. It makes sense to embrace the most erse range of storytellers that we can. Having Michaela and Steve on BBC One in the same year is massive for the BBC.”Is he concerned that the lockdown might lead to delays? “We’re in the very early stages,” he says. “With Small Axe, Steve has finished shooting and has been editing each episode. We are currently on course, although much will depend on how long the lockdown lasts. Steve has been incredibly pragmatic but there are also obviously things he’s going to be incredibly rigorous about. So it’s hard to say for sure, although the signs are positive.”He is, however, prepared for a backlash when the shows do air. The recent adaptation of Malorie Blackman’s best-selling young adult novel Noughts + Crosses, about a world where black people rule over white people, was called a “recipe for ision” in the Daily Mail. Meanwhile, the casting of Vinette Robinson, who is black, as Mary Cratchit in A Christmas Carol led to predictable complaints.“Oh, the whole woke thing,” says Wenger laughing. “For us not to choose Vinette Robinson, who was the best actress put up for that part, is like saying there weren’t any black people in London in the 19th century, which is just historically inaccurate among other things.”While the pandemic has put talk of cuts and threats to the licence fee on hold, are there still concerns? “Of course. None of us can ignore the discourse around the BBC. For me, conversations about decriminalisation of licence fee non-payment and a subscription model for the BBC just point back in the direction of the importance of being a universal service.“We serve the heartland, but you have to think about young audiences and erse audiences and audiences across the whole nation to justify the licence fee. Quite often when I’m thinking about what to commission, I think who are the hardest people to convince? Which are the toughest nuts to crack? How can I give them a show that will be irresistible to them?”Small Axe, a little-told history that speaks to an audience Wenger feels has been ignored, is crucial in this regard. The first episode of McQueen’s anthology series focuses on the Mangrove Nine, a group of black activists who were tried in 1970 for inciting a riot they had been protesting against police targeting the Mangrove Restaurant in Notting Hill, London, a gathering place for intellectuals and activists. “It gave me the same visceral thrill as Hunger. It’s a defining piece of work from Steve McQueen, told with such purpose and drive and anger that you are stopped in your tracks.”He hopes it will address the ongoing exodus of black British actors to America. “The more work like Small Axe, the more work like January 22nd, the more work like Noughts + Crosses, the more we send a positive message that they don’t have to go. Clearly this has been an awfully long time coming. We’ve got to sustain that supply line of work for a bond of trust to build up, so we hang on to that talent.”This does not mean ignoring the BBC’s other shows, though. There will still be room for Line of Duty to get viewers across the country wound up, as well as such quietly beautiful family dramas as The A Word and Last Tango in Halifax, not to mention state of the nation shockers such as Years and Years, and epics such as World on Fire.What about a show about a global pandemic? There’s ahuge laugh. “Well, never say never – though I have to say, a pandemic drama is not what I’d want to watch when I turn on the TV this evening by any means. But if Russell T Davies phoned me tomorrow and had a completely brilliant genre-busting idea for one, I’d find him very hard to turn down.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/48bc86671256e9365b3d7619597cd77c9752d957/3_0_5901_3543/master/5901.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=80a88789635cab9d660f34cd0446ec89","title":"a listers natalie portman lend talents to bedtime story instagram live initiative during covid lockdown","story":"Natalie Portman and Lupita Nyong’o among those signed up to Instagram Live initiative to raise money for charityAs culture adapts to the limitations imposed by the Covid-19 outbreak there has been myriad new material online, from viral pop parody videos and impromptu classical concerts to TikTok dance-offs and marathon DJ sets. But now the online cultural arms race has shifted to another, less likely target: the humble bedtime story.Several Hollywood actors, music stars and politicians have become children’s storytellers in an effort to support charities and bring some levity during the Covid-19 outbreak, as experts extol the importance of regular routines for parents and children.Natalie Portman, Lupita Nyong’o and Reese Witherspoon have all signed up to an Instagram Live initiative started by fellow actors Amy Adams and Jennifer Garner called Save With Stories, where celebrities read bedtime stories and appeal for donations to Save the Children and No Kid Hungry.In a post on Instagram, Jake Gyllenhaal, who read a Jamie Lee Curtis story called Where Do Balloons Go?, wrote that the charities would “support food banks, and mobile meal trucks, and community feeding programs” to help the estimated 30 million US children who rely on school meals.The show has more than 120,000 followers and the videos have been viewed more than 27m times, with an estimated 18,000 donations so far.“I don’t have any children, but I’ve been watching the videos,” Betsy Zorio, the head of Save the Children’s US programmes and advocacy, told the Hollywood Reporter. “They’ve become a nice little way to take a break during the day and get your mind off the shortage of toilet paper.”On Thursday, Dolly Parton will start her own weekly online storytelling programme by reading The Little Engine That Could. The country star and Glastonbury favourite said the Goodnight With Dolly series on YouTube should act as “a welcome distraction during a time of unrest and also inspire a love of reading and books”.Parton’s charity Imagination Library, which she started in 1996, has delivered more than 130m free books to children, making her known simply as “the book lady” to a generation who might have never heard her songs such as Jolene.Unorthodox choices to get children off to sleep are nothing new. Before the Covid-19 outbreak, the BBC recruited the likes of the Queens of the Stone Age frontman Josh Homme, the Batman and Venom star Tom Hardy and the Captain America actor Chris Evans as narrators for its CBeebies Bedtime Story.With coronavirus perhaps leaving stars with as little to do as much of the rest of the population, a swathe of other names are now doing the same. Other celebrities recruited for the Save the Children campaign include Jimmy Fallon and Gal Gadot, who has already had one Covid-19 viral moment when she appeared in a much maligned celebrity-packed cover version of John Lennon’s Imagine.The bedtime story trend has reached beyond the usual celebrity circles, with the former attorney general and Conservative MP Geoffrey Cox adding his name to the list of night-time narrators.“I’ve been asked to record a children’s bedtime story for while we are cooped up in CV confinement,” he wrote in a tweet introducing his story. Cox chose The Stone Monkey, a Chinese fairytale told by the Victorian author and Chinese language and culture scholar Herbert Allen Giles in what Cox described as “a beautiful little pamphlet” of tales published in 1911. “I hope you enjoy it,” he added.Before becoming attorney general under Theresa May, Cox was arguably best known for having the highest outside earnings in parliament, because he continued to work as a QC while serving as an MP in Devon.Now the politician, whose booming oration was described as sounding like “Uncle Monty played by Brian Blessed”, has joined the ranks of well-known bedtime storytellers. There were suggestions Cox should start narrating audiobooks after a clip of him reading A Visit from St Nicholas, more commonly known as ‘Twas The Night Before Christmas, was widely circulated in December last year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ffd59e90238a4ee6815ed256e586639c37f4255/30_0_3465_2081/master/3465.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bdfae6d6c5acc20a209e6c2488688537","title":"antarctic","story":"Experts say new evidence from Cretaceous period ‘shows us what carbon dioxide can do’Think of Antarctica and it is probably sweeping expanses of ice, and the odd penguin, that come to mind. But at the time of the dinosaurs the continent was covered in swampy rainforest.Now experts say they have found the most southerly evidence yet of this environment in plant material extracted from beneath the seafloor in west Antarctica.The Cretaceous, 145m to 66m years ago, was a warm period during which Earth had a greenhouse climate and vegetation grew in Antarctica.Scientists say the new discovery not only reveals that swampy rainforests were thriving near the south pole about 90m years ago but that temperatures were higher than expected. Such conditions, they add, could only have been produced if carbon dioxide levels were far higher than previously thought and there were no glaciers in the region.“We didn’t know that this Cretaceous greenhouse climate was that extreme,” said Dr Johann Klages of the Alfred Wegener Institute in Germany and a co-author of the research. “It shows us what carbon dioxide is able to do.”Writing in the journal Nature, the team explained how, in 2017, they drilled a narrow hole down into the seafloor near the Pine Island glacier in west Antarctica. This location is about 2,000km (1,200 miles) from today’s south pole, but about 90m years ago it was about 900km from the pole.The hole was drilled and material extracted using a remotely operated rig. “It is like a spaceship sitting on the seafloor,” said Klages.The first few metres of material were glacial sediment, dating to about 25,000 years ago, while the next 25m were sandstone, dating to about 45m years ago – something Klages said was of little interest to the team.As they worked, a huge field of sea ice was approaching. “It was getting a little dangerous,” said Klages. “We said: ‘OK, three more metres and then we can evacuate the coring site here.’ And in this three metres we had this exciting new material.”This three-metre section was composed of mudstone, topped by a coal-like material, and packed with soil from the ancient forest, complete with roots, spores and pollen – with the latter identified as coming from plants including conifer trees and ferns.“It is like if you would go to a forest near your house somewhere and drill a hole into the forest soil,” said Klages. “It is really pristine … it was amazing.”The team found evidence of more than 65 different kinds of plants within the material, revealing that the landscape near the south pole would have been covered in a swampy conifer rainforest similar to that found today in the north-western part of the South Island of New Zealand. The material was dated to between 92m and 83m years ago.It would have had average annual temperatures of 12-13C (53-55F), “which is warmer than in Germany today”, Klages said, adding that analysis of chemicals left by photosynthetic organisms called cyanobacteria revealed that surface waters, for example of lakes, would have been a pleasant 20C.Crucially, said Kages, computer modelling shows that such an environment so close to the south pole – where in the winter there is darkness for four months – would only have been possible if greenhouse gas concentrations were far higher than previously thought and the land surface were covered in vegetation.In other words there were no ice sheets present – something Klages noted had been a matter of debate.Dr James Bendle, an expert in organic geochemistry from the University of Birmingham, said that studying the Antarctic ecosystem was hugely important in understanding past and future climate change, adding that unabated use of fossil fuels use could push concentrations of carbon dioxide to levels similar to those 90m years ago by the start of the next century.“Ultimately, if we have an atmosphere of more than 1,000 parts per million of carbon dioxide, we are committing ourselves to a future planet that has little to no ice, and ultimately an Antarctic continent that would be vegetated and wouldn’t have an ice cover,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7200859fb487792e1336e456cb1a1b0c126614c/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3c3503426875ecac8614c1ddb0a46742","title":"coronavirus at a glance 1 april 900000","story":"A summary of the biggest developments in the global coronavirus outbreakKey developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include:According to data collected by researchers at Johns Hopkins University, 887,067 people around the world have become infected, 44,264 of whom have died. They also count 185,541 people who have recovered.However, it is thought the true scale of the outbreak is significantly greater as concerns are expressed that some countries, including China, have been underreporting their figures.American officials reportedly believe China has been underreporting the total number of cases and deaths.The conclusions of a classified report from the intelligence community to the White House were revealed to Bloomberg by three anonymous officials who declined to detail its contents.They reportedly say the thrust was that China’s concealment was deliberate and that the report was received by the White House last week.The UK government has confirmed hundreds more deaths in hospitals, taking the total to 2,352 the youngest was aged just 13. However, figures from the Office for National Statistics have already revealed that dozens more people have been dying as a result of the pandemic in care homes and other settings, meaning the true total is likely to be considerably higher.Ministers say 152,979 people in the UK have been tested and 29,474 have tested positive.People in the UK have been urged to stay at home as a recent acceleration in the number of cases being reported comes alongside data that suggest people are out and about in their cars more.Prof Yvonne Doyle, Public Heath England’s director for health protection and medical director, said the situation in the UK was less severe than in France, Spain or Italy, but stressed the need to avoid complacency.Deaths from the coronavirus reached 1,096 in New York City as an emergency field hospital opened in Central Park. Data released by the city’s health department showed the virus was having a disproportionate effect in certain neighbourhoods, mainly Brooklyn and Queens.Physical distancing measures have been extended in Germany until at least 19 April, and will be re-evaluated on the Tuesday after Easter, Angela Merkel has said.The German chancellor spoke after a telephone conference with the premiers of Germany’s 16 states on Wednesday afternoon, in which they agreed a draft resolution urging people “to keep contact with people beyond their own household to an absolute minimum, even during the Easter holidays, in accordance with the applicable rules,” according to German media cited by the broadcaster Deutsche Welle.Another 727 people have died in Italy, taking the total to 13,155. That represents the smallest increase since 26 March. Nevertheless, figures from the Civil Protection Agency show that the number of new cases rose more sharply than a few days earlier, growing by 4,782 compared with 4,053.Lockdown measures in the country are to be extended to 13 April, the health minister, Roberto Speranza, has said. He told the Senate on Wednesday: “We must not confuse the first positive signals with an ‘all clear’ signal. Data shows that we are on the right path and that the drastic decisions are bearing fruit.” Spain has crossed the threshold of 100,000 confirmed cases, health officials have said. According to official figures, it has had more cases than any country except Italy and the US. Spain also reached a record single-day death toll between Tuesday and Wednesday, with a total of 864 deaths. The country has logged 102,136 cases of the virus and 9,053 deaths."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6dee53ed3a9f5ab0dac3511d8dd5300f66faf65/0_0_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6545e252bfa8f09bf05d37da87ef68ec","title":"coronavirus uk how many confirmed cases are in your area covid 19","story":"Latest figures from public health authorities on the spread of Covid-19 in the United Kingdom.

Eager to catch up with his birds, Lewis beelined it to his office when he got back to work. “The first thing I did,” he says, “was go and check on my eagle tags.”One bird in particular, Golden Eagle 1703, gave him pause. Lewis knew the animal well. He had tagged it on 26 July 2017, when it was still a nestling on a rocky outcrop in Denali national park and preserve. Even before it knew how to fly, 1703 displayed its might by leaping from its nest and gliding a quarter mile down a valley to evade Lewis’s initial attempt at tagging it. After a short hike, Lewis and his team retrieved the squawking bundle of black and white feathers, outfitted it with the tracking device, and returned it safely to its nest.In the 18 months that followed, 1703 flourished. The bird traversed about 8,000 miles, from Denali to Wyoming, all the way back up to Alaska’s North Slope, where it probably feasted on waterfowl and perhaps a straggling caribou calve of two. From there, it carved a long, treacherous path south through the wilderness of western Canada and worked its way back to the lower 48 to hunker down for its second winter on Earth.Little is known about what golden eagles do in the liminal years between leaving their parents’ nest and settling down to build a nest of their own. Each ping from 1703’s solar-powered GPS revealed a tiny part of the picture, offering a rare glimpse of an apex predator as it learned the ropes of the natural world. “It takes four or five years for them to reach maturity,” Lewis says, “and it’s unknown how long it actually takes them to then compete and get into the breeding population. So you have to follow a bird for years.”But now, staring at his computer screen on that January morning, Lewis could see that 1703’s location device was stationary in Sully county, South Dakota, and had been so for two days. “It was seeing the sun and talking to the satellites,” Lewis says, “but it wasn’t moving.”It’s not uncommon for Lewis to lose a bird. Since 2014, he, along with colleagues from the National Park Service and the US Geological Survey, have tagged 49 golden eagles in Alaska as part of a broader effort to understand their biology, behavior and population trends. Of those birds, only 17 are still being monitored. Sometimes the GPS device malfunctions or the eagle shakes free from it. Other times the bird dies.“It’s a tough world out there,” Lewis tells me, “especially for eagles.” They can starve to death or get electrocuted by high wires or be decapitated by wind turbines. None of those fates, however, seemed likely in the rolling farmland of Sully county.Hoping to get a sense of what went wrong, Lewis opened a souped-up version of Google Earth, plugged in the last GPS coordinates he had for 1703, and began looking around the virtual landscape. There was a nearby road, a line of trees, acres of empty land, and what looked to be a farmhouse. “It definitely felt suspicious,” Lewis says.He called up a Fish and Wildlife office in Pierre, South Dakota, and asked if anyone could go check on a downed eagle tag.Richard Bare wasn’t sure whether to be pissed off or deeply disappointed by the prospect of having to retrieve yet another dead eagle. “I first and foremost suspected a shooting because we were having a rash of eagle shootings,” says Bare, a special agent with FWS’s office of law enforcement, who was stationed in South Dakota at the time. In the five weeks leading up to 1703’s death, he had responded to a bald eagle shooting and two separate golden eagle shootings. None of the birds survived, and he found no evidence to suggest the incidents were related. The case of 1703 seemed like more of the same.While the average American might be shocked to learn of an eagle being intentionally blasted from the sky, those who work in wildlife law enforcement know it’s an alarmingly common problem. According to one FWS report, somewhere in the range of 1,000 golden eagles are shot each year. Sometimes it’s poachers who want to sell the bird’s feathers on the black market, other times it’s ranchers who want to keep the e-bombing predators from snatching their livestock.Bare, who has been a special agent since 2016 and before that spent close to a decade in the field as an FWS game warden (the outdoor world’s equivalent of a beat cop) ballparks that over the course of his career he’s dealt with upwards of 200 cases involving eagles – shootings, poisonings, collisions with cars, starvations. “If you asked me about any other eagle, I probably wouldn’t remember it,” he says. But 1703 “was a flashbulb event” because the weather was memorably miserable, even by South Dakota standards. A punishing cold snap had plunged temperatures well below zero while sustained winds of 50mph ripped across the plains.After a quick chat with Lewis, Bare loaded his cold-weather gear into his truck and hit the road. 1703’s GPS tracker was pinging about five miles north-west of where the Oahe Dam cuts across the Missouri River to form Lake Oahe, one of the nation’s largest man-made reservoirs and fertile hunting ground for birds of prey.When Bare arrived at the location, he saw all the same features that had popped up on Lewis’s computer screen – the quiet country road, the shelter belt of trees and the farmhouse, which in real life was dilapidated and long ago abandoned. A firm layer of snow crunched under his boots as he walked across the field, scanning the ground for any signs of an eagle or an errant GPS tag. Then, among the knee-high wheat reeds that poked through the frozen landscape, Bare spotted what looked to be a clump of tail feathers. He took out his camera and began documenting everything. “Even though something might not be a criminal investigation, I have to treat it as such and maintain the integrity of the evidence,” he says, “the evidence being the eagle in this case.”Only two species of eagles are native to the US – the bald eagle and the golden eagle – and few animals in the world enjoy as many legal protections as they do. In addition to the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and the Lacy Act, which regulates the trade of wildlife, they are privy to the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act, a federal statute that threatens steep fines and jail time for anyone caught killing eagles, disrupting their nests, or generally interfering with the birds.Passed in 1940, the law was originally designed to protect only bald eagles. At the time, the species was teetering on the edge of extinction in the contiguous US as a result of hunting, habitat loss and the toxic effects of DDT. In 1962, Congress amended the act to include golden eagles. Nearly 50 years later, the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act has proven to be a godsend, at least for bald eagles. The national bird is widely considered one of the 20th century’s greatest environmental comeback stories: in 1963, a mere 417 nesting pairs lived in the lower 48. Today well over 10,000 pairs can be found from the suburbs of Boston to garbage dumps near Seattle.Golden eagles haven’t been as lucky. While they are not classified as an endangered or threatened species, they certainly aren’t thriving. FWS estimates that in 1967, there were 31,813 golden eagles in the US. In 2014, the most recent year for which data is available, the agency estimated there were 31,477 golden eagles in our skies. It’s a remarkable stretch of stability, but it’s unclear if the numbers can hold as wind farms rise across the western US and myriad pressures from habitat loss, environmental degradation and the climate crisis push down on raptors and the animals they prey upon.With so many threats looming, Bare knows as well as anyone that the last thing golden eagles need are people shooting them out of the sky. After a few minutes of photographing the area, he dug 1703’s frozen carcass out from under the snow and gave it a once over in the wind-whipped field. Much to his surprise, there were no overt signs of trauma – no bloody bullet hole or broken wing or spilled guts. The bird weighed more than 7lb and, aside from being dead, looked to be in good shape. Still, there was no telling what type of damage might be lurking under its plumage. Bare zipped 1703 into a small body bag and chewed over the possibilities on his drive back to the office.A day or two later, a preliminary X-ray seemed to support his original hunch when it revealed two metal fragments near one of 1703’s wings. “It resembled the approximate diameter of buckshot,” Bare says. Following protocol, he packed 1703 on ice and FedExed it to the National Fish \u0026amp Wildlife Forensics Laboratory in Ashland, Oregon.Like that, 1703 had gone from a high-flying predator to commercial cargo.On any given day, a menagerie of dead animals passes through the FWS’s forensics lab. From the outside, the building looks like most any other government facility – squat, gray, plenty of parking. Inside, it’s filled with sophisticated laboratory equipment and staffed by a small, exquisitely specialized team of scientists whose disciplines range from herpetology to ornithology to ballistics to genetics. When it comes to analyzing evidence of animal-related crimes and building scientifically sound prosecutions against wildlife traffickers, poachers and others who inflict harm on nature’s inhabitants, there is no better place on earth.Like any potential murder victim, 1703 underwent a full postmortem in hopes of pinpointing the cause of death. That task fell to Rebecca Kagan, one of two staff pathologists at the lab. If there’s a federally protected animal that dies under mysterious circumstances, there’s a decent chance it will end up on Kagan’s exam table. One day it’s an endangered Mexican gray wolf the next day an eagle.“We get a lot of bald and golden eagles,” Kagan laments. In 2019, she and the other pathologist at the lab necropsied about 100 eagles total, including 1703. Managing an endless stream of suspiciously dead animals can be bleak. But Kagan keeps a sharp sense of humor – she jokes that she always carves the bird at Thanksgiving – and finds comfort in knowing that her work is ultimately in service of conservation. Sometimes a necropsy yields evidence that helps finger the bad guy. Other times her efforts reveal that there wasn’t any foul play, just the lethal hand of Mother Nature at work.Kagan unpacked 1703 on 13 February 2019, roughly three weeks after Lewis first noticed its GPS at a standstill. Dribs of a red-brown fluid leaked from the bird’s mouth when she tilted its carcass. She checked the esophagus and it was empty. She checked the crop, a pouch-like structure near the upper part of the digestive tract, and found a 3.5oz blob of partially masticated muscle and fat mixed with a few white hairs that looked like they came from a deer. “The nutritional condition was good,” Kagan recalls. “This bird didn’t starve to death.”Slowly and methodically, she worked 1703 over, inspecting and documenting every inch of its insides and outsides. A large amount of “watery, red-tinged” excrement pooled in its cloaca and its gall bladder contained “scant, yellow-green, watery bile”, according to the necropsy report.Kagan eventually arrived at the two metal pellets that showed up on the preliminary X-ray only to discover that they were nothing more than tiny remnants from the GPS harness. Hours spent deconstructing 1703, and the cause of death wasn’t any clearer. “It’s a little frustrating,” she tells me. “We really checked everything with this bird.”As a final step, she shipped 1703’s liver to Michigan State University for a detailed toxicology analysis. A few weeks later the results came back positive for bromadiolone, better known as rat poison.Even if you’ve never heard of bromadiolone or its chemical counterparts –brodifacoum difenacoum and difethialone – chances are you’ve been in close proximity to them. They are known as “second-generation anticoagulant rodenticides”, a popular class of poisons that essentially kills a rodent by making it bleed to death from the inside out. Exterminators stuff these poisons in those black plastic bait boxes that you see everywhere in cities – down alleys, on the sides of restaurants, in condo buildings’ parking lots – and they are deployed throughout the agricultural sector to keep germ-carrying rodents away from food supplies.These poisons came to prominence in the late 1970s and early 1980s and were “extremely widely embraced” from the get-go, says Bobby Corrigan, an esteemed rodentologist who has spent his career studying and consulting on pest control practices. “It was kind of a magic bullet of advanced chemistry.”Corrigan frequently preaches the importance of addressing the root causes of rodent infestations – improving trash storage and collection, addressing degrading infrastructure – and is unsettled by the widespread reliance on second-generation anticoagulants and lax enforcement efforts by the Environmental Protection Agency to restrict their use. But – and this is an important, he says – the sad truth is that we are dependent on these poisons. Forgoing them entirely would lead to an explosion in rodent populations that could usher in “a public health catastrophe”.One reason these poisons are so effective is because, in most cases, the rat or ground squirrel or vole or whatever the target vermin happens to be only needs to eat a single dose. The poison works quickly, and the critter typically doesn’t have time to excrete any of the poison before it keels over. In other words, a rat that dies from a second-generation anticoagulant often dies with a belly fully of poison. And if a scavenger comes along and plucks up the rodent corpse, it, too, will be exposed to the poison. It’s a process that scientists call bioaccumulation, and it occurs all the way up the food chain.The toxicology report for 1703 showed that it had 0.05 parts per million of bromadiolone in its liver. Murray says it’s unlikely that’s enough to directly kill an eagle, but there’s not really any good data on what the lethal threshold is for a bird of that size. If the poison didn’t deal the fatal blow, I ask, could it have impaired 1703 in a way that made the bird less capable of hunting or migrating or withstanding the winter and thus contributing to its death? Again, Murray says, it’s an important question to which there’s no answer. And even worse, it’s becoming an increasingly difficult question to study because, Murray explains, so many raptors in the wild now have rodenticide in them that it’s almost impossible to find enough birds that are free of rat poison to serve as a control group.Because of all the uncertainty around how the poisons affect birds, Kagan listed the final cause of death on 1703’s necropsy report as “undetermined (suspect poison)”. It’s a fate that many golden eagles suffer. While data is scarce, FWS scientists estimate that poisonings are now the leading cause of anthropogenic-induced death among golden eagles, possibly killing as many as 2,000 a year.Kagan’s exam table was the end of the line for 1703. Sometimes an eagle can be sent to the National Eagle Feather Repository, which distributes deceased eagles to Native American tribes so they can use the animals for ceremonial purposes. 1703 would not find any such greater meaning in death, however, because the feather repository, according to an FWS spokesperson, cannot distribute eagles exposed to rodenticides.On 7 March 2019, Kagan filed the official necropsy report and moved on to the next animal carcass in her queue.Without any evidence of a clearcut crime and an ever-expanding caseload, Bare closed the file on 1703 and retrained his focus on the spate of eagle shootings.And out in Juneau, Lewis logged 1703’s data and carried on monitoring the 17 other golden eagles that are still tagged and up in the air, hoping they avoid the wind turbines and high-voltage wires and blasts of buckshot and poisoned prey that have made the natural world so unnaturally dangerous for the species.“I know that death is a reality,” Lewis says, “but it’s really frustrating when it seems like it’s a senseless death.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b6bbfcfb944659e609e49dd99fefb4999e5e672b/0_101_3072_1843/master/3072.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b9edfbb92f76b428f72422db188cba86","title":"italy extends lockdown amid signs coronavirus infection rate is easing","story":"Minister says drastic measures are yielding results as Spain also reports a ‘trend change’Italy has extended its lockdown until 13 April but signs are emerging that the rate of coronavirus infection both there and in Spain, the two countries that have suffered the highest global death tolls in the pandemic so far, may be reaching a plateau.“Experts say we are on the right track and the drastic measures we have taken are starting to yield results,” the health minister, Roberto Speranza, said. He warned, though, that it would be “unforgivable to assume this was a definitive defeat” of Covid-19 and it would be “a long battle”.It is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals.The virus can cause pneumonia-like symptoms. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties.In the UK, the National Heath Service has defined the symptoms as:Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should stay at home for at least 7 days. If you live with other people, they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.China’s national health commission confirmed human-to-human transmission in January. As of 31 March, more than 780,000 people have been infected in more than 170 countries, according to the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering.There have been over 37,800 deaths globally. Just over 3,200 of those deaths have occurred in mainland China. Italy has been worst affected, with over 11,500 fatalities, and there have been over 7,700 deaths in Spain. The US now has more confirmed cases than any other country - more than 164,000. Many of those who have died had underlying health conditions, which the coronavirus complicated.More than 166,000 people are recorded as having recovered from the coronavirus.Italy’s civil protection authority announced on Tuesday that the country’s tally had climbed by 837 deaths to 12,428, the highest in the world, and that the number of new confirmed cases had risen by 4,053, taking the country’s total to 105,792.“The curve tells us that we’re at a plateau,” said Silvio Brusaferro, the president of Italy’s Higher Health Institute (ISS). “That doesn’t mean we’ve hit the peak and that it’s over, but that we must start the descent … by applying the measures in force.”Spain, which crossed the threshold of 100,000 confirmed cases on Wednesday and reported another record single-day death toll of 864, is following a similar pattern, with officials saying on Wednesday a “trend change” was starting to be seen.“If we only look at cases of people who are being treated in hospitals – the figures that allow for a precise analysis of the spread of the epidemic and of the effectiveness of our measures against the virus – then the percentage is still coming down compared to previous days. That helps tell us social distancing measures are really working.”According to the Johns Hopkins University tracker, the pandemic has infected more than 870,000 people worldwide and killed more than 43,000. Nearly half the world’s population are living under some form of requested or mandatory confinement.In other developments:As equipment shortages continue to dog Europe’s response to the pandemic, France, which on Tuesday announced 499 new deaths, its biggest increase since the start of the pandemic, said it would invest €4bn in “strategic” health products including masks and respirators, with the aim of making the country “fully and completely self-sufficient” by the end of this year.“We have to produce in France, on our territory, from now on,” the president, Emmanuel Macron, said. “Certain products and certain materials have a strategic importance and we need Europe to be independent to reduce our dependence. The day after the epidemic will not be like the day before we must rebuild out national and European sovereignty.”Germany’s finance minister, Olaf Scholz, announced the government would financially support companies taking a gamble on switching their production to making facial masks. But politicians in Germany, which has registered 71,000 confirmed cases and 775 deaths, have declined to force industry to retool to produce protective gear or respirators.The debate comes amid a growing sense that the relatively stable situation in German hospitals could be about to become a lot more serious as the virus moves on to the elderly population. Reports from around the country suggest a number of outbreaks in care homes for the elderly."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/36bb1f94fd7c20755c97ce69cf104d318ba5e038/217_0_2446_1468/master/2446.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4036c72b489f24f6fb1ec94acd187b4b","title":"life in lockdown how is your family coping","story":"The Anywhere but Westminster team would like your help to create the next episode of Life in LockdownWe’re putting together the next episode of Anywhere but Westminster’s Life in Lockdown series.

On Tuesday the Steel City had the third highest number in any local authority in England (451), behind Hampshire (650) and Birmingham (814).The figures have led some to worry that Sheffield – home to 575,400 people, compared with Birmingham’s 1.1 million – has become a hotbed of disease. Research from the Centre for Cities on Tuesday prompted further consternation by breaking the data down by population size and reporting that Sheffield was second only to London in terms of cases per 100,000 people.But local hospitals and public health experts play down the statistics. “The figures are misleading and alarming. People look at them and think ‘oh gosh, we’re all going to get it’ and ‘Sheffield is a high-risk area’, but that’s not true,” said Dr Andrew Lee, a reader of global public health at Sheffield University and executive director of primary care and population health at NHS Vale of York clinical commissioning group.Talking in his academic capacity, Lee despaired at the Public Health England daily dashboard, which lists the number of cases in each local authority in England. “That tracker is really misleading. In some senses they should just turn it off because everywhere is testing differently. So you can’t compare place A with place B with place C. And it’s not like you’re just following a score because the interpretation of those numbers is really complicated,” he said.So far, four patients have died in hospitals in Sheffield. The main reason Sheffield has such a high number of cases is that it has been testing more people and testing earlier, according to Lee. The Sheffield Teaching Hospitals trust, which operates the city’s two big hospitals, the Northern General and the Royal Hallamshire, took the decision to test all symptomatic NHS workers 11 days before most other areas, the  understands.Meanwhile, it was only this week that the rest of the NHS was ordered by Sir Simon Stevens, the chief executive of NHS England, to start testing staff, starting first with those working in critical care, emergency departments and ambulance services.Healthcare workers were disproportionately likely to get infected, said Lee. “If you look at what happened with Mers-Covid, when they had that big outbreak in South Korea some years ago, most of the cases were in health workers. And the same with Sars in 2003-4. It just reflects the fact healthcare workers have high risk, prolonged contacts with patients. Healthcare workers are not representative of the wider public.”The Northern General medic said the widespread testing in Sheffield meant that infected staff stayed at home while those who tested negative could come in to work. “I know five or six people in my team were sure they had it and tested negative, and yet a few others who were adamant it was just a cold turned out to have coronavirus,” they said.Another reason for Sheffield’s high figures is that the Royal Hallamshire is home to one of England’s few specialist NHS infection centres. That’s why when the first coronavirus patients arrived in the UK, from the cruise ship the Diamond Princess, two were sent there.In addition, Sheffield has experienced a few “Covid clusters”, according to a spokeswoman at the Sheffield Teaching Hospitals trust. “I know we did have some clusters of people that we tested in the community, which had a wide contract testing base, which made the Sheffield figures look larger,” she said. These clusters were largely groups returning from Italy and other infected regions, she added.She said the trust saw two million patients each year – four times the population of Sheffield – which would also help explain the disproportionately high number of coronavirus cases.Meanwhile, staff at the Northern General said the hospital had not yet had an influx of patients with Covid-19. On Monday, the 18-bed intensive care unit was not yet full and the high dependency unit, which had been cleared out in anticipation, was empty. The Hallamshire, which has dedicated an entire floor to coronavirus, was also not yet at capacity, the  understands.“It’s a bit like watching the tide go out before the tsunami comes in,” said the Northern General medic. “We are not overwhelmed yet but we have all seen what has happened in London and we know what’s coming. We are hoping the lockdown will make it not as bad, but it depends who you talk to how much you believe whether we are going to be saved or not.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf917edde114d60b274aa6ba03432a179032d230/0_116_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eae5abacf8eef823f3fd898108d8a407","title":"royals ministers or even boy george houseparty isolation app coronavirus","story":"A social app once the preserve of teens is proving a vital way to beat the Coronavirus bluesLike any real-life get-together, you can never be sure who you will bump into in the kitchen – and in much the same way people are now discovering government ministers, famous musicians, and even members of the royal family when using the Houseparty app.While Zoom has quickly risen to prominence for business meetings, and Microsoft’s Teams function is being rolled out by many large firms, it is Houseparty that is becoming the place for the nation to socialise.As a result the service, which allows up to eight people to share the same chat and hop uninvited between mutual friends’ conversations, has been transformed in the space of a few weeks into a venue where the public stand a chance of inadvertently bumping into notable figures.“The great joy of Houseparty is that you can just crash any group gathering you wish,” said the magician and YouTuber Archie Manners. “I saw that a mutual friend was having a Houseparty with someone called Boy George and assumed that was someone using a nickname. I opened it up and had an hour with Mr Karma Chameleon himself. We chatted about self-isolation and music.”At least four serving cabinet ministers are on the app, including the tech-obsessed health secretary Matt Hancock, currently self-isolating with coronavirus. Keir Starmer, the frontrunner to become the next Labour leader this weekend, has also been spotted on the service, along with many Labour frontbenchers.A spokesperson for David Cameron would not comment on suggestions the former prime minister had been spotted on the service, although Labour’s one-time communications chief Peter Mandelson has an account.Real royalty has also been spotted. The Daily Mail has reported that the Duchess of Cornwall has been using Houseparty to keep in touch with her grandchildren while in self-isolation at Balmoral. The newspaper quoted a royal source saying the app was a “brilliant way of staying in touch with her own family whom she is missing terribly”.A similar pattern has been seen around the world, with usage jumping after a pandemic-enforced lockdown is imposed. Although Houseparty is owned by Epic Games, the parent company of Fortnite, it does not show any adverts and its simplicity is part of its appeal.Its growth has been boosted by the way it encourages users to upload their phonebooks and then search for contacts already on the app. This has resulted in people having Houseparty contact lists that combine real-life friends, business contacts and work colleagues in a high-risk mix. With ongoing conversations set to public by default, users are already reporting anxiety caused by ex-partners gatecrashing chats and the delicate social etiquette involved in their bosses joining late-night group conversations – although there is always the option to “lock” a room and avoid interlopers joining.Houseparty’s growing pains have brought its own problems, with a viral rumour spread earlier this week that its user data had been hacked. The service said this was a malicious smear campaign and offered $1m to anyone who could prove an attack had taken place.Its ability to break down social boundaries has been particularly appealing to many on the left of politics, with James Meadway, a former economic adviser to the shadow chancellor John McDonnell, approvingly describing it as a “chaos agent”.Tina Daheley, a BBC journalist who presents the Beyond Today podcast and many news bulletins, said she had downloaded the app last week and mainly used it to chat and play games with her friends.“On Friday I joined Houseparty and had a catchup with wine and three girlfriends, then the same on Saturday lunchtime with a couple of other friends. What’s really nice is they’re a load of my oldest schoolfriends, and realistically we don’t see each other that often but we had a proper catchup.”She’d found it harder to get her 71-year-old parents on to the service and remained mildly concerned about the prospect of her bosses being able to jump into the conversation.“The idea of an editor from BBC News accidentally joining in is terrifying,” she said.But there is one group who may be less delighted by the surge of interest in the app: its original teenage users. What was once a youth-focused space well away from adults is now overrun with middle-aged parents arranging virtual drinks parties with their friends, all suddenly able to keep an eye on what their offspring are up to."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c773f03328d341a0992ce8c5034ec383ce637429/0_152_3015_1809/master/3015.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=35fd63f3a15b662c4f3ecf4b9f7168ea","title":"viktor orban ditches mayor plan amid claims of coronavirus power grab","story":"Hungary’s prime minister criticised for inefficient and unworkable measuresHungary’s nationalist government announced measures to strip the country’s mayors of political autonomy, before appearing to ditch them hours later, the latest episode in a political drama in which the prime minister, Viktor Orbán, has been accused of using the coronavirus to mount a power grab.On Monday, Hungary’s parliament passed a law that gives Orbán the right to rule by decree for an indefinite period and also criminalises intentionally spreading false information about coronavirus with up to five years in prison. The move was roundly criticised by Orbán’s domestic and international critics.It was followed up by a bill of further measures published late on Tuesday evening that would target municipal authorities and mayors, many of whom are from opposition parties. During the state of emergency, mayors can take on the decision-making abilities of local councils, but the new regulation would submit these decisions to a review that could take up to five days.The move was immediately criticised as inefficient and unworkable, and later on Wednesday Gergely Gulyás, the chief of Orbán’s cabinet, said the government would not follow through on the measure.Budapest’s mayor, Gergely Karácsony, had warned that the measures risked increasing the loss of life due to coronavirus.“I think this proposition is dangerous not only for our democracy but it also makes the fight against coronavirus very difficult,” he said, in remarks emailed to the  by a spokesperson before Gulyás’ announcement. “If soldiers, policemen and Fidesz delegates have to decide on local government issues they do not even know or understand and have five days to do so, we are losing precious time in saving lives. If this proposition is accepted it could cause the death rate to rise.”Karácsony beat Orbán’s candidate in elections last October, standing on a platform of a greener and fairer city. Orbán’s party lost control of a number of big cities, including Budapest, in what was his first significant electoral setback for a decade.As of Wednesday morning, Hungary had 525 confirmed cases of coronavirus, with 20 deaths. Opinion is ided on whether the country may avoid the nightmare scenario unfolding in many western European countries currently, due to relatively early restrictions on movement imposed by the government, or whether the epidemic is simply a couple of weeks behind and will soon enter an exponential growth phase.In a sign that even during a pandemic the Hungarian government has not ceased its rightwing culture battle, another part of the bill submitted on Tuesday would make it impossible for transgender people to legally alter their gender. The bill would introduce “gender at birth” into the Hungarian civil registry, in place of “gender”, and make the entry unalterable.Responding to Orbán’s power grab, Luxembourg’s veteran foreign minister Jean Asselborn said Hungary should be stripped of its right to take part in the EU council of ministers, the union’s prime decision-making body. “Hungary belongs in strict political quarantine,” he told Die Welt. “We cannot accept the fact that there is a dictatorial government in the EU.”The European commission has come under fire for its muted response to the Hungarian law that failed to mention Hungary by name. On Wednesday, the president of the European People’s Party, Donald Tusk, said the group would have to reconsider its earlier reluctance to expel Orbán’s Fidesz party from its ranks. In an open letter to the EPP - the centre-right political family long accused of turning a blind eye to Orbán’s excesses - Tusk said Hungary’s emergency measures were “disproportionate and inadequate”. But Tusk stopped short of saying that he supported Fidesz’s expulsion and was accused of failing to take a stand.Additional reporting by Jennifer Rankin in Brussels"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b73d970f251da5617be9a1651cd174504993bfbb/182_0_4137_2483/master/4137.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=797c635b3f7b3d58f609e1daa1f9b333","title":"what are your rights in lockdown britain coronavirus","story":"Can you exercise more than once a day? How often can you shop? We explain what is allowed and what is notSince the introduction of strict new measures to stem the spread of coronavirus, not everybody has been in agreement as to what exactly “lockdown” means. One police force has defended its use of a drone camera to shame those driving into a national park, while another introduced roadblocks to stop people heading to tourist hotspots.The extraordinary official powers introduced by the Coronavirus Act and the 2020 Health Protection Regulations, combined with the speed with which legislation passed through parliament, have left many uncertain about precisely what is permitted and what is a criminal offence under the lockdown.Activities under the health regulations that constitute a “reasonable excuse” for leaving home are listed (alphabetically from A to M). They include obtaining food and medical supplies, taking “exercise either alone or with other members of their household”, seeking medical assistance, and providing care to a vulnerable person.Also permitted is attending a funeral of a close family member, “to move house where reasonably necessary”, and any existing arrangements for access between separated parents and children. Travel for the purposes of work where it cannot be carried out from home, similarly for the provision of voluntary services, is also legal.The problem has been that ministers and officials, eager to prevent transmission of the coronavirus, are circulating more restrictive guidance than is in statute or the regulations. Some police forces have been following their lead.On Tuesday, Downing Street was forced to clarify that people could go out to buy food more than once a week, after the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, mistakenly said shopping trips should be limited.A Home Office announcement from 26 March said iniduals could only leave their homes for “very limited purposes” including “one form of exercise a day”. Some police force websites also initially listed exercise as being allowed only “once a day”. The health regulations, however, do not say anything about permitted frequency. Police have powers to order anyone to return home if they judge that they are out without reasonable excuse. Officers can also order anyone with a child to take a non-compliant youngster home. Where three or more people are gathered without reasonable excuse, they can be ordered to disperse.The latest police guidance on enforcement does not specify what forms of proof would be required if, for example, someone says they are going to care for a vulnerable relative. It states that officers will apply the law “in a system that is flexible, discretionary ad pragmatic. This will enable officers to make sensible decisions and employ their judgement. Enforcement should be a last resort.”Failure to comply is punishable by a fine. Fixed penalty notices are £60, or £30 if paid within 14 days. For subsequent penalty notices, fines can rise to as high as £960. Those who do not pay can be taken to court.The courts are not hearing many cases at the moment, but anyone who feels they have been fined inappropriately can go to court to contest it. Civil liberties organisations might contemplate supporting legal challenges in future if they think fines are being imposed unfairly and the lockdown continues for a long period.

Gracie Bradley, policy and campaigns manager at the human rights organisation Liberty, said this week: “There have been amazing community responses to this pandemic, and people have shown they are willing to change the way they live – but that goodwill, and the broader aim of protecting public health, will be undermined by harsh and heavy-handed policing.”Katy Bourne, chair of the Association of Police and Crime Commissioners, said: “We are rightly proud of our policing by consent model in this country, and PCCs know that, in order for these measures to be truly effective, the police will need to maintain public confidence. That means calmly engaging, explaining and encouraging people to do the right thing, not being overzealous, and only taking enforcement measures as a last resort.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/228507a7bae5ea7f8c74530b2d511642f47d403f/0_448_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0280e7bae203c307cf28a00c5b88f1c0","title":"when this is all over im not going to stop hugging my friends","story":"As coronavirus keeps us apart, I have developed a very wholesome thirst for the physical intimacy we used to have with friends and family Lately, when I find myself reaching for my phone for a distraction, it’s no longer just to mindlessly swipe through Instagram stories and semi-ironically decipher my horoscope. Instead, I catch myself constantly returning to my camera roll. In particular, the photos where I’m touching my family and friends.There’s the fuzzy Christmas party set of my colleagues and I, all cheek to cheek, craning our heads to get in a series of group selfies. There’s a backyard family lunch, me with my arm slung over my mum’s shoulder. There’s a day at the beach with my sister and her kid, us each holding a hand as we drag her back to the car. And there’s Mardis Gras night. It was just a few weeks ago but today the photos feel as though they belong in a history book. Friends and strangers covered in glitter and sweat, dancing close at a street party, arms wrapped around waists, exuberant kisses being planted on faces, all of us joyfully, drunkenly close to each other and vigorously engaged in whatever the opposite of social distancing is.I’m experiencing a new and very wholesome kind of thirst.As the coronavirus crisis deepens, we are moving further and further away from each other. If we’re lucky enough to still have a job, we are mostly working from home. The latest wave of lockdown restrictions have made seeing friends and family outside the home almost impossible (unless you’re wearing activewear). Even the physical proximity of strangers has evaporated. We leave bigger and bigger gaps as we pass on the street and step back from each other in the supermarket. If you live alone, it might be weeks since you touched another person, and months before you will again.One of the greatest paradoxes of this moment is most of us are feeling more tender and afraid than we ever have, and want nothing more than to pull close the people we love, to seek reassurance and comfort. Yet, for the first time in our lives, unless we live together, we can’t do this – not physically, at least.This is all the sadder because touch – when it’s wanted, when it’s caring – is so good for us. It connects us to each other. It is our most primal form of communication. Years of research suggests it’s beneficial for our physical and mental health, lifting our mood and decreasing stress. Newborn babies thrive on skin-to-skin contact. Every kid knows the power of “kissing it better” when you get hurt, or being patted off to sleep by a reassuring hand.Adults too can experience a true “skin hunger” when they go long periods without touch, as the illustrator Kristen Radtke explored in the New York Times this week.Right now though most of us are so wary of touch, even of hugging our parents.I saw my mum last week and she moved towards me on pure instinct, her arms out. I jumped back, like a teenager about to get an embarrassing goodbye kiss at the school gate. We may yet all need to do what the mother of the ABC journalist Emilia Terzon did last week – building ingenious protective “cuddle suits” out of garbage bags so they could give each other a squeeze.Even one of the most familiar rituals in most families – greeting returning loved ones at the airport with wide open arms – is impossible now. Last week my sister, her wife and their three-year-old daughter arrived home from New York after beating a hasty retreat from their life in a city rapidly descending into a public health nightmare. They have another baby due in a couple of months. No one could even go to the airport to meet them, let alone embrace them.When I have seen them, it is with a gulf between us. I drop groceries and bottles of wine on the stoop of the Airbnb where they are quarantining, then retreat back to the front gate to sit out on the footpath when my sister comes to the door.My niece has to be physically restrained from barrelling out of the house towards visitors. A champion hugger, hair-messer and tickler, not being able to be physical with her grandparents, extended family or friends means she has become exponentially more handsy with her mums. “She crawls at the walls, she crawls on us,” my sister says.With all this touch deprivation, the most common wish I see expressed among people on social media is to hug their friends and family when this is all over. That is unless you’ve been forced into celibacy, in which case you’re naturally concerned with  another kind of physical intimacy.“The world is going to be an intense cuddle puddle on the streets,” my friend Que Minh Luu tweeted last week. “It’ll be like that iconic end of the world war photo, except with active consent.”When this is over, I for one cannot wait to go HAM on all my friends. I daydream about the first dancefloor we can get on, wrapping them up and smooshing their faces. I will never not let my mum hold my hand again, no matter where we are. I will let my toddler niece use me as a human climbing gym and I look forward to nibbling on the fat little legs of her new sibling. If everyone I love makes it through this, I want to put my arms around them all. We’ll need it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d3cfbda2a7a0fcb476054adbb4d9c2af05872ec/0_5_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c8e47c6f0eb4865ff1b3d69ff20dcaac","title":"how are you affected by coronavirus in the south west of the uk","story":"If you live in the south-west England or Wales, we’d like to find out about the impact of coronavirus on you and your community.

Martin Fraser, the secretary general of the Government, sent a letter to his counterpart in the Oireachtas, Peter Finnegan, which has been forwarded to TDs. Mr Fraser highlighted that “everyone in the country has been asked stay at home, subject to the limited exceptions which have been published by the Government”. He also said he is “sure” this public health advice would be uppermost in the minds of Oireachtas officials and TDs organising Dáil business.It comes ahead of the Dáil sitting on Thursday afternoon to hear statements on the coronavirus crisis and on social protection measures. No legislation will be debated and the sitting has provoked ision among some parties, with Sinn Féin and People Before Profit insisting the Dáil must meet.Others, such as Labour, have said TDs should not gather at a time of national lockdown to deal with the coronavirus crisis. Sources described Mr Fraser’s letter as “gentle admonishment” of TDs.Attendance at tomorrow’s Dáil session is restricted to 30 per cent of the total 160 TDs and only two people from each party and group will be allowed in the chamber at any time to ensure physical distancing. Mr Finnegan told TDs he had received “communication” from Mr Fraser. He said, among other issues, Mr Fraser “highlights the extraordinary constraints that everyone is operating under at present”. “He states that everyone has been asked to stay at home subject to limited exceptions which have been published by the Government. And he concludes by saying that he is sure that the public health advice will be uppermost in the considerations of the business committee at this extraordinary time.”The business committee decides the timings and schedules of the Dáil.

Photograph: iStockRound about now, in the normal world, we would be publishing a story detailing all the “hilarious” April Fool’s Day pranks played by newspapers on their readers and brands on their customers.The story would be long and would cause readers to smile, sigh or throw their eyes to the heavens before getting on with their days.But this is not the normal world and there isn’t a lot of smiling going on. What has been striking in recent hours has been the almost total absence of April Fool’s Day jokes circulating.That is not to say there have been none.We must doff our cap to the Dublin Fire Brigade who, this morning, tweeted their thanks to Aer Lingus for the “safe delivery of specialist ‘truck mask’ PPE for our fire appliances”The post said the personal protective equipment (PPE) would “help provide fresh filtered air to the engine and cab,” and it was accompanied by a picture of a fire truck wearing a face mask, obviously.Land bridgeThe Star was one a small number of newspapers in this part of the world that tried to fool their readers. They ran with an elaborate story about a new land bridge between Holyhead and Dublin under the headline “Rocky Road to Dublin”.Well, we say the Star “tried to fool” but in truth it did not try that hard to fool anyone, given that the reporter said the € 15 billion Brexit busting bridge would be painted green white and orange and named after the Wolfe Tones.Cork-based online publication Cork Beo ran a story about the discovery of 11th century land deeds in the University of Copenhagen which had revealed that much of Cork city centre still belongs to the Nordic warrior tribes and their legal heirs.Laois Today went with a story about a new app dedicated to helping Laois people to find love.Bohemians Football Club in Dublin 7 posted a story about a Golden Eagle which has built a nest in one of the Dalymount floodlights.But apart from sporadic attempts to lift people’s spirits, the jokes were thin on the ground.Alcohol banThere was the odd WhatsApp message purporting to be from official sources suggesting that a ban on the consumption of alcohol was being introduced while some parents went to great lengths to play tricks on their children by mocking up television news reports that schools were re-opening this week.But what was clear in most quarters however was that the hearts weren’t in it this year.“When times are good and brands want to show their humour and personality, it can be positive. A good stunt can humanise a brand,” Joe Baratelli, the chief creative officer at a Los Angeles-based advertising agency told Ad Weekly. “When things are serious, it’s probably not the time to be messing with people.”It certainly isn’t but Korean pop star Kim Jaejoong clearly didn’t get that memo.In what appeared to be a serious post on Instagram, he told his 1.9 million followers that he had contracted Covid-19 and was in hospital being treated.The post was quickly deleted and then revealed to be an April Fools’ Day joke and one which was - apparently - posted in an effort to raise awareness of the pandemic.A fool for sure . . . just not perhaps an April one.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4217791.1585743786!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"seanad elections mullen tops nui poll ahead of mcdowell","story":"Former Sinn Féin MEP for Dublin Lynn Boylan has been elected to the Seanad on the final count along with outgoing Green Party Senator Pippa Hackett and Labour Cllr Annie Hoey.

There, he conducted 300 tests, skipping meals to assess a stream of people so that “the country is protected from the invasion of the novel coronavirus”.Stories like this, carried in the state-run newspaper Rodong Sinmun, focus attention on one of the stranger oddities surrounding the Covid-19 pandemic: How could North Korea claim to not have a single coronavirus case while countries around the world stagger under the exploding epidemic?North Korea has taken some of the most drastic actions against the virus and did so sooner than most other nations. It sealed its borders in late January, shutting off business with neighboring China, which accounts for nine-tenths of its external trade. It clamped down on the smugglers who keep its thriving unofficial markets functioning. It quarantined all diplomats in Pyongyang for a month. The totalitarian state’s singular ability to control the movement of people also bolsters its disease-control efforts.But decades of isolation and international sanctions have ravaged North Korea’s public health system, raising concerns that it lacks the medical supplies to fight an outbreak, which many fear has already occurred.“You can see immediately what’s going to happen if you get a surge of Covid-19 patients streaming in,” said Dr Kee B Park, a lecturer at Harvard Medical School who has worked alongside North Korean doctors to help improve the country’s health system. “It will overwhelm the system very quickly.”Many observers of North Korea doubt its claims of not having any coronavirus cases. But a lack of testing equipment may mean it literally has not detected a single case, Park said. “It’s because they may have cases but they just don’t know how to detect it,” he said. “So they can say, ‘We have not confirmed it’.”Some accuse North Korea of hiding an outbreak to preserve order. “It’s a blatant lie when they say they have no cases,” said Seo Jae-pyoung, secretary-general of the Seoul-based Association of North Korean Defectors, who said he heard from his North Korean contact that a family of three and an elderly couple died of the virus in the east coast city of Chongjin in mid-March.“The last thing the North wants is a social chaos that may erupt when North Koreans realise that people are dying of an epidemic with no cure.”Alarming reports-The North’s leader, Kim Jong-un, is clearly aware of the threat the virus poses to his country’s decrepit health system. Around when Washington announced on February 13th that it would allow coronavirus-related humanitarian shipments, North Korea made a rare request for urgent help from relief groups, including diagnostic kits, according to people familiar with the matter.In recent weeks, the North’s official media outlets have carried alarming reports detailing the coronavirus’s toll around the world: a snowballing caseload in South Korea, bodies piling up in Italy, “panicked citizens” hoarding “guns and ammunition” in the United States.They contrast such reports with pictures of North Korean disease-control officials in full protective gear spraying disinfectant in buses, trams, playgrounds and hotel gyms in Pyongyang, the showcase capital city. Garment factories are shown making masks instead of clothes. There is a national drive to send eggs, meat and fish to those under quarantine.By its own account, North Korea has quarantined 10,000 people. International disease-control officials “have all been amazed” how North Korea could have done it, the state-run Rodong newspaper said this month.But video clips shot in Hyesan, a town on the North’s central border with China, in February and early March depict a far less flattering picture of the North’s disease-control efforts. A red wooden marker on a sidewalk covered with a dirty slush of ice said “disinfection station”, according to a clip, which was smuggled to the Rev Kim Seung-eun, a human rights activist in South Korea.A lone official in a green plastic suit with a tank of disinfecting liquid on his back stood idly. A silver van raced through the town blaring the importance of wearing masks. In another clip, a sign saying “Quarantined” was stuck on the door of what looked like a tenement house where Rev Kim said people with possible symptoms were kept.Information blackoutRev Kim said one of his North Korean contacts had been unable to return home for a month after visiting another town because the government controlled internal movement. Such restrictions were needed for disease control because of North Korea’s crowded public transportation network.The country’s information blackout and the inability of outside health experts to get into the country leave the rest of the world largely in the dark about how North Korea is coping with the virus. Last month, Daily NK, a Seoul-based website that hires anonymous informants inside the North, reported the deaths of 200 soldiers, as well as 23 others, who were suspected of contracting the coronavirus.But Kang Mi Jin, a North Korean defector-turned journalist in Seoul, said that no matter how hard they searched, her contacts in the North could not find a death officially ascribed to the coronavirus.In the past, the country has hushed or played down epidemics, military rebellions, man-made disasters or anything else that could undermine the people’s faith in the government. But this time, the North’s unusually aggressive moves, as well as its unique ability to detain people, may have prevented a devastating outbreak, said Jung Gwang Il, a North Korean defector who leads No Chain, a North Korean human rights activist group in Seoul.As soon as an outbreak was reported in China, North Korea rounded up all Chinese visitors in its northeastern town of Rason and quarantined them on an island for a month, Jung said.“It’s safe to say that there are cases in North Korea but I don’t think the outbreak there is as large as the ones we have seen in South Korea, Italy and the US,” said Ahn Kyung-su, the head of the Seoul-based Research Centre of DPRK Health and Welfare, which monitors the North’s health system. “North Koreans are trained to obey government orders in a shipshape way during crises. But there is the risk of the virus running out of control if it starts spreading among its malnourished people.”Ahn said testing kits from China were available in big cities such as Pyongyang. Telltale evidence came when Kim Jong-un inspected a missile test this month and military officers surrounding him did not wear masks, which Ahn said would not have happened had they not tested negative.Mass mobilisationBut the coronavirus has put Kim between a rock and a hard place, analysts say. On March 17th, the broke ground on a modern “Pyongyang General Hospital” to be completed by October. But such projects in the North rely on mass mobilisations of soldiers who sleep and eat together for months at a stretch and raise the risk of mass infections during an epidemic.By this month, some help began reaching North Korea in its efforts to confront the virus. Russia donated 1,500 test kits. China is also believed to have sent diagnostic tools. The United Nations has begun waiving sanctions for aid groups such as the Red Cross to ship testing machines and diagnostic kits, as well as ventilators and protective equipment. But the shipments have been slow.“Given the global shortage of supplies and items being available in different locations, we are still in the process of procuring the items,” said Ellie Van Baaren, a Red Cross spokeswoman. – New York TimesStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4206213.1584564281!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"eu sets out proposals for close uk ties after brexit talks","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEuropean Union chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier and the British prime minister’s Europe adviser David Frost in Brussels on March 2nd. Photograph: Oliver HosletReutersThe European Union released a draft of its hoped-for future relationship deal with Britain on Wednesday, setting out ambitions for a tight relationship on trade and security.The 440-page document crosses several of Britain’s red lines, spelling out the bloc’s ambitions for Britain to agree “uniform implementation” of state subsidy rules, with the European Court of Justice remaining the adjudicating authority.It also makes reference to the so-called “level playing field”, provisions to ensure fair competition by keeping rules aligned, which London has already rejected.“The Parties recognise that the establishment of conditions that ensure a level playing field between the Parties is necessary for trade and investment between the Union and the United Kingdom, ” the draft reads.The EU’s draft envisages reciprocal access to waters for fishing rights, with negotiations held each year by December 10th on fishing opportunities for the following year, another contentious point.The UK negotiating team said it had also sent a draft to the EU. This includes a free trade agreement with annexes, as well as agreements on aviation safety and air transport, and a civil nuclear agreement.“We are sharing ours in confidence as a negotiating document, as part of the ongoing negotiating process,” a government spokesman said.“Teams will now analyse each other’s texts and we expect further conversations between the teams next week.“We will keep under review which documents it is appropriate to publish during the course of negotiations and whether it is useful to make them availablle more widely.”Though Britain has left the EU it is is currently in a transition period, continuing to adhere to prior norms pending the agreement of a deal on the future relationship. If none can be agreed, it will automatically begin trading on World Trade Organisation terms from January 1st, 2021, with potentially severe effects on the Irish economy.The government of prime minister Boris Johnson has until July to request an extension to the transition period, but has insisted it will not do so even as the Coronavirus pandemic delayed talks this week.Both sides said they were examining options such as using video conferencing in place of face-to face talks.“The negotiations can still proceed given all of the logistical arrangements that have been put in place,” British foreign secretary Dominic Raab said on Tuesday.“We’re confident that we can get this done and, actually, I don’t think delaying Brexit negotiations would give anyone the certainty on either side of the Channel that they need.”Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":null,"title":"dolphins enjoy friendships lasting decades imitating study finds","story":"Dolphins enjoy friendships lasting decades by imitating each other\u0027s sounds and movements, an academic study has found.Male bottlenose dolphins match the tempo and timing of each other\u0027s calls, as well as synchronise their movements, when working together to shield a female they both want to mate with.The co-operative tactic can result in them forming long-lasting partnerships, as they simultaneously compete to fertilise the female while herding her away from other males, according to researchers.Bronte Moore, a coastal and marine scientist, says dolphins rely on synchronous movements to maintain their social bond and are able to form alliances that can last for decades.Apart from humans, very few animals use both verbal and physical synchronisation when working together.Researchers from the University of Western Australia (UWA) and the University of Bristol analysed acoustic data from a population of dolphins in Shark Bay, Western Australia.Dr Stephanie King, a senior lecturer from Bristol\u0027s School of Biological Sciences, said: Male dolphins need to work together to herd a female and defend her from rival alliances, but they are also competing to fertilise her.Such synchronous and co-ordinated behaviour between allied males may therefore promote co-operative behaviour and regulate stress, as it has been shown to do in humans.The study, which was funded by The Branco Weiss Fellowship - Society in Science, and the National Geographic Society, was published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons april 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178Coronavirus latest news: UK lockdown to be reviewed after Easter, as death toll surges by 563 on worst day of crisis yetDrug created to fight \u0026#39Disease X\u0026#39 10 years ago will be tested in battle against coronavirusNorth Korea accused of doctoring images from latest missile testNato warns Russia that it has not been weakened by coronavirus Comment: We cannot allow the lazy lockdown beard to become a feature of our post-plague worldCoronavirus exit strategy: the four ways we could get out of UK lockdownGreece records first coronavirus case among the tens of thousands of migrants crammed into its squalid campsCoronavirus: Why parents should not be overly worried about their childrenAlok Sharma says it is \u0026#39completely unacceptable\u0026#39 for banks to withhold loans, amid warnings businesses could go bustHow many coronavirus cases are in the UK - and where are they?What is coronavirus, how did it start and how big could it get?UK coronavirus lockdown: the new rules, and what they mean for daily lifeCan I get a private coronavirus test in the UK, and how much would it cost?Doctor who refused to retire from NHS dies after treating coronavirus patientsWednesday evening news briefing: Only 2,000 NHS frontline staff tested for coronavirusComment: The excesses of the last week were not a one-off.

He said Finland and Norway, where the number of deaths had been fewer, were simply at different phases of the pandemic.We shall see how it ends up, but there are explanations as to why they look as they do, he added.The Public Health Authority announced on Tuesday that it was putting together an advisory group of epidemiological and clinical experts it could draw on, raising the possibility that Mr Tegnell may begin to be sidelined.  On Tuesday evening, Skistar and Branäs group, Sweden\u0027s two biggest ski resort operators, announced that their slopes would close next week.  Stefan Sjöstrand, Skistar\u0027s chief executive, told The  he had made the decision following a call with Mr Carlson. Since the past weekend, there has been a clear increase in the number of people who have been taken into intensive treatment in the big hospitals, he said.  Yesterday, when we were in contact regarding these new facts, it was very clear to us that the healthcare system would not manage to take care of people coming into our resorts during the Easter peak season.He contrasted Sweden\u0027s power to the people approach, where iniduals and businesses are trusted to act responsibly, to those of Austria, Norway and Switzerland, where the governments have ordered ski resorts to close.Dr Sofia Leje, who heads the primary care ision in the ski town of Åre, had long been calling for local resorts to close after infections brought by incoming skiers took the per capita number of coronavirus cases in her region close to that of Stockholm.I am extremely worried, she told SVT in mid-March. I think it\u0027s important that we learn from other ski resorts in Europe, which have been hit really hard in Italy and Austria, and from where infections have spread elsewhere.But Mr Tegnell had repeatedly argued that the resort companies\u0027 moves to limit aprés-ski events and reduce queues were sufficient to minimise the spread of infections. More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/04/01/16/animal-crossing-new-horizons-switch-screenshot06.jpg","title":"animal crossing new horizons weddings coronavirus acnh reddit twitter","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.People are throwing elaborate\u0026nbspceremonies\u0026nbspon the hit Nintendo Switch game after the pandemic\u0026nbspderailed\u0026nbspplans worldwideWhile the ongoing coronavirus pandemic has resulted in\u0026nbspcancelled wedding plans all over the world, some resilient video game enthusiasts have turned to\u0026nbspAnimal Crossing: New Horizons\u0026nbspto celebrate their nuptials.In\u0026nbspthe\u0026nbsprecently released social simulator for the Nintendo Switch,\u0026nbspplayers are able\u0026nbspto travel to each other’s virtual islands to socialise – which is how people are able to arrange the events.On Reddit, a user called uAshmush\u0026nbspposted a screenshot from the game, explaining that his wedding had been called off as a result of the pandemic.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesWhen can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsWhich countries around the world has coronavirus spread to?Listen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus Podcast“My fiance\u0026nbspand I had to cancel our upcoming wedding due to Covid-19, so our best friends gave us a surprise animal crossing wedding instead,” they explained.“Im graduating from med school and not getting a graduation and our wedding was cancelled,” they continued.\u0026nbsp”I was feeling pretty down about missing out on my milestones.”“This made me so happy, I don’t even have the words to describe how much it meant to me.”The post was met with an outpouring of support and celebration on Reddit, with others sharing pictures of their own Animal Crossing\u0026nbspweddings and birthday parties\u0026nbspon Twitter.“Had to cancel my wedding in April bc of corona, but my besties surprised me w one on their island!” said one Twitter user.The weddings won’t\u0026nbspcarry any legal weight but\u0026nbspthey’re still\u0026nbspa touching display of people making the best of a bad situation.You can follow the latest coronavirus news here.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Between February and March, it became around 4,000 times brighter.When it does arrive, even if it is bright enough to be seen, it\u0026nbspmay still appear somewhat fuzzy\u0026nbspas comets often do.When looking at such objects, astronomers advise that people use a trick called averted vision. That means looking off slightly to the side of the thing you want to see, while keeping your concentration on it, which makes it easier to see because of the structure of the eye.After May, Atlas will continue its journey towards the centre of our solar system, getting closer to the Sun. That will make it harder to seeIt is expected to come back around in June – when it may be visible again – on its way back out of our neighbourhood and out of sight once more.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The term it uses for the statutory wage floor for younger workers is the national minimum wage.The national minimum wage is £4.55 for 16-17 year olds in 202021, £6.45 for those aged 18-20 and £8.00 for 21-24 year olds.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The move follows similar increases recently made elsewhere in Europe.The British Retail Consortium and UK Finance, which represents the finance and payments industry, believe the change will make it easier for consumers to shop, giving a much-needed boost to retailers.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIt will reduce the number of occasions when people need to input their pin, speeding up queues – a change that will be particularly welcome in UK supermarkets which had their busiest month on record in march as shoppers stocked up on supplies.It will also mean more payments can be made without the need to handle cash, which should cut retailers\u0027 costs.When can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsWhich countries around the world has coronavirus spread to?Listen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus PodcastAn increased limit was already being considered but the process has been accelerated as part of the industry\u0027s response to Covid-19.However, the benefit will not be felt for most shops until the government eases current lockdown conditions. Only shops designated as essential by the government are open as the UK attempts to slow the spread of coronavirus.Consumers spent £80.5bn via contactless payments in 2019, up by 16 per cent on the previous year, according to UK Finance.Increasing the maximum value on contactless purchases may cause concerns about fraud but UK Finance\u0027s figures suggest the amount lost is relatively small.Fraud equates to just 2.5p in every £100 spent using contactless technology. UK Finance said contactless fraud on payment cards and devices represents just 3.3 per cent of overall card fraud losses.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Amazing treatment from my GP over the phone, taking the time to give me all sorts of tests THEN consulting with a colleague before prescribing.“Feel like I’ve been run over by an elephant but in total awe of the NHS.”When can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsWhich countries around the world has coronavirus spread to?Listen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus PodcastIn an update on Wednesday, Thorne added: “Feeling better after two days of steroids. Still v tired, but the elephant has been replaced by a mountain lion. Of course it could not be Covid (wish we had Germany’s resources) in which case this is not reassuring to anyone. But, for me, at this moment, the drugs have worked.”The lack of testing for coronavirus has been heavily criticised in recent days, with many NHS staff unable to tell if they have the disease and therefore whether they are inadvertently spreading it to patients.Many rushed to wish Thorne a speedy recovery on Twitter, with Line of Duty writer Jed Mercurio writing: “Sorry to hear this, Jack. Wishing you a rapid recovery.”Good Omens writer Neil Gaiman also commented: “Sending love and worried get well wishes by the bucketload.”Get well, mon ami, wrote His Dark Materials author Philip Pullman, while actor Josh Gad said: Sending you lots of love brother.

We\u0027re thrilled to have the opportunity to reach far more people, with far more impact, than we ever could alone.It is not clear what Apple plans to do with the weather app, but it will presumably be folded into the forecasts that are provided by the built-in tool in the iPhone and other platforms.

in areas with hot and humid climates?Can Covid-19 be transmitted through mosquito bites?Can I use hand dryers and ultraviolet disinfection lamps to kill Covid-19?How effective are thermal scanners for detecting infected people?Should I spray alcohol or chlorine on myself to kill Covid-19?Will a pneumonia vaccine protect me against the virus?What about antibiotics?As the new coronavirus spreads around the globe, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has been working to make sure people have accurate information on how to stay safe and healthy.There is currently no specific medicine to prevent or treat the virus, formally known as Covid-19, which has infected more than 200,000 people worldwide.However, the WHO has advised people of all ages to take simple steps to protect themselves, such as by frequently cleaning hands with alcohol-based hand rub or washing them with soap and water.Although older people and people with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes and heart disease) appear to be more vulnerable to serious illness, the WHO has said all people should take steps to protect themselves from Covid-19.\u0026nbspYou can find the organisation’s advice on some common myths and misconceptions about the virus below.Created with Sketch.Before and after photos show impact of coronavirus around the world Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.1020 Gateway of India, Mumbai1320 Church of the Nativity, Bethlehem1020 Gateway of India, Mumbai1320 Church of the Nativity, Bethlehem1 Can Covid-19 be transmitted in areas with hot and humid climates?Current evidence shows Covid-19 can be transmitted in all areas, including areas with hot and humid weather, and protective measures need to be adopted in any area reporting the virus, regardless of climate.There is no reason to believe cold weather can kill the new coronavirus or other diseases, as the normal human body temperature remains around 36.5 to 37C, regardless of the external temperature or weather.Taking a hot bath will also not prevent you from catching Covid-19, and\u0026nbsptaking a bath with extremely hot water can also be harmful\u0026nbspas it can burn you.2 Can Covid-19 be transmitted through mosquito bites?There has been no information or evidence to date to suggest that the new coronavirus can be transmitted by mosquitoes.Covid-19 is a respiratory virus which spreads primarily through droplets generated when an infected person coughs or sneezes, or through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose.3 Can I use hand dryers and ultraviolet disinfection lamps to kill Covid-19?The dirty truth about washing your handsWhat is the difference between Covid-19 and the common cold and flu?Can face masks really protect you against coronavirus or flu?The UK government\u0027s four stages of fighting coronavirus explainedWhat are symptoms of coronavirus -- and where has it spread?Hand dryers are not effective in killing the new coronavirus and to protect yourself, you should frequently clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.Once your hands are cleaned, you should then dry them thoroughly by using paper towels or a warm air dryer.UV lamps should not be used to sterilise hands or other areas of skin as UV radiation can cause skin irritation.4 How effective are thermal scanners for detecting infected people?Thermal scanners are effective in detecting people who have developed a fever – those with a higher than normal body temperature – because of infection with Covid-19.However, they cannot detect people who are infected but are not yet sick with fever.\u0026nbspThis is because it takes between two\u0026nbspand 10 days before people who are infected become sick and develop a fever.5 Should I spray alcohol or chlorine on myself to kill Covid-19?Spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body will not kill viruses that have already entered your body and spraying such substances can be harmful to clothes or mucous membranes, such as your eyes and mouth.Be aware that both alcohol and chlorine can be useful for disinfecting surfaces, but they need to be used under appropriate recommendations.Similarly, there is also no evidence that regularly rinsing the nose with saline can protect people from infection by the new coronavirus.6 Will a pneumonia vaccine protect me against the virus?Vaccines against pneumonia, such as pneumococcal vaccine and Haemophilus influenza type B (Hib) vaccine, do not provide protection against Covid-19.The virus is so new and different that it needs its own vaccine, which researchers are currently working on trying to develop.Although these vaccines are not effective against Covid-19, vaccination against respiratory illnesses is highly recommended to protect your health.7 What about antibiotics?Antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria, and should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment for Covid-19\u0026nbsp– which is a virus.However, if someone is hospitalised for the new coronavirus, they may receive antibiotics because bacterial co-infection is possible.No

Nasa plans to send the first woman and next man to the lunar surface in 2024, and establish a Moon base by 2028. That work will lay the foundations for sending humans to Mars in the 2030s.“We’ve entered a bold new era of space exploration with the Artemis program, and we are thrilled to see so many incredible Americans apply to join us,” said NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine\u0026nbspin a statement.“The next class of Artemis Generation astronauts will help us explore more of the Moon than ever before and lead us to the Red Planet.”The call had seen applicants from every US state as well as the District of Columbia and four US territories.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

It is surpassed only by the record of 18,000 applicants set for the recent class of astronauts, who graduated at the beginning of this year.The agency said that the large application fields allowed it to choose the best astronauts it could.“We’re able to build such a strong astronaut corps at NASA because we have such a strong pool of applicants to choose from,” said Anne\u0026nbspRoemer, manager of the Astronaut Selection Board and director of human resources at Johnson.“It’s always amazing to see the ersity of education, experience and skills that are represented in our applicants. We are excited to start reviewing astronaut applications to identify the next class of astronaut candidates.”Since the 1960s, some 350 people have been chosen to train as astronaut candidates. There are 48 people in the active astronaut corps, but Nasa says that it will need more as it works to head to multiple destinations at once, including the Moon and beyond.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Reversing the increase would deny a pay rise to hundreds of thousands of low paid workers, including many in sectors such as care, retail and cleaning, who are on the front line in the national effort to tackle the virus.”Polling by the institute found that 66 per cent of adults last October believed the level of the minimum wage to be too low. Only 2 per cent said it was too high.Support for hiking the minimum wage was highest among young adults and low-income households.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailThe independent Low Pay Commission recommended the upcoming NLW rate in October 2019.“It is extremely hard to believe that, had they known that the coronavirus outbreak were about to unfold, they would have recommended that same rate,” argued the IFS earlier this week.Nye Cominetti of The Resolution Foundation said: “Increasing cost pressures for low-paying firms directly affected by the government lockdown risks pushing them towards making job losses – something we all want to avoid.”In the 2019 general election the Conservatives pledged to raise the NLW to two thirds of median earnings within five years.The national living wage is the government’s term for the statutory hourly wage floor for those aged 25 and over. The term it uses for the statutory wage floor for younger workers is the national minimum wage.The national minimum wage is £4.55 for 16-17 year olds in 202021, £6.45 for those aged 18-20 and £8.00 for 21-24 year olds.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But, just like with Cheer\u0026nbspand Tiger King, it’s the\u0026nbspdocumentaries– including Brew Brothers and The Innocence Files – that could prove to be your next binge watches.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesWhen it comes to the licenced content, though, Netflix has you sorted. Among the many things joining this month are the remaining Studio Ghibli films that haven’t yet been added, all\u0026nbspsix seasons of Community and Will Ferrell comedy Blades of Glory.Find a full list of everything being added to Netflix in the UK in April below – find the US list here.Sunderland ‘Til I Die season 2Why Netflix has become a graveyard for great shows39 hidden gems to stream while self-isolatingThe best Amazon Prime and Netflix shows to watch while self-isolatingToo Hot to Handle​Cooked with Cannabis\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspWin the Wilderness\u0026nbsp​The House of Flowers season 3Never Have I Ever​The Forest of Love: Deep Cut​Time to HuntEarth and Blood​Rich in Love​How to Fix a Drug ScandalCircus of Books​David Batra: Elefanten I Rummet\u0026nbspMurder to Mercy: The\u0026nbspCyntoia\u0026nbspBrown Story​The Last Kids on Earth Book 2​The Adventures of TintinBlades of GloryDumb and DumberFrom Up on Poppy HillCreated with Sketch.Hidden gems: The best Netflix originals you might have missed Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.120 Money Heist (TV series, one season, 2017–)Known as La Casa de Papel (House of Paper) in its native Spanish, Money Heist is Netflix’s most streamed non-English language show. The bank heist is a tired dramatic trope these days, but don’t let that, or the show’s bland English-language title, put you off – creator Álex Pina has made something special. The heist here, led by a mysterious man known only as The Professor, involves breaking into the Royal Mint of Spain and printing off €2.4 billion. There are even more twists in the show’s 15 episodes than there are hostages. 220 American Vandal (TV series, two seasons, 2017–2018)Part satire of true crime documentaries such as Making a Murderer, part carefully observed portrayal of teenage life, American Vandal was criminally underappreciated during its two season run. It’s been cancelled now, but that doesn’t mean you can’t catch up with it, and then write Netflix a strongly worded email.320 One Day at a Time (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)In stark contrast to the off-beat, low-key comedy that currently rules TV – the kind that provokes a wry smirk rather than a hearty laugh – One Day at a Time is a big, bright sitcom filmed in front of an interminably enthusiastic studio audience. You wouldn’t have thought that the story of a Cuban-American army veteran  nurse  single mother – who suffers from PTSD and depression – would fit into this format, but it does so beautifully, tackling issues of sexuality, racism and sexism in the process.  Based on writer  director Tamara Jenkins’s own fertility struggles, Private Life stars Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti (both giving brilliant performances) as a spiky, loving middle-aged couple desperate to have a baby. They even rope their enthusiastic but irresponsible niece Sadie (Kayli Carter) into the mix, much to the horror of Sadie’s mother (Molly Shannon, turning a potentially repellent character into one worthy of empathy). It’s subtle, restrained and beautifully realised.520 Big Mouth (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Crude, rude, and rife with surprise emissions and bodily functions, animated sitcom Big Mouth is also a sensitive, nuanced deep e into the various horrors of teenagehood. When 12-year-old Andrew Glouberman (John Mulaney) is visited by the hormone monster (Nick Kroll, who voices many of the show’s best characters), he finds his life irreversibly – and seemingly disastrously – changed. Unlike many other puberty-centred comedies, Big Mouth makes as much time for its confused female protagonists as its male ones Maya Rudolph is a delight as the female hormone monster, and look out for Kristen Wiig’s wonderful turn as a talking vagina.  620 Easy (TV series, two seasons, 2016–)Joe Swanberg’s style of defiantly undramatic mumblecore isn’t for everyone, but if you enjoyed his earlier films, Drinking Buddies and Happy Christmas, you’ll find plenty to admire in this anthology comedy-drama series. Big-name stars such as Orlando Bloom and Aubrey Plaza crop up, but Jane Adams – who you might remember from Todd Solondz’s chronically depressing 1998 film Happiness – is the show’s heart, and Marc Maron is its jaded soul.Community’s Gillian Jacobs is brilliant as the prickly, magnetic recovering addict Mickey, who forms an unlikely – and arguably deeply unwise – relationship with her nerdy neighbour Gus (Paul Rust). Despite Gus’s pathological need to be the nice guy, we’re never quite sure who or what we’re rooting for – which is what makes Love such complex, compelling viewing.  In 2016, comedian Patton Oswalt’s wife, the true crime writer Michelle McNamara, died suddenly in her sleep. That subject matter doesn’t exactly scream “stand-up special”, but out of his devastating loss, Oswalt managed to craft something funny and profound. Over the course of an hour, he processes his grief onstage, managing to find humour in the struggle to raise his grieving six-year-old daughter alone.920 Santa Clarita Diet (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Granted, this horror-comedy – which stars Drew Barrymore as a neurotic real estate agent who suddenly develops a taste for human flesh – is really silly, and really, really disgusting. But it’s also strangely charming, and funny. Timothy Olyphant is excellent as Sheila’s frazzled husband Joel, and the pair’s idiosyncratic but respectful relationship with their smart teenage daughter Abby (Liv Hewson) isn’t quite like anything else on TV right now.1020 Dark Tourist (TV series, one season, 2018–)New Zealand journalist David Farrier is an unlikely TV presenter in the same way that Louis Theroux is – in just about every scenario in which he finds himself, he’s a little bit awkward. But as with Theroux, Farrier’s weakness is actually his strength, allowing him to endear himself to the many unusual people he meets on his journey through the world’s most questionable tourist destinations. Farrier’s stops include the site of the Fukushima nuclear disaster, the road where JFK was assassinated, and the Milwaukee suburbs where serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer murdered his victims.1120 Sacred Games (TV series, one season, 2018–)Based on Vikram Chandra’s epic 2006 novel, Netflix’s first Indian original series is a slowly unfolding gem. The first season of Sacred Games – which follows a troubled police officer (Saif Ali Khan) who has 25 days to save his city thanks to a tip-off from a presumed dead gangster – only covered one quarter of Chandra’s 1,000-page novel. As the show itself declared when it announced the forthcoming second season, “the worst is yet to come”.When the trailer for Dumplin’ first landed, it seemed all the ingredients were in place for a film that was at worst tone-deaf, and at best vaguely patronising. Thank heavens, then, that the trailer did Dumplin’ such a disservice. Starring Danielle Macdonald (who broke out in the excellent 2017 film Patti Cake$) as Willowdean, a self-described “fat girl” who enters a local pageant to annoy her former beauty queen mother (Jennifer Aniston), Dumplin’ is as funny, warm and sensitive as its protagonist – and with a killer Dolly Parton-laden soundtrack to boot.1320 Dark (TV series, one season, 2017–)This sci-fi thriller – which features disappearing children, a mysterious local power plant, and scenes set in the Eighties – has, for obvious reasons, drawn comparisons to Stranger Things. But Dark is even more beguiling and (true to its name) less family-friendly than Stranger Things.1420 The Death and Life of Marsha P Johnson (Film, 2017)Though it’s been somewhat tarnished by claims that director David France appropriated the work and research of trans film-maker Reina Gossett, this documentary is nonetheless a loving, respectful tribute to gay rights activist Marsha P Johnson. One of the key figures in the Stonewall uprising (though her involvement was almost entirely eradicated in 2015’s critically hated Stonewall), Johnson modelled for Andy Warhol, performed onstage with drag group Hot Peaches, helped found the Gay Liberation Front, and then died under suspicious circumstances in 1992.1520 On My Block (TV series, one season, 2018–)This coming-of-age series might not have found as many eyeballs as it deserved last year, but those it did find were glued to the screen. In fact, it was the most-binged show of 2018 – meaning that it had the highest watch-time-per-viewing session of any Netflix original. Created by Awkward’s Lauren Iungerich, On My Block follows a group of Los Angeles teens as they navigate both the drama of high school and the danger of inner-city life.Two beleaguered assistants (Zoey Deutch and Glen Powell) conspire to get their over-demanding bosses (Taye Diggs and Lucy Liu) together in order to get their lives back in this winning romantic comedy. Set It Up is responsible not only for coining the term “over-dicking” (it’s much more innocent than it sounds), but for rejuvenating a tired genre.Martin Freeman stars as the father struggling to protect his young daughter from a zombie epidemic spreading across Australia. So far, so overdone. But this drama thriller, directed by Ben Howling and Yolanda Ramke and based on their 2013 short of the same name, throws a handful of unpredictable ners in the works.    1920 Godless (TV series, one season, 2017–)With shades of John Ford\u0027s The Searchers, this languorous western was critically acclaimed but swiftly forgotten after it landed on Netflix in 2016. Set in 1884, it\u0027s about Frank Griffin (Jeff Daniels) and his notoriously ruthless gang of outlaws’ pursuit of their injured former ally Roy Goode (Jack O’Connell), who is hiding out in a small town populated solely by women after a mining accident killed off all its men. A gun-toting Michelle Dockery, clearly relishing the change of scenery after years of Downton Abbey, and a taciturn Jack O’Connell, are on brilliant form.2020 Atypical (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)This coming-of-age series about a teenage boy with autism was sweet and well-intentioned from the start, but its first season was criticised for a handful of inaccuracies, and for its lack of autistic actors. Rather than drowning in a sea of defensiveness – as too many shows tend to do – it listened, and brought in autistic actors and writers for its excellent second season.120 Money Heist (TV series, one season, 2017–)Known as La Casa de Papel (House of Paper) in its native Spanish, Money Heist is Netflix’s most streamed non-English language show. The bank heist is a tired dramatic trope these days, but don’t let that, or the show’s bland English-language title, put you off – creator Álex Pina has made something special. The heist here, led by a mysterious man known only as The Professor, involves breaking into the Royal Mint of Spain and printing off €2.4 billion. There are even more twists in the show’s 15 episodes than there are hostages. 220 American Vandal (TV series, two seasons, 2017–2018)Part satire of true crime documentaries such as Making a Murderer, part carefully observed portrayal of teenage life, American Vandal was criminally underappreciated during its two season run. It’s been cancelled now, but that doesn’t mean you can’t catch up with it, and then write Netflix a strongly worded email.320 One Day at a Time (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)In stark contrast to the off-beat, low-key comedy that currently rules TV – the kind that provokes a wry smirk rather than a hearty laugh – One Day at a Time is a big, bright sitcom filmed in front of an interminably enthusiastic studio audience.

It’s subtle, restrained and beautifully realised.520 Big Mouth (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Crude, rude, and rife with surprise emissions and bodily functions, animated sitcom Big Mouth is also a sensitive, nuanced deep e into the various horrors of teenagehood. When 12-year-old Andrew Glouberman (John Mulaney) is visited by the hormone monster (Nick Kroll, who voices many of the show’s best characters), he finds his life irreversibly – and seemingly disastrously – changed. Unlike many other puberty-centred comedies, Big Mouth makes as much time for its confused female protagonists as its male ones Maya Rudolph is a delight as the female hormone monster, and look out for Kristen Wiig’s wonderful turn as a talking vagina.  620 Easy (TV series, two seasons, 2016–)Joe Swanberg’s style of defiantly undramatic mumblecore isn’t for everyone, but if you enjoyed his earlier films, Drinking Buddies and Happy Christmas, you’ll find plenty to admire in this anthology comedy-drama series. Big-name stars such as Orlando Bloom and Aubrey Plaza crop up, but Jane Adams – who you might remember from Todd Solondz’s chronically depressing 1998 film Happiness – is the show’s heart, and Marc Maron is its jaded soul.Community’s Gillian Jacobs is brilliant as the prickly, magnetic recovering addict Mickey, who forms an unlikely – and arguably deeply unwise – relationship with her nerdy neighbour Gus (Paul Rust). Despite Gus’s pathological need to be the nice guy, we’re never quite sure who or what we’re rooting for – which is what makes Love such complex, compelling viewing.  In 2016, comedian Patton Oswalt’s wife, the true crime writer Michelle McNamara, died suddenly in her sleep. That subject matter doesn’t exactly scream “stand-up special”, but out of his devastating loss, Oswalt managed to craft something funny and profound. Over the course of an hour, he processes his grief onstage, managing to find humour in the struggle to raise his grieving six-year-old daughter alone.920 Santa Clarita Diet (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Granted, this horror-comedy – which stars Drew Barrymore as a neurotic real estate agent who suddenly develops a taste for human flesh – is really silly, and really, really disgusting. But it’s also strangely charming, and funny. Timothy Olyphant is excellent as Sheila’s frazzled husband Joel, and the pair’s idiosyncratic but respectful relationship with their smart teenage daughter Abby (Liv Hewson) isn’t quite like anything else on TV right now.1020 Dark Tourist (TV series, one season, 2018–)New Zealand journalist David Farrier is an unlikely TV presenter in the same way that Louis Theroux is – in just about every scenario in which he finds himself, he’s a little bit awkward. But as with Theroux, Farrier’s weakness is actually his strength, allowing him to endear himself to the many unusual people he meets on his journey through the world’s most questionable tourist destinations. Farrier’s stops include the site of the Fukushima nuclear disaster, the road where JFK was assassinated, and the Milwaukee suburbs where serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer murdered his victims.1120 Sacred Games (TV series, one season, 2018–)Based on Vikram Chandra’s epic 2006 novel, Netflix’s first Indian original series is a slowly unfolding gem. The first season of Sacred Games – which follows a troubled police officer (Saif Ali Khan) who has 25 days to save his city thanks to a tip-off from a presumed dead gangster – only covered one quarter of Chandra’s 1,000-page novel. As the show itself declared when it announced the forthcoming second season, “the worst is yet to come”.When the trailer for Dumplin’ first landed, it seemed all the ingredients were in place for a film that was at worst tone-deaf, and at best vaguely patronising. Thank heavens, then, that the trailer did Dumplin’ such a disservice. Starring Danielle Macdonald (who broke out in the excellent 2017 film Patti Cake$) as Willowdean, a self-described “fat girl” who enters a local pageant to annoy her former beauty queen mother (Jennifer Aniston), Dumplin’ is as funny, warm and sensitive as its protagonist – and with a killer Dolly Parton-laden soundtrack to boot.1320 Dark (TV series, one season, 2017–)This sci-fi thriller – which features disappearing children, a mysterious local power plant, and scenes set in the Eighties – has, for obvious reasons, drawn comparisons to Stranger Things. But Dark is even more beguiling and (true to its name) less family-friendly than Stranger Things.1420 The Death and Life of Marsha P Johnson (Film, 2017)Though it’s been somewhat tarnished by claims that director David France appropriated the work and research of trans film-maker Reina Gossett, this documentary is nonetheless a loving, respectful tribute to gay rights activist Marsha P Johnson. One of the key figures in the Stonewall uprising (though her involvement was almost entirely eradicated in 2015’s critically hated Stonewall), Johnson modelled for Andy Warhol, performed onstage with drag group Hot Peaches, helped found the Gay Liberation Front, and then died under suspicious circumstances in 1992.1520 On My Block (TV series, one season, 2018–)This coming-of-age series might not have found as many eyeballs as it deserved last year, but those it did find were glued to the screen. In fact, it was the most-binged show of 2018 – meaning that it had the highest watch-time-per-viewing session of any Netflix original. Created by Awkward’s Lauren Iungerich, On My Block follows a group of Los Angeles teens as they navigate both the drama of high school and the danger of inner-city life.Two beleaguered assistants (Zoey Deutch and Glen Powell) conspire to get their over-demanding bosses (Taye Diggs and Lucy Liu) together in order to get their lives back in this winning romantic comedy. Set It Up is responsible not only for coining the term “over-dicking” (it’s much more innocent than it sounds), but for rejuvenating a tired genre.Martin Freeman stars as the father struggling to protect his young daughter from a zombie epidemic spreading across Australia. So far, so overdone. But this drama thriller, directed by Ben Howling and Yolanda Ramke and based on their 2013 short of the same name, throws a handful of unpredictable ners in the works.    1920 Godless (TV series, one season, 2017–)With shades of John Ford\u0027s The Searchers, this languorous western was critically acclaimed but swiftly forgotten after it landed on Netflix in 2016. Set in 1884, it\u0027s about Frank Griffin (Jeff Daniels) and his notoriously ruthless gang of outlaws’ pursuit of their injured former ally Roy Goode (Jack O’Connell), who is hiding out in a small town populated solely by women after a mining accident killed off all its men. A gun-toting Michelle Dockery, clearly relishing the change of scenery after years of Downton Abbey, and a taciturn Jack O’Connell, are on brilliant form.2020 Atypical (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)This coming-of-age series about a teenage boy with autism was sweet and well-intentioned from the start, but its first season was criticised for a handful of inaccuracies, and for its lack of autistic actors. Rather than drowning in a sea of defensiveness – as too many shows tend to do – it listened, and brought in autistic actors and writers for its excellent second season.Ladies in BlackWhisper of the HeartWhen the Game Stands TallViolet Evergarden: Eternity and the Auto Memory DollWelcome to MercyPokemon the Series: Sun \u0026amp Moon season 3 – Ultra LegendsThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We’re determined to keep getting food out there.”“The number of people in need is much greater now, but we’re set up to do a lot more than we used to. And the Help The Hungry campaign is certainly helping get us plenty of traction and offers of help.”How to support our campaignPrior to the pandemic, The Felix Project had been picking up surplus food from restaurants, caterers and manufacturers and delivering it to around 600 food banks, care homes, school providers and other charities.“Some of the charities are\u0026nbspeither closing or having to reduce what they can do,” said Mr Curtin. “We are still getting food to all those that are still operating, and all those trying to get supplies to people’s homes in different ways.”Responding to the enormous scale of the current crisis, The Felix Project has joined forces with two other large food surplus charities – City Harvest and FareShare – to create the London Food Alliance.And to make sure food redistribution is as efficient as possible, the alliance is now co-ordinating with all 32 London boroughs to make sure the new, centralised community hubs are well-stocked with surplus food.The Felix Project’s pool of volunteers has gone up to around 75 people, and Renault have provided the charity with six new vans. Mr Curtin said he would like to get hold of more vehicles\u0026nbspwith refrigerators inside – and is also looking for more volunteer drivers. “That would make a massive difference,” he said.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailThe CEO added: “There is actually plenty of food in the supply chain – the industry, the farmers, the producers, the manufacturers, the supermarkets – they are all stepping up.”Over at the new community hub in Edmonton, in the London Borough of Enfield, council staff and volunteers are gearing up for a huge emergency food operation.“We’ve made the decision to help everyone who needs help, including people who may be struggling financially,” said the council leader Nesil Caliskan.On Tuesday, residents who have signed up to help their council dropped off the first 80 food parcels to some of their most vulnerable neighbours, with deliveries set to accelerate in the days ahead.The council has been provided with around 4,400 names of the most vulnerable people in the area, given age and underlying health conditions, from the NHS list. It is also inviting everyone struggling because of job losses or a sudden drop in income to register with them for help.“The small, local groups have done brilliant work, but we need to co-ordinate so that we made sure absolutely everyone who is in a vulnerable position is picked up,” said Ms Caliskan. “The Felix Project works right across London, so it’s been a great partner.”Tottenham Hotspur Stadium was the first of the community hubs to open on Monday, as Haringey council staff and volunteers began getting surplus food out to vulnerable people in the borough.Rachel Ledwith, FareShare’s development manager in London, said her organisation and the others in the alliance were speaking to each other at a daily 11.30am phone call to co-ordinate deliveries across the capital.“We’re ready to get a high volume of food into the hubs, and all the boroughs are reacting as fast as they can to get things up and running,” she said.Ms\u0026nbspLedwith\u0026nbspadded: “There’s been a tsunami of food coming from the hospitality and catering sector. We’re also seeing the large manufacturers and retailers donate more, as well as providing us with surplus food.”When can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsWhich countries around the world has coronavirus spread to?Listen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus Podcast“What’s important next is that we work closely with the food industry to ensure the current volumes of food we’re accessing remain sustainable, as we know demand from our charity network will only continue increasing over the coming weeks.”The encouraging developments come as the total raised by our Help the Hungry appeal, in conjunction with our sister title the\u0026nbspEvening Standard, leapt by £300,000 in 24 hours to £850,000.We are also asking food aid charities across the UK to contact us using the email helpthehungry@ to tell us about your project and what problems you are facing right now.You can help us build a directory of ways that our readers can help the hungry in their area – through money, volunteering and food donations.

People who previously struggled with universal credit continue to do so. Rough sleepers and sofa surfers continue to live without shelter. Services that once offered support have shuttered to protect workers, while people are burning through their kitchen cupboards faster than usual because they are stuck inside.\u0026nbspIn short, many of those who have needed to use food banks in the past, those who are not among the government’s 1.5 million most at-risk people and will not be able to call on its swelling volunteer service for support, still need help.\u0026nbspThe Independent’s Help The Hungry campaign aims to help give these people the support they need. Click here for ways you can help.And here are five things you might not have considered to help you to support your community’s food bank.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesA common misconception is that food banks exist to offer the bare minimum – but to do so would be to completely undermine what food can give us in our day to day lives. We don’t only eat for sustenance – we do it for pleasure, to access our cultures, to engage in tradition. Food is central to the human experience, and for millennia has been key to how we experience love and affection.How to support our campaignSo ultimately think about what is going to taste good. Of course you can pick up staples that will be warmly received, but you can also donate things that get you excited, and share that excitement with someone else.Take, for example, Easter eggs. They may not be a matter of life or death, but by donating them you can give a parent the chance to treat their child, and a child the ability to engage in a communal tradition they might have been left out of. You are not just handing out subsistence, but a moment of dignity and joy for a family – and all it took was a bit of chocolate.It’s not just foodFood banks have never been just about food. Poverty is about choices – do you buy something to eat, or put money on the meter to keep the electricity running? Do you really need the heating on, or can you hold out? Will you be hungry now, or hungry later?\u0026nbspAt their most fundamental level, food banks are about a community pulling together and trying to resolve those conflicts – so when you think of donating, empathy is key. On one side of the spectrum, this means not just dredging mystery tins from the back of your cupboard – if you didn’t want to eat it over the last two years, chances are no one else will either. On the other, it’s about thinking of the groceries you couldn’t live without – be that food or something else.In the early days of the UK epidemic, among the first things to be stockpiled were hygiene products – sanitary towels, hand wash, toilet roll. If you didn’t have the ability to bulk buy, or the spare funds to travel from shop to shop by car or public transport, you were stuck. Donating bathroom products means people who use the service don’t have to choose between hunger and hygiene.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailThe range of reasons people visit food banks is vast, reflecting many of the social issues seen across the country, from universal credit delays to limited post-prison rehabilitation systems, rising rents and jobs that simply do not pay enough to allow for survival.\u0026nbspBut helping rough sleepers and sofa surfers out represents a unique challenge for food banks – particularly those who do not have access to kitchens and so are less likely to feel the benefit of, say, the bag of dry pasta many would receive. While volunteers will build a parcel that helps as much as possible, you can go a step further by putting together boxes of much-needed items that can be handed straight over as is.\u0026nbspAsk if your local service is interested, then get a few shoeboxes and add things that might prove useful – like socks and underwear, first aid kits, compact waterproofs, or toothbrushes and paste. Once again as much as you are donating a small box of odds and ends, you are also handing over dignity, and the tools people need to look after themselves.\u0026nbspBags of bagsFood banks across the country have had to make drastic changes to how they operate due to the virus – while volunteers may have a few contingency plans up their sleeves to keep services running, readying for a global pandemic was not among them.What has followed has been a herculean effort to organise outright change in a matter of days. Entire delivery systems have been dreamt up out of thin air, while the elderly and at risk who make up much of the volunteer base have been sent home.\u0026nbspFood banks strained as volunteers isolate and demand surgesFood banks have never been more needed, or closer to collapseFood banks in crisis as coronvirus panic buying leaves families hungryFood banks are under threat – the government has to step inUnited and City make joint food bank donation to fight coronavirusOperations have also been streamlined to feed as many people as possible, as hygienically as can be achieved. And as every service user’s food is bagged up and handed over, a small mountain of plastic bags are being deployed.So, bizarrely enough, in this time of national crisis, that bag of shopping bags that you and every other UK resident has been keeping in the corner of their kitchen or under their sink for years might finally serve a purpose. After all that time of being stored and neglected after trips to the supermarket, they could be put to use in ensuring social distancing.\u0026nbspAsk your local food bank if they could use them – but if you can go a step further and also feel a little apprehensive about contributing to the impact of plastic on the planet, consider handing over canvas bags instead. There are so many feelings wrapped into asking for help – and when you’ve been let down by the world around you time and time again, one that’s likely to come up is shame.\u0026nbspVolunteers work hard to try to mitigate that – and make the experience about support and community, but it’s easy to feel self-conscious walking away from a food bank and onto the high street with an array of clearly worn and mismatched carrier bags in your hands. A canvas bag, while sturdier, is also more discreet.Possibly the most useful thing you can do for your local food bank is among the easiest – ask what they need. While the Trussell Trust, the nation’s largest food bank charity, helps to set up and support sites, the inidual operation in your region sets its own rules and runs its own show. Others run via other charities or completely independently.\u0026nbspSo check out their tweets to see what they are appealing for, or send them an email to check what they are after, or give them a call and offer up a few hours a week to stack some tins (particularly if you are young, physically fit and don’t mind lugging around crates of produce).\u0026nbspReaching out, at every level, is fundamental to what food banks are. In reaching out you will get the satisfaction that comes from rallying around your community at a time where we’ve perhaps never been more isolated. What the person who comes to ask for food will get, from your contribution combined with others in your area coming together, is help when it’s possible no one else can.Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But they were being very naughty.”The following day, Mr Stuart noted the goats were “back, and gathering in groups of more than two”.He continued to document the goats’ movements throughout the weekend, eventually writing a post echoed by many, declaring: “I, for one, welcome our new goat overlords.”“Growing up in Llandudno, I always knew the Great Orme mountain goats would be ones to take over in the event of any future apocalyptic dystopia,” said Jeanna Skinner, writing on Twitter.\u0026nbspAnother Twitter user wrote: “And so it came to pass that the Great Orme goats captured Llandudno and all who saw them did tremble at their might.”While the goats are fairly regular uninvited guests in the town,\u0026nbsphaving even faced a cull in the 1990s,\u0026nbspthere appears to be a general consensus that\u0026nbsplockdown\u0026nbsphas encouraged them to roam further\u0026nbspthan usual.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They usually only come down from the Great Orme when it’s windy, and only the backstreets at the top of Mostyn Street. Now lockdown means it’s empty, they’re going further than ever.”The goats of Llandudno are not the only animals taking advantage of the absence of humans to venture more often into\u0026nbsptypically bustling towns and cities.Wild boars have been spotted in Barcelona, ducks were filmed\u0026nbspstraying\u0026nbspfrom the Seine to roam the streets of Paris,\u0026nbspand a puma was captured by authorities in the Chilean capital, Santiago.

We have teamed up with The Felix Project – a start-up charity we helped launch in 2016 – to deliver produce to community hubs in London boroughs.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Independent is also asking food charities across Britain to contact helpthehungry@ to tell us about your project and help build a directory of ways that our readers can help the hungry in their area – through money, volunteering and food donations. Food banks, which were already struggling to meet the need for emergency food parcels, have seen a huge surge in demand in recent weeks, while at the same time coping with dwindling donations, supermarket rationing systems, and a loss of many volunteers to self-isolation – yet none of the government’s rescue money goes to them.British households have stored more than £1bn worth of goods in their homes in response to the pandemic, creating shortages for food banks as shoppers ignore assurances that supply chains are robust.How to support our campaignJess Phillips, the Labour MP who recently ran for party leader, has backed our campaign, saying: “Nobody should be in the position of not being able to get enough food. In my constituency, London and in places all around the UK the coronavirus pandemic is placing extra stress on a system that was already straining.“We should all do what we can to help food and other essentials get to those that need it. That is why I’m backing the Help the Hungry campaign – please give if you are able.”Pastor Obi Onyeabor, the manager at Barking Foodbank, part of The Trussell Trust’s national network, said his pool of around 50 volunteers has been reduced by a dozen or so people currently self-isolating at home. Yet he and his team have kept their two church hall food banks open, and are now making home deliveries on Tuesdays and Thursdays to make sure the most vulnerable get supplies.“We have been scrambling for the past couple of weeks, doing all that we can – but we’re appealing for more people to come and help,” he said. “Out of fear people have been buying for themselves and their families, but I’ve seen some real generosity too.“I hope that if we can get past the panic buying stage, more people will want to give money, food or some of their time too.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailIn London, charities like The Felix Project donate 10 tons of food – or 22,000 meals – to the needy every day. But funding has dropped since the outbreak of Covid-19, limiting their capacity to carry out vital work at a time when it is more important than ever. As part of the London Food Alliance, along with FareShare and City Harvest, The Felix Project will coordinate deliveries in London boroughs in order to distribute surplus food to the elderly, poor and vulnerable. The charities will deliver food to the hubs, where local volunteers will package up parcels and arrange “last-mile” deliveries to the homes of the vulnerable.Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, has backed our campaign to help in the capital in partnership with our sister title the Evening Standard. He said: “In a city as prosperous as London, everyone should have enough food to feed themselves and their families – but unfortunately the coronavirus outbreak means some Londoners are facing even greater difficulties. It’s commendable these organisations are joining forces to help ensure surplus food isn’t wasted and instead reaches those who need it most. I urge Londoners to support this crucial initiative.”Mark Curtin, CEO of The Felix Project, said: “Our role is to pick up large volumes of nutritious surplus food from the commercial sector and deliver it to community hubs to ensure there is enough food for vulnerable people for as long as this health crisis ensues. We will be working all hours doing our bit – and it would be wonderful if your readers can get behind us so we can do this job for London.”Emma Revie, chief executive of The Trussell Trust, which supports 1,200 food banks, appealed for help from the public to get vital food to people who cannot afford the basics, and to boost volunteer numbers in areas where they are needed.\u0026nbsp“Our main priority as coronavirus unfolds is ensuring the safety of everyone who comes to a food bank – whether it’s someone needing help, someone volunteering their time, or someone making a donation,” said Ms Revie. “Until we are confident that adequate government protection against poverty is in place, food banks provide an essential community service to people unable to afford food. But this should not fall to food banks.\u0026nbsp“Our benefits system could be the life raft people need now. That’s why it’s more important than ever that we end the five-week wait for universal credit. While incredible food bank volunteers continue to help people unable to afford the basics, we would ask our government to take this essential step and end the five-week wait now. It’s five weeks too long.”Sabine Goodwin, coordinator of the Independent Food Aid Network UK, which oversees 834 independent food banks, said the charitable services were “struggling to stay above water” in the current climate and accused the government of so far “failing to act” to prevent an ever-increasing number of people falling into poverty.“Food bank use was rising before the coronavirus outbreak and the impact of job losses can only make matters far worse. But this catastrophe in the making is avoidable,” she said. “We’re calling for an income-based solution to this crisis which would mean that the Herculean efforts by volunteers across the country wouldn’t be needed.“FareShare, the UK’s biggest food redistribution charity, is also calling for more volunteers to help with packing and making van deliveries. The organisation takes food from the food manufacturers that can’t be sold in shops, either because of packaging errors or overproduction, and gets it out to food banks, hospices, homeless hostels and other charities.Commercial director Alyson Walsh estimates around 1,200 people have got in touch over the past week. “We have quite a lot of older volunteers who have had to stay at home, but we are now seeing a wave of interest in new people willing to fill in.”Ms Walsh added: “We know we have the capacity to do more – we have the warehouse\u0026nbspspace and the chillers. But the government needs to help the food industry do more in terms of all the bagging and boxing and delivery of food that needs to be done.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

These would later be delivered to the doorsteps of poor, elderly and vulnerable residents of Haringey, as identified on the council’s database, as well as to the homes of local children eligible for free school meals.\u0026nbspSpurs chair\u0026nbspDaniel Levy said: “As a club, we have always been clear about our commitment to the wider community — and never has this been more important than it is now. We are immensely proud of the efforts of everybody involved in the fight against Covid-19 and see today as just the start of what we can do as a club to assist.”How to support our campaignA Haringey council spokesperson\u0026nbspsaid 150 of the borough’s most vulnerable families would have got food parcels delivered yesterday. Production will be ramped up from today to several thousand food parcels daily.\u0026nbspThe packers are council employees transferred from non-priority services and volunteers from Edible London, a local charity tackling food poverty.A second Haringey hub, located at Alexandra Palace,\u0026nbspalso became operational yesterday, and will be used to supply food to borough residents with severe underlying health problems in self-isolation as part of the government’s Covid-19 “shielded” category.Joseph Ejiofor, leader of Haringey council, said: “I’m inspired by the generosity of our community who have stepped up to help so quickly. We have staff and volunteers working tirelessly at our two food redistribution centres, Tottenham Hotspur Stadium and Alexandra Palace, alongside our voluntary sector partners, Edible London.“Working together we’re ensuring food gets to households who need it most.

Its most recent accounts recorded a pre-tax loss of £11.5m for the year ending September 2018, after a period of profitability that followed the move, in 2009, to a free-distribution model.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It could all go south tomorrow, he said.One factor that contributed to government officials closing down San Francisco early is it is\u0026nbspthe densest and oldest county, with more people over the age of 65 compared to the rest of California.Dr Robyn Gershon, clinical professor of epidemiology at NYU School of Global Public Health, also said the county had early warning signs of how the virus could be spreading in the US.San Francisco had a little bit of early warning because they are so close to the Asian countries, she said.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Companies like Apple and Google, both based in Silicon Valley, allowed their employees to stay home starting as early as 5 March.While this was all happening, millions of people every day were still taking the New York City subway and bus systems, which Dr Gershon said potentially aided the exponential spread in Manhattan.I think what really helped them is that (San Francisco) doesn\u0027t have mass transit, the epidemiologist said. New York City has kept open the mass transit because so many depend on it.It is very easy to spread, Dr Gershon added. It seems to spread from one person to three.When comparing New York City and San Francisco, similarities include both having high rates of a vulnerable elderly population, homeless people, and people living below the poverty line. These variables can contribute to each city getting hit harder with the virus compared to other parts of the US. But San Francisco isn\u0027t seeing quite the same hit.We are way outstripping them, Dr Gershon said about the number of cases and hospitalisations in New York City, adding: When you think of San Francisco and the counties, yeah they have a lot of people but in San Francisco ... it is not dense. It\u0027s not the dense close living that we have here.Dr Jeremy Greene, professor and director of the Institute of the History of Medicine at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, warned against comparing New York City and San Francisco based on how quickly regulations were put in place.I think that it\u0027s a dangerous game to compare the differential epidemic in New York City in San Francisco, he said. Yes, we know that California did put into place shelter-in-place orders earlier than New York ... but I don\u0027t believe that the difference that we are seeing between New York and San Francisco can be attributed to a political will-to-action.Covid-19 differs from that of influenza because people show little to no symptoms for weeks after first being infected.While we have earlier evidence of community spread in California over New York, we have no reason to believe that is the truth of the epidemiology, Dr Greene added. Coronavirus could\u0027ve been spreading in the New York area for far longer and clearly spreading in a denser capacity.EU says Trump\u0027s \u0027miracle\u0027 malaria drug \u0027has not been proved\u0027 effective\u0027It’s like being on eBay\u0027: Cuomo attacks US healthcare as coronavirus Fossil fuels should have cigarette-style warnings, health experts sayLouisiana sees large surge in coronavirus casesThe number of cases in every\u0026nbspcity and state has not been the most reliable factor when determining how Covid-19 has impacted the area because of the lack of testing capabilities in different parts of the US.Unlike influenza - where the disease manifests and it is clearly influenza - coronavirus is so silent that in the absence of a robust testing form, we\u0027re operating blind, Dr Greene said. The United States had several opportunities to aggressively ramp up and employ proper screening mechanisms on a level that South Korea deployed, and we failed to do so. And at this point we have no capacity to do so.In New York City, 89,197 residents have received tests for Covid-19 and more than 200,000 people in the state. California, in comparison, has only tested 89,600, as of last week. But case numbers in each area could be exponentially higher given how silent Covid-19 symptoms are in carriers.Hospitalisations and death rates are stronger indicators on how the virus has impacted communities, but even that data can be flawed in understanding the true level of the pandemic.The ICU hospitalisations are higher than we would\u0027ve thought relative to the other ones, Rutherford said about the Bay Area. Of the total number of California cases, 1,432 hospitalisations and 597 people are the ICU, a number that tripled from the weekend.Santa Clara, which has been hit the hardest in the Bay Area, reported 125 hospitalisations.\u0026nbspNew York City has more than 7,741 people hospitalised, 1,700 of which are in the ICU.Stay-at-home orders impact on states like California and New York will not be seen for another few weeks as less and less people are coming in contact with each other.It\u0027s going to take a couple of generations, 10 to 14 days, to see some peaking in the curve, Dr Rutherford said. And that is assuming the effect (of the virus) happens instantly.The epidemiologist added even though signs are cautiously showing the curve could be flattening, this was not the time for the Bay Area to lift regulations. Instead, it was announced the stay-at-home order across California\u0026nbspwould extend until 1 May.You have to be cautious about this stuff, he said. This is the time to save those 10 to 20,000 (lives).New York City has been clear that\u0026nbspadditional weeks are needed\u0026nbspto determine where the curve is going, and Mr Cuomo\u0026nbspsaid that apex could happen in seven to 21 days. New York state\u0027s stay-at-home order was extended through\u0026nbsp15 April with the anticipation for it to get pushed back again.Everyone who is infected by four weeks out is going to show up, Dr Gorshen added. They will be identified. (New York City) can then flatten the curve of our hospital surge.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

My body ached severely, I felt so heavy and was sweating with a fever.Things were not looking good. I struggled to sleep due to the intense body aches – I never felt anything like this before.Doctors have warned that a loss of taste or smell could also be a sign of coronavirus.The British Association of Otorhinolaryngology, which represents experts in ear, nose and throat medicine, has said that those who lose these senses should self-isolate immediately - evenyou have no other symptoms.They added that the eye infection conjunctivitis may also be another sign.In a statement, the docs said: Evidence from other countries that the entry point for the coronavirus is often in the eyes, nose and throat areas.We have also identied a new symptomthat may mean that people without other symptoms but with just the loss of this sense may have to self-isolate - again to reduce the spread of the virus.Its thought that losing the ability to smell or taste could be due to the virus destroying cells in the nose and throat.Experts say its something people can commonly experience after having other types of coronaviruses - such as the common cold.Prof Carl Philpott, of the Norwich Medical School at UEA, said: Coronaviruses have previously been associated with what we refer to as post-viral olfactory loss– this is smell loss that persists after a cold.There are many respiratory viruses that can potentially cause problems with the smell receptors.So far with Covid-, the smell loss appears to be transient but only as time elapses will we know how many people have a more permanent loss.Ryan Van Waterschoot, who ended up in hospital for  days while he fought Covid-, is one of those who lost his sense of taste and smell.The -year-old said: I didn’t think I was going to make it out of the hospital. I thought it was the end of the road for me.Mr Van Waterschoot, of Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, first felt unwell on March  when he lost his sense of taste and smell and, and went from feeling tired to not being able to move in just one day.As his condition worsened, he called the doctors and was immediately advised to call an ambulance on March .His temperature had soared and he was taken to Peterborough City Hospital where he was put on an isolation ward and needed oxygen for five days.He is now at home recovering but has warned people to stay at home and follow government advice.Some people may experience brain fog, also known as mental fatigue, as another symptom of coronavirus.Its not been officially looked into as a symptom but its another indicator that those who have experienced the illness have reported experiencing.Thea Jourdan, , said she didnt experience a cough or fever - instead her introduction to Covid- began with a tickle in her throat and a dull headache,.The mum-of-three, from Hampshire, says she then started to experience brain fog.She told the Daily Mail: Initially I felt exhausted, asI was dragging myself through treacle and had no choice but to go to my bed. I had no meaningful cough and I wasn’t running a fever.But I had a peculiar sensation of something settling deep within my lungs, almost like breathing in talcum powder. I also had brain fog. I was unable even to fill out forms from the children’s schools. I just wanted to sleep.Another woman, who had recently recovered from Covid-, told the Huffington Post that she too had experienced the unusual mental block before her symptoms worsened.Christy, from Seattle, said her illness started with a multi-day fever that progressed into sinus congestion, a headache and a debilitating “brain fog” that made it impossible to focus.She added: “It’s not just a cold.  I’m pretty healthy and not old , and it kicked my a**.”Another symptom that coronavirus patients have reported is feeling extremely fatigued before symptoms develop.According to a report in the Journal of the American Medical Association, up to  per cent of those hospitalised with Covid- reported exhaustion and fatigue.Chiara DiGiallorenzo, , has been battling Covid- since March , said her illness started with a fever and fatigue.But she knew it was more serious than a flu when she developed a tightness in her chest that left her short of breath.Chiara, from Miami, told HuffPo: “It is not the flu,” adding that many people who get it are left “fighting for air.”Linda Carr, , from Hethersett, Norfolk, said that around a fortnight ago she lost her sense of taste and smell.She told the Mail she then developed other symptoms, adding: I felt very sick and terribly fatigued. But I didn’t have a temperature or a cough.Within two days I could barely stand. I didn’t have the energy to lt one foot in front of the other.It was only when she went to her GP to collect some unrelated blood tests that she had her temperature taken and was told it was so high she should go straight to hospital.She tested positive for Covid- and spent five days in hospital before being discharged.Linda says she is still feeling weak and remains in isolation at home.Those who develop minor symptoms such as a high temperature or continuous cough should self-isolate for seven days.If you live with others, you should also stay at home for  days from the day the first person started showing symptoms.Anyone with suspected coronavirus who becomes seriously ill should call  and in a medical emergency always call .Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It is what a government should do, but only when faced with a le-or-death situation. It is not a sane strategy for normal times.What the old dunce cannot grasp is that such gargantuan bailouts will need to be paid back by years of tax rises and further austerity. If he wants credit for the spending, will he also accept responsibility for that future hardship No, we didn’t think so.Corbyn will be remembered as Labour’s worst-ever leader, the architect of their most abject defeat in  years. He drew anti-Semites like flies to dung. He repelled decent Labour MPs and voters.Only leftie cranks and Tories will miss him.IN six weeks as Chancellor, Rishi Sunak has saved an estimated .million jobs and bailed out Britain. Not a shabby start.No wonder his approval rating is off the chart.

That we’d all wake up and think: “Nah. My job’s not important at all. I’ve been wasting my le really, so I’ll stay in bed.”Everyone thinks their job is important, so everyone went to work, and this meant that in London especially, the public transport system was rammed full of commuters. This made everyone very angry.I don’t want to blame anyone for what’s going on. If you shut a country down overnight there are bound to be issues. It’s no one’s fault.I do, however, have a helpful suggestion for people who really do need to get to work. A suggestion that no one will have considered. It’s a means of transport that’s virus proof.You can’t be infected when you’re inside it and you can’t pass your infection on to anyone . It’s called the “motor car”.For years, successive leaders and politicians have done their best to squeeze it out of society.They’ve lowered the speed limits and raised the taxes and ­introduced congestion charging and even suggested, hilariously, thatyou ­absolutely must have one, it should have an electric motor. Like a milk float.Even the great libertarian Boris ­Johnson — a former motoring correspondent for GQ magazine — has been involved, handing half the road network over to wretched cyclists.Well, now’s the time to stop all that.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.During the Covid- outbreak, when it’s important we keep our distance, all ­parking restrictions should be lted.Cars should be allowed to use both bus and cycle lanes and all traffic cameras should be turned off. I know this flies in the face of what the eco-mentalists say is good for us but buses are petri dishes so park them at the depot.Trains and the Tube are no better, so turn off the power immediately. In the last three months of last year, million people in this country had jobs. And that’s handy because at the last count there were million cars registered for use on the road.This means that everyone can get to their place of work, safely, in a virus-proof cocoon. Strange isn’t it. For years we were told that cars would one day kill us all. But now it’s obvious that actually, they are our knights in shining armour.I only ask because the phone she was using looked like it was from about .Who was she calling  Dial-a-Disc WHILE scrolling through my phone the other day I was interested to read that I could increase my immunity to coronavirus by taking more vitamin C.Then I was told I would not catch itI stared for two hours every day at a picture of Charlize Theron.Later, I received news from someone whose neighbour’s aunt lives next door to a doctor’s cleaning lady that I should drink my own urine.But I was quickly distracted by someone  whose hairdresser had hacked the World Health Organisation and found that under no circumstances should I eat anything containing vitamin C. Or look at Ms Theron.And then I remembered something Important. Every single thing on the internet is b******s.But there’s one small problem.How do you reach anything on the shelves AS I write, the whole world is trying to work out why Germany is doing so much better with the coronavirus than everywhere .The bald figures are certainly intriguing. In Britain, . per cent of people who catch the disease go on to die. In Italy, it’s a terrying nine per cent. Whereas in Germany, it’s . percent.Experts have claimed that the epidemic started there in the Baian Alps, so the people it affected were young, fit skiing enthusiasts. Who barely noticed they had it.Others have pointed to the fact that Germany has many more beds for critically ill patients than Italy. And a HELL of a lot more than the UK.Then there’s testing. For months German medics have been testing the sort of numbers the rest of the world can only dream about. I wonder, however,anyone has considered this: The Germans do well . . .  because they are German.I was once told by a professor at Rome University that: “You can have as many laws as you like in Italy. Just so long as they are not enforced.”So, when the government there first told everyone to go home and stay there, they simply carried on riding around on their Vespas and kissing everyone.It’s the same story in Britain. We were told to stay at home but because the sun was out, we all hit the park for a picnic.The Germans are dferent. You tell Wolfgang that he must wash his hands every  minutes and he will wash his hands every  minutes. You tell him to go home and he will do so, immediately.It’s probably considered racist to talk about national characteristics these days. But in these troubled times I’m going to plough on regardless and say thatwe want to survive, we’ve got to be a bit more German. And for once, do as we are told.Which I’m told is an important ­ingredient in a building project.WE keep being told that the supermarkets will be able to keep up with our demand for food. But I seriously doubt that.I was told this week that the supplier providing my farm with veg seeds had closed. And because he had no delivery drivers, he was dumping his stock.I’ve now found a replacement and I will be getting them in the ground next week. But who will harvest them in three months, when the people who normally do this kind of thing are stuck in Latvia  Students  Fat chance.To make matters worse, a lot of peppers, tomatoes, cucumbers and courgettes you buy come from Spain.And who, right now, in this locked-down country, is planting them, and packing them and taking them to the docks or the airport  Still, there is some good news.Vegetarians will be forced to abandon their idiocy and start to eat meat. Lamb looks like a good bet. Because all the restaurants and pubs are shut, and exports are tricky, prices have more than halved in the past seven days.Bloody annoying for me as a sheep farmer.

The -year-old commander knows all too well what le is like on lockdown.He spent a year and a half living in a tiny tin can in close proximity to his crew.And he has some good tips for not going stir crazy.Obviously the space station astronauts had a lot of work and experiments to do, but that did not take up all of their time. And like the rest of us, they needed to keep busy.Scott has lots of common-sense advice for coping with being cooped up.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.First of all, we need to have a routine. We have to make sure we get up at the same time every morning and that we get washed and dressed and make our beds. We also need a regular bedtime.Scott says you have to get outside at least once a day — we can do that on earth — while also folowing the rules.You need to schedule times to talk to family and friends and have proper meal times.Exercise is vital. Our very own spaceman, Tim Peake, trained and completed a marathon on a running machine when he was part of the crew on the Space Station.Not all of us are fit enough to run -odd miles, but we can use this time to improve stamina and energy levels. I’m still doing my exercise classes with instructor Maxine Jones on her YouTube channel, and I will be starting virtual yoga with my daughter Rosie, who is in Singapore.I was surprised to learn Scott took actual books, not ebooks, into space.But he said holding a real book in his hands meant he could become completely absorbed, and concentration was not interrupted by messages pinging on his iPad.One of the most interesting things he said was to keep a journal of these strange times.It is more than just jotting down what you got up to that day. You need to go deeper and describe your hopes, fears and state of mind, and also what you hope to achieve when this is all over.One of the things Scott valued most during his long stint in space was video calls with family and friends. And he says one of the silver linings of this crisis is time to reconnect with loved ones.I know exactly what he means. I have been spending hours in WhatsApp chats with Rosie, my best friend Joyce, who is in lockdown in Spain, and my mum in East Kilbride.We chat about everythingand it lts my spirits. Scott’s other sensible advice is to get your information from the experts — and he advises against relying on the internet.He is right. Social media is stuffed with misinformed people and mad conspiracy ­theories.I was shocked to realise how some teens don’t watch any news outlets or read newspapers. They get their “news” from Facebook.They also think they are invincible, which is why we saw those packed beaches and parks this time last week.This was partly because they were unaware of the need for “social distancing” but also because they think it won’t happen to them.But Scott’s most important message to all of us is about working together.“All people are inescapably connected and the more we can come together to solve our problems, the better off we will be.“I’ve seen humans work together to prevail over the toughest challenges imaginable, and I know we can prevail over this one,we all do our part and work together as a team.”Well, I would urge you all to listen to Scott.If we can put a man on the moon then we can beat this awful virus. It won’t be easy but I have faith in science.And as long as we obey the rules, and make some sacrices, we WILL overcome.NO matter what you think of him, it would be churlish not to wish Boris Johnson a speedy recovery.But my sympathies are with Carrie Symonds, who is due to give birth in three months. She’s in isolation at a time when she needs his support.My thoughts are with all expectant parents now, bringing babies into a world we barely recognise and unable to be together in the delivery room. It will be bittersweet for all of them.ONE part of the world untouched by Covid- is my spiritual homeland of Antarctica.I visited the great white wilderness three years ago and cannot wait to .Aside from astronauts, the men and women who man the science bases in Antarctica – particularly the station at the South Pole – are well used to being in isolation while living on top of one another.Which is exactly what most of us are doing right now.Living space is limited at the Pole, and there’s no escaping the other  human beings holed up at the station for the full Antarctic winter.It’s virtually pitch black for six months and you can’t really go outside apart from short bursts of vital scientic work.Most are in danger of becoming “toasty”, which is their description of going stir-crazy.Being cramped, isolated and without proper personal boundaries and “me time” can make you cranky, short-tempered and irritated by the smallest things.In order for us all to avoid toastiness during these strange times, I’d recommend a few rules, some of which were given to me by a hardy survivor of winter at the extreme south.Have a sanctuary, evenit is just in the toilet reading your newspaper and doing the crossword.If you are feeling at the end of your tether, don’t bottle it up.Talk about your feelings and listen to what others in the house with you are saying.You might very well be annoying them as much as they are driving you up the wall.It’s early days, and this is a marathon and not a sprint.Unlike those at the Pole, at least we can still go outside and enjoy the sunshine and the heat as well as the light.I’VE got a Star Trek version of Monopoly and I’m wonderingit is too soon to bring it out from the back of the cupboard.I’ve never actually got to the end of a game of Monopoly and I reckon this might just be the only time that will ever happen.I’m also going to start watching Game Of Thrones for the first time, which should keep me going for a couple of weeks. Any other suggestions for box sets gratefully received.I’M sure all dog owners would agree that our fantastic, loyal, loveable pets are keeping us sane right now. I don’t know what I would doI couldn’t take Angus for a walk once a day.It’s not just a chance to get out in the fresh air and do some exercise, which is good for our physical and mental health, but it’s having something that takes your mind off the current state of the world.When I’m playing with Angus I can almost forget those feelings of anxiety that creep up on all of us and simply enjoy his energy and enthusiasm.He needs to be fed and watered and taken care of, and that gives me a much-needed sense of purpose.It’s a proven fact that just having a dog in the house to cuddle boosts your well-being and cuts stress levels.I don’t know what I would do without him.IT has never been more vital for all of us to receive clear-headed analysis and news we can trust.That’s why it’s so important you continue to buy your Sun every day.There’s a free delivery offer for those unable to get to the shops and of course there’s our splendid online version.We need to be well informed about the latest, fast-moving events and have all the facts to best protect ourselves and our families.Thank you for your loyalty and, as always, for your comments and feedback.

Then suddenly, since Monday, we are not.It’s not even been a week since the new normal for all of us is to stay put.I am guessing that for most of us, it feels like twice that. For many of us, being unable to roam freely is the stuff of nightmares.Still, although it’s been a hard week, I am feeling fortunate. Others I know are really struggling, but I’m very lucky to have a house, a job and the basics in my fridge. But my goodness, it’s boring staying at home all the time, isn’t it At the moment more or less every day is the same. I get up, do conference calls, watch the news and go to bed.But I have been trying to do a few things dferently. For fear of my muscles atrophyingI have started using an exercise video.That may sound normal to you but for me, this is staggering. It’s one from the s and is really quite funny and ­dficult at the same time.I’ve also been more studious than usual and have been doing online lectures for my master’s degree.I have put in the hours with a TV show called This Is Us.And I’ve been cooking up a storm — making increasingly inventive recipes with bits and bobs from the back of the store cupboard because the idea of getting a supermarket delivery slot feels like a fantasy so I have not even bothered to try. I cook whatever my corner shop has in stock, which sadly is not a lot.I know many supermarkets are prioritising elderly and vulnerable shoppers, which is right and proper. And I really hope that the people who are hoarding and stockpiling out of fear soon realise that they don’t need to do that.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.Friends who work in the food ­industry have repeatedly told me there is no issue with supply.Especiallypeople continue to go to their local shops, which should still be stocked — and which need their custom.I am nine days into my -day self-isolating as I am still waiting to see my dad, who is recovering from cancer.And, like many others, I’m focused on the importance of being absolutely certain I am ­infection-free before I even think of going to see him and my mum.So really, I’m just sitting it out. But gosh, it’s tedious.One of the biggest changes for me is not being able to go out or see my friends. But on Friday night we had a Skype party. We all got out a bottle of wine, and I even washed my hair before we had a laugh.We are also playing the game Psych — which is great fun and played on your mobile with your mates.It’s made me realise how many of the things I blithely took for granted as being my inalienable right have changed — literally overnight.And I don’t know whether it’s a good or bad thing that my kids aren’t home with me. I’m pretty sure my daughter has already had coronavirus but happily she seems fine now.But I obviously can’t see her other than on video phone as I am isolating. And boy, do I miss her.My son, meanwhile, is with his housemates in Buckingham. They seem fine — working out in their garden gym, making meals together and playing Xbox. In fact, it’s just another day for him.I know there are people reading this who are genuinely struggling and having a seriously hard time with being isolated, who are worried about loss of income, about elderly or vulnerable relatives, or who are stuck at home with ­dficult or even violent people.It is hard to reflect on anything when we are in the middle of it.We have to focus on getting through a day at a time knowing there will be plenty of time to learn lessons when this has passed.We’ll no doubt start from the basics, like being hyper-vigilant about which animals enter the food chain, scrupulous hand-washing and reassessing our attitude towards travel — something we’ve all taken for granted for so long.We will also focus on building the NHS back up. Just as we built nuclear deterrents to protect ourselves against war, we have to protect ourselves from the ious viruses that we now know are, increasingly, out there.Yes, the important thing is the here and now. We’ve seen unprecedented events this week alone, with the PM Boris Johnson,Health Secretary Matt Hancock and Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty all self-isolating after either testing positive or showing symptoms of the virus.But what is vital is the long-term strategy to fight another attack like this in the future.And in the meantime, apart from feeling a bit cooped up, all in all I am pretty much doing OK with self-isolating.Apart from one thing — I can’t find any hair dye to cover my grey hair, for love nor money. Now that really is a nightmare.ASbeing stuck at home wasn’t hard enough, sports fans are having to get through this time without any football.Now that’s what I call adding insult to injury.As fans will already know, all football has been postponed until April . But behind the scenes, all football clubs, including mine, are doing whatever it takes to ensure the season finishes.I think everyone understands that our priority has to be the safety and good health of our players and the fans. So, while matches are not being played, players are doing all they can to stay fit and well so they are ready whenever it’s time to resume games.Meanwhile, the stadiums, training grounds and offices are all shut.Then, after April , we hope matches can recommence, behind closed doorsrequired.In the meantime, it’s a waiting game. So here’s hoping you’ve got some old Match Of The Day shows lined up to while away your time.ONE thing about us all having to stay at home is that it’s giving celebrities nowhere to hide in terms of what they have got to offer the world.They are on their own at home, with nothing much to do, just like us.Some – Joe Wicks teaching PE to the nation’s primary school kids every morning, Carol Vorderman holding online maths classes or Richard E Grant reading from the script of Withnail And I – are trying hard to provide the nation with useful entertainment.And then there are others. Instagram is also peppered with images of reality TV and soap stars in extremely scanty underwear.Without the props of stylists, red carpets and paparazzi shots, we see them for what they really are.Human beings, just like us.AS a week of firsts comes to a close, athletes and sports fans alike were further disappointed by the announcement that the Olympics have been postponed.Something that only a few weeks ago would have seemed unimaginable now feels, clearly, like the only sensible thing to do.Apart from the logistics involved with quarantine and uncertainty about travel restrictions, some athletes cannot train while some can, which, when the integrity of the sport is at stake, is fundamentally unfair.ANYONE  bored  With This Is Us my current favourite thing to watch, I’ve compiled a list of some other fab shows, just in case you’ve finished Succession and need some inspiration.Here goes – The Crown, Ozark, Luther, Line Of Duty, Sense, Grace And Frankie, Schitt’s Creek, Sex Education, Messiah, Spinning Out, Unbelievable and Mum.I WAS so moved by the nation overriding the old stf upper lip mentality to stand on their doorsteps to give NHS workers a round of applause on Thursday night.And then I read a tweet from a nurse saying that literally as the nation were clapping, she had received an email from her employers advising her not to travel to work in unorm or display her work ID.This is because some people have been mugged for these items and the very scant privilege – like an early supermarket slot – that they bring.Come on, people – sort it out. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But I went above and beyond with the coronavirus, not just washing my hands  or  times a day until they were red raw but boiling my gloves as well.I took them off first, obviously, and even photographed the act, as I was aware this behaviour was a little “out there”.But, like the committed hypochondriac I am, I figured the ridicule was worth enduring so long as it provided one further line of defence against the invisible enemy which has us all surrounded.The glove thing seemed to be working as well, right up until the time it wasn’t. And, on Sunday, March , I very suddenly became one of those symptom lists you read about.Head in a “vice-like grip”  Check. Whole body feeling like it’s been in a car crash  Yes, and the bag didn’t inflate. Feverish  Oh boy, yes.  Chills  They’re multiplying.There was the cough as well. A textbook dry, intermittent hack that’s had its moments but never really amounted to much and has left me in a grey area, medically speaking.Testing has been out of the question, so to this day I still don’t knowI’ve had coronavirus or just something  horrible. The advice from Jake at  was unequivocal, though — “self-isolation” — and the response from everyone  was almost exactly the same.“Ha ha. Not much dferent for you then.”Ha ha. Indeed not.They mean no harm, bless them. It’s the classic British response to bad medical news. They’re reassuring themselves, as you need to do with this thing.If you think I’ve spent the past fortnight sat monitoring EastEnders for minor continuity errors, though, you haven’t had coronavirus, or anything like it.The thing does not lend itself to watching television as easily as you might think. Especially not during its first week when I was sleeping for anything up to  hours a day.The time you are awake you’re in a lot of discomfort and unwilling to be reminded of your condition, which is what television is now doing incessantly, while trying to take moral ownership of the illness as well.With endless spare time on my hands, I didn’t give up on the medium, though. I thought, in fact, it might be a good opportunity to watch some of those films I’d never got round to watching, like Get Carter, Lost In Translation and The Big Lebowski. It wasn’t.I hated all three of them, especially The Big Lebowski— not because they were without merit but because I had no appetite, zero energy and was unable to stand upright without losing my breath, while watching them.I shall now associate all three movies with misery, pain and paracetamol, for ever. About the same time I gave up on films, Sky’s Football HD channel played an even crueller trick on me, on Monday.Start to finish, it re-ran Scotland’s abortive Euro  campaign. The full chronological nightmare, starting with the - defeat in Kazakhstan, which I’d witnessed first-hand.A bullet to be dodged, surely  Reader, I watched the lot and, must confess, I found it strangely cathartic and quite funny, as well as sad.Because it reminded me of a time when there was a le that stretched so far beyond the walls of my own little home isolation unit.It provided a salutary lesson as well. Television is a fickle, uncaring beast and, with some honourable exceptions, like The Repair Shop, pretty useless at cheering you up in times of personal distress.People, on the other hand, are amazing and came up trumps during my illness.I’ve been particularly blessed with my amazing and generous East London neighbours, Fatima, Richard and David, who became aware, early on, what was happeningand reacted accordingly.Every day the buzzer would go, I’d hear footsteps beating a fairly quick retreat and by the time I’d shuffled my way to the front door, dinner would be sitting by my feet. They phoned regularly as well, to check on me.Until, on Day , after a couple of  dawns , the fever had lted, I’d had my last night-sweat, could think straight again and even a hint of an appetite ed.If this is being done for one miserable, solitary, middle-aged git who boils his gloves, I have not the slightest doubt that even more noble things are being done for all those in far greater need, and humanity will triumph over this illness, with something to spare.In the meantime, my isolation continues for now and —it so pleases the British comedy gods — no, it’s really not much dferent for me.To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Quite right too.And boy, are they going to need it once they’re in the full glare of the LA-based paparazzi, who operate under far fewer legal restrictions than those based in the UK.One was caught trespassing at the school of a celebrity’s child, another scaled a wall at Jenner Aniston’s to try to get a shot of her, other stars have had their cars blocked by paps, singer Niall Horan was dragged to the floor by one at LAX airport and they’ve been known to sit outside doctor’s surgeries to snap someone famous coming out.So good luck with all that, Harry and Meghan.You’re about to realise how protected you were in the UK, both by the stricter laws and the ring of steel that shields the Royal Family.Little wonder that the rumoured bill for their personal security is estimated at around £million a year.Add in the cost of other staff, general living expenses and the £.million they said they would repay for the refurbishment of Frogmore “cottage” — now sitting empty — and it’s clear they are spending money like water with no discernible means of actually earning much to make up any shortfall.Which, once the Covid- crisis has passed, means they will be vulnerable to the attention of the super-rich.And we all know how that worked out for Prince Andrew.But perhaps the greatest concern for the Duke and Duchess of Sussexis that, thanks to the coronavirus pandemic, the world’s attention is erted where and the news of their move to LA was greeted with a collective, “so what ”A mass disinterest which, when you’re “former royals for sale”, is very worrying indeed.FORMER Love Island star Maura Higgins has revealed she could get any boy she wanted at school.“I’ve always been very, very confident,” she says.Following her recent appearance on Dancing On Ice, reports that she’d split from boyfriend Curtis Pritchard were followed by rumours that she’d got a little too close to her married skating partner Alex Demetriou.But Maura claims they are “just friends”, adding: “Alex and I are so close – we’ve trained together for months . . . but that’s it.”I’m sure his we, fellow skater Carlotta Edwards, will now feel deeply reassured.Yes, it’s come to this.

Results can take between a few hours to a couple of days to come back.The second test is the much-awaited antibody test - hailed a game-changer.The test is a finger-prick test and is being designed to be performed at home, giving results almost instantly like a pregnancy test.It detects antibodies that the immune system produces to fight coronavirus so can tellyou have had the bug, and are immune.These tests would give the green light for NHS staff, key workers and the public to go back to work, and could help relax lockdown measures.Testing for coronavirus serves a number of important purposes.The swab test can tell us how many people currently have Covid-.Meanwhile, the antibody test can tell us how many people in the population have had it.It can also give an idea of the asymptomatic population - how many people have had coronavirus, but have shown no symptoms.Knowing whos had the bug and who hasnt will drastically speed up our route out of lockdown.It will allow us to identy who is safe to go back to work, and in some countries like Germany there are plans to give people certicates to identy they are safe to move about.Labour deputy leadership candidate and AE doctor, Rosena Allin-Khan, who has gone back to work on the NHS front line, said another important aspect is staff wellbeing.She wrote to Matt Hancock telling him the lack of testing is having a huge mental health impact on our NHS workforce.Meanwhile, ex-health secretary Jeremy Hunt has expressed his concern over the lack of mass testing, branding it very worrying.He said it had been key to finally controlling the outbreak in Wuhan, the Chinese city where the pandemic originated in December.Yesterday, Department of Health figures showed , people had been tested for coronavirus, in the previous  hours.That falls short of the Governments promise to test  , people a day.Last night, Deputy Chief Medical Officer Jenny Harries said we have capacity to test , people.Meanwhile, the PM has expressed his desire to reach , tests a day.Today, Health Secretary Matt Hancock told hospitals to test more of their workforce, lting the restriction that trusts could only use  per cent of their capacity to test staff. The remaining  per cent was reserved for testing patients.In the UK around , people are being tested every day.In total since the start of the outbreak , people have been tested, with , testing positive.Meanwhile, in Germany, , tests are carried out each day - thats more than half a million a week.In total, South Korea has tested around , people since the start of the outbreak.Both countries have far fewer deaths than the UK.Testing for viruses is not a simple process.It requires the right equipment, testing conditions and as the Governments top doctor keeps reminding us, one thing worse that no test, is a bad test.But critics have pointed out, this crisis has been building since the start of the year, accusing the authorities of acting too late.Tim Colbourn, associate professor of global health epidemiology at University College London, said: The UK was complacent and didnt think it could happen here.We didnt see the signs quickly.Anthony Costello, professor of global health and sustainable development at UCL, said part of the blame rests with Public Health England.He told Radio s Today programme: We have  molecular virology labs in the UK.If they were doing  tests a day, we would be up to Germany levels of testing and that is perfectly feasible.Public Health England were slow and controlled and only allowed non-PHE labs to start testing two weeks ago, but that was after the strategy to sht to end community tests.Prof Costello is referring to the announcement on March  to stop testing people in the community, as the Government announced a move from containment to delay in their plan to tackle the outbreak.From that point, only people in hospital have been tested for Covid-.The Government has repeatedly said their goal is to increase testing capacity across the UK.Boris Johnson has said he wants to reach , a day, while Deputy Chief Medical Officer Jenny Harries said at yesterdays daily briefing we have capacity to carry out , tests.Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office Minister, said the Prime Minister and Health Secretary Matt Hancock, are in talks with pharmaceutical companies across the world, after admitting a shortage of chemicals is partly to blame.The chemicals are needed for the antigen tests - or nasal swab tests currently being used to test NHS staff and patients.Mr Gove said last night that the Government must go further, faster to increase testing.We are increasing the number of tests, he said.One of the constraints on our capacity to increase testing overall is supply of the specic reagents, the specic chemicals, that are needed in order to make sure that tests are reliable.When asked when the Government started placing orders for key test parts, the PMs spokesman said today: Weve been working with industry throughout.But as the Chief Medical Officer and Deputy Chief Medical Officer have both set out, there is a global demand for reagents.Its clear from industry that they are working as hard as they can in order to support the NHS, and we are working alongside them.The chemical reagents the Government admits the UK is short of are needed for the nasal swab tests - the antigen test.Dr Colin Butter, at the University of Lincoln, explained there are two main bits to the chemistry.Many companies make suitable kits for this, he said. Universities and others will have lots on the shelves.The next step involves ingredients and chemicals to run the test itself.Prof Lawrence Young from the University of Warwick explained:  The test is complicated, and requires many dferent synthetic components which probably accounts for the shortages given the unprecedented demand.In recent days, theres been a lot of talk about the two dferent types of tests that the government are ramping up.The government refers to them as the have you got it antigen test or the have you had it antibody test.Here we explain the dference between the two...What is an antigen test Antigens are found on the surface of invading pathogens, including coronavirus.Testing for antigens can determine whether someone is currently carrying the virus and are actively infectious.The NHS is currently using antigen tests in hospitals to determinesomeone is currently infected with Covid-.Samples are taken using a swab - which resemble a large cotton bud - from deep inside the nose and throat before being sent off to a lab for testing.Most labs use a method called the polymerase chain reaction , which takes several hours to get a result.It can take days for labs to run the tests and tell people their result.Several companies are working on ways to fast track this type of testing.What is an antibody test When a person gets infected with antigen, the body starts making specially designed proteins called antibodies in response - as a way to fight the infection.After they recover, those antibodies float in the blood for months, maybe even years.Thats the bodys way of defending itself in case it becomes infected with the virus again.So an antibody test specically looks for antibodies which will be able to tell whether youve already been exposed to Covid-.Anyone who has already had the illness is presumed to be immune to getting it again - at least, in the intermediate term.This would allow them to go back to work safe in the knowledge that they are unlikely to become infected again or pass the virus on.The check that has been developed for Covid- is a finger-prick blood test, with the samples sent to laboratories and results available within a few days.Dr Hilary Jones, a GP and resident doctor on Good Morning Britain, explained that it works almost like a pregnancy test, except you need a drop of blood.These tests are being developed by several dferent firms and Public Health Englandis also working on its own test.They still need to be validated to ensure they give accurate results.Dr Al Edwards at the University of Readings School of Pharmacy added that there are a lot of ingredients that go into a swab test.Any of these might be hard to get hold of in the current rush, he said. The world is seeing more of these virus tests conducted than ever before.But they could also be simply the swabs or containers for collecting samples.“The real catch is – we are very good at making a highly accurate test fast.But to make that test accurate, you need to keep the ingredients fixed. So we are likely seeing a shortage of the exact ingredients used in the approved tests.Although other versions might work it’s not easy to simply switch to a dferent type.There can be tiny changes that make the test fail – for example,you use the wrong swab to take the sample, the virus might not be detected.Professor Stephen Baker, an expert in molecular microbiology at the University of Cambridge, said: There is a massive demand for raw materials, this is not unique to the UK and many places no longer have stock of essential reagents.The Chemical Industries Association told The Times that demand for key chemicals is increasing.But it said reagents are being made and they are being delivered to the NHS.It said: Every business here in the UK and globally is looking at what they can do to help meet the demand as a matter of urgency.To clary the exact NHS  need and meet it, all relevant UK industries are continuing to work closely with the Government.The first hint of the coronavirus pandemic emerged at the end of December in China.While few countries could have predicted its rapid spread, some, including South Korea were better prepared.The nation had vast stocks of face masks and testing kids on standby, making them better placed to cope.Having endured the  Sars epidemic and the more recent Mers outbreak, South Korea built up huge stockpiles and had signicant testing capacity ready and waiting.Germany, which is testing , patients a week and has plans to test , a day, was quick to learn from the response of countries in Asia and began ramping up testing at an early stage.Professor Lawrence Young, from Warwick University, said countries like Germany also benefit from a more joined up approach.A better relationship with the biotech industry, more German virologists producing tests in January and central coordination by the Robert Koch Institute all gave Germany a head start, he said.When asked why this was such a challenge for the UK, he added: It just requires better national coordination.It highlights a lack of investment in virology over many years.Professor Stephen Baker, of Cambridge Uni, said there is no overnight solution.He warned: There are multiple steps to ensure that the methods used and results that are a correctly validated, as there is nothing more dangerous at the moment than reporting incorrect negative or positive results to staff or patients.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And that’s why we have been asking people to stay at home during this pandemic.From this evening I must give the British people a very simple instruction - you must stay at home.If you don’t follow the rules the police will have the powers to enforce them, including through fines and dispersing gatherings.Since then, Dr Harries told us that we could be living like this for around six months.No. This is the first time the UK and Europe has had to deal with a pandemic on this scale since the outbreak of Spanish Flu in  that killed around  million people and infected  per cent of the world population.Weve had a few close calls with things like swine flu in -, but it was nowhere near as bad as this.However, the reason we are in lockdown now is that we have a better understanding of how the pathogens work and what we need to do to stop them.We know that coronavirus is transmitted by touch and by droplets in other peoples breath, unlike  years ago where they only had a basic idea of flu and no concrete idea about viruses until they were discovered in .By contrast it took modern scientists days to decrypt the RNA, which is just incredible work that will have saved millions of lives already.Over the last four months over  clinical studies have been completed globally, scientic communities have managed years worth of work in weeks, and as bad as it looks, we have never been better equipped to fight this pandemic.All the rest of us have to do is stay indoors.So far we dont know because coronavirus has only been around since December  and it took some time to realise what was going on because symptoms often present like seasonal flu.China, where the virus originated, is starting to ease its lockdown measures after going into full lockdown January  .China experienced a hard lockdown, particularly in the Hubei Province.The  million-strong city of Wuhan was completely barricaded, with people literally being welded into their homes.Italy went into lockdown March , and Spain shut down on March , around the time that most countries started closing their borders and implementing the same measures.Lockdown has been severe in all hard-hit areas with deserted streets the norm for over a month now.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But the scheme does not apply to people who started a new job after the cut-off date of February . Instead, the only way for them to be furloughed is to be rehired to their previous job and then be put on the scheme. Whether this happens is up to the old employer. This stops well short of demands by thousands of workers who said the date of February  must be extended. The Mirror understands the government is resisting calls to extend the scheme beyond February  because of practical dficulties. To prevent fraud, officials decided to capture peopleaposs earnings in February - the most recent full month - to work out how much they are owed through the scheme. Senior officials are understood to be aware of the loophole, but believe there had to be a cut-off date for the Treasury to snapshot peopleaposs earnings. Officials appear to accept that any cut-off date would have imperfections, but not every business or inidual job in the country can be saved. A Treasury spokesman said: Obviously it’s important to have proof that iniduals are connected to the firms that are furloughing them. Tony MacDonald, , from Dundee, said the decision was so disappointing.  Tony missed the scheme by three days after leaving his job of three years to start a new role as a fire safety engineer. He and we Logan, , have been left high and dry unable to support children Alfie, , and Aoe, , on her midweaposs salary alone.

This would allow those in badly overcrowded accommodation to have somewhere suitable when they’re ill or have to self-isolate. The measures could also be used to help those who are homeless. Mr Healey told the Mirror: “A secure and stable home for everyone has never been more important. People can’t effectively self-isolate and get betterthey are homeless or in badly overcrowded housing. “These emergency measures would give councils the powers to ensure that people in their area has a settled home throughout this crisis period and help control the spread of the virus. “Ministers should urgently update the rules to allow councils to bring empty properties into use, to help the country fight the coronavirus crisis.” Labour analysis of the Government’s English Housing Survey has identied , vulnerable people living in overcrowded housing, making it dficult to self-isolatethey or a member of their household gets ill.

Meanwhile, more than , properties lie empty – classed by the Government as long-term vacant. An overhaul of Empty Dwelling Management Orders would cut the period of time a property has to be empty before councils could temporarily take it over from two years to six months, and the notice for property owners cut from three months to two weeks.

Megan-Leigh wrote a post on Facebook to parents to explain what she was offering and itaposs now been shared more than , times, with more than  FaceTime calls booked in. She explained: With everything going on in the world right now, I’ve decided to dust off my tiara and do what I love most. Being a princess and making children smile. Tonight I see a mumaposs plea for a princess to FaceTime her daughter on her birthday. This little girl has had to cancel her birthday party twice because of the recent Covid- virus. I feel so sorry for the little girl but I’m extremely happy I’m able to brighten her birthday on Sunday. It got me thinking about all the other little children missing out on their birthday parties or even children feeling a little low and needing their spirits lted. So, If anyone is in need of a Princess FaceTime please message me as I would love to help as much as I can over the next few weeks months. All I ask for inis a small donation. Megan had previously worked as a Disney princess, where she would entertain children at birthday parties, but she was forced to give up her dream job due to ill health - and instead went to work in the beauty industry.She said: Everyone that knows me knows the last  months have been very hard for me due to ill health. I thought I’d be able to get back to work and a normal pain free le once I had surgery, but it has had to be postponed until things improve in the world. But I’m now able to do something I love from the comfort of my own home without causing too much strain and pain on myself. As running around after  children wasn’t doable, Megan said the fact she can offer this service and still make children happy while safely staying at home is amazing. She added: I’ve found it really tough being unable to work and have had to make a lot of le changing choices along the way. So I’m really excited to be able to run Princess FaceTime from the comfort of my own home.Megan started FaceTime calling and surprising children at the weekend after her post first went viral last Friday. She said one little girl was so impressed by her chat with Cinderella that she sent over a handwritten letter for Megan to respond to. The real-le princess said: Most of the children are talking about having to stay at home so I tell them I also have to stay at home in my castle to keep safe. I called a four-year-old little boy dressed as Elsa from Frozen and now he is going around telling his friends I’m his girlfriend while another little girl told me I am her best friend and she has invited me over for a tea party when the nasty virus has gone. Megan also spoke to a Disney fan who has been poorly with chicken pox and described her as so brave, sweet and loving every minute of her chat with Cinderella. Speaking about how happy her service is making children, Megan said: Their reactions have been amazing. They’ve all been so happy and the smiles on their faces really makes it so rewarding. One little girl showed me all her Lego creations and another askedI have to clean all my castle by myself. I’m really looking forward to the rest of the FaceTimes I’ve got booked in.Glad she is able to put her ‘rewarding’ job back to good use again, Megan said it felt great to put the wigs and costumes back on to do something positive during the coronavirus outbreak.She said: I’m overwhelmed with the reaction it has had. I wasn’t expecting it to spread as well as it has. It’s made me so happy and given me something to focus on during this awful time! I’m glad I can play a tiny part in spreading some happiness around.‘I only thought I’d have a few messages and be able to brighten up a few kidsapos days but, it’s gone crazy. I’m glad a small gesture like this can bring a lot of happiness. In just  hours, Megan had more than  messages about her offer to dress up as Ariel from Little Mermaid, Elsa from Frozen, Cinderella and more - scheduling  video calls over the next few weeks. She added: This will hopefully cheer up so many children. It’ll give them something magical to remember during this crisis. They’ll be able to tell all their family and friends about it and it will hopefully lt their spirits. Megan’s social media page now includes several excited reactions from little girls who were shocked and delighted to chat to their favourite princess.

To make sure you don’t, only pass on information you can very with a trustworthy source, like a reputable newspaper or the NHS coronavirus website.

Roughly  mourners showed up to pay their respects to community elder -year-old Alfred Loveridge.While the gathering looked substantially smaller than a traditional traveller funeral, government guidance states that only immediate family should attend, with some councils placing even tighter limits on the number of mourners. Police have been heavily criticised for being heavy-handed with emergency coronavirus powers which include using a drone to film people going for a walk. Some councils have limited the number of funeral mourners to  and members of the public are urged to stay at least two metres apart from people who are not in their household. There is also a restriction on church services such as funerals, weddings and christenings. Alfieaposs coffin was driven in a hearse from his home to a nearby cemetery in Upwell, Norfolk with six family members following on foot. They were followed on the funeral route by other mourners in up to eight cars, reports The Sun. A group gathered in a ft by ft marquee beside the grave for Alfred - who did not die from coronavirus. Before the lockdown was put in place Alfieaposs son, Alfie Jr, had invited people to follow the cortege from his dadaposs home. But some locals have defended the service and instead blamed aposlooseapos Government guidance on allowing aposimmediate familyapos at funerals. One reportedly said: “The travelling community around here often have large and extended families who are very close. “The guidance about funerals under the new coronavirus conditions is very vague because how can you say who is immediate family  It all depends on how big your family is. They added: “His family brought forward the ceremony by a week and kept it as small as possible. A spokesman for Upwell Parish Council, which runs the cemetery, told : “The funeral director asked to hold the service outdoors as, for the moment, there is a restriction on what can happen in churches. “I gave permission for that as I felt it was safer than being inside. “All the council did was sell them the plot.” Government health watchdog Public Health England warned that mourners need to stay ftapart at funerals. Meanwhile Donald Trump said the UKaposs early approach to tackling the coronavirus outbreak would have been very catastrophicBoris Johnson had not decided to change tack.

The letter, published today, was written on behalf of the industry by Tracy De Groose, executive chair of Newsworks. It asks advertisers to remove blocklists from trusted UK news brands to ensure they can continue to fund quality British journalism at a time of national crisis.   Here is the letter in full: Dear Advertiser, These are challenging times for all of our businesses no matter the size, sector or region we operate in. However, working together we can help reduce the devastating impact of this virus. We are open and ready to support you, so please let us know how we can best do that for your people, your customers and your business. Across our own industry, our journalists are working harder than ever to ask the right questions and to deliver accurate information in the most helpful and accessible ways possible for their readers.

Mexican officials have pushed back against the suggestion that they picked up the virus at the tourist spot, as the reports drew attention to possible low detection of cases in the country. About a week-and-a-half ago, approximately  people in their s departed in a chartered plane for a spring break trip, the city said, adding that some of the group ed on separate commercial flights. Currently,  young adults on this trip have tested positive for COVID- and dozens more are under public health investigation, the statement said.Follow the latest coronavirus updates in our live blogHowever, the Los Cabos Trust, which runs tourism sites including the resort where the vacationers stayed, said the group departed on March , implying they did not come in contact with the coronavirus until later.

Critics of the governmentaposs strategy say a relatively low number of tests carried out mean more cases could be undetected. Baja Calornia Sur had  cases of coronavirus as of Tuesday, Mexican health ministry data shows.  Austin public health authorities and the University of Texas at Austin have contacted every spring breaker onboard the plane using flight manests from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the cityaposs statement said. Many of the people are students at the University of Texas at Austin, the school said in a statement obtained by local television station KVUE ABC. The university did not immediately reply to a Reuters request for comment. At the time of the trip, Mexico was not under a US federal travel advisory, but had advised against non-essential travel. A leisure vacation of any kind is not considered essential, the city said. The government of President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has been reluctant to implement coronavirus restrictions that could adversely affect the economy and jobs, and only in recent days stepped up the message that people should stay at home.

The -year-old is said to have moved his entire harem of concubines into the high end Grand Hotel Sonnenbichl in Baia after he was given permission by authorities. Baia is under lockdown, like the rest of Germany, and the hotel should be closed down along with all the others but it was apparently been given special permission to remain open for the king and his bizarre court. It is not knownthe kingaposs FOUR wives are among the group. King Vajiralongkorn has long been a controversial figure in Thailand, where it is banned from criticising the royal family, or even their pets. Despite the threat of  years in prison, he is criticised in his home country, albeit in private. As the oldest monarch to ascend to Thailandaposs throne, King Vajiralongkorn, has been married four times and has a colourful private le. Said to be worth £billion the royal has hit the headlines for all the wrong reasons, from his marriages, to his mistresses and even a leaked video of the queen naked apart from a G-string. Back in November  a home video of the royal and his third we, Srirasmi Suwadee, was leaked. The queen was wearing nothing but a G-string while servants waited on her hand of foot at the celebration of his pet poodleaposs birthday.That same year Harry Nicolaides, am Australian, was jailed for three years after he published a book which contained the sentencethe prince fell in love with one of his minor wives and she betrayed him, she and her family would disappear with their name, familial lineage and all vestiges of their existence expunged forever. Nicolaides was later pardoned by the king and he said his book had been entirely fiction from cover to cover.Two years later, one of Vajiralongkornaposs royal planes was seized by German authorities as payment for a £million debt owed to a German firm, which was in danger of becoming bankrupt. Vajiralongkorn finally agreed to pay £million, which was then covered by the Thai government. He married his first we, Princess Soamsawali Kitiyakara, in  and the couple welcomed their daughter, Princess Najrakitiyabha. However, during his first marriage, Vajiralongkorn embarked on an affair with actress Yuvadhida Polpraserth, with whom he had five children. Despite repeated requests, Princess Soamsawali refused to orce her husband until he finally got his wish in , claiming the fault of the marriageaposs failure lay squarely at his weaposs door. Even so, his first we and their daughter continue to play a major part in royal events. Vajiralongkorn, still a prince, then married the woman he had been having an affair with for more than  years - but their wedding was not blessed by the queen. Just two years after their marriage Yuvadhida moved to Britain with all of the coupleaposs children - the prince did not react well. He put posters up all around the palace, accusing his we of adultery and eventually abducted his daughter and brought her back to Thailand to live with him. She was later elevated to the rank of princess, but his we and their sons were stripped of their royal titles and they all now live in the US. His third we was Srirasmi Suwadee, who had worked for the prince since . The marriage was kept from the public for four years, finally been disclosed in . Srirasmi gave birth to the coupleaposs son, Prince Dipangkorn Rasmijoti, in the same year and was made a princess by her husband, who vowed his wild days were behind him. But nine years later Vajiralongkorn demanded his weaposs family be stripped of their royal titles amid allegations of corruption among her relatives. His we relinquished her royal titles soon afterwards and agreed to a orce after  years of marriage after being awarded a £.million settlement. Just three days before he was crowned king, Vajiralongkorn married his fourth we, Suthida Tidjai, who was a former acting commander of Royal Thai Aide-de-Camp Department. However, despite once again being a married man Vajiralongkorn was still not faithful and just months after his wedding he gave his concubine Sineenat Wongvajirapakdi the title of Chao Khun Phra, which means royal noble consort. The -year-old had become the first royal consort in Thailand for almost a century in almost  years and meant she was an official companion to the king but not the queen.

Looking back, that only makes the win all the more remarkable.For United, it was a far grander venue and harks back to the good old daysof regularly competing for big trophies.The  League Cup semi-final win over Aberdeen was my first experience of covering a big club game at Hampden. It was a great day with a huge Tangerine following rewarded with an amazing comeback victory thanks to Callum Morris and Nadir Ctci headers.Everyone has their own favourites and this stoppage is a great time to reminisce – hopefully, we won’t have to do that for too long.Uefa are due to meet via video conference today to thrash out some sort of plan for sorting how the current season ends.I’m glad to hear that’s because it’s pretty much certain their initial hopes to get club football completed by the end of June won’t be coming to fruition.August seems to be the consensus and it sounds fair enough.What I expect to come out of this virtual get-together is some sort of rational plan to sort out player contracts and technical issues like that.That’s what Uefa is there for. What I don’t expect them to do is grant the SPFL’s wishes by making tough decisions on how to end this season.I can’t help but think Neil Doncasterand SFA chief Ian Maxwellare desperate for Uefa to make a sweeping decision so they can avoid any sort of responsibility when people moan.My gut feeling is the European chiefs will have a plan to get the campaign finished in the autumn and roll straight into the new one. I would dearly love our set-up to be restructured to bigger leagues, however.After watching the  Scottish Cup Final on Sunday it made me think ‘where have all the cup finals gone’ It’s been five long years since Dundee United were last in a major cup final and  for Dundee. The end of my first season at the Tele saw the Tangerines in the Scottish Cup Final and then the League Cup showpiece a year later.It just shows how quickly things can fall apart – thankfully, both seem to be putting the pieces back together.To keep me amused I’ve been watching the Leeds United documentary on Amazon.

However, former Hearts and Falkirk man McGhee hopes it’s with Dundee having success.“We want to pick up where we left off because before the shutdown we started to hit a bit of form,” the -year-old said.“We knew that what would happen it was just about getting the right balance in the team.“I think we’ve got that now so we’re just raring to go again and finish the season as strongly as possible.”McGhee insists the squad are working together remotely to stay motivated and fit for a potentialto action.“I think some people will struggle but you don’t have an option right now other than to motivate yourself,” he added.“The way the world is at the moment you’ve either got the option to sit and watch TV, lying about doing nothing or you go out and exercise yourself.“Everyone in our changing-room will be going out to stay fit. I know the boys well enough to know everyone in the team is motivated to be successful.“Running and making sure they’re ready to go when football resumes is a big part of that.“We’ve got a few WhatsApp groups – one with the coaches and one with the players.“The coaching staff keep on top of us with our fitness stuff but everything is up in the air at the moment.“No one knows what’s happening so really it’s just a guessing game at the moment for us.“The manager’s been good, though, in keeping us going. We’ve been given tasks like a weekly challenge on a Friday.“Last week it was to do a k under  minutes on top of our programmes which have been tailored and specically set out.“With regards to the manager I think he trusts us all to go away and do it ourselves butwe don’t we know we’ll be found out when we go back.“It’s dficult because, normally, you’re building up towards a weekend where you’ve got a game coming up.“We’ve not got that now so it’s dficult to stay prepared for what may or may not happen physically and mentally.“The fact you’re not with the boys as well makes training dficult. The mental aspect is hard for everyone at the minute, in all walks of le.“We just need to get on with it and see what the outcome is then take it from there.”On top of everything , McGhee is working his way back from surgery on an ongoing wrist problem he’d carried for most of the season.His progress, however, has been good as he attempts to step up his rehab in the coming weeks.“I was in Dundee two weeks ago to get my cast off but ever since then I’ve been at home in East Kilbride,# he said.“I’ve just been staying in the house apart from my training programme. I’ve been out running and I managed to get myself a set of weights – that’s all I can really do right now.“Having broken a bone in my wrist it’s been dficult. Obviously, because I can’t get in to seeGerryto do movements on it.“He’s sending me stuff out, though, now I’ve had my cast off for a bit.“I’ll crack on with that and, hopefully, by the time football comes round again it should be strengthened and ready to go.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/457450ae-41b1-4b1c-9d21-76bcbf1fbd95-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/457450ae-41b1-4b1c-9d21-76bcbf1fbd95-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/457450ae-41b1-4b1c-9d21-76bcbf1fbd95-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/457450ae-41b1-4b1c-9d21-76bcbf1fbd95-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"lee wilkie neil doncaster ian maxwell","story":"It’s been a long week of rumour and speculation since the last update we had from the SFA and the SPFL.What that radio silence hammers home most to me is a lack of leadership and decisiveness.Don’t get me wrong, I have sympathy for Ian Maxwell, Neil Doncaster  Co.This is a very complicated situation where you are unlikely to please everyone because so many doors could open up in dferent directions for clubs in terms of the current season and ongoing league structure.It melts your mind a bit when you start thinking about all the possibilities and how it could affect people but there needs to be a decision made soon.Uefa won’t do it for them, nor will Fa or English football, they need to grab the bull by the horns and show a bit of leadership.The resolution for all of this starts with them so it’s important they’re clear with their message.There’s no way they could possibly keep everybody happy but they must do something decisively and quite quickly to protect clubs and their incomes.I think most football people, myself included, would like to see the season played to a finish – eventhat is behind closed-doors.However, it’s beginning to look like we won’t see that happening at all given the current health guidelines from the UK and Scottish Governments pointing towards a longer lockdown being put in place across the country.August has been touted as the date for ato domestic football and, like I have said before, although it will be a long four months, it could be a good opportunity to restructure our gamedone correctly.It’s definitely an option and, depending on how it looks, I might even prefer that to closed-doors games.Reshuffling the leagues and increasing the number of teams will be refreshing and I think most fans would back that.Most of the clubs would be fairly happy, too, with no relegations across all four isions and promotion for the top two sides in the lower leagues.There may be some disputes about the tighter leagues and promotion play-offs but you’d like to think most would understand the extraordinary nature of the situation.Dundee would probably have been able to push Inverness right to the end and might feel a bit hard done by but it’s a really dficult one.I don’t envy the high heidyins but they’re paid to make these calls.The biggest thing that needs to be cleared up as soon as possible, for me, is the financial aspect of the shutdown.Clubs have been left in limbo by the powers that be for too long already.Many don’t have any income at all while there are still so many question marks about how they will access adequate monies from the SPFL and the SFA.It’s really important they decide what’s happening as soon as they can because clubs need to move on and plan for, what looks like, months ahead without any football.There’s so much work to do, it’s a bit of a head spinner.At this stage we’re not even taking into account the transfer window where, Dundee United in particular may be able to raise cash.I’m sure there will already have been plenty of enquiries about Lawrence Shankland.It’s probably a huge worry for a club like United. Of course, all clubs have dferent worries financially because they’re all in dferent situations.The least they deserve is clarity.Even in the summer it doesn’t take long for players to be itching to get back to football.The current situation with the coronavirus shutdown is a dferent kettle of fish entirely, though, and poses heightened mental health risks.For that reason, I was delighted to hear Tony Asghar say Dundee United are using a sport psychologist to help players stay positive.Clubs are far more equipped to deal with these things than when I started  years ago.My son Jack and I have been out on our bikes to try to break the boredom of lockdown this week.He’s been doing a lot of running as part of his training programme from Dundee but somehow I think I’ll stick to the pedals!"},{"url":null,"title":"managing the coronavirus shut down has been my toughest test as dundee boss says james mcpake","story":"The first year as a manager brings all sorts of challenges but James McPake admits dealing with the coronavirus from a football point of view takes the biscuit.The Dundee boss has had plenty to deal with during his debut campaign, including heavy derby defeats, issues with the law and a restless home support.Pressure has always been a major part of the role and it was ramped up during poor spells in the first half of the Championship campaign.McPake has always had more experienced heads to turn to for advice throughout his time in charge, whether assistant manager Jimmy Nicholl, technical director Gordon Strachan or someone outside the club.The current complete shutdown of Scottish football, however, is completely unprecedented.“This is one I can’t go to anyone for advice,” admits Dens gaffer McPake.“Nobody has faced anything like this.

for the dundee clubs","story":"Ayr United captain Ross Docherty insists he’s not been surprised by how well his former team-mates have fared at Dundee and Dundee United.Declan McDaid joined the Dark Blues from the Honest Men last summer, with Lawrence Shankland and Liam Smith swapping Somerset Park for Tannadice.Shankland has notched  goals in  games for the Terrors and Scotland, while Smith and McDaid have been standouts for their clubs.Goal machine Shankland has particularly impressed Docherty.“It’s not been a surprise to me at all how well he’s done,” the -year-old midfielder said.“I had every confidence in him going up there at the start of the season because he’d done it for Ayr.“We were a decent team last season but he’s gone to Dundee United and they’re dominating the league.“If he gets a chance, he’s going to score and he’s maybe been getting a bit more service up there.“He’d dried up before the league stopped but they’d been struggling as a team.“His form has seen him get caps and a goal for Scotland which is amazing.“He knowshe performs he’s going to get an opportunity.“There’s been a shortage of strikers, obviously, but you can’t take it away from Lawrence.“Boys can look at him and take confidence and encouragement, even though they might not get a Scotland cap playing in the Championship.“It’s unexpected and a bit out there but,you’re going to perform well over a period of time, there’s chances out there to better yourself.”And Doc puts a large portion of Shankland’s improvement down to the -year-old getting himself into shape mentally as well as physically after joining Ayr.The former Livingston and Airdrie man added: “With any striker when they’re going through a period of good form then it’s got to be about having confidence.“That comes from doing well and what started that off was when he came in at Ayr.“He was maybe a wee bit unfit having not done much over the summer before signing for us and he was unfit the season before – he’d be the first to admit that.“His head wasn’t right so it was a number of things but he come in, got as fit as he could and he’s just in a better space.“He was like a dferent guy to the one I played against before and, once you get that, the confidence and the ability he has makes him unstoppable in the league at times.“I’m fairly close to him and he’s a bubbly character but it’s a quiet confidence.“He wouldn’t be bragging to anyone about anything or in anyone’s face.“He knows he’s good enough and that’s probably what a lot of good players miss in this league.“He’s one where,he misses a chance, he knows he’s going to go and score the next one.”Although a dferent character, Docherty believes Smith is almost as important to the Tangerines as Shankland.“I’m not surprised he’s been one of United’s most consistent players because he was the same last season at Ayr.“He came in and flew under the radar but, with two or three months to go in the season, people were starting to say ‘he’s been amazing for us’.“He did it the whole season but he sometimes goes unnoticed but that’s probably because he is such a quiet boy.“He’s a steady Eddy and he and Lawrence link up well.“They did it at Ayr but when you look at us compared to what Dundee United have in terms of budget this season I’m not surprised they’ve gone and done it again.”Docherty does admit, though, that McDaid’s transformation into a left wing-back under James McPake at Dens Park was unexpected.“I’ve seen recently they’ve been playing a -- so he’s almost been playing wing-back,” he added.“I spoke to him and, obviously, as a winger you never really want to be playing there so he was kind of laughing about it!“At the end of the day, though, it shows that he has that side of his game and will benefit him in the long run.“If people maybe two years ago, and I was probably one of them, had thought that Declan McDaid would be playing wing-back they’d have laughed.“He wasn’t as good defensively but now you can see he’s really improved there.“Whenever we’ve played them or I’ve seen them on the telly he’s been one of their best players this season.“It’s brilliant for him, the same as Lawrence and Liam, that boys from Ayr can go to these other clubs and really perform.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/03/DNic_Whorterbank_Signs-7-846x564.jpg ","title":"whorter

Here, we share their answers to some of those key questions:There is currently no evidence that food is a source of coronavirus and it is very unlikely that it can be transmitted through the consumption of food, according to the European Food Safety Authority.Coronavirus is not a foodborne gastrointestinal virus like noroviruswhich causes illness through eating contaminated food.Covid- is a respiratory illness and the transmission route of Covid- is thought to happen mainly through direct contact with respiratory droplets generated when an infected person coughs or sneezes.It is possible for Covid- to be spread indirectly when someone touches a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touches their mouth or nose, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads. Thorough and frequent handwashing will further reduce any risk of spreading Covid- indirectly through contact with potentially contaminated surfaces.Also, based on what we know about similar coronaviruses, the virus would be inactivated through proper cooking and would be removed from food preparation surfaces by thorough cleaning and disinfection.Whilst food is not considered to be a source or transmission route for Covid- it’s always important to follow the four key steps of food safety—cooking, cleaning, chilling and preventing cross contamination – to reduce the risks of all foodborne illness. vw, px\"  Indirect contact with Covid- through touching a surface or object that has the virus on it is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads. However, thoroughand frequent hand washing will help to minimise the potential for indirectly spreading the virus from any surfaces that may have become exposed, including packaged and unpackaged foods. Hygienic handling of food is important to prevent the transmission of any bacterial or viral infection – not just Covid-.You are advised to wash your hands thoroughly after handling food deliveries or unpacking your food and drink at home on ing from the supermarket. Try not to touch your face while you are unpacking the products and disposing of any outer packaging.Follow good food hygiene and wash fruit and vegetables by rubbing under water and peeling the outer layers or skins,appropriate.Based on the current evidence, the risk of imported food and packaging from affected countries being contaminated on arrival into the UK is considered to be very low. This is because the legislation requires appropriate controls to be in place to ensure good hygienic practices are followed by the exporter during the packing and shipping process.Food Standards Scotland’s advice is never to deal with cold callers selling food at the door, especially those offering to supply fish, poultry and meat. We would advise consumers to only purchase food from established supermarkets and local food stores and suppliers which are open for business."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.50148022-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.50148022-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.50148022-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.50148022-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"coronavirus aberdeen businessman calls on government to freeze rates to help companies","story":"A leading north-east entrepreneur has warned the north-east faces a “tsunami of unemployment” unless business rates are frozen.Companies have been offered government grants to help cover their running costs and wages while they are shut down during the pandemic.The Scottish Government has offered non-domestic rates relief of up to % for some industrial sites, while other sectors can claim a % discount.

air","story":"The fate of north-east nursery staff due to start work in the summer to accommodate extended childcare areas is now up in the air because of the coronavirus pandemic.Scottish Government officials had intended to extended the number of annual childcare hours for three and four-year-olds from  to , hours from August – but that has been delayed.When introduced, the extra hours will mean more children staying to eat and sleep at nurseries, so many are taking on extra staff while some are extending buildings, includng Cults Primary School in Aberdeen.It is understood local authorities are now working through the detail on how the delay will impact them.An Aberdeen City Council spokeswoman said: “This is impacting on the delivery of the early learning and childcareprogramme.“While works are stopping and sites are made safe and secure, design and development work will continue and the construction programme will go ahead only when it is absolutely safe to do so.“The ELC expansion team is currently reviewing the impact of Covid- on the delivery of the offer to families.”An Aberdeenshire Council spokesman said: “We would like to pay tribute to funded providers across Aberdeenshire who have helped us to be on course to meet the statutory requirement of offering , hours of additional early learning and childcare by August.“We look forward to continuing this important work once Scottish and UK Government advice allows.”Angus Council said decisions relating to the extended hours delay were being taken within a dynamic environment.A Moray Council spokeswoman said: “We completed the construction of two nurseries just before lockdown.“These are currently in the handover phase.“Construction of a nursery in Keith and other refurbishment projects are now on hold due to the instruction from the Scottish Government to halt construction.“All recruitment for Moray Council is on hold, with the exception of essential workers.“However, our plans to recruit an additional  colleagues in ELC are well developed and we are in a strong position to recover quickly when recruitment reopens.”She added that the council would not be able to provide the extended hours to all parents by August.Meanwhile, some north-east parents have asked the Scottish Government for clarity after receiving conflicting information about the availability of childcare during the coronavirus pandemic.A Scottish Government spokeswoman said childminders should only be open to key workers or vulnerable children.It is “strongly advising” childminders to limit the number of households for whom they provide childcare to a maximum of two, other than their own, at any one time to stop the spread of Covid-.A spokeswoman added: “The Scottish Government and Care Inspectorate contacted registered childminders on March  to advise strongly that all work, other than that for key worker families and vulnerable children, should stop until further notice.”Some parents have complained of childminders charging them in part or full, eventhey are not providing a service.The spokeswoman added: “Charging policies are a matter for inidual businesses.“However we are asking childcare providers, including childminders, to be reasonable and balanced in dealing with parents, recognising the unprecedented situation.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.53267560-240x180.jpg

So how did Britain look before human interventions  Dense forest  or open woodland Research now favours the latter.Plants and animals evolved in equilibrium for thousands of years before humans impacted the landscape. Essential to this balance were ‘keynote species’ including aurochs , bison and tarpan . By grazing, these animals trampled and eroded soils, dispersed seeds and redistributed nutrients, thereby keeping the forest open. This in turn encouraged growth of large trees while also creating numerous habitats and microenvironments for a wonderful ersity of plants and smaller animals.Now this bioersity is severely threatened by modern monocultures , and massive quantities of pesticides, fungicides, fertilisers and #weed# killers. It is no wonder that insect numbers have plummeted, many bird species are endangered and wild-flower meadows have virtually vanished. So could we recreate this natural order on unproductive land and save our wildle For Isabella Tree and her husband Charlie Burrell the answer is a resounding #yes#. In her book #Wilding#, Tree describes #wilding# their , acre farm at Knepp, West Sussex, that had been unproductive for years.They introduced longhorn cattle, Exmore ponies, deer and pigs but otherwise left well alone. Within months they saw a dference # most scrub was cleared, producing an explosion of plant and animal species. And where grazers were deterred by spiny or unpalatable plants, oaks emerged that will eventually form an open woodland.But Knepp is isolated. More rewilding sites are needed with wildle corridors between them to support the populations and genetic ersity essential for long-term survival.Surely parts of Argyll are ideal for rewilding. We already have beavers creating new waterways to support aquatic species – now how about some large grazers to open up the landscape and perhaps one day recreate the ancient Celtic rainforest "},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column february 7 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsDog walkers on the banks of the Crinan Canal need to take collective responsibility for lting their canine companions# mess.There is no excuse for leaving it lying for others to tread in, push a pram through or meet while cutting grass.The bins are there, so use them.We wish Rhona Love all the best in her shooting career.

As we stood about on deck while the dishes were being washed a boy from one of the motor boats passed in his dinghy. He was wearing blue shorts and red stockings which brought from the Pilot the remark: #In Brodickyou don’t wear red stockings you might just as well be in Lamlash.#All but the Skipper and Mate went ashore on Centre Island for a stroll. The Major was still completely paralysed in his hind quarters but he was full of spirit and when the Bosun held up his hind legshe galloped along. It was a quiet peaceful evening with a very light northerly breeze but it was distinctly chilly and there was a magnicentsomewhat lurid sunset. The shore party back aboard the Bosun took the Tar off in the dinghy and they landed on Eilean na Beithe and while the former explored the island the latter played on a shingly shore – it was long after dark when they ed.At half past ten we began to turn in and, as always on the first evening, this was a longer business then usual as pillows and blankets had to be allocated and pillowslips put on but by a quarter past eleven we were all in bed and shortly after that a light shower pattered on the deck. The problem of what to do with the Doctor’s mattress was solved by the Pilot double banking his bunk. We were all very glad to have had such a good day for the start.It was noticed that voices were still coming from the ladies’ cabin when the last of us in the main cabin fell asleep.The Tanky brought an innovation to the Fulmar # #Quickies# # a patent washing gadget that saved precious water.We had a dead quiet night with, as far as any of us knew, no rain but the forecast was not good, promising north to north-east winds, force  to  with frequent heavy showers. The glass had continued its steady drop. When we turned out, a light but cold north wind was blowing from a well broken up sky.We had a breakfast of bacon and eggs then the Bosun took the Major ashore for his walk. The latter was possibly a little better and was able to take a few steps on the deck, but ashore on the rough ground could do nothing. While they were ashore the big motor boat with the red-stockinged boy left after very nearly going ashore on Seil Island while getting his anchor aboard.At twenty past ten we were away under engine, but as soon as we were outside the sails went up to the north-easterly breeze and we set off for the Sound of Mull. There was no sign of the swell that is usually met south of Kerrera and we got along quite well, but we could not point any higher than a mile or so south of Loch Don. The Pilot went below and brewed a welcome cup of tea which warmed us up, then we took a tack right up to the south coast of Kerrera and had a close up view of Gylen Castle and the Skipper waxed historical.Putting about again we passed close south of the Potlid Island, but when we were about halfway across to Loch Don the wind died and the strong ebb began to force us south and about the same time the rain came on.The engine was started and we headed up for Duart, but our progress was pitully slow, and indeed at one period we but barely held our ground. The Lady Rock and Lismore Lighthouse seemed never to get any nearer closing. When the engine had run an hour we waited for the first sign of the old familiar falter but none came and we began to hope a cure for its stopping had been effected by replacing the HT coil.This change was a despairing effort made because it was the only thing we had not tried, though all the pundits declare it could not possibly be the cause. The engine would either go or not go, they said, and it would never startthe coil was defective. We got one scare when it staggered for a moment, but the Bosun, who was at the tiller at the time, said we had just passed though a big mass of floating seaweed and may have got some round our propeller.As we were to prove later the cure had been found and the engine ran impeccably all the cruise and the Skipper had a lot of unkind thoughts about all the many professional motor experts who had caused him a great deal of trouble, not a little acute anxiety and more than considerable expense through their failure to diagnose a not very obscure disease.As we came up to the Black Memorial Tower Leonora crossed our bows making for Oban and another yachtpassed close by south bound under engine though by this time quite a reasonable and, for then, favourable breeze was blowing from the north-east and our sails were drawing.We learnt later that the owner’s we would not allow a sail to be set under any conditions as long as she was aboard – a pity, we thought, as she certainly was a lovely job and we felt it would have been betterthe we had decided to stay ashore.At Duart we stopped the engine and were able to make good progress, but the rain got heavier and heavier and our sandwich lunch was taken below in relays. Then at about three with the turn of the tide the wind died completely and the engine was started again. Near the Grey Rocks we saw St Roma coming south under power so we altered course to intercept her then at slow speed turned back the way we had come for a few hundred yards while we exchanged news.We heard a thoroughly bad forecast at mid-day, the wind had gone, the rain was stotting in the glassy sea, and, though the glass had come back only a fraction, we decided to call it a day so, with the Bosun the only dissentient, made for Loch Aline. As we turned inshore at Ardtornish we saw Seewolf to the north of us, becalmed but heading south, and guessed she would be joining us later. Coming in, when between Morven Pier and the Ferry Pier, the Skipper held too close to the west shore and the bottom showed up suddenly far too clearly for our peace of mind and a quick sheer out was necessary.Through the narrows we turned to starboard and anchored at half past four in Kyle Bay in a flat calm and the rain coming down heavier than ever. Gratefully we realised that it was not quite as bitterly cold as it had been out in the Sound.Seewolf came in shortly after going very slowly and Hamish Lawrence called over that he had run a big end and was on his way to Oban for repairs and to hand over to brother Alec and his family. Soon after that we were joined by a small motor boat, Saguenay, flying a blue ensign which, in view of her size, the Skipper was sure she was not entitled to do and then a little later, while we were warming up with some coffee, Lindisfarne arrived and anchored close beside us with Guy Clephane in his usual tremendousform – he’s a proper marvel is Guy.Hamish Lawrence came across in his dinghy and came aboard for a gin and while he was there Guy called over inviting Tanky and the Pilot across to Lindisfarne then sent the Pilot back to Fulmar to fetch the Bosun. Hamish gone, the Skipper began to put nine inch tacklines into our line of flags as we had discovered at Rothesay at the Royal Clyde Centenary Regatta that without them our line was about fteen feet too short and we wanted them to be right for the Queen’s visit to Tobermory.When the Pilot came back he and the Bosun got the tents up as the rain was by then torrential.We had a supper of sausages and beans and while the dishes were being done the Bosun took the Major ashore. He was walking a little bettervery slowly, but there was, unfortunately, no concrete results from his exercise.At nine o’clock we went in two loads across to Seewolf and were offered drinks OR tea, but the Skipper insisted on both. We were, however, not allowed any biscuits with our tea as to have them would have meant opening a new box and broaching Alec Lawrence’s stores. The Tanky had not wanted anything but tea, but Hamish had given her a good strong gin which she tried to hide on a shelf behind her and it was only got rid of when the Pilot took it off her hands and quickly put it to its proper use. The Bosun was drinking beer and when he opened up the tin a goodly portion of it bubbled onto the fitted carpet in the cabin.On board Seewolf were, besides the two paid hands, Hamish’s mother and his two sisters. The old lady, well over eighty, was in grand form and waxed eloquent on #The old days# and the greatness of #Belshaft#. Also on board was a great big collie who was obviously petted and spoilt beyond measure and he behaved more like a lap dog than the great big clumsy creature he was.It was half past eleven before we went back to Fulmar all in one load with little enough freeboard for the dinghy considering the conditions. There was a nasty little lop on the water, the northerly wind was bitterly cold, and the rain was as heavy as ever. As quickly as possible we got below and into our warm bunks, not even the Bosun wasting any time about it, though he did read for some time after all the rest were sound asleep."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast podcast episode 10 nessie and the lost golf balls","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWelcome to Episode  of the Oban Time#s BOBcast.Charting Bob#s progress  and discussing lots of things golfare  presenters Stephen Day, George Graham, Martin Laing and Keith McIntyre.

As part of this project the fund provided MACPool with seven aqua cycles and training from Hydrorider.Arriving early to take photogaphs of the others giving these bikes a go, any sense of nervousness was set aside as I watched healthcare professionals and fitness and well-being enthusiasts laugh and chat through their shot.After some quick adjustments to the bikes June, from our advertising department, and I were raring to go.Partially submerged, the feeling of being weightless combined with the resistance of the water as we began peddling was initially a bit odd. As we got used to the feeling, we started to speed things up, pretending we were racing the rest of our group to The Cairnbaan for a gin and tonic.Finding our rhythm, instructor Kathryn Craig began to lead us through arm exercises. Our co-ordination was put to the test as we carried on cycling while doing simple arm movements that felt more impactive due to the water resistance.

Included in this is the Isle of Jura.This is as shockingly reckless as it is offensive.The Isle of Jura is not a #bolthole# as the Daily Mail has chosen to state but a very beautul island steeped in culture and rich history.On both Jura and Islay we, like so many rural areas, are struggling to deal with all of the challenges related to the Corona virus out break. Our local health services have very limited resources as it is, along side a population that has many elderly residents who are more at risk to the virus.We have seen a local uptick in people traveling to Islay in camper vans and this is happening at a time when the UK government is advising against non essential travel.Those who are choosing to travel to our islands of Islay, Jura and the many other islands in Argyll and Bute in order to avoid the coronavirus may end up inadvertently spreading it to islands who arenot as much affected in the same way as so many built up urban areas are. Such actions are as reckless as they are selfish and I would implore people who do not need to travel to our rural constituency to avoid doing so until this global pandemic has passed.Jura, Islay and the rest of Argyll are some of the most beautul places you will ever visit and you won#t find an area where the people are more hospitable and friendly but while this crisis is ongoing I would ask everyone who is not currently living here to avoid traveling here for the time being.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands ward.To the Scottish public,During this time of unprecedented uncertainty, we are all concerned about the safety and wellbeing of our families, friends and colleagues.Our hearts go out to those who have been affected personally by the outbreak of coronavirus , as well as the many communities around the world that are facing extreme measures in an attempt to slow its spread.We appreciate and are mindful of the challenges iniduals are currently facing as well as the impact this pandemic has had on our vital emergency services as well as the grocery retail sector, supply chain and producers.Like our retail partners, we want to take this opportunity to assure you that Scottish farmers, auctioneers, hauliers, processors and butchers are doing everything they can to maintain the ongoing availability of fresh, locally sourced Scotch Beef PGI, Scotch Lamb PGI and Specially Selected Pork.We would like to thank all those who work in the Scottish red meat industry and their families for their ongoing and unwavering efforts to keep our supermarket shelves and butcher shops stocked, fuelling Scotland with top-quality red meat during this challenging time.As bodies supporting the Scottish agricultural and red meat industry, we are constantly reviewing the developing situation and are doing all we can to support everyone involved in putting nutritious food on your plates.Alan Clarke, chief executive, Quality Meat ScotlandMartin Morgan, executive manager, Scottish Association of Meat Wholesalers Duncan Todd, secretary, Scottish Beef Association Jen Craig, president, National Sheep Association Scotland Penny Montgomerie, chief executive, Scottish Association of Young Farmers Clubs and Gordon King, executive manager, Scottish Craft Butchers.What on earth is going on  It was banal enough when Ben Goldsmith # English financier and environmentalist # tweeted that #overgrazing# by upland sheep farmers, was responsible for the devastating floods in South Wales, rather than record-breaking torrential rainfall.Unbelievably we now have a government official, Dr Tim Leunig, suggesting the whole of the UK does not need farming, and his comparison of the UK to Singapore in this context is absolutely ludicrous. You truly have to wonderthere is something in the water that he is drinking – could it be flood contamination Surely, every person having a full and ing set of neurons and synapses, the complete opposite is the truth, as we dearly need our hard working farming community.The UK Government should be fully supporting the farming industry and indeed, good land management. The Welsh Assembly has totally lost its way with its mindless policy of devastating Welsh forests with thousands and thousands # an understatement # of trees being felled for wind farms, and compounding the felony by covering acres of land with very limited electricity generating solar parks # Wales is not the Sahara and the sun disappears at night! Solar  will generate about  per cent of their maximum capacity in the UK.Returning to farming perhaps some kind person should tell Dr Tim Leunig that the answer lies in the soil and then lead him to a darkened and quiet room so he can lie down and contemplate the truth # wise men recognise that truth is the daughter of time, not of authority.Dave Haskell, Cardigan."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus claims 16 more lives in scotland","story":"Ellis ButcherUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThe number of people in Scotland who have died from COVID- has risen to , the First Minister has announced.The coronavirus death toll rose by  on yesterday with confirmed cases now up to , from , yesterday.A total of  people are in intensive care as the virus accelerates, she said, although numbers are regarded as underestimate.In addition, she confirmed today that the popular Edinburgh Fringe Festival would not take place this summer, bringing to an end rumours it may happen on a much smaller scale.Addressing questions about the availability of ventilators in Scotland, Mrs Sturgeon said the Scottish Government #had a number# on order with overseas manufacturers.#Those orders will be delivered,they stay on track, over the period of the next number of weeks and by the summer,# she said.#It will take us to roundabout more than a thousand ventilators.

Editor Andrew McQuarrie grabbed a torch, pulled on his big-boy trousers and joined the funhellipIt was .pm on a Saturday night and I was trying to communicate with a supernatural beingusing a pair of copper rods.Having done as instructed and asked the tools a simple lsquoYes Norsquo question, I was slightly dismayed to see the rods stubbornly remaining still, the spirit apparently refusing to play ball.Sheila, an employee of UK Ghost Nights, appeared quite perplexed as her eyes darted between me and the rods.ldquoAre you a sceptic  she asked, a faint edge of suspicion laced in her voice.I admitted that I was indeed a sceptic, but one who was more than willing to be converted into a true believer.Happy with this answer, Sheila ushered me into a corner that was, she said, known to be particularly popular with spirits.ldquoAre we in Melrose  I asked the rods, willing them to show even the smallest hint of movement.But after a full minute of tense observation, it was plain to see the equipment would not co-operate.An hour earlier, when the ghost experts were delivering their briefing, they had promised the  paying customers that ldquonothing is fabricated on the tours.The insinuation, it seemed to me, was that this would likely not be a night of high drama and theatrics.Nevertheless, I couldnrsquot help but feel a bit disappointed that my opening bid to converse with the dead had fallen distinctly flat.And over the next four hours, so it would prove, my luck would not change much.Yet, as I wandered the portrait-lined corridors of the George  Abbotsford Hotel, trying to channel my inner Bill Murray, some of the people to whom I spoke offered compelling tales.Few were as gripping as those delivered by Dawn Barrett - owner of the hotel for the last  months - and her cooking team.Among the unusual goings-on noted by Mrs Barrett, for instance, were lights turning on and off on their own, furniture moving around, footsteps at all hours and even the feeling of her hair being brushed.Asked for her views on the supernatural, Mrs Barrett said: ldquoI definitely believe - Irsquove seen and heard too much now.It was Mrs Barrett herself who contacted UK Ghost Nights in the first place, with the aim of getting to the root of what makes the hotel tick.ldquoI want to know why they [spirits] are here. I donrsquot understand how they can put lights on and off. I just want to understand it more, she said.Head chef Kailee Reidie, , spoke of an alarming encounter with a spirit who has come to be known as John, supposedly a grouchy ex-chef.As Kailee turned on the fryer one evening, while she was alone in the kitchen, her hair was pulled back so sharply that she was thrown into the table behind her, banging her head.ldquoAs soon as I turned my back on him [John], thatrsquos when it happened, recalled Kailee, going on to explain her emotions at the time.ldquoI was in shock because I knew he [John] was there, but Irsquom not a big believer in ghostshellip Irsquove never seen John - itrsquos just a feeling.Just a feeling. Well, there was certainly a sense of foreboding in some areas of the building - not least the cellar and the attic.In one of the attic rooms, we indulged in an activity called the lsquohuman pendulumrsquo. This entails three people standing in a row, with the person in the middle acting as the spiritrsquos means of communication.When the spirit is asked a Yes No question, the piggy in the middle is expected to rock forwards for a lsquoYesrsquo and backwards for a lsquoNorsquo - a movement being directed by the answering spirit.One by one, the customers lined up to participate in this creepy experiment, watched by the rest of the room with a mixture of excitement and dread.Time and again, the spiritrsquos presence was well felt. In fact, there turned out to be a number of obliging spirits, each surprisingly keen to answer questions including, lsquoDo you have childrenrsquo  and lsquoAre you happy with us being herersquo As I watched this circus unfold, I was praying Irsquod be able to endure the entire episode as an observer, a witness to the craziness.Not so much because I was scared - although I was a little, I must admit - but more because I knew what would happen.,params: .pushldquoAndrew, would you like to have a shot in the middle What followed was several minutes of embarrassment for everyone.Because of course I didnrsquot move. Not even an inch. And the change in atmosphere was so marked that I genuinely wonderedmy trousers had somehow dropped to my ankles without my noticing.Thankfully, my clothes had remained bound to my body, but any faith I might have had in the ghost-hunting process was sliding away fast.As the tour continued, taking in several other locations promising ldquohigh activity, it became increasingly dficult to muster the energy to stay alert, with the clock ticking into the wee small hours.That said, there was one incident which aroused a certain degree of puzzlement - a maglite which appeared to flash when certain questions were posed.Admittedly, that was a curious development. But still not enough to push me into the camp of believers.The more I dwelt on the nightrsquos events, however, the more I came to realise the deeper signicance of it all.Before the tour, UK Ghost Nights founder Lisa Tedstill had made sure I was aware of the crucial equipment to bring.ldquoAll you need is a torch and a sense of humour, she said, going on to lay her finger on the true essence of the affair.ldquoWe donrsquot guarantee there will be any paranormal activity - anyone who does that is a charlatan.ldquoBut we can guarantee everybody will have a very fun experience.And, indeed, while I may have left the George  Abbotsford that night without a firmer belief in ghosts, I certainly ed home with a smile."},{"url":null,"title":"council-powers-handed-chief-meetings-scrapped","story":"PLANS to hand Scottish Borders Councilchief Tracey Logan delegated control of decision-making are expected to be rubber-stamped this week.It comes hot on the heels of Prime Minister Boris Johnsonrsquos instruction that everyone in the UK should spend most of their time at home in order to counter the coronavirus outbreak.But on Thursday , in an unprecedented move, proposals to temporarily delegate the local authorityrsquos decision-making responsibility to the Chief Executive will be passed.Council meetings in Newtown St Boswells will be cancelled until September , with the exception of vital committee meetings which will be done through video-conferencing.SBC chief legal officer Nuala McKinlay stated: ldquoAs the virus makes a wider impact on public le, Scottish Borders Council must consider how to respond.\"In taking any decision to protect health by limiting social contact, it must also ensure processes are in place to enable it to continue to make urgent decisions.ldquoIn order to allow decisions to be made, it is proposed that all those decision-making s of council which can lawfully be delegated, be delegated to the chief executive to be made in consultation with members and relevant senior officers.It is also proposed that any committee meetings which do need to take place between now and October will be held via remote video links.Ms McKinlay added: ldquoThe Local Government in Scotland Act  allows a local authority to y that process and conduct a meeting by other ways.

It is caused by a virus called coronavirus.The outbreak started in Wuhan in China in December  and it is thought that the virus, like others of its kind, has come from animals.As this is such a new illness, experts still arenrsquot sure how it is spread. But, similar viruses are spread in cough droplets. Therefore, covering your nose and mouth when sneezing and coughing, and disposing of used tissues straight away is advised. Viruses like coronavirus cannot live outside the body for very long.The NHS states that the symptoms are: a dry cough, high temperature and shortness of breath - but these symptoms do not necessarily mean you have the illness. Look out for flu-like symptoms, such as aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose and a sore throat. Itrsquos important to remember that some people may become infected but wonrsquot develop any symptoms or feel unwell.Washing your hands with soap and water thoroughly. The NHS also advises to cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your sleevewhen you cough or sneeze put used tissues in the bin immediately and try to avoid close contact with people who are unwell. Also avoiding touching eyes, nose and mouth unless your hands are clean.As of Monday,March , the prime minister has put the UK into lockdown and instructed all citizens to stay at home.

It was so strange not being able to give each other a hug, as we have always done over the past  years of our friendship.I chose a walk in which I hoped we would meet nobody , and we walked two metres apart. Despite our plan not to talk about the virus, we inevitably ended up doing just that, although not all the time.The walk took us to the site of the old Byres Kirk, just beyond Ormiston. As hoped, it was deserted, and so we entered.The eeriness of current events affected my behaviour. I walked around with my friend, carefully ensuring I touched nothing. The original kirk built here in  is long gone. It replaced an even older kirk, the remains of which are hidden in private woodland next to nearby Ormiston Hall not far from this site.The first kirk at Byres was eventually demolished and replaced by a neo-gothic building in the s. But after the opening of a new church in Ormiston in the s, Byres Kirk was finally abandoned and eventually demolished in the s.But the graves remain, including war graves, and there is also a headstone erected by Isabella Burns, sister of the famous poet, to the memory of her children.It was this headstone I had come to see. Isabella was the youngest sister of Robert Burns and she lived in Ormiston and Tranent for a while. In  she was widowed, with nine children, three girls and six boys. She set up a village school to help make ends meet.Itrsquos dficult to imagine what her le must have been like, but I think the fact she was part of Robert Burnsrsquo immediate family may have given her a status and a degree of respect most women were denied.I found the stone and was intrigued by it. Two of Isabellarsquos children are mentioned one of them, Edward, died at the age of  in China.ldquoChina  I said out loud to myself, wondering what he was doing there. I saw the date of his death: November , .Then it dawned on me: the Opium Wars! He must have been a soldier. I quickly Googled it on my phone and sure enough he was serving in a regiment there.I stood for a moment, thinking about the story behind this scant piece of information. The Opium Wars are not usually a prominent part of our history curriculum, although they should be. The British state went to war with China to safeguard the ability of British traders to sell opium to the Chinese, which resulted in  million addicts there. Itrsquos a dark part of our imperial history, and the fact that a nephew of Robert Burns ended up dead in China defending state-sponsored drug smuggling by Britain seemed horribly ironic and sad. But it also gave me a sense of the connectedness we all have. The decisions people make, especially those in power, affect the lives of others in ways we will never know or predict.The memorial headstone also had a later inscription which recorded the death of Isabella herself. She lived until she was  and died in . She isnrsquot buried in this graveyard, however, as she spent the last years of her le in Ayrshire and was laid to rest in Alloway Kirkyard.Such a web of le and connection, now mostly long forgotten, revealed by this one memorial stone.As I left, I noticed the trees: oak, sycamore, beech and yew. They seemed to grow out of lost human memory, asthey were now s of forgotten stories.On ourjourney to the car, we passed another memorial stone, this time to the Polish soldiers who had been based in Ormiston Hall in the s during the war. This too is now a time of memory fading, but not forgotten, as the flowers someone left revealed.We had succeeded in a walk seeing almost nobody, except a passing cyclist at the end. Next time we go on such a walk, spring will have arrived undisturbed by human footprints.

support developers are already seeing applications for public meetings lodged without a date or venue for exhibiting future proposals.And Tony Thomas, director of APT Planning  Development in East Linton, says ensuring the building industry is ready to resume as soon as possible may mean future consultations have to be carried out on websites.Mr Thomas revealed that one consultation had already begun online as Queensberry Properties launched a website inviting feedback on its proposals for Finance House in Edinburgh.The website was launched after a planned second public consultation this month had to be cancelled and gives people a chance to view the plans to turn the former office building into residential accommodation with associated commercial and leisure facilities.And it could be the way people are consulted in the future as more companies look at ways to engage with the public without face-to-face gatherings.The first public stage of planning applications for large developments is lodging a pre-application noticewith a council informing them that public consultation meetings are being held.The meetings, which usually take place in town halls or community centres, give local residents a chance to see the proposals for the first time, talk to developers and give their views.However, that crucial stage is on hold for some developments after the lockdown, which prohibits gatherings of more than two people.At Millerhill, Midlothian, a pre-application notice for housing at Wellington Farm on land known as Dukersquos Field has been lodged with no date or venue for the public exhibition.In a note to the council, the developers have said: ldquoIn light of Governmentadvice which seeks to minimise the spread of coronavirus, non-essential contact is limited at his time.ldquoWe are therefore awaiting the advice of the Scottish Government before making any formal arrangements for pre-application public engagement.Mr Thomas said it was vital for the industry that companies were ready to resume work as soon as possible.He said: ldquoThe approach to all aspects of the planning process is very much an emerging issue.ldquoThe authorities are working hard to continue lsquoas normalrsquo whilst working remotely and this is hugely appreciated.ldquoIt will be important that as and when restrictions are lted the development industry is ready to respond quickly.ldquoFrom a workload perspective, most clients are looking to progress with projects that are already in the pipeline and to be fair the alternative would be catastrophic for a sector that feels peaks and troughs very quickly.ldquoWhere public consultation is still proposed programmed, the only way to achieve this will be to set up a dedicated website with the ability to post

Over the last couple of days he talked of getting people back to work after Easter - a ldquobeautul timeline - at the same time as threatening to put New York, currently the worst affected state, into complete quarantine.Donrsquot get me wrong, I was relieved when the  trillion government support package his administration drew up was finally signed off. But based on what family and friends are telling us on daily calls, itrsquos going to take more than a one-off , cheque for low and middle earners for this to be anything other than a catastrophe for the worldrsquos richest country.The coronavirus trajectory is looking particularly ominous in the US, with its case rate the highest in the worldand a death rate that is already on course to outpace Italy.No country can escape the devastating effects of this virus, of course, no health service is not at risk of being overwhelmed. But as anyone who has spent signicant time there will know and understand, the US is a nation spectacularly ill-suited to a pandemic of this nature and magnitude. Even without the addition of Donald Trump.Indeed, the virus is already exposing many of US societyrsquos in-built weaknesses. Most fundamentally, the non-universal healthcare system that means millions of Americans have no way to pay for treatment should they become ill. Even those who do have medical insurance could find themselves with huge, le-ruining bills, depending on their medical history and policy exclusions. At a time like this, a complex, profit-drivensystem which links healthcare with employment status is particularly likely to fail.The notoriously ungenerous welfare system only compounds this. Many people will feel compelled to keep working rather than following instructions to stay at home. The additions to unemployment benefit announced in the support package are unlikely to provide much reassurance for those in this situation.Demographics is also key. Much of the interior of this vast country, including many of the southern states and rural areas, are poor and poorly resourced to a level that would astound many Europeans. If they are short of ventilators and hospital beds in New York, I dread to think what it will be like in rural Arkansas and Mississippi, where higher proportions of the population are elderly, infirm, unemployed and uninsured.But, as Mr Trumprsquos popularity in some of these places affirms, there are other fundamental issues at play. Many Americans distrust the very idea of the state, and their in-built inidualism may make them balk at the idea of having freedoms curtailed. They have no experience of the state having this much direct control over their lives, no experience in living memory of sacricing personal freedoms, as Europeans did during the Second World War. I note with concern that in some parts of the US there has been a rush on guns as well as toilet paper.This is also the most ided of nations, along political, geographical, economic and religious lines, which plays into a narrative of suspicion and rage. Only two weeks ago, while visiting the southern states, I spoke to people who believed coronavirus had been created by China in retaliation for US trade tarfs. Others talked of it being a plague sent by God to punish sinners.Even a well-run administration would have been up against it. As it stands, Mr Trumprsquos response, strewn with delay, contrary messages and personal insults, may already have cost lives.Despite the worry I feel for my American family, I want to end on a positive. I have no doubt the ingenuity, tenaciousness and \"can do\" attitude of people there, that other strand of the inidualism mentioned earlier, will play an important role in how the world tackles this crisis in the months ahead. On this front, I hope America continues to be the home of the brave."},{"url":null,"title":"TV REVIEW   The Steph Show - just the tonic the lockdown troops need ","story":"Channel , noonALL hail television. It has brought the moon landing into our homes, allowed us to explore the world from sea to sky, enriched our souls and blown our tiny minds.Now here we are, in , and there is a woman on the screen wearing a cushion cover on her head. Like the man Lennon said, nobody told me there would be days like these.But thatrsquos the virus, The Thing, for you. No aspect of le remains untouched by it. Now it has given rise to a new strand of programmes, which for want of a yuckier phrase wersquoll call virus viewing. Among the first examples of this aired yesterday on, where , Channel .The Steph Show comes live from the home of presenter Steph McGovern. You know Steph. Yorkshire. Working class. Blonde. Gets on with everybody. The Aldi version of Clare Balding. She was due to start a conventional daytime chatshow soon, in a proper studio, and when all this is over, and there are blue birds over the white clfs of Dover, she will get that. For now, though, Steph is stuck at home like the rest of us, so why not do the show right there There she was, broadcasting live ldquofrom my actual house, where she lives with her five-month-old baby. We did not glimpse young McGovern on this occasion, but we did see the -strong Hann family from Dundee, Strictlyrsquos Anton du Beke, the comedian Keith Lemon and others, all beamed in from their homes courtesy of the internet. Otherwise, the production team were in Stephrsquos garage, the sound man was outside, and everyone was the regulation two metres apart.The interview with the Hann family exposed one of the pitfalls of this kind of Blue Peter, sticky back plastic programme making in that the sound was too low and the signal kept breaking up. While other interviews were clearer they were interrupted by screen freezes and phone pings. The odd instance of such things happening might be considered charmingly ramshackle too much will be just plain annoying.The content, including a money management section and a fitness routine, must have taken a whole five minutes to think up. There were local radio style ldquoshout outs to the ious heroes and heroines of the virus crisis, including a GP and a chap who had helped stock a food bank. In the middle of the show was a Channel  news bulletin with Cathy Newman. The smoothness and conventionality of this segment made The Steph Show look even more thrown together when we switched back.It was, as McGovern herself said, a bit rough round the edges. ldquoThatrsquos how Irsquove been described for most of my career, she joked. McGovern is too modest. Thatrsquos one of her many charms. The only reason the show stayed together, and remained watchable, was her. She could think on her feet, she was good with the guests, and she did not stop rabbiting for a second ndash all essential qualities for a presenter of a live show. She could have a giggle, too, as when she and Lemon were trying out ideas for masks and she put a cushion cover over her face. You would never catch Fiona Bruce doing that.At times the chat descended to the depths of banality, as when Lemon told us that he had hot dogs for dinner the previous evening. ldquoSo did I! shrieked McGovern asit was the most fascinating coincidence ever.Oh, and it turned out that Lemonrsquos we had the same jumper as McGovern. Gripping stuff, eh  This is going to be a tough gig to do day after day. By day five the format might have found its groove, or jumped the tracks entirely.Much of the interest lay in seeing what other peoplersquos homes were like. McGovernrsquos was modern, sleek, all John Lewis cushions and fresh flowers. Everything looked brand new. Du Beke had curtains that were as gaudy as some of his Strictly costumes, while Lemon appeared to live at the bottom of a well.The hour flew by in a rush of silliness.

Public-service deadlines for licensing and planning applications will also been extended, reflecting the slowdown caused by the outbreak.If approved, the new powers would expire on September  this year, although MSPs have the option to extend the legislation for a further two six-month periods, should it be deemed necessary to do so to tackle the coronavirus pandemic.:Coronavirus: Parts of Britain now like a \"police state\", ex-Supreme Justice warnsMr Russell said: \"We are in an emergency and these are emergency powers that are necessary to allow us to concentrate on the absolute priority of dealing with the pandemic.\"Some of these measures are about the continuingof the justice system and public services to maintain public confidence and to keep our communities safe.\"He added: \"For example, we cannot simply summon juries at present - that would be completely impossible.:Coronavirus: It may be over six months before we get back to normal le, says medical chief\"The procedure to have solemn trials without a jury is in the Bill, but there are many safeguards.

For almost  years people in Scotland who are victims or witnesses have been able to give their evidence to a jury, and for the accused to know that their peers are judging them.

We had a strict cleaning policy in the studio. We tried to keep going with the class and keep ahead of things, but it just ended up being a bit of a roller coaster, said Mrs Black.ldquoI think self-employed instructors were able to move faster as we are a bit more nimble in how we could react compared to some gyms.

While there are a number of restrictions in place during lockdown.Mrs Black added: ldquo One of the most important things just now is ways of keeping connected.

The payments industry, including all contactless card issuers, has completed all the work to enable retailers to upgrade as soon as they can.If a retailer wants to start accepting contactless payments at the higher limit of £ it should get in touch with its acquirer.For consumers spending more than £ there are many ways to choose to pay, for example through Chip  PIN and other alternatives such as mobile payments which do not have an upper limit when authenticated through biometric technologies.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

As a result, we’ve had to take the decision to focus our efforts on the collection and disposal of household and commercial waste, while suspending our recycling services.”The following changes will be made:Mr Richardson added: “In normal times, we greatly appreciate the efforts people make to recycle a wide range of household and commercial items. But these are far from normal times, which is why we’ve had to make the dficult decision to suspend our recycling services.“We are not the only Council making this move, and we understand that  of the  local authorities across Scotland are also working on revised arrangements.“We are asking folkat all possible to store their recycling until these services can begin again. We’re aware that this won’t be an option for everyone, but we would ask that recyclable items are only included as a last resort on grey bin collection days.”He added: “People will be disappointed, and we apologise for the inconvenience these measures will cause. But in these unprecedented times, there is a need to ensure we can continue with the most essential operations with a limited workforce during the weeks and months ahead.“We ask all businesses and householders to be considerate during this time and to make every effort to minimise the waste that is put out for collection, bearing in mind that higher than normal volumes can cause delays and missed collections for other households and businesses.“We are extremely grateful for your co-operation during this dficult period and also for the efforts of our office and depot staff, crews and drivers, who are already going above and beyond in providing vital waste collection services under extremely challenging conditions.”Any further changes will be announced through local media, on the Council website and using OIC’s social media channels.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This came as welcome news to Orkney MSP Liam McArthur, who had previously highlighted these concerns. The moves were also welcomed by Highlands and Islands MSP Jamie Halcro Johnston.The Loganair aircraft will be based at Glasgow Airport but can operate throughout Scotland.   Loganair pilots will be operating the aircraft as usual, and late last week, all received a special briefing from the airline and the Scottish Ambulance Service on the nature of the deployment.Work has continued in Loganair’s Engineering and Flight Operations teams at Glasgow over the weekend and into this week to ensure full readiness of the aircraft ahead of full mission readiness from Friday  April.Loganair is also now working to convert a larger Saab  aircraft, capable of operating into all Highlands and Islands airports apart from Barra, to become an air ambulance with the capability to carry two Epishuttle pods and accompanying medical teams simultaneously.  It is expected this aircraft will be available within the next seven days.Loganair’s Chief Executive Jonathan Hinkles said: “The team effort to make this happen, moving from a concept to an operational solution in just a week, has been absolutely incredible.#Between the SAS and Loganair teams, the concept, testing and training has all taken place and we’re also grateful for the support from the Civil Aviation Authority in progressing this project.“Although the circumstances under which all of this work has been undertaken are ones that we’d never have wished to see, I’m heartened that the effort which has gone into this is truly admirable.

The grief of losing loved ones is bad enough but not being able to go and visit their graves - it’s not asyou have to worry about social distancing in a cemetery.Others agreed: This is a step too far. The cemetery is not a social gathering.There is never anyone there when I go to visit my sons grave. I wish someone can tell me what purpose this will serve.If they even left the side gate open it would be a compromise.What about peoples mental health This is a total disgrace to deprive any of us a few quiet moments at the graveside of our loved ones.Another woman said: This is just not necessary! Its absolutely ridiculous. Nobody goes to a graveyard in large groups to have social gatherings!People go to have a quiet moment with a loved one and are then on their way again! This is the only walk for the day that some people do.One woman was bereft after burying her father on the same day as the announcement.She said: Im absolutely heartbroken at this.I have just laid my daddy to rest today and he never even got the send off he deserved.We couldnt bring him home and now I cant even visit to try to come to terms with his loss this. Its so heartbreaking.Others said they would have hoped for advance notice in order to pay a final visit to their loved ones and to put fresh flowers on graves.However, one woman posted: Folks, its my sons anniversary tomorrow.I will not be able to attend his grave as usual. However, instead of finding fault, I will accept this new ruling as a neccessary action for our continued safety.Many of you dont seem to have thought about those people who have died of the virus and the need to bury them as well. Remember we had the comfort of being present when our loved ones were buried or cremated - the families of those dying with Covid- will not get this andthe council need to keep the public out for safety then respect this request.They are not asking to upset you or infringe on your actions.

In addition, % of symptomatic cases would adhere to case isolation.The modelling team’s best judgement is that this would lead to a peak number of  Covid- patients requiring ventilation and critical care beds during the first wave of the epidemic.

Linda Stewart speaks to three frontline staff who are staying away from their dwellings to protect their loved ones.The AE nurseAE nurse Ruth McGreevy , from Newtownards, has moved into an Airbnb accommodation in Bangor in order to protect her mum and siblings who fall under the high risk category. Her boyfriend is Philip , a computer technicianAE nurse Ruth McGreevy has had fond memories of the Ulster Hospital since childhood when she was a frequent visitor due to her asthma.Now on the frontline in the fight against coronavirus, the -year-old from Newtownards is poised for the toughest battle of her le as the hospital prepares for a flood of patients hit by coronavirus.Although patients infected with Covid- have already started to appear at the Ulster Hospital - and there have been some deaths - there is still a sense that it is the calm before the storm.We shut down a bit of the AE to cater for people coming in, where we could call people in and treat them, send them to the ward or send them home. And then the past couple of weeks we#ve been closing off more and more of the AE, Ruth says.We#re all very nervous. I don#t even think it#s about the people coming in - people are worried about taking it home Ruth McGreevy, nurseObviously, the doctors and the managers are concerned that it#s coming because they#re shutting it down and we#re getting more in-depth training on how to deal with the really sick patients that come in. So it#s a bit scarier now that all this is taking place - everyone#s on tenterhooks just waiting for this to hit.All the wards have been emptied out to deal with this when it arrives and it#s quite bizarre lately going to the ward and seeing lots of empty beds, because that hasn#t happened in years.The staff have been getting special training in the personal protection they will wear, including masks, aprons and gloves.And then there are things like infection control, how to stop the spread. We#re learning how to work ventilators and respiratory equipment, Ruth says.That#s quite daunting - nurses generally wouldn#t really be doing much of that, but now we#re being taught it just in case we get into the circumstances where we might have to use them.We#re all very nervous. I don#t even think it#s about the people coming in - people are worried about taking it home.We all have families at home and sick people and children and things. You#re so scared of walking it back into your house, because you never know what will happen. You hear of people getting younger and younger with no medical history who are dying from this, so it#s scary.Ruth has a long association with the Ulster Hospital - she was born prematurely and had bad asthma when she was young, and spent a lot of time in the hospital.I just had lots of admissions with my chest as I had quite a lot of asthma attacks, so I was just in and out with that into Maynard Ward. They were always so nice and kind and my sister Eleanor was quite unwell as a child, so we spent a lot of time visiting her when I was little - I was just always around hospitals.It was this early experience that spurred her to become a nurse.I was struck with just how much a bit of kindness can do for someone, Ruth says.You can be so unwell and someone just giving you a nice smile or being kind - the smallest gesture can go a long way. Making someone a cup of tea sometimes goes a lot further than any other medication you can give them. with her mum and sisters\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph le features ab .ece AUTOCROP w --_l__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph le features ab .ece AUTOCROP w --_l__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph le features ab .ece AUTOCROP w --_l__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph le features ab .ece AUTOCROP w --_l__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph le features ab .ece AUTOCROP w --_l__I.JPG w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   with her mum and sisters\"Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClose with her mum and sisters\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph le features ab .ece AUTOCROP w --_l__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph le features ab .ece AUTOCROP w --_l__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph le features ab .ece AUTOCROP w --_l__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph le features ab .ece AUTOCROP w --_l__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph le features ab .ece AUTOCROP w --_l__I.JPG w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   with her mum and sisters\"Close family: Ruthwith her mum and sisters FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappClose family: Ruthwith her mum and sistersAfter leaving school, Ruth went to Queen#s University Belfast and worked as a healthcare assistant while studying to be a nurse. She is now an adult-trained AE nurse in the Ulster Hospital.Basically, it#s people walking in unwell, so it#s like doing bloods and ECGs, trying to figure out what#s wrong with people. Lately, I#ve been dealing with cardiac arrests and things like that, dealing with car accidents.Ruth lives with her mum Belleand sisters Sarah , Eleanorand Kirsty .In the past week she has been forced to make the dficult decision to move away from her family in order to protect them from the danger of infection.I#m the youngest, and I didn#t want to do it but my mum is , and she#s diabetic and has high blood pressure, Ruth says.My oldest brother Alex recently had four strokes and he was on chemotherapy treatment with quite an unusual disease that he has - nobody#s really heard of it. So he#s on chemotherapy and he would have quite a low immune system. My sister Eleanor has MS and my sister Kirsty is on immunosuppressant drugs for a stomach problem. I feel like a walking super-virus going into my house.I was thinking about it for a few weeks but I hadn#t really talked to my mum about it - I didn#t want to bring it up until I thought it was really necessary.But in the last week especially I noticed that a lot of the patients I#ve been looking after had been going off to the ward and were taken very unwell or there were people passing away. So, in my eyes I could see it escalating quite a lot and I felt like it was time to go. Ruth says her family was very upset that she had to move out. She was the youngest and had never been away from home for a long period of time.I#m only moving to Bangor - it#s not far but it#s more that I can#t come into the house and have a proper conversation with them, she says.My mum was very upset about it - she#s just worried. She keeps saying she might not see me again.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseRuth with boyfriend Philip Ferguson FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappRuth with boyfriend Philip FergusonRuth keeps in touch with her family and her boyfriend Philip , a computer technician, using video chat.I haven#t seen him in a month, she says.Along with another nursing colleague, Ruth has moved into an Airbnb accommodation at Gray#s Hill in Bangor thanks to the generosity of the couple who own it.They#ve given us the use of their house completely rent-free which is amazing - it#s so kind, she says.The kindness we#ve been shown at the moment is immense - like every day there#s more things being sent off to us. We#ll keep laughing, saying we#ll be rolling out of here after coronavirus because people are feeding us so much.We#re getting pizzas and doughnuts, and a big coffee van was up the other day giving everyone free coffee and sandwiches and everything. People are donating hand creams because we#ve washed our hands until they#re cracking and bleeding - people are giving us everything.The toughest thing just at the moment is all the new training, Ruth says.They#re saying things are going to get a lot harder for us because obviously this disease is airborne, so it#s when we go into the big proper masks that it will be scary.You#re just aware that you can#t take them off, she says.It#s just the fear in people#s eyes because they#re not allowed any visitors. So it#s trying to comfort those people - they#re so unwell and scared, and they can#t have anyone in their family with them.All you can do is just try and be as kind and caring as you can, staying with them, explaining why it#s happening, why their family can#t come in, we#ll look after them the best we can. It#s just being there to hold their hands when they need it.Ruth pays tribute to all the staff who are doing their bit to combat the disease.It takes an army in here, she says.To move a single patient to the ward, the whole corridor has to close because obviously people can#t walk into the corridor when you#re moving - so the amount of porters it takes and then the whole area has to be cleaned after one patient moves. The amount of people it takes to move one person is crazy. And you couldn#t do it without everybody - the teamwork going on at the minute is amazing.I know the Down AE has closed, so the staff from the Down AE have just come up today to the Ulster. So that#s extra doctors and extra nurses coming up, which is great.Ruth says the whole thing is very scary but the key thing is to try to keep positive.It#s all going to be over soon hopefully andwe all just do as we#re told it will be over sooner rather than later, hopefully, and we#ll come out the other side, she says.It really does prove how great everybody is that works for the NHS, not just nurses. We#re being supported at the minute, but it really isn#t just us - it#s everybody. It#s amazing seeing everyone pulling together.The social workerSocial worker Maria McNamee , from Londonderry, has moved in with a friend in Castlefin, Donegal, because she is concerned about putting her partner Gareth at riskI live with my partner of  or  years - it#s just me and him, she says.He has two of the conditions that put him at a really high risk - he has type one diabetes and is on immunosuppressants for Crohn#s disease. Each one of those would have put him in the at-risk category but the two together complicate things a bit more.Over the weekend the couple discussed the risk and made the dficult decision that Maria should move out.Because I#m still working and I#m out and about in contact with people, we decided the risk was too high, she says.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseForced separation: Maria McNamee and partner Gareth FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappForced separation: Maria McNamee and partner GarethEven before I moved out we were practising a bit of social distancing at home - we had moved into separate rooms and we stayed in separate parts of the house.I really thought we could just continue to do that - we didn#t go out with friends, we didn#t have people calling.We genuinely thought this would have been OK but the more we learned about the virus and how it is transmitted, it was like a bang at the weekend.The dficult thing is not knowing how long it#s going to be for -someone said it would be for #X# amounts of weeks it would be easier, but it#s not knowing when I#m going back to my own environment Maria McNamee, social workerIt was a really tough thing to do and we just felt it had to be done.We made the decision over the weekend and I packed my bags and left for work on Monday morning, not toreally. The dficult thing is not knowing how long it#s going to be for -someone said it would be for #X# amounts of weeks it would be easier, but it#s not knowing when I#m going back to my own environment.It#s a bit hard for us doing it - I can#t even imagine what it#s likeyou have children.Maria has moved in with a friend in Castlefin and works from home quite a lot, but there are still days when she has to go to the office or carry out home visits.Even though the rest of my family are living locally I#m still not seeing them either, she says.As a social worker with the looked-after children service, much of Maria#s work involves visits to children, families and foster parents.We#ve stepped some of that down but we#re doing a lot of phone support and there are still children that we need to visit, she says.It#s a tough job, so when you don#t have your own home comforts around you and your own routine of what you do, it#s really tough.This is the start of it - it#s been okay and it#s a lovely place, but I can only imagine when you#re two, three, four weeks down the line, and that#s only the start of it.I think there#s a real sense of people getting on with it and you are having to dig deep - I think everybody is doing it. I am so lucky with what I have here - for others out there, it must be so hard for them.The paramedicParamedic Rab McCoy , from Coleraine, has moved into a BB to protect vulnerable family members from infection. He is married to Tanya and has two children, Robbieand Rachel It was really from a personal point of view - there were a couple of things, he says.It was a matter of timing for me, trying to gauge the timing for this curve that is talked about in the news.I realised early on that I couldn#t work from home.My we had had a couple of bouts of cancer and had undergone radiotherapy and chemotherapy and had her spleen removed, so it was a decision we talked about.

Rhys was told he could not leave for at least  days.This means he has been unable to take a seat on repatriation flights being arranged by the British and Irish governments.Rhys said he fears the quarantine will be extendedthere are any new cases.He called on both governments to negotiate his release with the Peruvian authorities.Rhys spends  hours a day in his room and is only allowed to leave for meals that he likens to prison food.We currently have the military on the door and the police are barricading the street at the other end, he said.We#ve been put on government rations, so the meals have taken a big hit. A couple of nights we haven#t had dinner. Guests have been told they could face a prison sentence of five to  yearsthey try to leave without permission.The announcement we got in the hostel is that the quarantine can be anything from  days to three months, Rhys said.Kate Harrison, the British Ambassador for Peru, said on Twitter it would be  days, but she#s had a huge backlash because she hasn#t claried what the  days means.From what we understand, it means  days from when a new case is reported. Two new cases were confirmed on Monday, so that#s another  days for us already.Originally, around  travellers were in the hostel, with around  from other countries securing flights home before the lockdown was announced.The other night the military stormed the hostel and basically had a list of people to bring to another hostel, Rhys said.No one knew what was going on, but they eventually told the hostel manager that  people had to pack their stuff and be disinfected.It was like a sci-fi movie where people are getting sprayed down. Their clothes were completely ruined because it wasn#t basic alcohol they were using to spray people.At the start people were happy and had that optimistic backpacker mentality. But when the two people tested positive and we had to go back to our rooms, guests started crying because it looked like we were going to be here for at least a month.A spokesperson for the UK Foreign office said: We continue to work around the clock to help British travellers struggling to get back to the UK and we thank the Peruvian government for all their support in making this happen.It is understood the Peruvian government has insisted the -day quarantine at the hostel cannot be overturned, but efforts to bring those affected home continue.Belfast Related ContentCoronavirusRussia confirms  new overnight cases as it ramps up testing capacity by over %Russia registered  new confirmed cases of coronavirus overnight yesterday in the steepest rise on record.

At first it may have seemed a bit like we needed to plan for the kids asit were a school holiday, but the level of social distancing required has meant that few of the things we normally do during holiday times are feasible. The fact that we must currently forbid social gatherings for our children may also be provoking some nervousness for parents, as we worry that all of this isolation may impact on our children#s sociability and the social and emotional development that is usually promoted by hanging out with, and playing with, their friends.Evenwe arrange to go for walks and come across other families we know, we have to keep at a distance that prevents the usual running around, hugging, tumbling, or horseplay that might occur in their play together. So, in their play, they won#t have any of the usual physical closeness that they might have enjoyed with friends.There is no doubt that the next whilewill be testing for children as they will miss out on lots of social interaction with their peers that they would normally have had. No birthday parties, no sleepovers, no playdates, no knocking for friends, no organised sports. It feels like a very signicant loss.I never thought I#d see myself write this, but suddenly technology and social media has real value for our social communication. While it is a dferent form of social connection, it does now play an increasingly important role in allowing our children and teenagers to stay in touch with friends, while maintaining the social distance needed to slow the spread of Covid-.While there is no doubt that this new social etiquette will impact on how we and our children can physically connect with our friends and extended family, the social distancing that we must practise, doesn#t have to lead to an emotional distancing or disrupt children#s emotional development.It is still really important, unless you are feeling unwell or need to socially isolate , that we maintain physical closeness in our families. Our children still need a loving touch from their parents. They need hugs, foot rubs and cuddles. Touch is such an important part of our social experience that our children cannot do without it for months. While our children may not be able to play with their friends, we can still promote their emotional development. In fact,we are all thrown together at home for extended periods there is more opportunity than ever to help children to learn about their feelings, to express those feelings and to process them healthily.Empathy is the mechanism by which we help children to develop emotionally. Le will provide children with the experiences that will provoke emotions. Our job is to help them to make sense of those emotions. The best way to understand what I am talking about might be for me to explain using an example. Let#s imagine you have a nine-year-old son, who is, by now, bored with being at home, restless, and perhaps cross that he can#t meet his friends. If he comes to you pleading, again, to be allowed to at least meet his friend just for a few minutes, many of us may have lost patience and may end snapping back at him, that he just can#t and to stop moaning, stop asking, let it go. While this is a natural response to our own frustration and stress of trying to manage the strange circumstances we find ourselves in, it does little to help our son deal with his feelings.If we can manage to regulate our frustration, a better response is to say something like: You sound really desperate to be able to see your friend. I#m guessing it is really disappointing that we have to keep apart from people we want to spend time with. You may be really cross that this virus seems to be spoiling our lives.There are a few things to notice about this response. The first is that we haven#t asked any questions about his feelings. This is because he is only nine and so he may feel put on the spotwe ask questions. If he doesn#t know how he feels, he may actually get more frustrated by being probed, since he will experience the social expectation that he should reply.Secondly, we don#t assume to know how our son is feeling. We are just guessing how he feels. So the you sound desperate... and you may be really cross... are phrased as statements and, importantly, they leave room for us to be wrong.A third thing to notice is that the statements don#t try to fix the problem created by social distancing, they simply recognise and help the child to identy, more accurately, the feelings it may create. A fourth thing you may have spotted is that the phrasing not only tries to guess at his feelings, but it also tries to guess at what may be generating those feelings . Sometimes we can be reluctant to do this, fearing that we may put ideas in their heads. However, we usually are very attuned to our children andthe thoughts are likely to be there already then it is very helpful for us, adults, to name those thoughts and feelings. If we are wrong, children still value the fact that we are trying to understand and may then be able to verbalise their actual feelings or thoughts, knowing that we have opened the door to these kinds of important conversations.There are no easy solutions to the problems or frustrations that our new way of interacting creates. But helping children to understand and voice their feelings will also help them to develop socially and emotionally.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Three days later, Corona Girl was finished and last Sunday we posted her on Facebook asking people to make bids through private message through the Zebra collectables Facebook page or telephone and whoever has bid the most by Sunday, April , will get her. We will use the money to get PPE to local places - some of whom have little or nothing and while this might not be as much as they need, it will be better than nothing.We will courier Corona Girl to whoever ends up getting her and because it has been nished she can be wiped down and disinfected.Mr Patterson saidCorona Girl garners plenty of interest he will consider making a Corona Boy that he will also auction off.He said: It is just my we and myself here now and she is keeping herself busy making hospital scrubs on her sewing machine so we are like the rest of the country - we are trying to do whatever we can to help those that need it.Belfast Most ReadArrest after disturbance at Belfast shopDUP MLA claims republicans are intimidating businesses into coronavirus closure Famous Northern Ireland faces share photos from past as part of latest social media crazeDetectives investigating ferry bomb plot seize vehicle, phones and clothingFamily-owned Newry business thank public for #uplting# support after armed robbery,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

In addition, % of symptomatic cases would adhere to case isolation.

The modelling team authors emphasise that the work is not a prediction or forecast, rather a model for planning purposes and also state: “It is assumed that current restrictions remain in place for the foreseeable future. When the current restrictions are relaxed, there will be a second wave. Future modelling will focus on the size and shape of this depending on how when restrictions are relaxed or re-introduced.

The Foyle MLA said:Many Northern Ireland businesses are struggling to survive the coronavirus pandemic. The British government put in place emergency measures, which should assist them. These measures are welcome, however many businesses are coming to me and saying that they are having serious dficulty in accessing these schemes in the way they are supposed to operate.” I have written to Economy Minister, DianeDoddsMLA asking her to press the UK government to urgently stress to banks across theUK that they must do more to enable local businesses to access the funds they need. Many businesses will struggle to survive this pandemicwe do not act quickly. We are dealing with a health emergency, but it is fast becoming an economic emergency.” googletag.cmd.push In the letter, the Foyle MLA says she received representations from several businesses in recent days, who have expressed concern at the responses from banks in Northern Irelandregardingthe operation of UK government support schemes.Those concerns include banks tellingbusinesses they can only access the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Schemethey fail to meet criteria for a loan from that bank under normal lending terms, which may be signicantly more expensive and which the business may not wish to engage in. A number of banks have told businesses they are not engaging in the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme, or are only doing so for sums much less than the poundm maximum specied by the government. googletag.cmd.push Many businesses are too large to access the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme, but not large enough to access the Bank of England scheme for larger companies. Some banks are only considering applications under the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme from existing customers. In addition, businesses - and homeowners with mortgages - who are being given holidays on loan repayments, but no extension on theof term of the repayment, are finding they are faced by higher monthly repayments at the end of the crisis, when they are still likely to be struggling financially.We believe that these are systemic problems with the government’s measures of support, which need to be addressed by the UK government with participating banks and building societies. It is our understanding that these problems are not unique to Northern Ireland and are the same for businesses operating in Great Britain, the SDLP representative added.Indeed, Lord Leigh of Hurley has made similar points in relation to the attitude of banks in Great Britain. He has issued a statement saying:“I am hearing that the banks are being very uncooperative. They have been seeking personal guarantees, although some have now relented. I have heard of one bank who told a customer that although their turnover was below poundm they had more than  employees and were therefore ineligible. Likewisestart upsand new tech companies will never get it as they have no profit history, indeed some no revenue yet!Clearly the banks are not keen on these loans. They would rather encourage customers to take a regular product, on which of course they can charge fees as opposed to the CBLS.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

cook everything, not just heating beans in a microwave or a boiling an egg but proper gravy with stock and cornflour.So wondering what to do with your children this week. … there’s your answer.Mum also said that meal times were much more family times, when everyone would come together, sit together and talk, sounds great to me.We are all so busy now that I wonder, when did you last sit at the table together and talk - so another good point.What about home grown food too - we used to eat a lot of this but as le has got busier this skill seems to have faded away, is this the perfect time to order seeds or shoots to plant and grow potatoes, peas, beetroot, onions, peppers or tomatoes  I remember my mum teaching me the games she used to play, so why not teach your children too - great excuse to turn the TV or computer off and play.What about Pick Up Sticks, Cat’s Cradle, Marbles, Jacks, Dominos and Cascading Dominos, or card games such as Chase The Ace, Cheat or the Matching Memory Game or even building with the cards.For outside, what about Hop Scotch, skipping rhymes and games with a skipping rope or two tennis balls against a wall - A Sailor Went To See See See, To See What He Could See, See See .. the song went on and you had to do the actions whilst still throwing and catching the two balls.Or another, sing “Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, next door neighbour carry on” and your friend would move in catching and throwing the balls without breaking the rhythm.Or try clapping games together like Say Say My Playmate.Or making obstacle courses or dens - children of any age love dens especiallythey can have lunch in there too.And do you remember making perfume from flower petals or paper mache Or on wet days what about learning to knit, or do knitting dolly, sew, crochet or even try tongue twisters, Betty Botter bought some butter but she said this butters bitter,I put it in my batter it will make my batter bitter, so she bought a bit of butter better than the bitter butter and she put it in her batter and her batter was not bitter, so twas better Betty Botter bought a bit of better butter .Don’t forget the board games too like Cludo or Mouse Trap, Ludo or Snakes And Ladders - maybe you could make the boards yourselves too!In the olden days we used to write to each other too - not email, text, Facebook, Snapchat or Instagram!So why not encourage, or help, your child to discover the enjoyment of writing and receiving letters They could write about the fun you’ve been having whilst you are offand maybe include a picture they’ve done, then pop it in the post to their friends, grandparents or other family members We used to get pocket money for ‘jobs’ we did too - not just pocket money for the sake of it!Maybe your children could earn pocket moneyby washing the car, fence painting or weeding .So the ‘olden days’ sound like they had a lot to offer, they’ve also got your history too, why not investigate and create a family tree or look up what used to be in your area - what did it look like a  years ago, what did schools and homes look like and transport too, what did people do for fun, apart from the above of course.In doing and enjoying all these ‘olden day’ activities maybe you’ll inspire your child with a love of history, a love of finding out, a love of baking, cooking, gardening and maybe, most importantly of all, a love of being in a family where people talk and play and enjoying being together.P.S. in the olden days many people would have just put baby in a pram in the garden - don’t do this.And young toddlers and young children were cared for and played with by older children and teenagers - do do this and have some peace!Have a safe and healthy week everyone x. googletag.cmd.push Written by, on Facebook, Me  You @meandyoubyjenni to support the Greater Shantallow Talking To Our Babies, Greater Shantallow Area Partnership.

In addition to Colum Cille’s own foundations at Derry and Durrow, these monasteries all looked to Iona as their leader.They adhered to the traditions of the Irish church.These Columban monasteries played a leading role in the expansion of Christianity they converted the Picts and restored Christianity to Anglo-Saxon Northumbria in the th century.In the second half of the th century Iona was at the height of its prestige – the laws of Colum Cille held sway in Ireland, with the abbots of Iona making frequent trips there.This period of Columban expansion resulted in the appearance of two art forms to Irish monasteries namely, high crosses and illuminated manuscripts.The fusion of Irish techniques of timber construction and Northumbrian skills in stone carving resulted in the appearance of highly decorated standing crosses in Irish monasteries from the second half of the th century.These elaborate high crosses with the wheel head design, in which a circle surrounded the point of intersection, developed from the earlier simple pillar stones of the th century on which crosses were incised.In the monastery at Derry there would now have appeared intricate high crosses on which scenes from the Bible were sculptured.The purpose of the crosses ied. Some marked burials, others signied a boundary of some sort, while others acted as focuses of prayer.Distinctive manuscripts on parchment were now being produced in Columban monasteries.Sometime between  and  the Book of Kells, a brilliantly illuminated copy of the four gospels with Latin text, known as “the Great Gospel of Columkille”, was written.Its precise origin is unknown not every monastery could produce such highly decorated and, at the same time, legible and correct copies of gospels written in Latin.Undoubtedly it was written in a Columban monastery, as they were famed for their teaching of Latin and the classics and for the skills of their craftsmen and artists.It was unlikely to have been written in Derry, as the team of scribes and artists required to produce such a masterpiece probably only existed at the monastic centre of the Columban confederation, which was Iona to  and subsequently Kells in central Ireland.The contents of the th century library and scriptorium at Derry have not survived.Colum Cille, according to the Annals of Clonmacnoise, wrote  books, all copies of the New Testaments. Copies were left with each of his churches, which, of course, included Derry.The earliest surviving decorated Irish manuscript is the Cathach or Battle Book, a copy of the psalms, which according to tradition was written by Colum Cille towards the end of the th century.It was handed down in the family of Conall Gulban, i.e. Colum Cille’s kin, and it was always carried three times round the army to ensure victory before they went into battle.Illumination in this manuscript was confined to the fine large capital letters at the beginning of each psalm.With the Book of Durrow, a copy of the four gospels written in the mid-th century, an Irish style had emerged in which at the beginning of each gospel there was on the left a full ornamented page, brilliantly coloured, with intricate designs of spirals and interlocking animals and plants while on the right there was an introductory page beginning with a large, beautully proportioned, capital letter. In addition, portraits or symbols were used to depict each of the four evangelists.The Book of Kells marked the pinnacle of Irish achievement in manuscript production, with its profusion of illustration, colour and ornamentation, and its repeated use of the same symbols for the four evangelists a man for Matthew, a lion for Mark, a calf for Luke and an eagle for John.By the end of the th century the monastic settlement at Derry would have changed little.The monastic complex would still have been made of timber.The only new physical feature would have been the erection of a few high stone crosses.The scriptorium may have begun to produce some basic illuminated manuscripts, similar to the Cathach. It would, of course, have continued to make straight copies of the psalms and gospels.In  a fleet of ships, the like of which had never been seen before, sailed up Lough Foyle.These ships, built of oak, some over  feet long and  feet wide, and steered by a rudder paddle, were powered by both oar and sail.From  feet pine masts fluttered square sails of double-thickness strips of red and white woven cloth, and, from behind rows of shields slung over the side, men, up to  on each boat, pulled on narrow-bladed spruce oars and manoeuvred the boats into the sheltered waters of the River Foyle.They beached their boats, which drew only three feet of water, on the shore beneath the monastery.From the boats men rushed up the hill, the leaders wearing protective coats of mail and helmets with a nose piece which projected down over the face the rest, following close behind, in thick woollen coats which reached half way down their thighs.They all carried a round wooden shield, many of which were painted either yellow or black.The long, broad, two-edged iron sword and the long-handled, broad-edged battle axe were the principal weapons they carried.Some were armed with spears, others with bow and arrows. Most had an iron kne, with a wood or bone handle, tucked in their belts.The Vikings had located the monastic settlement at Derry, and, as where in Ireland and Britain, they met no organised resistance.They burnt the abbey and massacred her clergy and students.Not only was the monastery an easy target to attack because of its secluded, yet very accessible, location, it was also a very rewarding one.Derry was a centre of wealth, rich in lands and livestock.The Vikings were interested in food provisions, to sustain further voyages, as well as in the precious metal ornaments associated with a monastery.They were also interested in taking prisoners, especially girls, as they had been trading in human slaves to central Europe for centuries.The Vikings never attempted to settle in Derry.In  they again attacked, but this time they were driven back, with great losses, by Niall Caille, King of Ireland and Murchadh, Prince of Aileach.Derry continued to be attractive to Viking invaders throughout the th century.In  the shrine of Colum Cille was carried away by the Vikings. In  and  she was again plundered.Derry’s long-term growth did not suffer because of the Viking raids,anything it increased.With the Viking raids on Iona in ,  and , the monks acquired a site at Kells in central Ireland, and, bearing the relics of Colum Cille, moved there to found a new monastery.There was a steady rise in the status and importance of Derry from , as she succeeded Iona and then Kells as the centre of all Columban foundations in Ireland and Scotland.By the end of the th century Derry was known as Doire Columcille, as opposed to Doire Calgach.This Viking period resulted in two new additions to the monastery at Derry: her first stone church and a round tower.Sometime after the first raid in , the wooden church, which the Vikings burnt, was replaced with a stone one.It would have been a simple building, similar in shape to its wooden predecessors.This stone single-chamber church, later known as Dubh Regles or Black Abbey church, was perhaps no longer than  feet.It probably had one narrow slit for a window, and was roofed with stone to simulate overlapping tiles. Housing for the monks and their tenant farmers was still made of the traditional wood and wattle combination.Sometime between the end of the th century and the beginning of the th century, a round tower of stone was built next to the Black Abbey church to serve a iety of purposes, such as a belfry, a watch tower and a place of refuge.Perhaps  feet high and  feet in diameter, with five floors, each lit by one window except the top which had four, entrance was gained,  feet above ground level, by a movable ladder.Inside, each wooden floor was linked by a wooden staircase. If set on fire this tower would have been a death trap, as the up-draught working on ignited wooden floors would have created an inferno.By the turn of the th century Derry was beginning to see a revival in its fortunes as an important monastic town.Apart from the additions of elaborate stone crosses, a small dry-stone church and a round tower, Derry was still very similar to the settlement founded in . googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It was a spell of pretty ruthless football from the Oakleafers, although had Mark Lynch had another half second to get the ball to his foot, his close range effort might not have been smothered by Paddy O’Shea. Still, with seven minutes to go to the half, Damian Cassidy’s side led by a point and were capitalising on a lot of Cork errors. googletag.cmd.push Without Patsy Bradley, Derry lost the kick-out battle and soon Cork were back in the game again. Cork led by threeat the interval, and maintained a similar degree of comfort until the latter stages. But when Raymond Wilkinson and Paddy Bradley pointed to leave Derry just a point behind going into injury time, they just needed a little bit of composure. Charlie Kielt and Mark Lynch kicked a wide each before Paul Kerrigan just booted the ball over the line to allow Marty Duffy to call time and see the Munstermen home with a rare two points from Ulster.

Minister Mallon said: “Just yesterday I confirmed MOT test centres would no longer be carrying out tests and that all vehicles eligible would be issued with a temporary exemption certicate . However, this could not be applied to four year old cars and taxis due to legal requirements. “I am pleased to confirm that following signicant work by my officials, I am now able to put arrangements in place to ensure four year old cars can get back on the road,given the ongoing health advice, the journey to be made is essential. googletag.cmd.push “From tomorrow, four year old cars will be given a TEC for six months from the date that their MOT test should have been due. This will allow the vehicle to be taxed and driven on the road. Issuing the certicates will take some time but the exemption will automatically apply from the due date. “The PSNI has agreed to our request that given these exceptional circumstances, where PSNI detects a vehicle without a valid MOT certicate, it will in suitable cases, exercise its discretion under the law, in circumstances where there is no identied risk to public safety. It is important that drivers realise that they are responsible under the law for the roadworthiness of their vehicle at all times.” googletag.cmd.push The Minister continued that she and officials are continuing to urgently explore options to support taxis at this dficult time. “For taxis which require PSV tests, new regulation and legislation needs to be put in place to allow the legal issuing of Temporary Exemption Certicates and,despite best efforts, this is taking longer to resolve. However, I want to reassure taxi drivers that we are working urgently on options to help them at this dficult time. I recognise the taxi industry is being hard hit by this public health and economic crisis. I also am working with Executive colleagues and pushing hard for more support from the UK Government for the self-employed. Protecting drivers and the public from the serious impact of COVID- is my priority.” Alastair Ross, Head of Public Policy for Northern Ireland at the Association of British Insurers, said: “Insurers recognise that this is worrying time for everyone and will take a pragmatic view. They will not penalise customers for something that is entirely out of their control and where motorists with an MOT exemption certicate request a quote, they will not be prejudiced by their lack of a valid MOT certicate. This applies regardless of whether they wish to renew with their existing insurance provider or are looking to take out a policy with a dferent insurer. “Insurers do, however, expect that motorists comply with their legal obligation to keep their vehicle in a roadworthy conditionthey are driving it. Those affected by the ongoing MOT testing suspension should continue to service their vehicle and carry out basic checks such as looking out for brake wear, ensuring that all lights are working and that windscreen liquid and oil are at the correct levels.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It’s just a way of trying to help people out. “ The rapidly moving situation has caused confusion in all schools across the UK but John says the school have been supportive, especially with him being away from home. “I was worried about trying to get home at Easter to see family but the school I’m in have been brilliant, they’ve advised us as much as we can. “No one really knew what was going on. It’s been hectic because you’re trying to get things ready for the children in school as well and then you didn’t knowit was closing or not. googletag.cmd.push “It’s really dficult because even the headteachers don’t know what’s going on. It’s important that parents understand that schools are doing their best to react too.” Any parents interested in John’s resources can get in touch through his Facebook page John Wade Primary Tutoring.

Vincent Rainey, from Dunloy, Co Antrim, began hosting the quizzes from his Facebook page last week, with much of the country already in self-imposed lockdown. The mortgage advisor says the idea stemmed from a throwaway comment while enjoying a glass of wine with his family to relieve the boredom of lockdown. He said: “Catherine, Lauren and I were having a chat over a glass of wine. “Quizzes are my hobby and I just had this random notion about doing a live broadcast, which I’d never done before.” googletag.cmd.push Engagement was central in Vincent’s thinking when building the idea. He wanted to ensure that those living in isolation, particularly those living alone, had access to some interaction. He said: “A lot of people are on their own and I want to try and make sure that they are socially involved, particularly those people who are really on their own. “It’s about figuring out ways for people to communicate with their friends and family, so they are not isolated.” The quiz was launched on Saturday, March  and over  people tuned into the online broadcast, but Vincent says he had a bit of homework to do before he got going. googletag.cmd.push “I YouTubed it,” he admits. “I have loads of content, having done this for a number of years, but I’d never done a live feed, so I had to figure out even how to do that!” The Dunloy man says the experience of hosting an online quiz is a dferent experience for someone used to the more social environment of a pub or hall. “I was quite apprehensive doing it online for the first time,” he said. “In a pub, or on a stage, you can gauge your audience, so you knowthey’re engaged. You can tell by body language their level of interest. “The only way you can check online is through comments and reactions, but that’s good because you want to know you’re not making a complete ass of yourself!” Watching along in another room in the house is Vincent’s we Catherine and daughter Lauren, and with the help of technology, son Josh joins them from Canada. “We just go into a dferent room and it all works well,” said Catherine. “Our son lives in Winnipeg, Canada and got in touch through Facebook Messenger. On one phone we had the quiz coming up and on the other we had a live chat open with Josh. “That conversation makes things much easier and much more satisfying. You can see the other person’s face and engage. The quiz’s reach is growing steadily, with Saturday night engaging over  eager participants, and Vincent is beginning to reach a global audience from his kitchen. He said: “I saw messages from New York, Houston in Texas and there was someone  joining in from Chicago, so there is beginning to be an international feel.” You can increase the Derry contingent by getting involved.

Caitriacuteona Lagan, from Castledawson, won the U All-Ireland mandolin title at the  Fleadh in Drogheda and is usually found playing at a session every weekend. Due to the measures in place to curb the spread of coronavirus, however, she has ploughed her efforts into performing online and sharing much-needed positivity. Caitriacuteona told the County Derry Post that it was vital to keep people’s spirits up at this time. She said: “I think it’s very important to keep playing because it can cheer people up and help them to take their minds off things. It makes them feel better. googletag.cmd.push “It’s nice to keep children happy and, instead of all the technology, give them something  to do as well.” The -year-old recently posted a video of her playing a few tunes for the children of Kilronan Special School in Magherafelt. Her mother, Roisiacuten, said Caitriacuteona had a great fondness for the children at Kilronan, having held charity events and performed there before. She said: “After she won the All-Ireland, we didn’t really get a chance to play any events, so for her th birthday she wanted to have a big session. “We don’t have any connections with Kilronan or anything, but she had met a few children at sessions who went to it. googletag.cmd.push “She did a charity night and then was invited up to the school and the summer scheme, so she’s been up and they know her. “She decided, in order to keep her practice up, she would share some videos online. It’s a good way for her to practise and it’s good for her confidence too. One thing that Caitriacuteona will miss out on this year is the annual series of Fleadhanna – county, provincial and All-Ireland – which have had to be cancelled due to the coronavirus. She said: “I’m a wee bit disappointed because I love going to the festivals because the atmosphere is so good at them. “I’m using the time to catch up with my schoolwork, take my dogs for a walkI can, do a wee bit of painting, bake at some point, practise my music. “I play a few dferent instruments – banjo, mandolin, fiddle, guitar and piano.” Caitriacuteona’s mum Roisiacuten said that social media has been a godsend for the music community during this time. “At the minute it’s the only way people are able to connect. A lot of Caitriacuteona’s friends would be in the music scene, and she would be at sessions every week, so she’s missing that. “With the Fleadh not being on this year, there’s going to be a massive gap. We normally plan our whole year around the fleadh, so the music is great for everyone to keep spirits up.” Caitriacuteona is certainly helping to keep spirits up, and Roisiacuten said a few children had already been in touch via social media. “A wee boy this morning sent her a rainbow, so hopefully they keep coming and keep children and adults occupied.” You can keep up to date with Caitriacuteona’s videos via her Twitter and Facebook accounts.

In recent days, the debate around essential services has been widely raised with no further clarity emerging for businesses and employees. Chief Executive of the Londonderry Chamber, Paul Clancy said: “The situation is getting more confusing by the day. We have had many businesses in the North West impacted because of this confusion. The supply chain to all essential services is broad and it incorporates a vast number of companies in many sectors. “Take for example the food supply chain. That does not just consist of places that produce foodstuffs, but there is also a huge supply chain supporting it from those that produce agricultural products, oil companies for heating and keeping lorries on roads, food labelling and packaging, to distribution. If one of these links is broken, it will have an impact on the end product we have on our supermarket shelves. googletag.cmd.push “We must stop demonising businesses for trying to keep essential work going during this crisis and instead work with them to ensure they can keep the business going, whilst also ensuring the safety of employees. “Maintaining essential supplies will protect public confidence that we can feed the nation whilst everyone  is told to stay at home and fight this virus. “We urge the Executive to show leadership and work effectively with businesses and workers to outline what are essential businesses. The establishment of a forum on workplace safety is welcome but we need to see decisions and guidance. With every day that passes, more essential businesses are forced to close.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Letrsquos look out for each other in these turbulent times.Cllr McMurray mdash who spoke ahead of Mondayrsquos ban on access to Tyrella beach mdash said that last weekend he had been ldquoinundated with messages and calls regarding the number of people attending local forest parks.ldquoUnfortunately, it appears that the general population is not adhering to the advice in relation to social distancing and I would suggest that they are nearly treating this crisis as a national holiday.I will be reviewing access to our forest parks with party leaders and senior management team, he said.ldquoWe have been pushing a lot of advice and guidance with regard to the need for social distancing but it is not resting with the population. It is so dficult to balance the need to allow people the space to walk to protect mental and health and well-being, but we ask that the public refer to guidelines set out by public health officials to do so safely.Cllr Lewis said the closure of leisure centres, play areas, council-owned facilities and schools across this district had been done for peoplersquos safety.ldquoI appeal to people to recognise why these areas are closed, he continued. ldquoPlay parks and sporting facilities should not be used. It is imperative that we recognise and accept the seriousness of this illness. It simply cannot be business as usual, we must heed all relevant medical advice.Cllr Lewis added: ldquoThis is for our own safety, while also protecting the integrity of our health service and those vital, dedicated experienced staff who support it. Newry, Mourne and Down Council has taken extreme measures and please respect these steps. This isnrsquot a holiday and itrsquos not a jolly. We are protecting le.Cllr Gallagher said it was vital that everyone in the community ensures that social isolation is adhered to, highlighting the need to reduce the risk.He added: ldquoThe elderly and those with predisposed health conditions need to keep their distance and follow public health guidelines. Remain at homepossible and get someone to do your shopping. Family units are important. People must not allow others into their home and visits that are not essential must stopCllr Howell said that last week the Education Minister finally declared that schools would close to help prevent the spread of COVID-, highlighting the huge responsibility on parents to ensure that not just children are safe, but so are those they are in contact with.She added: ldquoUnfortunately, some young people think that this is the start of their summer holidays and they are free to continue with no worries or concerns. I am appealing to parents to inform their children about social distancing and the importance of adhering to the public health guidelines.ldquoIf your teenager goes out can you be confident that they will observe the required social distancing of two metres  Many of them donrsquot have the willpower to practice what is being advised.ldquoAs a parent I know only too well how hard it is to keep teenagers from going out, but we need to set the example to our children. If these social distancing rules are not adhered to, they will come home and unknowingly pass the virus to others, perhaps family members with underlying health issues or aged grandparents..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/25th March 2020 Pretend.jpg","title":"‘Pretend cough’ over credit union worker  ","story":"POLICE will be contacted after a saver in Downpatrick Credit Union ldquopretend coughed at a staff member last week during the coronavirus outbreak, it has been revealed.Mary Cullen, chair of Downpatrick Credit Union, warned that it was now operating a ldquozero tolerance policy as incidents of verbal abuse to staff increased during reduced opening hours.She said the credit union, which is situated in Market Street, had been inundated with messages of support after she posted a warning post on Facebook last Friday where she asked members to respect everyonersquos boundaries regarding social distancing and to accept the new reduced hours cover.She said a member of the public verbally abused a member of staff before ldquopretend coughing at them.ldquoThis particular incident is not acceptable and going forward, unfortunately, Members who cannot be courteous to our staff will not be served, said Mary in her post.ldquoWe are in a very dangerous time and are doing the best that we can. We are very lucky to have an amazing team at DCU, letrsquos appreciate and respect them as they try to continue to provide a service to members.ldquoThe support for my staff has been phenomenal. Members have contacted me to express their sadness and disgust that anyone could behave in such a manner.One shocked local person commented: ldquoWhat is actually wrong with people being totally ignorant to what is happening.Several people called for the person to be banned from the credit union.Mary said that the staff had to adopt themselves to the changed methods of operation and service in the public health crisis.ldquoWe have had a fair amount of verbal abuse since implementing restrictions on the number of people in the banking hall at any one time and staff have been working tirelessly to ensure a safe environment for all by encouraging social distancing, she explained. ldquoWe will continue to monitor member activity and behaviour and have a zero tolerance policy now in place.However, she warned: ldquoAny member who does not respect the boundaries in place or who proceeds to abuse staff will be asked to leave the building, I have told the staff that the Board support them ,% and continue to do so.ldquoI will be making contact with the member and we will be pursuing this matter through the PSNI.The credit union is from .am to .pm on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday and from .am-pm on Saturday.

If people did go out, they were advised to keep two metres apart.Council officials say the latest closures are part of the organisationrsquos ongoing coronavirus response and that the decision will be reviewed on an ongoing basis in line with Public Health Agencyguidance.Last week, council officials had decided to keep Tyrella beach and Delamont Country Park open and had agreed to waive the entrance fee to both facilities. But there was a dramatic U-turn on Monday when these two popular facilities also went into lockdown.Across the district a range of community events have been cancelled with last Sundayrsquos horse race meeting at Downpatrick taking place behind closed doors, with spectators locked out.The local authority want people to obey self-distancing requirements with its decision to close Tyrella beach and Delamont Country Park further evidence of its concern about people spreading the virus.It is clear that both facilities have now been placed in the ldquohigh risk category alongside the districtrsquos leisure and community centres.

That’s a good direction of travel.”He said “travelling long distances to go for your daily exercise is not essential and therefore you shouldn’t be doing it”.When it was put to him that the actual wording of the regulations do not permit him to enforce that, ACC Todd said: “It depends on how you read the legislation...on one reading of it, no you shouldn’t under the law be travelling distances in order to take your exercise”.But he said the police did not want to get involved with the “fine minutiae”.He said he was concerned thatmany people do turn up to beauty spots, then “police have to step in to prevent crowds gathering” .PSNI headquarters later went on to say: “There is no confusion on the part of police.

Performance of the Oberammergau Passion Play : Freelance“The nd Oberammergau Passion Play will be postponed due to the current situation caused by the corona pandemic.”In the Baian district of Germany, beside the Ammer River and framed by the Ammergau Alps, Oberammergau is a small town known for its woodcarvings, its NATO School and its internationally renowned -yearly Passion Play.The organisers of the Passion Play summarised the historical signicance of the postponement, explaining that the event “goes back to a vow made in . At that time, the people of Oberammergau vowed to perform the suffering, death and resurrection of Christ,no one died of the plague anymore.Engraving depicting the Passion Play in  : Freelance \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Therefore the plans to perform the Passion Play in  are currently beginning.”Held in the ‘decimal year’I attended a performance in , one of the most vivid and moving experiences of my letime, and indeed, I had toyed with the thought of ing this year.There would have been  performancesstarting in mid-May with an expected , visitors from around the globe paying between € to € for a ticket.The enormous production has been running since  except for two cancellations and a postponement.Crucixion scene in the Passion Play in  : FreelanceNearly half of the , residents of today’s Oberammergau are involved with the show - actors, musicians, front of house, backstage and looking after the horses, sheep, goats, cows and doves that add to the often intensely dramatic scenes.The other half of the townsfolk run the restaurants, shops, hotels, BBs and farmsteads where many of the visitors stay,they’re lucky.The nearest accommodation I could get in  was St. Anton am Arlberg in the Austrian Tirol.Participants in the production must have been born in Oberammergau or have lived there for  years.Oberammergau on the River Ammer in  : FreelanceIt’s not unusual for up to four generations of the same family to be taking part in the same run of plays, which can involve around  children on stage at the same time.In the th century, passion plays were held in many parts of Europe, often performed on carts in the street.They re-enacted Christ’s last days, from his entry into Jerusalem to his trial, crucixion, resurrection and ascension.In the bigger and more elaborate productions, when scene one ended the cart trundled off to another part of the town or city and scene two arrived, and so on!They were the ‘poor man’s Bible’ enabling even the most illiterate become familiar with Bible stories.But Oberammergau’s is the only play with its origins in a collective vow to God which has run, almost without a break, for approaching four centuries. This unique double-accolade brought the town a UNESCO World Heritage award.It’s quite likely that passion plays were already common events but a document in Oberammergau’s archives records “the first decades of the th century went by in peaceful calm…but then followed the Thirty Years’ War with all its hardships from  until . As early as , infectious diseases spread in Baia. This village was spared by dutul vigilance until the church festival in , when a man brought the plague into the village.”More than  local folk died and almost every family lost loved ones.“Faced with the great distress that the terrible illness inflicted upon the population,” the archive continues, “the leaders of the community came together and pledged to hold a passion tragedy once every ten years. From this day forward, not a single person perished, even though a great number of them still showed signs of the plague”.They made the pledge in  and the Passion Play was first performed at Pentecost in , on a wooden stage that some say was built on plague-victims’ graves near the church.Surviving documentation from the  production shows that the play ran ‘completed smoothly’ with seating provided ‘for spectators standing close by.’From  the date of the performance was changed to the beginning of each decade, by which time folk were coming from all over Germany to see substantial productions.Paint and painters for the  show’s scenery cost  guilders, ‘the gentlemen trumpeters’ got two guilders and  guilders went ‘to the actors for drink’!There was no performance in  when Maximilian III’s Clerical Council banned all passion plays and when another threat loomed in the s the so-called ‘mad’ King Ludwig II of Baia protected it from those who wanted to close down the ‘harmful’ passion plays. Following WWI the play was postponed until , and there was a special th anniversary show in  attended by Adolf Hitler.There were no performances in  during WWII, just the second cancellation…until now.Plans to perform the Passion Play in  are already under way, for over  five-hour shows, several thousand participants, a -strong orchestra and a -strong choir.\"\" for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from Belfast News LetterSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bYSBpT sc-elJkPf kHpvMx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Lurgan man Geoff Gates, who has created the Limitless weight loss programme, believes people shouldn’t use lockdown as an excuse to adopt a poor diet and exercise routine.He said: “The Limitless philosophy has always been that the only reason people get stuck in a rut is because of their limiting beliefs. If you feel good through proper nutrition and smart exercise, you will naturally be drawn towards better lestyle choices.”At times of great stress, for many diet often goes out the window. Geoff shared his advice on how to eat well during a crisis: “The issue here is we need to be not using food to combat stress but instead, tackle the stress head-on, that’s the first step. “I get all my clients to start practising meditation immediately. When I first suggest meditation to someone, they often wonderI’m joking or being serious. It’s not some hippy-dippy woo-woo thing, this is a proper prescription. They often report profound changes almost immediately.”Geoff said that having been overweight and depressed himself helped him to create Limitless: “There is gold in the depths of despair, and I count my experience as a blessing now. Without my personal struggle, I could never have developed the techniques to create the best weight loss programme in the world.”He said in terms of nutrition it was important to focus on quality food: “Broccoli is especially good for the lungs and its funny that it looks like a lung, just like walnuts a great for brain health they look like a little brain. As bizarre as this may sound, I believe our creator has provided us with clues.”Geoff said the current situation makes it even more important to make shopping lists, especially now that visits to the shops are meant to be limited. He commented: “There are always ways to make healthy food convenient food. We all own a freezer, so it’s just a matter of being a little bit smart and preparing ahead. “I advise my coaching clients to buy freezer bags then put all the ingredients together in the bag and use as and when they need them.”In terms of exercise he said: “I don’t think it’s been more relevant to use our time to focus on our health and fitness. The most used excuse I have heard continuously through my  years in the fitness industry was that people didn’t have time. Now we have an abundance of it. “So now you have plenty of time the next excuse will be that you don’t have the equipment. I refuse to hear it. “The simple truth is we don’t need gyms and never have needed them. The way I see it is the gyms have been a luxury, not a necessity. “The misconception is that you cannot get strong, fit and healthy without one – the truth being you can get the same results with just your good self, become your own gym.”He added: “If I was going to advise on one piece of home equipment it would be an adjustable set of dumbbells. He suggested a quickfire lockdown workout could include  bodyweight squats,  star jumps,  straight punches,  upper cuts,  push ups and  mountain climbers.He said those conscious of social distancing could exercise earlier to avoid encountering other people: “I have always got up at am to train so when I am out running in the morning, there is no one about. For me, being outside when no one is around is perfectly acceptable. We need fresh air.”\"\" for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from Belfast News LetterSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bYSBpT sc-elJkPf kHpvMx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Michael said: “People think, the music is dark and intense, they’re going to be really dark and intense.The band’s original line-up of Michael, Andy and Fyfe \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...“The most messed-up people I find are people in pop music. A lot of them are horrible twisted people with weird agendas and they become quite damaged iniduals. Then they go on stage everything is rosy.“It’s really the old cliche – never judge a book by its cover. With us the lyrics are kind of twisted, but there’s a big, dark sense of humour there.“We let off steam when we go on stage and jump up and down for  minutes. You tend to be pretty chilled afterwards.”When the band first got together in  lead singer and guitarist Andy Cairns was a pupil at Ballyclare High. Michael, who attended Larne Grammar with Fyfe Ewing , wasn’t present for the band’s first recording though he was there in spirit.On the front cover of metal magazine Kerrang! in He said: “Fyfe and I were in the same English class and would have traded records. He was in a band, I was in a band. “His band and Andy’s band had played a gig at Jordanstown Uni. They had more in common than they did with their own bands. “They did a demo together. I was there in spirit because Andy didn’t have a bass guitar so Fyfe asked me and I lent Andy my bass. Andy played it on the first demo.” Michael soon joined to play his own bass and things clicked from the start: “Our first gig was at Giro’s supporting Decadence Within. It went down really well, I was flabbergasted. “We weren’t trying to be U or Guns N’ Roses – those were the two big musical things at that time in , . I don’t mind U and I quite like Guns N’ Roses but we had our own little thing going on.“You kind of gravitated towards anyone who liked something that wasn’t Bryan Adams at school. In Larne where I grew up the metallers hung out with the goths, the goths hung out with the indie kids and you heard Joy Division, The Dead Kennedys and Slayer. We clung together as musical outsiders.”The friendship between Michael and Andy has extended more than  years: “I think I was  or  when Andy and I first met. When the first album came out I’d just turned . I’ll be  later this month.“One thing we did find quite early on is that we tend to be huffers. We got that out of our system. If you don’t like something you say then, you don’t leave it for six months and have a meltdown in the middle of eastern Europe.“There’s a lot of rock and rolls myths and stereotypes out there that people love. One of them I think which is not correct is that you need to have creative tension in a band. Maybe that’s works for one or two albums, but that burns itself out really quickly.“It’s really great working together as part of the band, what I get out of it is quite special, I think I’m very lucky.”Michael contrasted the crazy intensity when the band shared a house together in Belfast’s Holylandswith the situation now where they all live in dferent parts of the UK.He said: “I think there was one time me and Andy worked out over an -months period we’d been within  metres of each other every day with the exception of Christmas Day.“Now I live in Larne, Andy lives in Cambridge and Neilour drummer lives in Derby. When we meet up there’s lots of interesting stories and dferent experiences to share rather than walk down the main street in Larne going, ‘oh there’s the lads’.”On Fyfe, his original bandmate who left in , he said: “I haven’t spoken to him since he left. We have friends in common. He’s doing alright I believe. He moved to Brighton, he’s been there  years now. He’s had very little involvement in the music business.“It’s a real pity because he was such a great drummer, it’s just he couldn’t really get on with the lestyle. Somewhere down the line we’ll meet again.”Family man with attic of collectablesLast year Michael contributed a recipe to a celebrity cookbook to support his nephew Matthew who had been diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia.Michael said: “Matthew is doing well. The family is getting things back on track. It was a big thing, he’s still a bit traumatised as you’d expect but he’s doing well.”Of family le at home in Larne he said: “My we works full time soI’m at home I’m daddy day care. The only downside is when I’m away, I’m away   so there’s a whole dferent set of challenges for my we who’s an absolute saint.”Askedhis children, aged nine and five, were excited about their dad being in an band, he said: “They saw us at a big festival in Europe which was great because they were at the side of the stage and they were able to see , people from the other side. “They’re quite blasé about their dad being in a band. They’re not into music that much, they’re more into games, football and karate.”Michael went on to discuss some of the Therapy  treasure trovecontained in his attic: “I’ve got Fyfe’s original snare drum that he used on Babyteeth, the basses that I used on Troublegum. I’ve got a lot of the flyers, posters, tour passes and recordings and audio stuff I’ve kept over the years. The attic is a disaster area.”In the early days of Therapy  a pair of denim dungarees were Michael’s stagewear of choice. Askedstill had them, he said: “I actually do. I’m quite pleased that I’d still fit into them but I never wear them.“When we did the Troublegum shows a while ago there were some bets that they’d turn up again, but it didn’t happen for whatever reason. But never say never – right now I don’t think the world is ready for that.”Michael explained that there were in fact two pairs of his trademark dungarees, one of them he referred to as ‘the good pair’ then immediately burst out laughing.“Can you imagine denim dungarees after three weeks of touring ” he said. “It’s hard to find a -hour laundrette when you’re on the road. They were crunchy. I’m surprised they’re still in one piece.”Dates cancelled due to pandemicTherapy  have had to cancel some European tour dates later this month because of the coronavirus.Michael said: “We’ve had to cancel where the crowds would have been above ,, some of the big festivals we were really looking forward to. As it stands we’re still planning to play some of the smaller shows unless told otherwise. “It’s something that you just can’t account for. Gigs sometimes have to be cancelled because of illness or injury but this is beyond the band’s control. It’s a bit of a headmelt.”Touring major European cities is a far cry from the band’s gigging schedule in : “When we started there was the Warzone Collective in Belfast and Hope Promotions in Dublin. They worked in conjunction and would bring hardcore punk bands over like Fugazi and Concrete Sox. “We knew the Warzone people and that led to us being invited down to Dublin to play with the likes of Babes In Toyland. “They’d rent rooms above pubs for gigs, in Belfast they used the Art College and the Conor Hall. “We were quite lucky to get in at that DIY stage.”It’s okay not to be okayMuch is currently being done to raise awareness and funds for musicians suffering from mental health issues, particularly through Aware NI, PIPS and Help Musicians. As a band Therapy  have been tuned into the struggle from day one with many of Andy’s lyrics exploring the pressures that weigh on the human mind.Michael said: “It’s something that we’re all very aware of and very sympathetic towards. Being a young male in Northern Ireland there’s a bit of a ‘come on, man up’ vibe. That has been very damaging for a couple of generations now.“There is a rock and roll myth that everyone’s an all-singing, all-dancing, all-fighting gunslinger – you roll into town decimate it and move on. It’s not really like that.“I don’t think anyone hasn’t been touched by themselves or someone  who has had a mental health issue.“It’s such a fragile thing. It’s right there, there just seems not to be the widespread acknowledgement that it exists and for treatment. It’s so underfunded. It’s a real tragedy.”He added: “We’ve always had a lot of empathy, we take people as they are, we don’t have the answers, but we do try to let people know that it’s okay to not be okay. “Just talk about it, talk to your friends, talk to someone, reach out. Thankfully that stigma is moving away.“We’ve always been celebrating the outsiders – be yourself, do you own thing, what makes you happy, self preservation, looking after yourself.”Michael continued: “It’s one of these rock and roll myths that people want their musicians to be messed up and die young and leave a pretty corpse. “None of us subscribe to that at all.“We like to have a good time when we’re on tour, but doing it for so long there’s a massive element of self preservation.“It’s about doing a good gig. People don’t come and see you againyou’re stood there looking bored or hungover. It’s not pleasant for anyone – the player or the watcher.“We all feel a big responsibility to put on a good show. There’s people who have seen us  plus times.“We want every show to be as goodnot better than the last time.

The aim is that these virtues help to form them.With such a vast space at its disposal, the school ensures that children are given a rich and versatile experience.In the orchard, pupils pick fruit from pear, apple, plum, and damson trees which they use in cooking lessons during the autumn.They also grow  dferent kinds of fruit, salad, and vegetables in a polytunnel.Earlier this year, St Josephrsquos Primary was awarded a gold award in the UNICEF Rights Respecting School programme.The award is granted to schools which show a commitment to promoting childrenrsquos rights and raising awareness of these amongst young people.It recognises efforts to place the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child at the heart of a schoolrsquos policies and practice.ldquoAlongside our work on rights is the fact that we want our children to be aware of their responsibilities, said Mr Rein.ldquoYes, they have rights to be heard, but they also have a responsibility to listen to others.St Josephrsquos was the first school in Wales to develop a pupil parliament.Every child is a member of the parliament, and elected representatives from eight student groups form a cabinet which has decision-making powers.ldquoThe school parliament is a vehicle for the pupils to have a voice, so they can decide how the school can be a better place, how the local community can improve, and how we can help the UN to achieve their global goals, continued Mr Rein.ldquoSo the children are looking inward ndash at themselves and how the school environment can improve ndash and looking outward at how we can develop better links with the parishes and the areas of Penarth and Dinas Powys.ldquoOur Eco Ministry has been involved in a project to tidy beaches and pick up plastic, and our Healthy Schools and School Mission team have given food to local foodbanks.St Josephrsquos Primary is one of  innovation schools which have been chosen to contribute to the Welsh Governmentrsquos new curriculum framework, which will be rolled out to every school in Wales by . As part of the new framework, schools are required to design their own curriculum based upon the needs of specic learners, rather than adhering to a national learning program.St Josephrsquos curriculum is lsquoresearch-ledrsquo, meaning it is based on findings in child development and cognitive science.Teachers have undertaken training on how childrenrsquos bodies and minds develop, and lessons have been designed to enhance pupilsrsquo personal, social, and physical development.Mr Rein said: ldquoWe want our children to develop physically in terms of their gross motor skills, their fine motor skills, and their locomotion skills.ldquoWe have apparatus on which they can hang, climb, and swing, to build up their core strength.Mr Rein called the schoolrsquos curriculum lsquoreally ambitions.rsquoldquoWe are one of sixteen innovation schools in Wales helping to implement the new curriculum and develop special projects to do with the curriculum, he said.ldquoWe have taken that on by focusing on a knowledge-rich curriculum, so that we develop childrenrsquos knowledge, skills, and give them fantastic experiences.ldquoWe have taken good, rich materials from lots of dferent places, and developed some of our own, which we have implemented to a high standard.ldquoBehaviour in the school is exemplary partly because we have spent a long time asking what good teachers do.ldquoWe practice together as staff, so our teachers are working at a high level using a very well-researched curriculum.In last yearrsquos maths reasoning test,  per cent of pupils at St Josephrsquos scored higher than the national average, and  per cent of pupils scored above average in the National Reading TestldquoWersquore extremely proud of our achievements at St Josephrsquos, said Mr Rein.ldquoEverything we do is based on the best available research and is designed to help each inidual child thrive.The schoolrsquos curriculum has recently been praised by cabinet member for education and regeneration, Councillor Lis Burnett, who said St Josephrsquos had done a lsquobrilliant job.rsquoShe said: ldquoThe new Curriculum for Wales is inspiring schools to take a more holistic approach toward learning.ldquoIt encourages them to focus more on how and why the curriculum is being delivered, rather than delivering specic content and academic results.ldquoSt Josephrsquos have done a brilliant job in helping craft this approach, and in turn have seen their own curriculum and learning practices blossom. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It will cut planned capital spending to pound million from a budget of pound million and will work to grow online.MS said in a statement: \"Whilst we remain confident that the post-crisis future of the business and our transformation programme remains as strong as ever, trading over the next nine to  months in our clothing and home and international businesses is likely to be severely impacted.\"As a result, it is not possible to provide meaningful guidance on future earnings, although we are taking every step to secure future value for shareholders, colleagues and suppliers.\"The chairman of Wetherspoon has said that a decline in sales was accelerated when prime minister Boris Johnson told people to stay away from pubs.After rising in previous weeks, sales fell by . per cent in the week to March  and the slowdown has picked up further since the Prime Ministers statement, Tim Martin said.It came as the business reported profit before tax rose  per cent to pound. million in the half-year to January  on revenue of pound million.Health secretary Matt Hancock has warned that coronavirus will keep spreading as long as people continue to socialise.Speaking on talkRadio, Mr Hancock said: \"If you stay at home you are saving lives.\"I know, of course, this is a more dangerous disease for older people but not exclusively, some young people get it too.\"But, more importantly, the more that people continue to go out and continue to socialise, the more it will spread and the longer were going to have to keep these measures in place.\"So, were urging people to follow the public health advice.In the emergency Bill thats in front of Parliament right now, we are taking the powers to be able to enforce these measures, so we can make it happen by lawwe need to.\"Id rather not do that and the evidence so far is that the vast majority of people are following the advice, are doing what is sensible and right.\"The company said it was cancelling its interim idend, which had been p a year earlier.Mr Martin said: \"It is obviously very dficult to predict, in these circumstances, how events will unfold in future weeks and months, but we now anticipate profits being below market expectations, so long as the current health scare continues.\"As a result of this uncertainty, it is impossible to provide realistic guidance on our performance in the remainder of the financial year.\"The company has decided to delay most capital projects and to reduce expenditure, where possible, including the cancellation of the interim idend.\"As a result of these actions, combined with the Governments proposals on business rates relief and credit guarantee facilities, the company believes it has sufficient liquidity to maintain operations at a substantially lower level of sales.\"Nicola Sturgeon has urged anyone who left the medical profession in the past three years to consider ing to help the fight against coronavirus.Sharing a plea from Scotlands chief nursing officer Fiona McQueen, the First minister tweeted: \"Scotlands NHS needs our help to meet the #coronavirus challenge.\"Mr Hancock said some retired medics whoto work in the NHS to fight the coronavirus will be able to come \"straight back in\".Asked on the BBCs Breakfast programme when workers couldto the NHS, he said: \"Well, over the next couple of weeks because for some theyll have very recently left and they can come straight back in, their annual trainings been up-to-date and they can just restart.\"Imagineyouve left at Christmas, for instance, you can restart straight away. For others who have been out for a little bit longer, they may need more of a refresher because, of course, its vital that we keep people safe, thats the whole point of the NHS.\"So the letter will go out today, well then be engaging inidually with all those who respond and I very much hope that many, many thousands will respond.\"From those Ive talked to, I think people can see just how important this is. The training will happen for those who need it over the next couple of weeks, at the same time well allocate people to a hospital near them because theres a logistical exercise here as well.\"Mr Hancock suggested that tougher measures could have to be brought inpeople do not follow the Governments advice.He told the BBCs Breakfast programme: \"What I can say is thatpeople follow the advice, stay home which saves lives andthey keep apart from others, more than two metres, more than six foot, then we can tackle this and we can turn the tide.\"The scientists advise that we can turn the tide in  weekspeople follow the advice.\"If people dont follow the advice, then itll be longer and we might have to bring more and tougher measures.\"He added: \"We have brought these measures in earlier than Italy did in terms of where theyre up to with the number of cases.\"But were absolutely clear thatwe need to, we have the powers, in fact weve got a Bill in front of Parliament now to strengthen those powers further.\"But I think its far betterpeople follow the advice.\"The FTSE  has risen by more than five per cent in early trading as travel companies jump out ahead after a bruising few weeks for the sector sparked by the Covid- pandemic.Intercontinental Hotels jumped by about a fth despite revealing that demand for rooms was the worst it had ever seen, as markets opened on Friday.EasyJet also rose by around  per cent and cruise operator Carnival jumped by around . per cent.Meanwhile, the price of a barrel of Brent crude oil joined the rally, rising five per cent to . dollarsafter a massive fall earlier in the week.Shadow chancellor John McDonnell has warned about the prospect of a recessionpeople do not receive their wages.Labour has urged the Government to ensure the salaries of workers are protected as businesses lose trade during the coronavirus pandemic.He told the BBCs Breakfast programme: \"We need the Government now to act to protect people to keep them in their jobs.\"In that way, what well be able to do is ensure people have an income coming in, their job will be protected, but we prevent the second wave of a recession hitting uswere not careful.\"Becausepeople lose their jobs, they dont have their wages, demand collapses in the economy and then you really do have a recession.\"The lesson from past crises like these is act fast and act big, so thats why were saying the Government should step in and say to employers, well cover  per cent of your wages, you keep people in work.\"Demand for a room at Intercontinental Hotels has reached its lowest point in history, the group said, as the travel industry continues to be battered by the coronavirus pandemic.The business revealed that it would be cutting costs, eliminating its idend and reducing salaries in a bid to save cash.However, shares in the group, which have been badly hit in recent months, jumped by around  per cent on market open in London as investors reacted positively to the companys proposals.Chief executive Keith Barr said: \"Demand for hotels is currently at the lowest levels weve ever seen.Intercontinental Hotel Group has a robust business model and the measures we are announcing today to reduce costs and preserve cash give us the capacity to manage the business through this unique environment and to support our owners during this incredibly dficult time.\"These were not easy choices and we are mindful of the impact these decisions will have on our colleagues and shareholders.\"However, we believe that these are essential to ensuring that we come out of this as strong as we possibly can and ready to capitalise on what remains an industry with excellent long-term growth potential.\"Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders , said the list of key workers to whom schools will remain open is \"perhaps more extensive than we might have expected\".He said: \"Realistically, theywill need to identy these children by lunchtime.\"Mr Barton added: \"We already know from the trajectory of this that were not going to have many staff.\"We have to be careful that the message to parents is not business as usual.\"Matt Hancock said that a communication will be sent to around . million people who are classed as vulnerable to set out specic action for them to take.The Health secretary told Sky News: \"The first thing were going to do is set out exactly what conditions that applies to.\"We expect about . million people to then get a communication from the NHS to say that they are part of this and what they need to do.\"Many of these people have pre-existing health conditions and so will be very worried right now, and I understand that, and theyll need very specic sets of action - for instance, how do you go about still getting your chemoyou have cancer whilst also social-distancing \"If you have cancer its particularly important to stay away from other people, but you also of course have got to keep going with your chemotherapy.\"He added: \"These are some of the most dficult and challenging cases so well be getting in contact with them, butpeople think that they are on this list and dont receive a communication from the NHS, then they also need to get in contact.\"So that is under way, the money was announced for it yesterday.\"A combination of money to the NHS and money to councils because theyve got a very big part to play in keeping people safe.\"ASCL general secretary Geoff Barton said schools will have first worked to identy vulnerable children, as they will know who they are, and will then be looking at the \"key worker\" category.He said the ASCL is telling members: \"You have to do your best to negotiate the key workers list. Youre doing this to a tight timescale, and what you offer children on Monday may be dferent to what you offer next Wednesday.\"Mr Barton said that initially, schools will be doing all they can so that pupils who need to can still turn up to their own school after the weekend.In the longer term, there will be more strategic planning of school provision, he added.Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers , said: \"The Government has made clear that every child who can be safely cared for at home should be. And their advice makes clear too that this applies to children of key workers.\"For the vast majority of children and young people, school buildings will close tonight and not reopen for the foreseeable future.\"Taking up a place at school during this time of wider closure is the offer of last resort, for the minority of key workers, who have no alternative.\"School leaders have many questions that remain unanswered about how this will work in practice. We will continue to work with the Government throughout the day to provide greater clarity to schools to enable this reduced offer to be up and running as soon as possible.\"Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, added her voice to calls from school leaders urging parents to only send their children in as a last resort.She said: \"This is a very long list and could result in some schools having the majority of pupils attending. This will not achieve the goal of slowing the spread of the virus.\"So it is vitally important that parents follow government advice to keep their children at home, wherever possible. Schools can only accommodate a limited number of children and the fewer children making the journey to school, and the fewer children in educational settings, the lower the risk that the virus can spread.\"The competition watchdog has launched a taskforce to tackle businesses looking to exploit the coronavirus outbreak to take advantage of customers.The Competition and Markets Authoritysaid the outbreak has prompted concerns that people could be exploited by companies \"charging excessive prices or making misleading claims about their products\".It said it has already contacted traders and s over excessive pricing of hand sanitiser as part of its efforts.Andrea Coscelli, the CMAs chief executive, said: \"This is obviously a time when we all have to behave responsibly to protect our fellow citizens, and particularly those who are most vulnerable.\"We urge retailers to behave responsibly in the exceptional circumstances of the Covid- outbreak.\"Butthey do not, our taskforce is monitoring market developments to enable us to intervene as quickly as possible.\"We have a range of options at our disposal, from warnings to enforcement action to seeking emergency powers.\"The ceremonial of the Changing of the Guard at Buckingham Palace, St Jamess Palace and Windsor Castle is being postponed until further notice \"in line with Government advice to avoid mass gatherings\", Buckingham Palace has announced.The palace said in a statement that the situation would be \"reviewed on an ongoing basis, with a view to restarting when appropriate\". article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Providing that people continue to be generous then there wonrsquot be a problem.As increasing numbers of people self-isolate to protect themselves from the virus, Claire said that the food bank was able to offer deliveriesnecessary.ldquoWe are a very open foodbank. If yoursquove got a need, just ask and we can do our best, said Claire.After the Church in Wales announced the suspension of public acts of worship, the Tabernacle and other churches in Penarth have been finding innovative ways to support their congregation.ldquoFrom this weekend we are going to be streaming virtual services, said Clair.ldquoOur musicians are recording pieces in their homes which will be shared online.ldquoAll our small groups meet on Zoom so wersquore in touch with our congregation.ldquoThe more elderly congregations are keeping in touch by phone and telephone to support them in every way ndash spiritually, emotionally and practically.ldquoThe epidemic is pulling everybody together and cutting across denominational boundaries.The Tabernacle Foodbank is open for donations and collections between am and pm Monday to Friday.You can also deliver donations to their collection point in Sainsburyrsquos on Windsor Road.The foodbank would particularly welcome tinned products, including curry, chilli, corned beef, and potatoes.For more information, visit: Info@tabspenarth or call:  . article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Irsquove grown up on the beach.ldquoI normally take landscape pictures because I love the water and some of the sunsets here are incredible, especially in the winter.Rochelle wrote her Instagram handle on the parcels, so that people who found them could send her a message.ldquoIt was just to make someone smile, and Irsquove had some lovely comments from people who got back to me on Instagram, she said.ldquoThey said they were going to put it up in their room and frame it.ldquoSome people were feeling a bit down and didnrsquot expect to find anything, so it cheered them up.ldquoMy job was done ndash the main purpose was to make people smile and it did - it made me smile too.ldquoI think itrsquos very important to say hello, especiallypeople are living by themselves orthey havenrsquot got their family around.ldquoWhen Irsquom normally walking the dog I say hello and have a chat, but itrsquos quite hard to do that now because everyone is quite wary.ldquoI donrsquot have to have that physical contact with someone to brighten up their day.ldquoArt is just a dferent  to communicate with. You knowsomeonersquos a bit shy and they donrsquot want to speak using words, they may want to draw a picture and open up that way instead.ldquoI think art can show feelings that words canrsquot quite express, so itrsquos a great idea to share that with the community.At a time of uncertainty and doubt, Rochelle ended with a message of hope and solidarity:ldquoI think as a community we could do so much more at this time, she saidldquoEveryone is concerned about how long it is going to last, but I am hopeful we can get past it, andwe all work together and remain positive we may come out of this in an even better situation than we was before.Rochelle would like to make clear that all parcels were fully sanitised.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

These are sent off to a lab to be analysed for the genetic sequence particular to the coronavirus.But a blood test can be used for patients believed to have had the condition and since recovered.The finger-prick test identies the antibodies produced inside you to fight off an infection, indicating that the patient may have near-immunity from the disease for at least  days.ndash Where can I get a test The majority of tests so far have been carried out in hospitals or in peoplersquos homes, with a small amount of random sampling via GP surgeries.But some unusual locations have been set up as mass testing sites.Furniture giant Ikea has set up a drive-through testing centre for frontline NHS staff at its store in Wembley, north-west London.Meanwhile, Boots is setting up another drive-through system at its headquarters in Nottingham and more sites are being sourced around the country.Currently, these facilities are reserved for NHS staff and by invitation only.Tests have also been carried out in the car park of Surrey theme park Chessington World of Adventures.-What is the UKrsquos target The NHS is aiming to get to , of these tests per day, with the ultimate aim being several hundred thousand, but health officials say this target will not be met until the end of April.Prof Doyle said there is currently capacity for around , tests for frontline NHS staff, which will increase.She said on Wednesday: ldquoBut the important capacity is in the second strand where we have five centres where people can drive through and get their testing done in order of priority.ldquoNHS chief executives are identying that priority and the intention here is to get from thousands to hundreds of thousands within the coming weeks.ndash Why will it take so long Cabinet minister Michael Gove said at Tuesdayrsquos Downing Street press conference that a ldquocritical constraint on the ability to rapidly increase testing capacity in the UK is the availability of chemical reagents.He said Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Health Secretary Matt Hancock were working with companies worldwide to ensure the UK gets the material needed to increase tests ldquoof all kinds.The Chemical Industries Association responded: ldquoWhile there is of course an escalating demand, there are reagents being manufactured and delivered to the NHS.ldquoEvery business here in the UK and globally is looking at what they can do to help meet the demand as a matter of urgency.ldquoTo clary the exact NHS need and meet it, all relevant UK industries are continuing to work closely with Government..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Coronavirus testing: What we know so far article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It needs to be stressed that the vast majority of people are doing the right thing. I want to thank them publicly and to acknowledge how tough it is to stay at home and keep your distance from others. However there has been a lot of attention on the small minority who have not followed the public health advice. It is essential that these tight restrictions are rigorously maintained in the weeks ahead. Quite simply, lives depend on it. So, let me appeal to everyone not to slip back into old habits. Any signs of complacency and impatience must be strongly resisted. Our actions now will impact on the spread of coronavirus in future weeks. Don’t lose heart or think the measures aren’t working just because of the current numbers and trends. What we are doing now is aimed at future weeks – slowing the spread of the virus and flattening its peak by drastically reducing human contact. That’s how we protect each other and protect our health service. We all have to stick with it, to get through this together. I make no apology for re-stating the vital advice once again. Stay at home. Please. Only go outit’s absolutely necessary and,you do, make sure you keep your distance from others. Wash your hands, thoroughly. When you sneeze or cough, use a tissue and then dispose of it – catch it, bin it, kill it. As a prominent doctor said in recent days, we can all be heroes. When we get through this as a society – which we will – you will want to look back and say you played your full part in fighting back against COVID-. I know very well the anxiety being felt across the community. I’m feeling exactly the same way - as a husband, a father and a son. But we have grounds for hope and positivity, alongside the deep apprehension. Social distancing will make a major dference –we keep doing it right and doing it together. Let’s take heart from the way people from all walks of le are coming forward to provide essential help. Our HSC workforce appeal is seeking new recruits to our health and social care workforce during the pandemic. Within a few short days of the appeal going live online, more than , people had signed up to register their interest in taking on roles. And there is large scale community-level volunteering going on, helping older and other vulnerable people cope during these dficult times. The Department for Communities is playing a key role in this area. When we look back, I hope we will remember how this crisis brought out the best in us how neighbours and strangers alike stepped up to help their fellow citizens in a time of grave need. When this is over, we will have a lot of rebuilding to do. Grief-stricken families, shattered lives, the economic and social fabric of society permanently altered. The collective spirit being forged right now will stand us in good stead.  addthis, Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n n n n n bannerbox_aedfdeafadceebfe   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n n n n n bannerbox_eccbadefecf   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]  []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1585734877583.jpg--minister_highlights_key_findings_of_ni_covid_19_modelling.jpg?158573487700","title":"minister highlights key findings of ni covid  modelling ","story":",\"image\":,\"description\":\"THE crucial importance of social distancing in NI has been graphically brought home by local modelling data on COVID-.\",\"author\":,\"dateCreated\":\"--T::Z\",\"dateModied\":\"--T::Z\",\"datePublished\":\"--T::Z\" cmspos   *** Handle jQuery plugin naming conflict between jQuery UI and Bootstrap *** .widget.bridge@-webkit-viewport @-moz-viewport@-ms-viewport @-o-viewport@viewport - Twitter, Inc.

Health Minister Robin Swann has set out key findings of an expert NI modelling study, which will inform intensive hospital planning for the forthcoming surge in COVID- cases. “In summary, the research indicates that our health service would have a realistic prospect of coping in this initial perioda sufficient proportion of the population adhere to the social distancing and self-isolation measures,” Mr Swann said. “However, it is important that this is considered in context, and I would emphasise that it provides no grounds whatsoever for dropping our guard. On the contrary, the projections underline that the continuation of rigorous social distancing will save many lives and protect our health service from collapse. “Even then, a reasonable worst case scenario would involve signicant loss of le In Northern Ireland. “In addition, the absence of a vaccine means we will have to plan for a potential second wave of COVID- cases later in the year.” The modelling outcome sets out a reasonable worst case scenario, based on a number of assumptions including social distancing measures producing a % reduction in contacts outside the home and workplace. In addition, % of symptomatic cases would adhere to case isolation. The modelling team’s best judgement is that this would lead to a peak number of  COVID- patients requiring ventilation and critical care beds during the first wave of the epidemic. The peak number of COVID- hospital admissions would be  per week. Under this reasonable worst case scenario, the projected number of cumulative COVID- deaths in Northern Ireland over  weeks of the epidemic would be ,. The modelling indicates that the peak of the first wave of the epidemic is expected between - April . The modelling team authors emphasise that the work is not a prediction or forecast, rather a model for planning purposes and also state: “It is assumed that current restrictions remain in place for the foreseeable future. When the current restrictions are relaxed, there will be a second wave. Future modelling will focus on the size and shape of this depending on how when restrictions are relaxed or re-introduced. This will remain the case until there is substantial population immunity either as a result of recovery from infection or successful vaccination.”  addthis, Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n n n n n bannerbox_aedfdeafadceebfe   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n n n n n bannerbox_eccbadefecf   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]  []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
