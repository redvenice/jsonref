Horta-Osório said in a statement issued by Credit Suisse on Monday.  The breach emerged in December, after Reuters reported it was discovered through a preliminary investigation by Credit Suisse’s legal team. The news came just weeks after Horta-Osório admitted that he breached Covid rules in Switzerland, having flown out of the country within three days of arriving on 28 November despite being required to quarantine for 10 days.

We have every confidence in the future of China’s economy, Xi tells virtual Davos. He adds that it will continue with its economic reforms and the opening up of its economy. Xi also says China will let the market play a decisive role in allocating resources, and that all types of capital are welcome, if they comply with laws. Beijing has been cracking down on its technology sector, which prompted Yahoo to pull out of China last November.In a virtual speech to open the World Economic Forum’s Davos Agenda, Xi warns that that emerging markets could suffer if central banks tighten monetary policy to tackle inflation. He also called for world leaders to continue to embrace cooperation to defeat the pandemic.  Xi explains that the world is undergoing major changes, and that the global economy faces many constraints - such as ongoing supply chain disruption and a tight energy market. The global low inflation environment has changed, Xi says, with inflation risks emerging. And he warns that there could be serious spillovers if major economies apply the brakes to monetary policy (by raising interest rates and ending stimulus measures). That would create challenges to economic and financial stability, Xi warns, with developing markets bearing the brunt. Xi also says the international community has fought a courageous battle against the pandemic - comparing the response to one gigantic ship riding out a storm, where a collection of small boats would not have survived. He also says the pandemic continues to pose a serious threat to people’s safety and health - strong confidence and cooperation is the only way to respond, rather than holding each other back or assigning blame. The strike is set to begin this coming Friday, and run to Friday 4 February.

Fuel stress will no longer be confined to the poorest households, according to a study by the Resolution Foundation. Low- and middle-income families will also find it hard to cope as they spend a far greater share of their family budget on these essentials than higher earners.

GSK are still the top riser, after Unilever said its consumer arm would be a ‘strong strategic fit’ after seeing a £50bn deal rejected (see earlier post).  Victoria Scholar, head of investment at interactive investor, says: And a deal for GlaxoSmithKline’s consumer products vision is “very much still on the cards” despite GSK rejecting three offers including the latest £50 billion approach, she adds: GSK is the top FTSE 100 riser, after it insisted Unilever’s proposals “fundamentally undervalued” the consumer business and its future prospects.

Unilever has confirmed that it approached GSK and Pfizer about a potential acquisition of the business, insisting that the deal would make sense, saying: Lee Hardman of MUFG Bank, Ltd explains: Oxfam projects that by 2030, 3.3 billion people will be living on less than $5.50 per day. Big news in the banking sector this morning: Credit Suisse chairman António Horta-Osório has quit following an internal probe into his personal conduct, following breaches of Covid-19 rules. Credit Suisse announced that Horta-Osório had resigned after a board investigation, after it emerged he had broken British quarantine rules to attend the Wimbledon tennis finals in London last July. The Portuguese banker had flown in from Switzerland, which had been on the UK government’s amber list of countries that required arrivals to isolate for 10 days.  Horta-Osório had also admitted breaching Covid rules in Switzerland at the end of November, having flown out of the country within three days of arriving on 28 November, despite being required to quarantine for 10 days. It’s an embarrassing blow to the embattled lender, which had appointed Horta-Osório less than a year ago. Credit Suisse incurred heavy losses from the implosion of the Archegos investment fund last year, and also provided funding to the now-collapsed supply chain finance firm Greensill Capital. Credit Suisse has now appointed board member Axel Lehmann chair, as it tries to recover from this string of scandals. Severin Schwan, Vice-Chairman and Lead Independent Director of the Board of Credit Suisse, said: China’s economy slowed at the end of last year as the Covid-19 pandemic and the crisis in its property sector hit growth-- prompting Beijing to cut a key interest rate. But there are clear signs of a slowdown at the end of the year, as China’s government introduced new restrictions to combat the latest wave of Covid-19. Spillovers from the crisis at indebted property developer Evergrande also weighed on China’s economy. And in response, China’s central bank has cut its key interest rate for the first time in almost two years to help bolster the economy. The People’s Bank of China has lowered the rate at which it provides one-year loans to banks by 10 basis points -- the first reduction since April 2020.  Louis Kuijs, head of Asia economics at Oxford Economics, says: China’s president Xi Jinping will be speaking later today, as part of the Davos Agenda series organised by the World Economic Forum (as the usual Annual Meeting has been postponed again due to the pandemic). We’ll also get the results of Scotland’s largest-ever auction of permits to construct offshore windfarms, which could raise up to £860m.

Most of the infections so far have been detected in Tianjin – where China’s first case of Omicron was detected on 9 December. However, the discovery of a lone Omicron case in neighbouring Beijing over the weekend has sparked alarm. At a press conference on Monday, officials said tracing had determined the infection came not from another province, but from a package sent from Toronto, via the US and Hong Kong. Liao Linzhu, deputy director of the city’s post administration, urged people “to not buy products from oversea areas”. Authorities said the patient diagnosed with the Omicron variant on Saturday had “self-reported” that they had received a package on 11 January. The package had been sent four days earlier. Authorities have since quarantined the patient’s family, the courier, and more than 60 others as close contacts, and tested more than 16,000 people in the patient’s home district of Haidian. “Omicron virus transmits fast, please pay attention, avoid buying stuff from overseas, make sure you wear gloves, don’t bring the package indoors. If you have to, clean the package outside with alcohol, and wash your hands,” said Pang Xinghuo, deputy director of Beijing’s CDC. China has claimed to identify numerous cases of infection throughout the pandemic as being transmitted via imported products – often cold chain items – but there is not a strong scientific basis to it, according to experts. However, Dr Ian Mackay, a virologist at the University of Queensland, told the  it was “a long bow to draw”, and urging people to clean packages and avoid receiving mail was “a wasted effort”. He said the overwhelmingly likely source of the infection was another person, and blaming packaging seemed more political than scientific. ”We all know this virus can hang around in people who aren’t showing symptoms, especially early on in the disease,” he said. “If you’re looking for a reason for … a virus being introduced into a jurisdiction, the first thing you’d think of is humans coming in from overseas – where the virus is everywhere. “It’s an airborne virus. It’s not about surfaces. Technically, it can happen, sure. There’s a non-zero risk, sure. But is it happening again and again? No,” he said. “If you see and hear horses, don’t think zebras.”AFP reports that in a new study, the UN’s International Labour Organization revised its previous forecast that the global employment market will make a nearly full recovery from the virus this year. Blaming the impacts of Covid variants like Delta and Omicron and uncertainty around how the pandemic will evolve, it now projects a significant deficit in working hours in 2022 compared to before the virus emerged. ILO chief Guy Ryder told reporters that the outlook “remains fragile”, adding: Last May, the ILO predicted the working hour shortage would be just half that this year. At the same time, the global official unemployment rate remains significantly higher than before the pandemic hit. And it cautioned that the overall impact on employment is significantly greater than what these figures would imply, since many people have left the labour force altogether. In 2022, the global labour force participation rate is projected to remain 1.2 percentage points below the level three years ago, it said. That corresponds to a deficit of some 40 million workers worldwide, ILO said. Ryder warned that the pandemic had already “weakened the economic, financial and social fabric in almost every country, regardless of development status.” At the same time, the ILO pointed out that differences in vaccine access and in economic recovery measures meant the crisis was impacting groups of workers and countries in vastly different ways. Unsurprisingly perhaps, the report said labour markets in higher-income countries appeared to be recovering faster, although some were now beginning to face problems related to labour shortages, Ryder said. Numerous factors appear to be driving the so-called “Great Resignation” seen in some countries, Ryder said, adding that the crisis clearly “has led a significant number of people in the workforce to reconsider the employment that they have.” Shifts in the way we work meanwhile seem to be deepening various forms of inequality, including exacerbating gender inequity, according to the report. It has been clear from the start that the pandemic was disproportionately impacting women, who have taken on the lion’s share of the additional care work, and also more often work in hard-hit sectors, like services and travel. But Ryder cautioned the impact could last well after the pandemic ends. He said: Changes like the move towards greater reliance on informal self-employment, the rise in remote work and shifting trends in temporary work, “all risk impairing the quality of working conditions”, the report said. Ryder insisted that only a “broad-based labour market recovery” would allow the world to truly recover from the pandemic. He added: Andrew Sparrow has our combined politics and Covid blog for the UK. Lucy Campbell will be here shortly to take you through the rest of the day’s Covid news from around the world.Neighbouring Kazakhstan reported a record 13,523 cases on Sunday, and this morning, the Kazakh government has said middle and high school students in the country’s three largest cities would study remotely until the end of March.Anton Hofreiter, a senior Green party MP, said Rome in particular deserved leniency as it finds its feet again after the blows levelled by Covid-19. That flexibility should also extend to countries making ambitious expenditures in climate protection, he added. Asked how the EU should help struggling countries, Hofreiter replied: “By continuing to temporarily suspend the Stability Pact because we’re really in a very special crisis.”The highly infectious Omicron variant is driving a resurgence in coronavirus cases, which are hovering near record levels, after new infections exceeded 25,000 nationwide in the past two days. The measures being considered by the government will cover nine prefectures in addition to Tokyo, broadcaster FNN reported earlier.I’ll be continuing here with the latest international coronavirus developments.PA Media quotes him saying: “Looking at it from a UK point of view, there does appear to be light at the end of the tunnel … I think that it’s going to be bumpy before we get to the end. “So even though it’s possible to start imagining that the end of the pandemic is not far away, just everybody be ready for the possibility that there will be more variations and mutations coming along, or that there will be further challenges, other surges of even Omicron coming.” He said children do not get very ill from Covid-19, and “we’re going to have children acting as vectors of the virus for some time to come”. He said there was a need to still be “respectful of this virus”, adding: “Do what you can to stop transmitting it. Do what you can to protect others from being affected by it.

It’s the busiest we have ever been,” he said.Mr Mulroy added that he heard “not a thing” about who might have won it.The county’s perennial search for Sam Maguire may be one of sport’s longest running and unluckiest sagas, though having one town in the county which has won €80 million in lottery prizes brings its compensations.The elusive winner of the Lotto jackpot has yet to come forward and the National Lottery has asked players in the town to check their tickets.The details of the winning store will officially be revealed on Wednesday morning.The winning numbers for Saturday were: 02, 09, 16, 30, 37, 40 and the bonus was 23. It was a quick pick combination.As the Lotto jackpot was capped at €19.06 million, the funds from Saturday night’s draw that would usually go to the jackpot flowed down to the next highest tier at which there was a winner.The “Will be Won” event saw 149 winners at the Match 5 + Bonus tier who shared almost €5.5 million and they will now claim €36,687 each.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"consumers afraid to shop around for health insurance","story":"More than one million people have never switched health insurance provider,  according to the chief executive of the Health Insurance Authority, Laura Brien. Photograph: iStock Hundreds of thousands of consumers could be paying over the odds for reduced levels of health insurance cover because they are afraid to shop around, the head of the authority governing the sector has warned.Annual savings amounting to hundreds of euro are available to many who switch health insurance policies, but more than one million have never looked for better value, according to the chief executive of the Health Insurance Authority (HIA), Laura Brien.Ms Brien cited as-yet unpublished research carried out by the HIA which has found that just one third of people with private health insurance had ever switched, with most having only done so once.The figures mean that in excess of 1.2 million people have never switched policy. “People are worried more about what they might lose rather than thinking about what they might gain,” she said.“They are concerned that if they switch they might lose access to certain hospitals or consultants or not have the same level of cover that they previously had.”Waiting periodsShe also noted a widespread misunderstanding about how waiting periods are applied by insurers. “People think that waiting periods start again if they switch but that is not the case,” she said.Once a person has a certain level of cover with one company, if they switch to a different policy then waiting periods only apply for any enhanced cover offered, she explained.She said the HIA’s research suggests one reason people do not want to make changes is because it seems complicated and there are multiple things to consider. “That can lead people to make no decision because they are worried about making the wrong decision.”She stopped short of saying health insurers were exploiting the complexity of health insurance to increase their profits, but said they were “not trying to simplify things”.Ms Brien pointed out that not only have prices gone up over recent years for many policies, but the level of cover offered by companies has changed, which could leave consumers facing substantial bills for future treatments.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"more than two thirds of students want hybrid state examinations this year","story":"Students also voiced their concerns about missing classes, absenteeism of both students and teachers in the classroom and the pressure on their mental health of Covid-19. Photograph: Dara Mac Dónaill  The More than two-thirds of Leaving Certificate students want a hybrid state exams model this summer, according to a comprehensive new survey. The Irish Second-Level Students’ Union (ISSU) survey of school students shows that two-thirds of exam students are calling for a hybrid model for state examinations in 2022 (68 per cent of Leaving cycle students and 63 per cent of Junior cycle students).The ISSU is the national representative body for second-level school students in the State. The survey, which closed last Friday received over 40,900 responses from students in the State. It involved one in three Senior cycle students and one in seven Junior cycle students. ISSU student Emer Neville said it was “abundantly clear” that students want to see a hybrid model of examinations and assessments for this year’s State exams. She pointed out that the examinations survey saw double the engagement from students of previous years. “We are calling on the Department of Education to hear the voice of students, who are continuing their education in abnormal times,” she said. “With the levels of disruptions, mental health pressures and classes missed, we are asking the minister to introduce a hybrid model for state examinations.” Students also voiced their concerns about missing classes, absenteeism of both students and teachers in the classroom and the pressure on their mental health of Covid-19.

Photograph: Julien BehalPA WireIt began in 1922 with a simple handover of power from the British to most of the Irish.But many decades along the way, with the new nation modernising and monetising, Dublin Castle became less known as the home of the historic handover and increasingly notorious as a home from home for hand-over-fist merchants.After 70 years a-growing, the hot news from the upper and lower yards went from accounts of a low-key transfer of power to lurid reports of the abuse of that power. The castle became a place where successive tribunals explored how money went into brown envelopes and secret bank accounts.So while the old walls witnessed many more powerful men traversing those ancient cobbles, their motives were not exactly in the Michael Collins category of state service.Dignity and honour reasserted itself on Sunday for a State commemoration of that historic handover of power, the ceremony taking place beneath the room where it happened exactly 100 years ago.As the historians have been pointing out for the past week, the event was a brief and somewhat rushed affair, with the British keen to get the formal process over as quickly and quietly as possible and the Irish side in a hurry to get back to the Mansion House, where the provisional government was meeting.The ceremony in the courtyard a century later kept to the same short, early afternoon timetable while the tone of the proceedings echoed the deliberately low-key nature of one of the most significant events in Irish history. But where Michael Collins and his fellow ministers were driven through cheering crowds as they approached the castle gates, the turnout on this occasion was sparse.There were no flags flying at the castle when the last lord lieutenant of Ireland, Viscount FitzAlan of Derwent, formally handed over Dublin Castle and the power that went with it to Collins, chairman of the provisional government of Ireland.It was different on Sunday, with the raising of the Tricolour a central part of the ceremony. That honour was accorded to Sgt Shirley Stafford from Newbridge, Co Kildare, whose family has a record of unbroken service in the Defence Forces since 1922.It was a proud moment for Sgt Stafford, who is a member of the Air Corps and has served on five overseas missions. Her great-grandfather Christopher Jordan signed up in 1922 and retired as a gunner in the Artillery Corps, while her grandfather Jack Stafford served during the Emergency and retired as a sergeant in the Artillery Corps. Her father, Séan, who died in service in 1997, was a member of the Armoured Cavalry Squadron base in the Curragh.Three of Sgt Stafford’s siblings are in the Defence Forces, while the fourth is a garda. “It was very emotional to be out there and representing my family,” she said afterwards, confessing she had to fight back the tears during the national anthem. “It was such an honour to be chosen. I really enjoyed the moment and will cherish it always.”Her mother, Alacoque, was in the viewing stand for the occasion. She knew Séan would have been proud to see one of his children raising the flag on such a historic day. “He is watching over all of us today, that’s for sure.”Another handoverThe President, the Taoiseach and the lord mayor of Dublin led the cast of dignitaries invited to the castle to mark the centenary. Members of the Cabinet were out in force – Simon Coveney seated between two Fianna Fáil colleagues. Tánaiste Leo Varadkar was marched in under the arch by an Army officer, with a blast from the band, and deposited in the front row.He will have had particular interest in the ceremony: was he looking for ideas on how to mark that other big handover at the end of the year, when he is due to swap places with Taoiseach Micheál Martin?Maybe bring in some food trucks and replace all the retired dudes with more happening celebrities? And get Champagne Coveney to organise the after-show party? Lots to think about.Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald headed the Opposition turnout.It may have taken her party a lot longer than all the others to recognise the State and its government and the real Óglaigh na hÉireann on parade in the castle, but better late than never. There was some quiet comment about her choice of handbag, which appeared to be adorned with a very large lily, but even for image-conscious Sinn Féin that seems like a sartorial statement too far.She was seated next to the all-powerful secretary general to the Government, Martin Fraser. With her party riding high in the opinion polls and a stint in power within her grasp, did Mary Lou take the opportunity to bend Martin’s ears for a few little insider tips?Two former taoisigh attended, Enda Kenny and Bertie Ahern. Bertie who must have been thrilled to be back in Dublin Castle and not appearing before a tribunal. And there were two former presidents in the audience, Mary Robinson and Mary McAleese.The Social Democrats were represented by co-leader Catherine Murphy, while Alan Kelly and Dublin lord mayor Alison Gilliland were the Labour standard bearers.The British ambassador, Paul Johnston, looked happy out, which couldn’t have been said about the viceroy back in 1922. Imagine if things had gone differently and Ireland were still under British rule. This country would be party central now, with Boris Johnson hosting cabinet on tour sessions in Coppers and an Irish political press corps that isn’t bored out of its skull most of the time.Imaginary medalsAnyway, earnest and sensible Micheál Martin (there’s a lot to be said for it) was next to be tootled into the courtyard by the Army Band. The Taoiseach, a keen student of Irish political history, was taking things very seriously. We could hear him before we could see him, his heels crunching off the cobbles as he marched under the arch in the upper courtyard at alarming speed, three senior officers quick-stepping in his wake.“Clip-clop, clip-clop, left-right, left-right!” Micheál powered up past the viewing stands to the guard of honour. Unlike the Army lads and lassies, the Taoiseach hadn’t any ironmongery to show off, but judging by the way he was moving, in his head he had a row of 40 medals on his chest.He took his place on the VIP platform as distant sirens indicated that Michael D and Sabina were on their way. Eventually, the President’s car and motorcycle escort arrived in the upper yard, where he took the presidential salute before inspecting the guard of honour.Back to 1922 and the formal handover of power in a room over the archway between the two courtyards. Collins commented afterwards on the lavish “gilded and purple” decor in the Privy Council Chamber. He made particular note of the carpets. “We had red carpet laid for us that momentous moment.”Interestingly, the ceremonial carpets in the Dublin Castle courtyard for the VIP guests in 2022 were a dull grey. Who ever rolls out the grey carpet? Nobody.But the rest of this short and dignified ceremony shone with colour.At the end of it, President Higgins unveiled a plaque on the stone wall between the two yards. He pulled back the blue velvet curtain to reveal the inscription: “In a room above this archway, Dublin Castle was formally handed over by the last Lord Lieutenant of Ireland Viscount FitzAlan of Derwent to the Provisional Government of Ireland led by its chairman Michael Collins.”There was talk of a ceremonial Cabinet meeting afterwards, with the nod to the meeting in the Mansion House. We overheard the word “reception” mentioned by a few ministers, but invitation came there none. Again this was in keeping with the historically accurate objective – the press wasn’t allowed inside either 100 years ago. Of course, there was no social distancing back then.One wonders how many Ministers were willing to chance a socially distanced sausage on a stick on Sunday.Perhaps the most special guest of all was Elizabeth Berney, who will be 101 in May. She is the daughter of Gen Richard Mulcahy, and her two aunts – Phyllis Ryan and the Mary Kate Ryan – were married to Sean T O’Kelly and her mother was engaged to Seán Mac Diarmada. As a baby she survived a raid by the Black and Tans.Hale and hearty, she rounded off the event by having her photograph taken with the Taoiseach in the centre of the sunlight courtyard."},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Decades of progress overshadowed by Putin crackdowns and confrontation with WestRussia\u0026rsquos land of the midnight sun said to have inspired creator of Chanel No. 5Atomic icebreakers and floating power plants to help Kremlin develop Arctic shipping routeMinority nations feel squeeze as Putin\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquopower vertical\u0026rsquo crushes republics\u0026rsquo autonomyHistory of bloodshed and tragedy haunts stunning region shared by Muslims and ChristiansOil wealth and new mosque and churches help keep Tatarstan on Kremlin\u0027s sideOfficials claim West wants to \u0026lsquoGermanise\u0026rsquo and instil special identity in strategic regionNato monitors heavily armed Kaliningrad as locals long for borders to reopenAttack on renowned Memorial rights group deepens opposition anger and international alarmSaint Petersburg Letter: Russia\u0026rsquos old imperial capital celebrates 200 years since birth of Crime and Punishment creatorEnergy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"maureen dowd joe biden better build better or he won t be back","story":"Joe Biden President Biden ‘fancied himself another Master of the Senate. Unfortunately, he was thinking about the Senate of 1984’. Photograph:  Brendan SmialowskiAFP via Getty ImagesOh, the tribulations of Job Biden! Kyrsten Sinema humiliated him. Mitch McConnell disrespected him. The supreme court blocked him. Vladimir Putin scorned him. Inflation defied him. Covid stalked him. Even Stacey Abrams stiffed him. There are any number of sentiments to feel about what the president is enduring right now, and we should feel all of them. Pity, anger, disappointment, embarrassment – and hope that he can get it going, because the alternative is really bad.As hapless as Biden and his coterie are, we can’t give up on the president because he’s all that stands between us and the apocalypse at the hands of Trump, DeSantis, Pence, Kristi Noem and future chief justice Amy Coney Barrett. President Biden fancied himself another Master of the Senate. Unfortunately, he was thinking about the Senate of 1984. He was supposed to be Mitch McConnell’s equal in senatorial cunning. But, so far, McConnell – the Einstein of obstruction – has been astonishingly successful in ruining Biden’s agenda.Biden’s one big accomplishment, infrastructure, was achieved with McConnell’s support because there was enough home-state pork in the bill to fix the potholes on Kentucky’s Bourbon Trail. When Biden went up to the Senate on Thursday to have lunch with the Democrats, after being publicly stabbed in the heart by Sinema, he couldn’t help but lapse into the gauzy mists of the past, the good old days when he could reason with Webster, Clay and Calhoun. (Maybe not with Calhoun.)In the private meeting in the Kennedy Caucus Room, Biden said how much it meant to him when he was newly elected to the Senate and Ted Kennedy took him out to lunch, according to some in attendance. The president noted with melancholy that he had seen the Senate dining room empty, where once all the senators hobnobbed and worked out deals in a hive of bipartisan collegiality. Reiterating a point he made in his big voting rights speech in Atlanta, he said that even Strom Thurmond – the onetime segregationist presidential candidate – had become more supportive of voting rights than Republicans are now.But slurping navy bean soup with McConnell and John Thune isn’t going to break the fever. No matter how many times Biden mentions Strom Thurmond, he’s not coming back. “Strom Thurmond?” Nancy Pelosi said after Biden brought Thurmond up in the voting rights speech in Atlanta. “None of us have a lot of happy memories about Strom Thurmond.” FallaciesThe problem has been the same from the start. It’s not the Senate, country or world that Biden longingly remembers. Republicans aren’t open to persuasion. Their goal, as it was with Barack Obama, is to make Biden’s presidency a failure. One of the many fallacies of zanycreepy Sinema’s tremulous logic in her Senate speech about why the filibuster must be preserved is that she faults the Democrats for not working harder and striving more to bring Republicans on board for protecting voting rights.Psst! Senator Sinema. That’s the whole point. Republicans don’t actually want everyone to vote, unless they’re rural or white. And they don’t want to help Biden. This is all to their advantage. McConnell is not a sucker. The Republicans know that making it easier to cast ballots during the pandemic helped elect two freshman Democrats from Georgia and made Chuck Schumer, not McConnell, the leader of the Senate. And McConnell doesn’t want that to happen again. Even though Schumer is such a pushover that he backed down from his promise of a voting rights showdown by Martin Luther King Day because winter weather threatened.But Sinema feels more talking is required. “We need robust, sustained strategies that put aside party labels and focus on our democracy,” she declared. Yeah, like that’s going to happen. She’s as delusional about the Senate as Biden is. Biden was elected to be Not Trump, to be a comfortable old shoe. He overpromised and underdelivered. People wanted competence and stability, and instead we get incompetence and instability. Biden is running the White House like a Senate office with his familiar white-guy innermost circle from the old days. But the real problem is the president himself, who can’t shake the cobwebs of the judiciary committee that held its biggest hearings in the same ornate caucus room where he met with Democrats on Thursday. He is too in the weeds on process. He’s so lost in the snows of yesteryear that he is continuing his Amtrak Joe nearly-every-weekend commute to Delaware, albeit with better wheels, trading in the train for Marine One. We want the president to rise above it and be an inspirational figure. We don’t want the incremental updates of his negotiations with Joe Manchin. We want to see Covid under control. We want to see the sacred right to vote protected. We want the grocery shelves stocked with affordable milk and meat. We want a president who tells us that we will get through this and we will be stronger for it.Joe Biden better Build Better or he won’t be Back. If he doesn’t turn it around, he has cleared the way to a Republican rout in this autumn’s midterms. And in 2024, who knows how bad it can get?

Do they stick with the Prime Minister – whom most voters, most Conservative voters, and most Conservative members believe has lied about breaching Covid rules – or do they force him out of office?There is an uneasy peace in Westminster, a phony war, as ministers and backbenchers and the few diehard Johnsonites await the publication of the Sue Gray report. But whether they want the Prime Minister to stay or go, or if they cannot make up their minds, the conversation is about one topic only: how can Boris Johnson survive?Government insiders expect Gray to reveal more breaches of Covid rules, mainly by civil servants, than those reported to date. She is expected to come down hard on the absence of leadership at the centre of the Civil Service, and criticise drinking culture in Whitehall.Downing Street hopes that Gray will say Johnson did not, knowingly at least, break any rules. If she hands her report to the police before publication, they hope the Met will decide against a criminal investigation. Senior figures will be sacked, the Prime Minister will try to draw a line under the matter, and they will fill the Government grid with announcements: ending Covid restrictions, tackling the Channel crossings and launching Michael Gove’s levelling-up white paper.For some Conservative MPs who have been keeping their powder dry, whatever Gray reports will be enough to call for the PM to go. But for many others – who dislike the thought of regicide, worry about iding the party, are nervous about the next election, or remain uncertain about who should take Johnson’s place – it will be tempting to conclude that there is not yet quite enough evidence against him.The line among these MPs will be that the PM is “on probation”. Some will give him until the local elections to put things right. Come May, some will give him until the end of summer, party conference, or the end of the year. It is easier to defer a difficult decision than make one, especially when such a decision is taken by a group of people with different interests and little mutual trust.Those who put Johnson on probation will seek assurances from him. They will want to know that no further revelations will emerge, and that the PM’s personal conduct will not undermine the party or the Government again. They will demand policy and political momentum, and a stronger and more professional team in No10.Even if Johnson gives such assurances, however, he will be in no position to stick to them. Insiders warn about other stories of serious breaches in the rules. There may be parties – or details of parties or photographs – that emerge after Gray reports. We might learn of other breaches, concerning for example Johnson’s travel between Downing Street and Chequers during lockdown. We might see evidence confirming rumours that he hosted friendly political advisers at Chequers while isolating during the so-called pingdemic.The idea that policy and political momentum can be regained easily is also fanciful. The Tories have collapsed in the polls. Seventy per cent of voters think the Prime Minister has lied. The sources dripping out new stories about rule-breaking in Downing Street are likely to have held back material to release after Gray publishes her report. A new No10 team – replacing those sacked in the next week or so – is unlikely to be heavyweight. First-rate advisers will be reluctant to join a listing ship, so new recruits are likely to be civil servants and third-rate politicos: exactly the opposite of what Johnson needs to relaunch and survive.While sacking members of his team might be necessary to try to move on, by punishing subordinates for behaving as many believe he did, Johnson will do little to show that he has changed.And this brings us to the crux of the matter. The PM can reshuffle his team, and throw up chaff about a Whitehall drinking culture. MPs can seek assurances, and make whatever calculations they choose about who should replace Johnson, or how the party can still win the next election.But the issue is that the PM broke the rules – apparently often and with little care – and many are now convinced that he lied about it. He denied that there were parties in No10, and when evidence to the contrary emerged, told Parliament he was “angered” to learn of them. And we know now that he attended at least one party. His protests that he believed it was a “work event” – a distinction irrelevant in Covid laws anyway – are undermined by new reports that he waved away warnings before the party, calling its organiser “my loyal Labrador”.There are political factors Conservative MPs will need to consider. What authority does the PM have now if he needs to introduce new restrictions to deal with a different variant? How can the Scottish Tories go into the next election with their leader and 27 Conservative Members of the Scottish Parliament calling for the PM to go? How can Johnson make any election promises when most voters have concluded that he has lied to them?And can he show voters that he has changed? Some Tory MPs want to give him the benefit of the doubt, but many agree with the senior Government figure who said to me, “we know he can’t change because even now he cannot see what the problem is. He just complains about how unfair it all is.”But most important is the reputation of the Conservative Party on the fundaments of trust, truth and decency. With their philosophical understanding of the role played by community in buttressing and checking both market and state, the Tories more than others must respect the importance of fairness and reciprocity. If they choose not to live by these principles, they will be dismissed easily and deservedly as the selfish party, people who do not care about others.Right now, the fury of the public is directed at Johnson alone, not his party and not his Government. But opinion can shift rapidly. The question facing Tory MPs is: can the Prime Minister change, or do they need to change the prime minister?More from NewsPolitics latest news: We did nothing wrong, says Sir Keir Starmer as he refuses to apologise over lockdown beer photoYemen\u0026#39s Houthis claim \u0026#39drone attack\u0026#39 on tankers in United Arab EmiratesCovid latest news: UK will have \u0026#39flu-type\u0026#39 relationship with coronavirus by end of the year, says Government adviserLyrid meteor shower 2022: how to watch the peak and other key UK datesChina facing \u0026#39demographic time bomb\u0026#39 as birth rate sinks to lowest level since 1949More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"standing ovation addicts really applauding","story":"The concluding words of the drama are spoken, the last note sounds in the auditorium – and while it still echoes, the audience is on its feet, applauding. It generally starts in the stalls, with people popping up like observant meerkats. Then, either from shared enthusiasm or because they now can’t see the performers taking their bows, everyone else follows, save for a few die-hard grumpies.Once a rare and spontaneous gesture of acknowledgment for a remarkable performance, the standing ovation has become the default expression of approval – so much so that seated applause can be taken as indifference or even as an insult. As long ago as 1989, Dustin Hoffman was distinctly miffed when his performance as Shylock in Sir Peter Hall’s production of the Merchant of Venice failed to bring the West End audience to its feet.While the ovation traces its origins to ancient times, when it was a consolation prize for B+ military types who didn’t quite merit a Roman triumph, the obligatory theatrical standing ovation has its origins in the US, where applause inflation has been the subject of innumerable pained articles by fastidious critics who prefer a finer gradation of enthusiasm.Back in 2012, the New York Times’s then chief theatre critic, Ben Brantley, observed that, “The SO … has become a reflexive social gesture, like shaking hands with the host at the end of a party.” On the other side of the Atlantic, the Cannes Film Festival has acquired an unenviable reputation for interminable ovations.If a standing ovation were an unforced expression of gratitude for an uplifting performance, there would be no case against it. But the suspicion grows that it is more about egotism than altruism. The late conductor Bernard Haitink condemned with unusual vehemence the “idiots” who bellowed their approval of a concert performance before the final note had died away.The effects on live performance of Covid restrictions have been painful. But as we resume our seats in the auditorium, we should remember Haitink’s scathing view of performative adulation. Applaud until our hands hurt, by all means, but stand up for nothing less than the performance of a lifetime (or a train that leaves in the next ten minutes).By accident, I recently bought a packet of Cotton Candy grapes. They were strikingly nasty, tasting – as their name suggests – of little but sugar. It turns out that these bloated sugar-bombs are not a faddish supermarket one-off, but the harbinger of a new generation of fruit and veg, bred for a modern aesthetic that prefers the bland and decorative to the plain and tasty.The infantilisation of modern palates is a phenomenon lamented by nutritionists, but vigorously promoted by the same supermarkets that peddle virtuous platitudes about healthy eating. Of the five basic tastes – salty, sour, umami, bitter and sweet – it is the last that is ubiquitous in the food stores where most of us shop, lurking even in “savoury” foods.Aside from the dire health consequences of the sickly hegemony, the erosion of our ability to appreciate a wider range of flavours is a formidable cultural loss. It is as though we were restricted to an aural diet of bubblegum pop, when what we need is the pungent operatic complexity of Roquefort, anchovies – and proper onions that make you weep as you slice them.More from NewsPolitics latest news: We did nothing wrong, says Sir Keir Starmer as he refuses to apologise over lockdown beer photoYemen\u0026#39s Houthis claim \u0026#39drone attack\u0026#39 on tankers in United Arab EmiratesCovid latest news: UK will have \u0026#39flu-type\u0026#39 relationship with coronavirus by end of the year, says Government adviserLyrid meteor shower 2022: how to watch the peak and other key UK datesChina facing \u0026#39demographic time bomb\u0026#39 as birth rate sinks to lowest level since 1949More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"keir starmer says photo him","story":"Keir Starmer says photo of him with a beer was perfectly lawful in furious defenceLabours leader was grilled over the photo - which emerged last May and has been re-used in the Downing Street party row - but insisted there was no comparisonthis.style.displaynone\" Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video boris-johnson-broke-law-claims-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:QnsdXiOa,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,pubmaticVideoPrebidEnabled:true,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,disableOzoneScriptOnDragonfly:true,pubmaticIdDisabled:true,fbia.mantisRecommender:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,blackFridayWidget.linkUrl:https:www.mirror all-about black-friday,blackFridayWidget:,partner.quicklinks.bar:true,enableSlideInSkinnySignUp:true,justpremiumDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,videoPlaylistEnabled:true,domain:mirror,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,publicationId:aeed-a--bac-edf,lotameLightningTagV:true,ampVideoCacheBuster:true,pubmaticDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,deleteAccountFromProfile:true,adHiddenLoading:true,adslotsFixedSize:true,blackFridayWidget.Link:https:get-latest.dev.convrse.media black-fridayblack-friday-widget-v.,sovrnDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,video.header.bidding.enabled:,chatEnabled:true,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,enableAboutTopics:true,converse.widget.enable:true,viafouraComments:true,adMobileBottomSlotLarge:true,video.jwplayer.playerId:DxFYnOv,flagsFromDataLayerForFBIA:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,fbia.converse.enabled:true,irisClientToken:,disableAHS:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,openxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,globalTrayEnabled:true,manualReconsent:,mpulse.enabled:true,nobidDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,og.image.for.section.and.topic:https:s-prod.mirror @trinitymirrordigital chameleon-branding publications mirror img logo-mirror-socialsharing.png,publicationName:Mirror,video.jwplayer.enabled:true,loadIrisManually:true,delayAdsUntilCMP:true,disableAdvertMaxHeight:true,preloadFonts:true,viafouraEnabled:true,PWA.enable:true,readNextEmbeds:true,removeSSO:true,chartbeatHeadlinePageTypes:[ home , channel , topic , section ],felix.endpoint:https:felix.data.tm-awx ampconfig.,breakingNewsPull:true,nobidVideoPrebidEnabled:true,adFixedMobileBottomSticky:true,magniteDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,footerNewsletterConfig:,xandrDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,consentText:We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Sir Keir was grilled over the photo by the BBC after the Daily Mail put it on its front page.He insisted there was “absolutely no comparison” between the photo, taken in April , and Downing Street’s “industrial” scale partying dating back to May . Sir Keir said: “I was in a constituency office days before the election, we were very busy, we were working, at some time some food turned up.  “We stopped, we had our food and then we carried on working. That is not a breach of the rules, it’s not a party and it’s no comparison to the Prime Minister.” At the time fo the photo England was in Step  of its lockdown roadmap - which banned indoor socialising with people not in your support bubble. Yet Sir Keir insisted: It was perfectly lawful to meet for work, which is what we were doing. “The party that was put to the Prime Minister on Wednesday happened because an invitation was sent to  people saying aposletaposs have some socially distant drinks in the garden and bring your own boozeapos. “There is simply no comparison.  BBC host Sophie Raworth quoted government guidance which said meetings in-person should be avoided where possible, and “there should not be any sharing of food and drink by staff who do not share a household.” The latter part of that guidance was for “staff canteens and restaurants” in which staff were eating, rather than prohibiting food completely.She asked Sir Keir “why is that any dferent ” from a photo of Boris Johnson and aides having wine and cheese in the No garden, which the PM also claimed was a work meeting.The wine and cheese gathering was on  May . Sir Keir’s photo was taken in April . Lockdown rules existed at both times though at dferent levels of severity. Sir Keir said: “If you’re trying to persuade anyone that stopping to have some food when you’re in the office all day working is a breach of the rules, it’s just not going to wash. “It shows just how far the Conservatives are sinking that they’re trying to pretend there’s some sort of comparison between this and the industrial scale partying the Prime Minister has been up to.” Asked where he draws the line, the Labour leader replied: “The line is drawn in the rules - and the Prime Minister broke the rules”. During the interview, Sir Keir reiterated that Boris Johnson must resign in the national interest as he has lost all authority in the country. When asked about Plan B measures, the Labour leader insisted it is important they are lted because the medical science says they should be lted and not because the Prime Minister is in a real mess.

The Labour leader insisted he did nothing wrong after a picture, first published in May , emerged again showing him with a beer in the run-up to the Hartlepool by-election last year.Mr Starmer was filmed holding a bottle and chatting to a woman through the window of Durham MP Mary Foy’s constituency office. He told LBC: I think it’s very straightforward. It was a very busy time it was three or four days before the local elections. We were working in the office, and a takeaway turned up and we stopped and we ate it.Honestly, you know, two parties the night before Prince Philip ’s funeral with suitcases. We didn’t break any rules, we were working in the office. I understand what’s going on here which is exactly what happened with Owen Paterson. There comes a time when the Tories try to take everyone into the gutter with them. We did nothing wrong. Labour has previously insisted no rules were broken in the picture, which emerged last Spring but has featured again in media interviews because the Daily Mail put it on its front page two days in a row. At the time of the photo England was in Step  of its lockdown roadmap - which banned indoor socialising with people not in your support bubble. Nadhim Zahawi said he hoped the Labour leader findswithin himself to apologise for the image as the Tories tried to sht focus away from their own rule-breaking parties.The Education Secretary told BBC Breakfast: I think people expect, you know, very high standards from their leaders, and I think thataposs only right.Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Labour PartyPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Boris Johnson has failed to deliver on his “levelling-up” pledge and the UK is more ided than ever, according to the study.The Institute for Public Policy Research North warned there was a “gulf between levelling-up promises and policy reality”. In its annual health-check of the North’s economy, it says funding for levelling-up “pales in comparison to local government austerity”. The  allocations of the Levelling-Up Fund give a per-person investment of just £ in the North. Meanwhile, there has been a £ per-person drop in the North, and a £ drop across England, in annual council service spending over the last decade, the think tank says.  Despite the Tories trumpeting devolution, IPPR North says Britain is becoming more centralised, with public spending concentrated in central government. “Four years ago,  pence in every £ paid in tax was taken by Whitehall ,” it says. “Despite the levelling-up agenda, this has now increased to p.” The think tank says for every job created in the North, nearly three were created in London and the wider South East. Its -page report says: “From  to , % of all jobs created in England were located in the Greater South Eastregions, which are home to % of the population. “In comparison, the North is home to % of England’s population but only % of jobs growth was located in the region. “For every job created in the North, just under three jobs were created in the Greater South East.” In-work poverty has risen in the North from . million people in   - just before the Conservatives ed to power - to . million in  , after a decade of Tory rule, it says. IPPR North’s interim director Arianna Giovannini said: “Two years on from the promise to level-up the country, government rhetoric has reached fever pitch, but in reality they have once again over-promised and under-delivered on rebalancing our economy. “To succeed in levelling-up, enabling people everywhere to live a good le, it will be necessary to build an economy hardwired for widespread prosperity, that powers the net-zero transition and provides everyone with access to high quality, lelong education. “Broadening and deepening devolution, and building collaborative relationships between and across all levels of government are essential components of the levelling-up jigsaw.  “But reorganising local government by the back door,  dawns, and further centralising power and funding would be a huge mistake and level-down the country.” The Prime Minister has struggled to explain what he means by “levelling-up” and senior Cabinet members have failed to agree how it should be measured. The Government was due to unveil its White Paper outlining how it would deliver the election-winning manesto pledge before Christmas. But the plan was delayed and is now due later this month. A Levelling-Up Department spokesman claimed the IPPR analysis was “misleading as it focuses on just one part of our investment to level up the North of England”. He added: “In addition to the £.bn Levelling-Up Fund, we’re providing record investment in infrastructure worth over £bn, £bn in affordable housing and a £.bn Shared Prosperity Fund to help rebalance opportunity across the UK. “The Government will publish a White Paper that will drive forward this central mission in due course.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Boris JohnsonCabinetConservative PartyPoliticsChristmas party\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Rather than accept any responsibility for the scandal engulfing Downing Street, he is instead likely to throw a bunch of civil service flunkies under the bus, who could now face the axe. But it comes as the Mirror can reveal Mr Johnson attended a leaving do for his defence adviser in the run-up to Christmas  and gave a speech. And fresh doubts were raised on the PM’s claim he did not know in advance about the No garden bash on May  of that year after Sunday Times columnist Dominic Lawson claimed at least two people had warned him the email invite to staff made it clear it was a party and it should have been stopped. If true, it blows his half-hearted apology for ­Partygate last week out of the water and means he faces claims he breached the ministerial code by misleading the Commons. To add further pressure on Mr Johnson, his we Carrie was photographed breaking Covid social distancing rules in September .  The PM will hide behind claims he is to crack down on the “culture” at No in his bid to deflect any blame. Those who could be singled out for blame inclde his PM’s principal private secretary Martin Reynolds – who sent the May  party invite – his deputy Stewart ­Glassborow and chief of staff Dan Rosenfeld. But Mr Lawson’s claims suggest Mr Johnson knew more about the parties than he let on. The well-connected columnist said: “Last week I spoke to a former Downing Street official who said at least two people had told the PM, after seeing the emailed ­invitation from Martin Reynolds that this was ‘a party’ and should be immediately cancelled. “I was told that Johnson’s dismissive response was to say they were ‘overreacting’ and to praise Reynolds as ‘my loyal Labrador’. I then asked someone who has known the PM for decades what could have made him take such an approach . “His immediate answer was: ‘It’s because deep down he obviously thought the regulations were ridiculous, so why should he observe them ’”  No insisted: “It is untrue that the Prime Minister was warned about the event in advance. “As he said earlier this week he believed implicitly that this was a work event.” We can reveal Mr Johnson gave a speech at an event to mark defence adviser Captain Steve Higham’s Downing Street departure before Christmas in . It is understood the PM was “there for a few minutes to thank him for his service” as a “small number of No staff briefly said goodbye”. The MoD declined to comment. Our revelation could give senior civil servant Sue Gray more material to consider as part of her probe into the Downing Street parties. Tory chairman Oliver Dowden signalled civil servants would take the rap for the rule breaking parties.He said: “The PM is ­determined to make sure that this can’t be allowed to happen and that we address the underlying culture in Downing Street. There were failings, we should have done better.” The Mirror told on Saturday how Mr Johnson attended some “wine time” Friday events at No.What do you think  Have your say in the comments below.

No Prime Minister is able to survive for long in high office when they trigger scorn in every home, workplace, cafe and pub. A mate of mine, a retired welder in a red wall seat, sent a reworking of a joke about a dead man at the Pearly Gates and was informed by St Peter the hands on heavenly lie clocks ticked only when fibs were heard. The pointers on those of Mother Theresa, Abraham Lincoln and Nelson Mandela had never moved. “Where’s Boris Johnson’s clock ” inquired the man. “We’re using it as a ceiling fan,” replied St Peter. Sacricing the jobs of Downing Street staff to save his own skin will not work for Johnson. It feels like when nothe is booted out of No  by Tory MPs worried about their futures. Nor is he able to cower in a fridge again as the glass door on the front of No ’s wine-time Friday cooler symbolises the charlatan having hidden in plain sight for too long.  Suitcases of booze smuggled into Downing Street, drunken shenanigans on the eve of the Duke of Edinburgh’s funeral and an unprecedented apology to Buckingham Palace have a last days of Rome vibe to them. Labour leads of up to % in the polls are encouraging the opposition to go for the jugular, Keir Starmer justiably accusing the PM of breaking the law and lying. With jilted insider Dominic Cummings orchestrating much of the onslaught, there’s an irony in Johnson as co-author of his own downfall. Labour is aware it should target the Tories as much as Johnson himself when as rising star Wes Streeting acknowledged, the opposition’s best bet’s a mortally wounded PM limping on or the Conservatives will claim they have changed under Rishi Sunak or Liz Truss.What do you think  Have your say in the comments below.From coronavirus to Brexit, our daily politics newsletter is there to guide you these turbulent times.

They successfully played the trick in Government when John Major succeeded Margaret Thatcher, Theresa May followed David Cameron then Johnson came after May. I never bought the Johnson appeal but I understood why many voters did. Brexit, his main pitch, was another lie and anyway even many who wanted to quit the European Union these days avoid talking about the mess. Whatever magic Johnson displayed is gone and isn’t ing. The steady drip of awful rule-breaking, civil servant Sue Gray’s party report, April’s tax rises and soaring energy bills and May’s local elections all threaten fresh blows for a deflated egotist who cut a beaten figure on the ropes at Prime Minister’s Questions. Lting England’s Covid restrictions will earn little credit when he’s lost credibility. Johnson’s political obituaries are being written. Only the publication date is to be decided.

He then began another relationship and was abusive to another womanJake Foot, , was jailed for  months Image: northumbria policeByDavid HuntleyGraeme Murray:,  Jan | commentsA controlling boyfriend burned a womanaposs face with a cigarette and stopped her from seeing her kids. Jake Foot threatened to kill her and during stormy relationship burned her face with the lit cigarette. When the pairaposs relationship ended he was arrested before he began another and was also violent and abusive to a separate woman. Foot, , appeared at Durham Crown Court on Friday, via a video link from HMP Durham. He was then sentenced for two counts of controlling or coercive behaviour. ChronicleLive reports that Foot entered into a relationship with a woman from Sunderland and later moved in with her. Ian West, prosecuting said the accused was a user of cannabis, but became paranoid and jealous when he couldnapost get hold of any and arguments would arise.Foot believed his girlfriend was speaking to other people on Facebook, and arguments soon turned into violence.Mr West said Foot threw a Coke bottle at the woman and then went on to smash her mobile phone. The court heard that Foot would punch doors and even stabbed a door with a kne. But things took a turn for the worst when Foot grabbed the woman by the throat and threatened to kill her. Mr West said the woman believed she was going to die, but managed to flee. Following the incident, Foot flicked a lit cigarette in her face, causing burns. Foot would also frequently take the womanaposs house keys and lock her in her home to stop her meeting other people. The woman also had children from a previous relationship, but Foot threatened her, telling her to say goodbye to your kids because youaposre not seeing them anymore before smashing her phone. Mr West said that after his violent outbursts, he would apologise and get upset, but he was not sincere. On July , last year, the woman bought a new phone, and Foot asked to use it so he could buy trainers. But instead, he went through her phone and found pictures of her children with their dad. Foot became so angry at this, he smashed the phone and punched her in the face, the court heard. The incident led the woman, who suffers from depression and anxiety, to self-harm. The day after, Foot trashed her home, causing her to tell a family member about his behaviour. Foot was then arrested and he was released under investigation. But during this time, Foot then went on to form another relationship with a woman, which went very much the same way. The relationship was peppered with assaults and Foot even ripped her earring out, tearing her ear. He also held a kne to her throat and threatened to kill her before telling her he would have raped hershe wasnapost fat and ugly. Mr West said Foot also carried out an assault on her while they were on a bus together. David Callan, defending, said Foot had no excuse for this behaviour and was sorry for what has happened. He added Foot, of Ashwood Avenue, Sunderland, was remorseful and had had a bad start in le. Judge Ray Singh jailed Foot for  months and made him subject of a five year restraining order.

Stephen, who is now living in the house, decided to document the incredible renovation for his Youtube channel @Three Eagles Recordings. Stephen told the ECHO: Iaposve been a builder for around  years now and when I first saw it I was looking online. I didnapost have any intention of going to auction but when I saw the building and the guide price of £-, I thought to myself aposwhat the hell is that apos  I thought Iaposve got to have a look at least, so I arranged to go and have a look, and I could see the potential in it because of the amount of space in the building. In my head I could see straight away the potential to cut the building in two and have a little shop as well as a house, so sort of kill two birds with one stone and then I could eventually set up a business as well. It had a lot of things going for it. I could see the bigger picture.  When he first got the keys to the property, Stephen said the building was in a pretty poor condition and the backyard was like a jungle. Stephen said: I didnapost get a structural report done before I went to auction either which was a big risk but there wasnapost enough time. By the time the estate agents organised a block viewing where everyone turns up, there was about a week before the actual auction.  Iaposve never done it before and finding someone to come and do the report and everything, I just didnapost have enough time so I just had to take a gamble on it. The worst case scenario when I did get the structural report done is he could have told me to knock the building down because it was that bad. But luckily he said aposyouaposre going to have to knock the front of the building downapos and rebuild it as that was about to fall down, so thataposs what I did in the end. Stephen did the majority of the work on the renovation himself in his spare time alongside his full-time job as a joiner. He paid a structural specialist company to do the work on the front of the building, which had to be completely rebuilt. In the last  months of the project Stephen signicantly reduced his hours at work to get the renovation completed.  He said: I did as much of the work as possible myself to keep the cost down. When I took the roof off and the front wall was down that was about two years into it because the first couple of years was just me clearing the place out, saving up more money and planning what I was going to do that was from  to  - the summer. Then when I took the roof off and I saw the bare shell and how poor the state of everything was, there was a point where I was like aposwhat the hell am I doing apos I was thinking this is going to take forever. I had to learn how to be positive put it that way.  On the ground floor of the building, Stephen, who writes and produces his own music in his spare time, plans to run an independent record label and artist residency where other musicians and DJs can come to meet each other and record their music. In the longer term, he hopes to make use of the ground floor bedrooms as part of the artist residency, where musicians can come and stay. Stephen said: I did have a vision for it. Even though it was a shop itaposs obviously been a flat above it, so it kind of had a bit of a layout that I could see in my head.It just came together really. It took a bit of time and I was spending a lot of time getting ideas on apps like Pinterest and Instagram.Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON YouTubeAppsproperty newsHousing Units\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\" to FREE email alerts from our Property Market newsletterSubscribeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Brian Gerson says his we Kellymarie Gerson and their four kids have been forced to deal with the unliveable conditions at the two-bedroom property in South East London which they compare to being like crabs in a barrel. The dad has become increasingly worried about his familyaposs health. He claims that the majority of his family have developed respiratory issues because of the thick damp that has plagued the property, which is under Optivo Housing Association.He further claims the conditions are so poor that his family are forced to pick pieces of their wet ceiling out of their food because of the paint crumbling, the Daily Star reports.  Brian also said their living situation has caused him to move out and live with his mum. The dad told the Daily Star: It has been over  years my we has had to deal with it - she first moved in with her firstborn daughter in . The mould has also brought problems such as things being ruined [such as] clothes, toys, furniture and keepsakes, so they have to be thrown away. The ceiling also flakes off bits of paint that end up everywhere from in the bath, to falling into your food while cooking.  He said his weaposs eldest child was diagnosed with asthma within the first two years of moving in and that their other childaposs health is also poor. Brian added: Her firstborn son was born premature and had to be incubated for the first two months of his le and ended up having subglottic stenosis [an issue with a childaposs airways just below their vocal cords]. This is classed as a disability since he has trouble regulating his breathing while running and playing - it has been made worse by the mould. The dad said: The pandemic also has taken its toll on the family seeing as itaposs like crabs in a barrel [with] nowhere to escape to.  With the eldest being fteen years of age, you can imagine how it [must be for her] to share a room with her younger siblings that are nine and three years old. He says that the most recent medical evidence submitted to the housing association by his we has been disregarded. Brian claims: Optivo have done the bare minimum to try and solve anything. It needs more than just a mould wash. They have also painted over the mould rather than treating it properly [and] have misplaced records of complaints and jobs that they have done in the property.  They seem to be trying to do everything possible to keep her and the kids in that property because they know that they would have a hard time getting someone to take it. They need to be named and shamed for treating them like this and I can [only] imagine how many other households have been affected by the same housing association. Optivo said in a statement: We were made aware of mould and damp in one of our homes in Brockley on  November , when reported by our resident, Ms. Gerson. We carried out an inspection on  December . We found low-level mould in rooms including the kitchen, bathroom and living space. As a result of the inspection, we’ll be attending the home on  January to complete a mould wash treatment of affected areas. This treatment is designed to kill and inhibit the growth of mould, fungi and mildew. We’ve also agreed a date of  February to redecorate the treated areas, which is the first date Ms Gerson is available.  We’ll also install a fan on  January to increase ventilation and help to stop mould growth. If Ms Gerson is looking to find a new home, she’ll need to discuss this with her local authority, who are responsible for the allocation of homes. Our Lettings Team are here to support with this process, but the decision to accept the move remains with the local authority. A member of our housing team will make contact with Ms Gerson next week to discuss options available to her. We have a record of one complaint, raised by Ms. Gerson on  November . We worked to resolve this and responded on  November  with an action plan. The complaint has since been closed due to receiving no further response from Ms. Gerson. We’ve no record of any further or misplaced complaints. We’re sorryMs. Gerson feels we’ve not met her expectations, and we’re working with her to further address the issues she’s raised.

Council officials have even headed out to find her with concerns for her safety, Birmingham Live reports.But ‘Betty Bypass’ never travels far and stays at her favourite spot in the shadow of Nick’s Sandwich Bar, a food van on the A between Rubery and Bromsgrove, near Junction  of the M. It’s been around  years since she first appeared at the roadside with her ghost-like features and nose peeling from her age.  Food van owner Nick Husband, , from Rubery, has grown attached to the strange figure over the years. He said: aposBetty Bypassapos gets a lot of attention around these parts and is seen in all sorts of places from the road with her pram. Sheaposs been around for about  years and hopefully with me for a long time to come as Betty is like family.  But the beginnings of this eerie tale start with practical joker Nick, who bought aposBettyapos the mannequin from the PDSA charity shop in Rubery High Street so he could pose her in dferent positions with a pram next to the food van. I get someone asking me every day about Betty, chuckled Nick. Some think sheaposs real, many take their photos with her and others worry about her being homeless and want to help her. A few years ago, a council officer came down saying it was on the agenda to discuss her at the next meeting as councillors had raised concerns about aposthe ladyapos.

The mum-of-two was convinced she was going to be a victim of revenge porn and believed someone had set up cameras in her house.Sarah, from Wythenshawe, would take apart all of her electrical devices because she was terried someone was going to upload an indecent video of her to Netflix. On another occasion, Sarah phoned her dad and told him to go into her loft as she was convinced she could hear people talking. Sarah also phoned the police on several occasions as she thought she could hear people whispering at the side of her house. She said: I knew they thought I was crazy. Sarah was referred to a psychiatrist and social worker and was eventually diagnosed with bipolar disorder three years ago.She has since set up a blog called Sarah OaposRourke Bipolar and Me and aims to challenge some of the stigma surrounding the condition. Sarah said: I always felt dferent but this became more apparent when I was around eight-years-old. I found building relationships dficult because I could see and feel that people were dferent to me. But as I got a little older I excused this by acknowledging my parents had separated and this may have something to do with why I felt the way I did. I was overwhelmed with sadness and loneliness and thinking about it now it is really unfortunate to feel those things at that age and it upsets me that I felt that way. Sarah recalls her teenage years consisted of smoking and drinking and at the age of , claims she was sexually exploited. She attended college and worked ious jobs, eventually landing her dream job as a special needs teaching assistant. But her manic episodes and depression continued to spiral out of control, meaning she had to leave her job to focus on her health. She said: I had been doing things that in my normal mindset I wouldnapost do. Iaposd take big risks and date men that I knew I shouldnapost. One day I was really upset and the next day you couldnapost shut me up. I was all over the place. Following her bipolar diagnosis, Sarah was taken off antidepressants and prescribed antipsychotic medication for the first time. She said: Now I have ups and downs but they are not as bad as they were. When I talk about the depression I had before I was suicidal. I still can’t really plan anything because I don’t know how I am going to feel when I wake up. Sarah says her diagnosis has inspired her to channel all the negative things that happened to her and begin a new chapter. She said: The blog is something I can do at my own pace but is informative and can help other people. The lack of understanding about bipolar even with my own friends and family has been terrible. Sarah hopes to be able to use the blog to show people what itaposs like to live with bipolar day-to-day and raise awareness of the signs and symptoms of the condition. She said: I do wish I had been diagnosed sooner. I went to see the GP purely by chance. She added: I am putting my story out there to make people think about the way they are. It might even make some people seek help for their own behaviour.

Toni Estevez moved into a refuge with her children when a previous relationship broke down before being moved into a flat.Despite being told they would ‘soon’ be moved into a house, the -year-old and her children Rene, , Amari, nine, Kayden, seven, and Lilly, three, are still waiting, reports Birmingham Live.Rene and Kayden have asthma and Toni has had to rush to AE  times after one of them has been left struggling to breathe. She puts this largely down to the mould and damp they are having to live with in their draughty first-floor flat. Toni said: There’s mould and mildew in the flat, I’m constantly cleaning. “The walls are wet to touch and you can feel a breeze coming into the sitting room windows. It took us six months to get the shower fixed as bits of concrete kept dropping in every time you washed. “I have been bidding on properties since  but for some reason I was put down as needing a five bedroom property, I’ve been fighting this for two years saying that I qualy for a four bedroom property. This has finally been changed now so I’m hoping there might be some more options available to me now. Have you been on the housing waiting list for years  If so email webnews@reachplc  “I would love the kids to be able to use the garden but it’s just not possible. It gets very hot in here in the summer. I just have to rely on the children being able to run around during their playtime at school. “I take them to parks and for picnics as much as I can but it’s hard. “When we first moved in, the housing officer said you won’t be here very long and I’ve held onto that but it’s been so long now, it’s heartbreaking.” When the family first moved in Toni promised her children they would have a new house by the next Christmas -four years ago.  She added: “That first Christmas I told my children we’d not be here next Christmas just to give them a little bit of hope - we’ve now spent four Christmases here. “Little Kayden wrote a letter to Santa at school to say he was going to be extra good and could Santa please give us a home  “I saw it and realised I’d got to stop vowing to my kids that we will move into a home because they are starting to think it’s something they are doing. Kayden grabbed me and hugged me really tight the other day and said, ‘MummyI promise to be really good will we move ’ “This journey has been an emotional rollercoaster. We just want somewhere we can call home.  When you’re homeless you don’t even get spoken to like you’re human. Because you’re in temporary accommodation people make assumptions about you. It doesn’t make me feel great, I’m not homeless through any choice of my own. “I feel like we’ve been left and forgotten about.” A Birmingham City Council spokesperson said: We are sorry for the distress caused to our tenant by the damp and mould in their flat. A contractor will visit the property to survey the problem and treat it. We are experiencing a national housing crisis and as Britain’s largest local authority this has resulted in very long waiting list as demand for our homes far exceeds supply, particularly for larger properties. The tenants housing officer will be in contact with them to discuss their housing options in line with the council’s allocation policy including renting in the private sector which is currently the quickest way to find a larger property.

Michael Hulme booked the £, four-day package stay through Hays Travel, in Newcastle.He told Stoke on Trent Live he had paid for the break in monthly instalments leading up to the trip in March last year.But when the -year-old and his partner Kerry Barlow arrived at The Gallivant Times Square hotel in the Big Apple, hotel staff told him their room had not been paid for. The  bill was then taken from Michaelaposs bank account after he used his card to pay a  security deposit. This left him with just  on his card to spend on sightseeing. The grandad-of-five promptly contacted Hays Travel, who told him he would receive a refund within  days. But it meant he couldnapost afford to pay for attractions - such as Top of The Rock - and was forced to ask family to lend him some cash. The Abbey Hulton security guard said: The trip was a surprise for my partner and a once-in-a-letime break as it was somewhere she had always wanted to go. I paid for the package holiday in monthly instalments and it was all paid up by March, . But when we got to the hotel they said our room had not been paid for. I told them I would ring the travel agent up the next day and I paid a  security deposit for the room. When we got up the next day and went to do a bit of shopping my card kept getting declined and I couldnapost understand why. When we got back to the hotel and checked the banking app it said the hotel had taken  from us.  I went to the reception and they said they had taken the money to pay for the room. They said not to worry and that they would reimburse the money when the travel agent had paid. I got in touch with Hays Travel and they said by the looks of it, the holiday had been cancelled and re-booked. But as far as I was concerned it had been paid for. If it had been cancelled why were we still told we could still go on the holiday I think it may have been cancelled and re-booked because ofCovid.But the travel agent said they would look into it and see what was going on.At pm reception rang us. They said the travel agent had sent the payment through and I had been reimbursed - but it can take up to  days. We were only there for four days and couldnapost wait  days, that was our spending money for attractions. I only had  left on my card. Thankfully I had  in cash that we could use for food. Michael says he suffered panic attacks after realising they had been left with just  for sightseeing and tourist attractions. He was forced to ask his partneraposs brother for money so the couple could carry on enjoying the trip. He received the refund after arriving back home, but says the break was spoiled by the money worries and he feels let down by Hays Travel. Michael said: I suffer a bit with depression and my anxiety kicked in. You go all that way expecting no problems, but we were stuck out there in this situation and my partner was in tears. I was in a right mess, I didnapost know what we could do. I rang the travel agent and they said sorry, and askedthere were any friends or family members that could help us. I canapost go round asking my children for money. Youaposre talking £ or more and I know they havenapost got that kind of money. We got in touch with my partneraposs brother and he sent us  so we could continue doing the ious things we wanted to do in New York. We still missed half of the attractions we wanted to do because we couldnapost afford it. I spoke to the travel agents when we got back because I was still fuming. Someone should be held responsible for what happened to us. Iaposm not going to use Hays Travel again. It was very stressful and I donapost want anyone  to go through the same thing. It just spoiled the holiday. Hays Travel has apologised to Michael and handed the couple £ as a gesture of goodwill. It says it was unaware of the issue until Michael called them from New York. A spokesman said: We were extremely sorry to hear of the mix-up regarding Mr Hulme’s hotel arrangements. We arranged for him to receive a full refund, plus compensation, as quickly as possible. Hays Travel has blamed the hotel for the mistake, but the hotel says the reservation had been cancelled on March  last year. The Gallivant Times Square hotel said: This reservation was cancelled by a third-party website on March , .

In this apartment, the Duke of York had a bed piled high with stuffed animals and toys, Page claims. He said: “It had about  or  stuffed toys positioned on the bed and basically there was a card the inspector showed us in a drawer and it was a picture of these bears all in situ. “The reason for the laminated picture wasthose bears weren’t put back in the right order by the maids, he would shout and scream.” One royal writer was introduced to the strange collection at Buckingham Palace in .  Elizabeth Day said of the bizarre meeting: It seemed rather strange that a grown man should be so amused by a stuffed toy.” The new show - Ghislaine, Prince Andrew and the Paedophile - is being aired on ITV on Tuesday at pm. In the programme, ITV says Singh unravels the story of how an entitled daughter of a billionaire sank into shame and disgrace through her friendship with paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. It will also explore how Prince Andrew, the Queenaposs second son, is now embroiled in the scandal as he faces his own possible civil court case brought by Virginia Giuffre Andrew has strenuously denied the allegations made by Ms Giuffre against him.  Page also recalled suspecting that Andrew and pimp Ghislaine were lovers because she would come and go from his quarters at will.Page, who is not without scandal himself after being jailed for a £million fraud scam in , said Ghislaine and Andrewaposs other female friends rarely signed in, The Sun Online reports.Again, speaking with Singh, Page said: “From the way she was allowed to enter and exit the palace at will, we suspected that she may have had an intimate relationship with Prince Andrew.”  He continued: “She kept coming in and out, in and out.” It comes after reports claimed Prince Andrew was tearful when the Queen told him she was stripping him of his honorary military titles. The Duke of York was said to be utterly devastated by his mother’s bombshell decision. The move came after a US judge ruled a civil case in New York against Andrew by his sex accuser Ms Giuffre can go ahead. Andrew strenuously denies any wrongdoing. The princeaposs lawyers want to quiz Ms Giuffreaposs psychologist to seehis accuser is suffering from  memories of meeting him.  It was quickly ridiculed by legal experts who described it as a “typical tactic” used in historic sexual abuse cases, and one Ghislaine Maxwell used at her trial. But Andrew’s lawyers are determined to grill Ms Giuffre’s therapist Dr Judith Lightfoot on the “theory of  memories” as well as matters discussed during their sessions, notes taken and any prescriptions given. The lawyers state that the royal “contends that [Ms Giuffre] may suffer from  memories, as evidenced by the fact that her claims regarding her time with Epstein, and the circumstances under which [Prince Andrew] allegedly assaulted her, have repeatedly changed over the years”.Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Prince Andrew, Duke of YorkITVBuckingham PalaceDocumentariesRoyal FamilyToysGhislaine MaxwellJeffrey Epstein\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Megan and Archie have not ed to the UK since the couple walked away from royal le in , while Lilibet has yet to set foot in the country where her dad was born. Lawyers acting for the Duke of Sussex say they will seek a judicial reviewcontinued security is not provided when he and his family visit. In a statement his legal team said Harryaposs security was compromised last summer when he unveiled a statue of his mother, Princess Diana, at Kensington Palace. It said that Harry - who inherited a security threat at birth - is unable toto his home with his family, saying they have been subjected to well-documented neo-Nazi and extremist threats. Without police protection, lawyers said, bringing Meghan and the children over comes at too great a personal risk. The Duke has ed to the UK twice in the last two years - for the statue unveiling in July last year and Prince Philipaposs funeral three months earlier - but Meghan and the children have stayed in the US both times. Harry is arguing his private protection team in the US does not have adequate jurisdiction abroad or access to UK intelligence information which is needed keep the Sussex family safe.  The UK will always be Prince Harryaposs home and a country he wants his we and children to be safe in, the statement said. The Duke has filed a claim for a judicial review against a Home Office decision not to allow him to personally pay for police protection while in the UK. His representatives said British taxpayers will not have to foot the bill, but said a private security team cannot replicate the protection needed.  It added that he had first offered to pay for police protection for himself and his family in January , but the offer was not accepted. During last summeraposs visit to London, Harryaposs car was chased by photographers - an incident that has made him anxious about his safety. A source told the Mail on Sunday: aposHarryaposs argument in a nutshell is: aposYou got the law wrong.apos He feels the decision to remove his security was wrong. Pre-action protocol was sent by Harryaposs lawyers to the Home Office a couple of months ago. This is essentially a precursor to a judicial review. If the case goes forward it could lead to a legal battle in the High Court between Government ministers and the Duke.  The statement in full Prince Harry inherited a security risk at birth, for le. He remains sixth in line to the throne, served two tours of combat duty in Afghanistan, and in recent years his family has been subjected to well-documented neo-Nazi and extremist threats. While his role within the institution has changed, his profile as a member of the royal family has not. Nor has the threat to him and his family.The Duke and Duchess of Sussex personally fund a private security team for their family, yet that security cannot replicate the necessary police protection needed whilst in the UK. In the absence of such protection, Prince Harry and his family are unable toto his home.The duke first offered to pay personally for UK police protection for himself and his family in January of  at Sandringham. That offer was dismissed. He remains willing to cover the cost of security, as not to impose on the British taxpayer. As is widely known, others who have left public office and have an inherent threat risk receive police protection at no cost to them. The goal for Prince Harry has been simple - to ensure the safety of himself and his family while in the UK so his children can know his home country.  During his last visit to the UK in July  - to unveil a statue in honour of his late mother - his security was compromised due to the absence of police protection, whilst leaving a charity event. After another attempt at negotiations was also rejected, he sought a judicial review in September  to challenge the decision-making behind the security procedures, in the hopes that this could be re-evaluated for the obvious and necessary protection required. The UK will always be Prince Harryaposs home and a country he wants his we and children to be safe in. With the lack of police protection, comes too great a personal risk. Prince Harry hopes that his petition - after close to two years of pleas for security in the UK - will resolve this situation. It is due to a leak in a UK tabloid, with surreptitious timing, we feel it necessary to release a statement setting the facts straight.

The Duke of Sussex’s unprecedented move of threatening to sue the government is both breathtaking and utterly baffling. Those in royal circles have almost universally questioned the play at hand, not only in its nature but equally in execution. True enough, with his background in the military and his position in one of the most famous families in the world – and celebrity lestyle – Prince Harry and his family are arguably high profile targets.  But to suggest he is at a greater risk at home than abroad, where he has chosen to base himself, surely holds very little weight. Indeed the manner of this row seems even more bizarre that it is still being argued two years on from being granted his wish to up and leave his royal role, on the understanding that you can’t have everything you want. This is all before even considering the effect on the Queen, who we are told has been made aware of her grandson’s latest bright idea just as she emerges from one of her most tumultuous periods of recent years. She faced her first Christmas without her beloved husband before wielding the axe on her son Prince Andrew’s royal career.What do you think  Have your say in our comments below... The decision to banish him into the wilderness, arguably a couple of years behind schedule, would not have come easy no matter the depths of his fall from grace. Now, just three weeks away from the beginning of her Platinum Jubilee year, Her Majesty is facing down another petulant member of her family for reasons she would be forgiven for assuming had been sorted.

The couple, who live in Calornia with their children Archie, two, and seven-month-old Lilibet, fund their own security there. The Duke of Sussex claimed he is effectively in exile because it is “unsafe” for his family toto the UK. He claims his private security arrangements are not enough to ensure his family’s safety and privacy here.  The Sun reports that a royal source said the Queen will not help her grandson in his demands for Met Police protection.A royal source said: “This is not a matter for Her Majesty. She certainly won’t cave in to his demands. “It is a matter for Her Majesty’s government. Who gets protection is not a gt the Queen can decide to give or take away.” Another said: “His demands for security in the UK have not been openly or widely discussed within the family because it was thought sorted two years ago.

This week it was announced that the Queen had revoked his honorary military titles and can no longer use the title His Royal Highness. It comes after a US judged threw out his latest attempt to have a civil case brought by Virginia Giuffre thrown out. Ms Giuffre, now , claims that she was forced to have sex with the Duke three times when she was a apossex slaveapos of Andrewaposs paedophile pal Jeffrey Epstein as a teenager. The Duke of York vehemently denies the allegations. In recent weeks his legal team have tried numerous times to get the case thrown out, or to discredit Ms Giuffre, who they have claimed is seeking another payday at his expense.  Ms Giuffreaposs legal representative said his client is determined to face the royal in court after judge Lewis Kaplan said her civil case can proceed. The mum-of-three is seeking undisclosed damages from Andrew, who she was pictured with in an infamous photograph believed to have been taken in , when she was . It means Andrew could be compelled to answer questions about her claims in a civil court in the autumn. Here we look at some of the attempts the Duke and his team have made to prevent the court showdown from happening. . Claiming Virginia Giuffre may have  memoriesAs the Sunday Mirror reports today, Andrew’s lawyers want to quiz Ms Giuffre’s psychologist to seehis accuser is ­suffering from “ memories” of meeting HIM.The extraordinary move emerged in legal documents filed late on Friday in the Duke of York’s looming civil court battle with Ms Giuffre. But he claims he doesn’t remember meeting her – despite the infamous photo of him with his arm around her. It was quickly ridiculed by legal experts who described it as a “typical tactic” used in historic sexual abuse cases, and one Ghislaine Maxwell used at her trial.  But Andrew’s lawyers are determined to grill Ms Giuffre’s therapist Dr Judith Lightfoot on the “theory of  memories” as well as matters discussed during their sessions, notes taken and any prescriptions given. The lawyers state that the royal “contends that [Ms Giuffre] may suffer from  memories, as evidenced by the fact that her claims regarding her time with Epstein, and the circumstances under which [Prince Andrew] allegedly assaulted her, have repeatedly changed over the years”. The move bizarrely links to the Duke of York’s stance in his  car crash Newsnight interview where he claimed to have “no recollection” of meeting Ms Giuffre.. Attempting to rely on secret deal made with paedophile Jeffrey Epstein One avenue Andrewaposs legal team used to try and get the case thrown out was a , settlement made between Ms Giuffre and his former pal Epstein. In a  deal which was unsealed earlier this year, the financier and child trafficker agreed to pay Ms Giuffre after she accused him of sexual abuse. One key clause in the deal suggested that Ms Giuffre would be barred from taking action against any other parties linked to Epstein.  This, the Dukeaposs lawyers argued, would have included Andrew himself. The settlement included an agreement to remise, release, acquit, satisfy and forever discharge the said second parties and any other person or entity who could have been included as a potential defendant … from all, and all manner of, action and actions of Virginia , including state or federal, cause and causes of action”. But Judge Kaplan was having none of it. Epstein, he said, was only out to protect himself, he ruled, and this aspect of the agreement did not prevent Ms Giuffre from pursuing a civil claim against Andrew. Judge Kaplan said that settlement was too ambiguous to protect the royal. . Arguing Ms Giuffre could not sue as she lived in Australia Another technicality which Andrewaposs team hoped could prevent the case continuing was the fact that Ms Giuffre no longer lives in the US. This, lawyers claimed, meant that she could not legally take action through a US court.  The Dukeaposs lawyer Andrew B Brettler, called for the case to be halted at the end of last month. He wrote: “Recently discovered evidence suggests that the court does not have subject matter jurisdiction over this action because plaintf Virginia L Giuffre cannot satisfy the elements of ersity jurisdiction. “Notwithstanding that, in her complaint Ms Giuffre alleges she is a citizen of the state of Colorado the evidence demonstrates that she is actually domiciled in Australia, where she has lived for all but two of the past  years.” Again, this legal argument did not get very far. . aposHidingapos to prevent lawsuit being served on himBack when the civil case was launched, Andrew was accused of hiding to avoid the lawsuit being served on him.Security personnel repeatedly stopped officials trying to hand the Duke of York the documents at the Royal Lodge in August, it was claimed. Ms Giuffreaposs lawyers said the papers had been handed to a Met Police officer at the Royal Lodge in Windsor on August . But they claimed the agent was told police told them they were not able to accept served court papers, or let anyone serve them on the property. It led to Ms Giuffreaposs lawyers seeking intervention from Judge Kaplan, claiming Prince Andrew was playing game of hide and seek behind palace walls.  . Claiming not have met Ms GiuffreDuring his car-crash BBC Panorama interview back in , Andrew claimed he had no recollection of ever meeting Ms Giuffre.Rubbishing her allegations that she had been forced into having sex with him, Andrew said: I have no recollection of ever meeting this lady. None, whatsoever. He was pressed by interviewer Emily Maitlis, who asked him: You donapost remember meeting her  The Duke replied: No. Years earlier a photo had emerged of Andrew with his arms around Ms Giuffre with Ghislaine Maxwell in the background. However his circle have long suggested it is a fake - alleging that his fingers were not chubby enough to be his in the image. A palace source said Andrew has “absolutely no recollection” of the photo being taken and “seriously doubts” it is genuine. “Look at his fingers,” they said. “The duke has chubby fingers, they don’t look right, nor does the height of the duke and the girl. His legal team have asked to have the original photo so they can carry out their own investigation. They seriously doubt its veracity. The duke is adamant and has been consistent since  that he does not recall ever meeting Miss Roberts, let alone the photo being taken.” “Many close to the duke, who know him well, believe this is a witch-hunt based on absolutely no evidence.” . Pizza Express alibi and claims he could not sweat  Two of the claims in Andrewaposs  Panorama interview that drew the most attention were his claim that he was at a Pizza Express restaurant on one of the nights he is claimed to have had sex with Ms Giuffre - and his claim he cannot sweat. Quizzed about Ms Giuffreaposs claim that the prince sweated heavily on the night in , Andrew claimed to have a medical condition that meant he could not sweat. In legal documents related to the civil case, Ms Giuffreaposs lawyers David Boies and Sigrid McCawley called on the Duke to hand over all documents concerning your alleged medical condition of anhidrosis, hypohidrosis, or your inability to sweat. His lawyers refused, however, on the grounds that it is harassing and seeks confidential and private information and documents that are irrelevant, immaterial and not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. Similarly the Duke has not presented any evidence proving he was at Pizza Express on March ,  - the night Ms Giuffre claims he partied in a West End nightclub before having sex with her. His lawyers responded: “Defendant is unable to comply with Request No.  because no such documents exist in his possession, custody or control. A diligent search and a reasonable inquiry have been made in an effort to comply with this demand.”Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Prince Andrew, Duke of YorkRoyal Family\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Residents say the nine blocks look half-built and the windows protrude with numbers which are written in paint outside fats.And after more than four years on from the Grenfell fire in London, occupants have yet to see any replacement cladding.The blocks are can be seen from all over Salford, Manchester, but residents say the real nightmare lies inside their walls.. Lynne Broughton has lived in Thorn Court for  years. and only in the last few years she has wanted to leave.Itaposs cold, no matter how much you put the heating on itaposs freezing. I have to put blankets around my legs. I was dreading this Christmas. We have get through another winter, she told Manchester Evening News. After living in fear for years following Grenfell, the type of flammable cladding which caused the lethal inferno was finally removed from the apartment blocks in Salford in September .  The residents may no longer be living in fear of fire - but now theyaposre living in fear of the cold and the meter. This is because the buildingaposs heating system depends on the cladding to retain heat. Without it, draughts whip through the flats, which have around  residents, at a time when the cost of energy is rocketing. Before, when Iaposd switch the heating on, in half-an-hour it would be as warm as toast, Lynne said. Now, she says as soon as she walks into her flat apositaposs like being outsideapos, even though she always puts the heating on. Lynneaposs bought thick curtains, keeps her blinds down, and has put bubble wrap below her windows to try and stop the draught. But the cold isnapost the only issue caused by the cladding being removed. Many of the residents have water coming in through their exposed windows too. Ours is p***ing with rain and itaposs freezing, Lynne said of her flat. Iaposd say the majority of the block, Iaposd say itaposs the cold and the draughts and the water, she said.  If there was plenty of houses I think I would have moved out. Itaposs two years down now. Weaposre still in the cold. Whoaposs to say weaposll get the cladding later this year  They should have never have done what they did. If you donapost live in these blocks you donapost know what itaposs like. They donapost give a s**t, weaposre the poor people. Residents had previously been told that the cladding would be replaced by . Pendleton Together has now said that works are set to be complete by  - a whole two years behind schedule. Not everyone can afford the extra money thataposs needed to heat their homes. The Manchester Evening News spoke to one single mum-of-three, who doesnapost want to be named, who says she hasnapost turned her heating on for aposwell over a yearapos. She said: I donapost put the heating on at all. I sit in blankets and make the kids wrap up. I canapost afford it.  She has a newborn baby, a three-year-old and a five-year-old and wants to get out - to a flat with more than two bedrooms - and to somewhere she can afford to heat. Iaposm a single parent, where am I going to get the money to go private  she said. Instead, she survives day-by-day by spending as little time in her flat as possible. She leaves the house at am in the morning and makes her way to the warmth of her mumaposs house and doesnapostuntil itaposs time to take her children to bed. Rachel, who lives at the top of Thorn Court, says she doesnapost use her living room anymore, and has to watch TV in bed. Itaposs cold like outside. You spend most of your time in your bedroom because itaposs the warmest place, but Iaposd like to sit in the living room and chill out. It used to be dead warm but now itaposs freezing cold. You just have to put blankets on and keep the curtains shut and stuff like that, she said. Hundreds of residents across the nine blocks of flats are taking legal action against Pendleton Together, the Private Finance Initiative contractor which manages the council properties. They are claiming the properties are aposunfit for human habitationapos - mostly down to the cold. Martin Eithne and Martin Crowson are two of them. The retired couple live in Holm Court and chair the blockaposs residents association. They say that they were paying £ a week in electricity bills when the cladding was on. Now, they say theyaposre paying £.  Itaposs down to them to pay us back, Eithne said. Martin says that the biggest issue people are facing in his block is that the electric is aposcosting a fortuneapos. If you put your heating on it costs a fortune, around £ a day extra, he said. Thereaposs people that stay in bed earlier and get out of bed later because of the cladding. They canapost put the heat on because they canapost afford they canapost afford to put the heating on. Pendleton Together is giving the residents £ every two months during the winter. But everyone the M.E.N. spoke to said it was not enough. Robert Vaudrey lives in Holm Court with his we Pamela and their four-year-old daughter April. We moved in with the baby, it was our first home together, he said. The biggest problem is the heating. Since the cladding got removed, weaposre putting in £ a week.  He says the aposgesture amountsapos of money heaposs been given arenapost enough - and aposdonapost even cover a monthaposs worthapos. The payments arenapost even touching the sides, he said. Weaposve got a littlaposun. Keeping a four-year-old dressed, trying to explain that itaposs cold, itaposs just ridiculous. The heating costs so much that Pamela had the idea of covering the thermostat up with a flannel. Itaposs so the computer thinks itaposs warmer than it is. Weaposve set it to  degrees, once it goes below it takes a daft amount of money from us, Robert said. The heating may be a winter issue - but it affects the family during the summer months as well. It costs an awful lots of money, money we save up for during the summer. We have to save up. During the summer weaposve got no money to spend, Robert said. Matthew Condrad, the director of Tenant Claim, says that aposall nine of the flats have got the same issuesapos. He claims there are around  people living in the Pendleton flats - and  of them have gone to him for legal help. He said: The buildings are fitted with NIBE heating system which operates at a low temperature and relies upon the cladding to retain heat. Removal of the cladding has therefore caused excess cold which has been exacerbated by draughts around windows and ventilation ducts. The windows do not open properly and constitute a hazard. Some have also fallen out. Matthew has put forward some test cases from the Pendleton flats - andsuccessful - others will follow. But he admits that itaposs a process that could take years. And he believes that evenhe wins the case, Pendleton Together will appeal, as aposthereaposs a lot of money at stakeapos. The cladding may even be replaced by the time the cases enter the courtroom. Lynne from Thorn Court is certainly sceptical. She fears that as she accepted the apostokenapos amount of money from Pendleton Together her case would fail. She also points out, thatthe case ends up taking five years to settle, lots of the elderly claimants aposwill have carked it by A spokesperson from Pendleton Together said: Pendleton Together understands that our residents have concerns during the programme of fire safety works and we are working with them to offer support or to direct them towards services that can offer further help. As part of this support Pendleton Together Operating Limitedis providing fairly calculated winter energy payments that mitigate the dference in electricity consumption. This will mean that no resident is left out of pocket due to this dference. that timeapos. We have received reports of water ingress in some of our properties and we have responded to these. All known issues have been or are being addressed, however residents with any new concerns should contact us immediately or book a repair via our website. In relation to the timeframe for replacement of cladding, within days of the tragedy at Grenfell, Pendleton Together and Salford City Council committed to removing all cladding and insulation on our nine blocks and replacing them with safe alternatives. Unfortunately, due to well documented issues around clarity of regulation and ability to secure funding, that affects landlords nationwide, the work has taken longer than anticipated. All of the cladding has now been removed and necessary preparatory works are taking place prior to the reinstatement of cladding which is expected to start on some of our blocks in the next few months. The programme of fire safety works, which includes the replacement of cladding, the installation of sprinklers and heat detectors and other internal mitigation works is set to complete in . We are very sorry for the inconvenience and disruption that our residents are feeling. We have a dedicated team supporting our residents and keeping them informed and are doing our very best to put things in place to mitigate any disturbance. If any resident has any concerns they should contact their Resident Liaison Officer as soon as possible.

There have been a series of discussions between culture secretary Nadine Dorries and BBC chiefs about how the broadcaster will be funded going forward.The culture secretary said the next announcement concerning the BBC’s licence fee “will be the last” as a new funding model is being considered for when the latest deal expires in .Here’s everything you need to know about the TV licence including why you need to pay it and what happensthe BBC gets rid of it.What is the BBCaposs TV licence fee and why do we have to pay it  TV licensing is a form of taxation which is used to raise revenue that funds the BBC. The money raised from the licence fee pays for BBC shows and services - including TV, radio, the BBC website, podcasts, iPlayer, local journalism and apps.Watching live TV without a licence is against the law and is punishable by a fine of up to £, as well as prosecution.

Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have been living in the USA since  after formally stepping away from active Royal duties, sacricing the benefit of security provided by the British state.But now the prince has said he doesnapost feel the UK is a safe place for him and his family toto without the protection supplied and paid for by the government. At the time of writing, the couple pays for their own private security in the USA, where they live in Calornia.However, now he says that toto the UK without police protection would carry too great a personal risk. Harryaposs grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II, has also reportedly refused to pay for his security.Harry has argued that his US-based security team doesnapost have access to UK intelligence that would enable them to offer the best protection, and instead feels they have insufficient jurisdiction in the UK. Why does Prince Harry no longer get security for his family in the UK   The Prince and his we lost their protection, which was funded by the taxpayer, when they stepped away from senior royal duties in . Speaking to the Mail on Sunday a source said: Harryaposs argument in a nutshell is: aposYou got the law wrong.apos He feels the decision to remove his security was wrong. Pre-action protocol was sent by Harryaposs lawyers to the Home Office a couple of months ago. This is essentially a precursor to a judicial review. What has Prince Harry requested regarding security for his family in the UK   Harry wants to be able to pay for security provided by the British state. On the princeaposs behalf, a statement said: “The UK will always be Prince Harry’s home and a country he wants his we and children to be safe in, adding, Prince Harry hopes that his petition - after close to two years of pleas for security in the UK - will resolve this situation. As part of an official statement, the princeaposs legal spokesperson said: Prince Harry inherited a security risk at birth, for le. He remains sixth in line to the throne, served two tours of combat duty in Afghanistan, and in recent years his family has been subjected to well-documented neo-Nazi and extremist threats. While his role within the institution has changed, his profile as a member of the royal family has not. Nor has the threat to him and his family.  “The Duke and Duchess of Sussex personally fund a private security team for their family, yet that security cannot replicate the necessary police protection needed whilst in the UK. In the absence of such protection, Prince Harry and his family are unable toto his home. “The duke first offered to pay personally for UK police protection for himself and his family in January of  at Sandringham. That offer was dismissed. He remains willing to cover the cost of security, so as not to impose on the British taxpayer. As is widely known, others who have left public office and have an inherent threat risk receive police protection at no cost to them. “The goal for Prince Harry has been simple – to ensure the safety of himself and his family while in the UK so his children can know his home country.” Following a visit to the UK for the unveiling of a statue of his late mum, Princess Diana, his car was chased by photographers leaving him feeling anxious about the state of his security in the UK.

They say that your name influences the sort of person you will become, which is why itaposs so important to take your time whittling down your list before picking one for your own child. But before you make your choice, a school reception worker has shared her brutal opinion on what your kidsapos names really mean - and she didnapost hold back.Manda Dee, who is best known as @theschoolofficelady on TikTok, has posted a series of videos on the names she likes and dislikes.First up for the boys was Liam - but it also applies to any boy with an aposL name.apos Your child cries... cries a lot and those tears arenapost real, she said. For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. Boys called Jack got off lightly as she called them incredibly hyperactive and crazy. Hayden is running someoneaposs le. I donapost knowit is the teacheraposs or yours - youaposve gotta tone it down, youaposve gotta stop spoiling that child. Then she roasts the name, Rex. You thought it was it was like a dogsapos name so you thought he was going to be happy-go-lucky, she started. Heaposs overly opinionated and he inserts his comments when they arenapost necessary. Tone it down. Next up was Xavier, as she said: I donapost knowheaposs not listening or he just canapost hear me. Xander was also met with criticism. I donapost know how to say this, she said. You thought Xander was going to be a girl. He wasnapost... he was another boy. She said boys named Emmitt never listen to their mums, Jadens try to kiss girls in the years above and those named Elijah donapost take part in group work because theyaposre too busy talking to their teachers about the show Dr Phil and basketball. Isaac or any less common bible names like Cain, Abel and Caleb,a first-grade classes Legos are missing, theyaposre probably in his pockets, she said. And finally we have Daniel. Daniel left his coat in the playground again and probably one of his shoes. Then it was time for her to judge the girls names. Girls called Lexi are sneaky, so sneaky, while Paisley is super cute... from far away. But sheaposs a hot mess. Olivia youaposre a sweetheart now, but youaposre gonna be a b***h once you get to high school, she said. Penelope is so cute but sheaposs left her bear at the resort again and youaposve got to drive back four hours and get it. She is so forgetful. Sheaposs the Daniel of girls. But she didnapost stop there. Hazel, Ruth, Evelyn, Lilith, basically all of the old, old lady names, you need to stop correcting me child and your mum needs a nice glass of wine and a long walk in the sunshine. She added: Any name that implies innocence - Heaven, Angel, Purity, Charity - your child is the opposite, your child is the devil. But what does she think about Sophies and Sophias  Manda said theyaposre often the cutest, nicest, smartest girls until they get into trouble, they stab their friends in the back and throw everyone under the bus. Charlotte. Be sure to check Charlotteaposs backpack before she gets to class today because itaposs likely thereaposs a dead bird in there that she found on the way to school, Manda declared. Ava is definitely the Isaiah of the girl names. Sheaposs so cute but sheaposs such a liar. Manda explained that Amanda will spill their sisteraposs nail polish on the classroom rug and will blame it on another kid. Isabella refuses to wear her sneakers to gym, instead she wants to wear her Ana and Elsa sparkly jelly flats.Have you got a story to share We want to hear all about it.

Scott Waring is a space buff and runs the website UFO Sightings Daily, and there he shared a blown-up version of the image where you could see a reddish object that he claims is an alien spacecraft. He said that after careful analysis, he was sure it wasnapost the moon, and whatever it was it was much, much larger than the ISS in the foreground, as the Daily Star reports.Scott said that he monitors the space stationaposs live stream and has done for the past six years, so he knows a rare sighting when he sees one. What do you think of Scottaposs sighting  Let us know in the comments...Publishing his find on Wednesday, stunned Scott said: Watch this live space station footage taken today and you will see a close up of a huge sphere UFO rising up in earths orbit. Itaposs not the moon. The moon is five times bigger and bright. This object is much smaller, oval in shape and has some unique red green colours to it. The teacher from Taiwan believes there is no other explanation for what was picked up on camera, other than an extraterrestrial controlled spaceship.

Goodbye. However, a few people defended the guy and said she was a red flag for mocking and exposing him online. And  Whataposs the problem  asked one person. Another said: Red flag.

One woman became so fed up of scrubbing her tiles and feel like they never looked clean, that she decided to come up with her own solution and weaposve got to say, itaposs pretty genius. DIY lover Gee opted to take a small paintbrush and paint the grouting black at a cost of just £, and it looks absolutely amazing. For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here.Posting from her TikTok handle @thesevenwonderzx, she explained: When the grout just never looked clean enough no matter how hard I scrubbed. I decided to paint the grout.In the clip, Gee can be seen carefully painting the grouting between the white tiles, before scrubbing away any excess paint, adding: Scrub, scrub, more scrubbing - send help! Fortunately, the end result was well worth it, and the TikToker was left with clean-looking bathroom tiles that could easily be mistaken for being brand-spanking-new. I love it, Gee concluded, and unsurprisingly, hundreds of other TikTok users agreed. Wow, it looks so much better - I love this, one person commented, while another added: Definitely trust the process! Love this! Meanwhile, others commented to say they regularly use a write grout pen to paint over the marks which are left between the tiles, which is also such an amazing hack.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

Following what she calls a strict military regime – which saw her take daily am visits to the gym and embark on km walks, working out for two-and-a-half hours a day – the mum-of-one managed to shed six stone in nine months.Despite being in better physical shape than before she had children, Alex says her meals are now bigger than what they were before – but packed with nutritious ingredients. She found out she was pregnant at the end of  and says midway through her pregnancy she began to eat unhealthily, causing her to pile on the pounds. “I really stacked on the weight – I was working long hours as a dental nurse and would eat McDonaldaposs at least once a day,” Alex, a former dental nurse, said.  I was starting early I’d usually get hash brown, egg and bacon muffin and hot chocolate for breakfast. And then for lunch I’d order a Quarter Pounder or Big Mac meal, a chocolate sundae and extra chicken nuggets with mayo. My mental health throughout most of my pregnancy was fine, however I did struggle towards the end realising how much weight I had gained and not recognising myself.” Alex welcomed her daughter in May  – but found herself feeling uncomfortable with her body. She said: I didnapost want to go out anywhere to show her off, I just wanted to hide away. I felt guilty Iaposd given birth to a beautul baby girl but I was so embarrassed about how I looked so never wanted my picture taken with her. I constantly heard was aposyour body will never be the sameapos and aposyou will always have a mum tum, learn to love itapos.  I didnapost want to be like that, so I used it as motivation. Alex decided that enough was enough and began to get in shape by hitting the gym and overhauling her diet. She said: I worked my a** off at the gym going at am every morning and going for km walks every day. At first I was really strict on my diet. I probably went too hard and developed somewhat of an eating disorder.  Iaposve now worked out a healthy relationship with food and exercise. Before I was only eating three small meals a day. Now I have larger meals and snacks. I donapost really count macros, or calories. I just try to eat mainly whole foods, regularly. I eat three main meals a day and have a snack in the morning which may be a protein bar, protein shake or a bit of fruit. In the afternoon I snack on a yoghurt but I try to listen to my body. I no longer turn down opportunities to eat out, and enjoy treats without guilt.  Alongside her healthy diet, Alex decided to ditch cardio and HIIT workouts in favour of weight training in a bid to gain lean muscle. She has currently shed six stone – and is healthier than ever. Her impressive weight loss has even let Alex change careers, swapping dental nursing for the glamourous le of an OnlyFans model.  She said: I saw it as a good source of income being a single mum having my daughter majority of the time. Now I can spend my days with Alora, and still make a good income. Alex shared a video documenting her weight loss to her , TikTok followers, who showered the mum-of-one with praise. One TikTok user said: This is what hard work and discipline looks like queens! Good job mumma. A second follower added: I literally gasped, this is amazing. Such an amazing transformation. Well done,” said another fan. One inspired viewer commented: Youaposre doing amazing Alex, itaposs empowering watching you.” While someone  said: Yes mama. You look awesome. Speaking about how her journey may inspire others, Alex added: I really want to show other mums what you can achieve when you set goals and are determined enough to achieve them. I also want people to know that itaposs important not to neglect self-care just because youaposre a mother – youaposre allowed to treat yourself and do things just for yourself.

According to investigators there was a network of dozens of scammers who brought people from across Italy to a vaccination centre in Ancona. There people would pay about £ for the fake jab before being handed a aposgreen passapos which shows proof that a person has been vaccinated. One nurse at the Paolinelli sports centre vaccine centre was caught squirting a dose of the vaccine into a rubbish bin before sticking a plaster on to the patient so it looked authentic.  The police unit in Ancona, which is in north east Italy, uncovered people who wanted to avoid having the vaccine before bribing a -year-old nurse who ran a vaccination centre. A video of the fraud shows the nurse and the patient pretending to get the injection when she in fact reaches over and injects the contents of the syringe into a bin. The nurse was later arrested and put into preventive custody, while four people including a -old-lawyer from Ancona who acted as intermediaries for the scam were placed under house arrest. Police are investigating about  people as part of their operation, which was launched in December last year, and they have been ordered not to leave the region and to present themselves on a daily basis to the local force. The gang were charged with wasting public resources as well as undermining the effectiveness of the public health work of the Italian national health system in order to tackle the spread of Covid. Police also seized £,that had been gained from people who had fraudulently paid for the fake vaccine.

But they remain a vital part of our phone network.“If Ofcom decides to remove the veto of local authorities, then we must do all we can to strengthen their criteria for retaining the public call boxes.“Scottish Borders Council already has a very effective set of criteria that they have applied locally, and I think these should be adopted by Ofcom nationally.“I have made these points very clear in my consultation response.”Leader of Scottish Borders Council, Cllr Mark Rowley, said: \"Rural phone boxes still have a role whilst some areas - like the box  yards from my home in a remote Berwickshire village remain mobile not-spots and are close to recreational routes..remove“Storm Arwen showed just how fragile our communications are. The odd analogue phone still worked when mobile masts were out of power, fibre broadband was dead and power cut all telephony.“Ofcom now has a great opportunity here to ensure that all rural communities that need it get a community connectivity hub with an updated phone box with a reserve power supply which could be a leline in remote areas and for those travelling through them.“Scottish Borders Council has always made a robust case to retain such vital infrastructure, we now ask that it be updated to be able to respond to the challenges our infrastructure clearly faces and I welcome support of our MPs to help make that case to Ofcom.”"},{"url":null,"title":"20mph-limits-borders-council-vehicle-clocked-58mph-data-suggests","story":"A COUNCIL vehicle was clocked travelling at mph in a mph zone in the Borders, figures obtained via a Freedom of Informationrequest suggest.Last month, elected members backed plans to make the limits – which had been introduced as part of trial – permanent across the region.According to the data released by the local authority, between November - a total of  council vehicles fitted with trackers broke the mph speed restrictions.Responding to the figures, a Scottish Borders Councilspokesperson said that there were “some discrepancies” where vehicles were logged in mph zones when actually on mph roads.:Class A drugs seized following police operation in HawickThe spokesperson said: “The council expects everyone to abide by the speed limits in place on our local roads.

It’s important in cementing a local community together and stopping rural depopulation.“These are definitely exceptional circumstances.

That aside, it was a strong year for the driver.Argyll rally fans are looking forward to a full  season, Covid permitting, in conjunction with Dunfermline Car Club and the new main title sponsors Burnside Piling.CAPTIONS:Jamie Miller and Ian McCulloch in their Citroen CR MAX.

It#s estimated that  million plant pots and seed trays are sold every year and the majority are sent to landfill or are incinerated.But there are non-plastic alternatives such as biodegradable pots made using materials like coir, wood chips, bamboo and rice husks.A growing number of garden centres and nurseries use biodegradable pots, but it#s worth checking out their sustainability policies.You can also make your own pots using newspaper or toilet roll tubes.And now is a good time to make your own supplies of biodegradable pots so you have stock for the planting season in a couple of months.If you#ve got a supply of old newspapers to hand, simply roll a cm-wide strip of newspaper tightly around a glass tumbler, leaving cm beyond the bottom of the glass.Fold the excess paper across the bottom, then press the glass down to flatten the pot#s base.There is no need to fix your paper pot with tape, just slide it off the glass.When ready to plant, just fill with compost.Taking good care of existing plastic is a good way to ensure you don#t have to keep buying it – so reuse any plant pots you have again and again for new seedlings, cuttings and plants.If you look after your propagator trays and lids, repairing themthey crack, they will last for several seasons.You can also reuse compost bags to store compost or turn leaves into leaf mould.The added bonus of recycling or reusing items in the garden is that it also reduces cost – as does growing from seed rather than buying established plants.Even in winter, you can grow something from seed, you just need a seed tray and a window ledge, or small cold frame or greenhouse – whatever space and budgets allow.For anyone growing their own vegetables, January is great for sowing onions.If you sow onions then, it saves the expense of buying onion sets – small bulbs – later, and you can have a much larger crop of onions in the summer.Onions seeds do not have a long shelf-le, so it#s best to buy new seeds each year.Seeds will germinate between C and C, one or two weeks after sowing.When large enough to handle, transplant to inidual small pots and keep in a bright, frost-free place until April when they can be planted outside.Varieties to try include: Setton – high yield, yellow skinned and good storage potential Red Baron – a late maturing red onion with globe shaped bulbs and strong taste and Hybound – an early iety with bronze-brown skins which is excellent for long-term storage.January is often the coldest month in the garden but there are still some things you can be doing to keep busy.As the Royal Horticultural Society says, January might be the middle of winter but, as the days en, the garden starts to grow.It is a great time to plan for the coming gardening year and to order seeds and plants.Enjoy the fresh air on dry sunny days, and check your winter protection, stakes, ties and supports are still working after any severe weather.Also, put out food for birds and leave some garden areas uncut, a little longer, to provide shelter for wildle in your garden.Top three jobs this month: clean pots and greenhouses ready for spring, dig over empty or unused plots, and prune apple and pear trees."},{"url":null,"title":"from our files january 7 2022","story":"Machrihanish and Islay topped the highest gusts of wind recorded in the west of Scotland on Tuesday.Throughout the early

demonstrations, visitors will be able to sample oysters at a specially-created oyster bar and a range of other foods.Speed cameras could be installed on Argyll roads in a bid to cut down on speed-related accidents.Argyll and Bute Council#s roads director Alistair Gow told councillors that use of both fixed and portable cameras to detect speeding had increased dramatically in the last few years.They had been pioneered by the former Strathclyde Regional Council which had paid for their purchase and installation with the police meeting the running costs.From the limited information available, an average drop of  per cent in injury accidents was being achieved where they were being used in the UK.#A substantial proportion of injury accidents within Argyll and Bute are speed related and in view of the above statistics, remote speed enforcement could substantially reduce the occurrence of accidents of this nature,# he said.#There are other types of equipment available which are not intended to operate as enforcement tools, but instead to convey a visual message to speeding motorists. This equipment has the advantage of raising driver awareness of the technology available, without the need to proceed with enforcement.#Councillors agreed that officials should investigate the ious forms of remote speed detection equipment, in consultation with Strathclyde Police and the Scottish Office, as trunk roads authority, and report back.FIFTY YEARS AGOThe New Year in Campbeltown was celebrated quietly at the weekend.Apart from a few breathalyser tests, police said the town was remarkably quiet. There were no incidents of breach of the peace, assaults and so on.All was peaceful on Islay too.No public houses or hotel bars were open to the public on New Year#s Day, which undoubtedly helped to keep everything quiet.There was one New Year#s Day incident. A van belonging to the Redfusion television company struck a wall on Low Askomill. Nobody was hurt.The breathalyser appears to have retained its purpose.All the burgh#s taxis were kept going non-stop over the Christmas and New Year period and operators reported heavy bookings.The West Coast coaches were also well used by people who sensibly left the car at home.Shops were kept busy during the few festive days and licensed grocers sold big amounts of the #cratur# and other alcoholic drinks.Christmas and New Year Day babies expected at Craigard Maternity Hospital failed to arrive and the staff had a quiet time of it.A large crowd of people of all denominations and from all over the country converged on Carradale House, home of the authoress Mrs Naomi Mitchison, to take part in the New Year celebrations.This was the rd time that Mrs Mitchison had played host to a large number of guests at Carradale.Politicians, government workers, farmers and fishermen all mingled together, danced, sung and sampled an excellent buffet.Many Carradale villagers were also present.Addressing the guests, Mrs Mitchison talked about the effects of the Common Market and fishermen.

Some years, the harvest had been better than others, and some trees gave their fruit easier than others. He’d learnt not to expect a good harvest, but hope for one, after caring for the trees in all the ways he’d learnt.But he knew what the problem was. The trees were old. He had pruned them and cared for them in all the ways he knew, but now was the time to plant new treeshe was to enjoy an abundant harvest in future years.But where to plant  He walked about his garden trying to decide the best location.He was a very lucky man, it was an extensive garden and his le’s joy. He knew what was needed, the type of soil, the position so there was enough sunlight, sheltered so the spring buds would be protected from the chill winds. Then he realised the perfect place to create his new orchard: close by the wall at the far end of the garden.He wanted to plant from seeds, and he used the technique his grandfather had taught him so many years ago. So he set to work, first preparing the soil, and then he began planting.The trees would grow up together and help each other to flourish, he thought.Years went by and his new trees did indeed grow. Passers-by would often see him standing admiring their progress.But there were some unkind whisperers in the village, who said mocking things about the old man and his new apple trees.“Does he not realise he will be dead before those trees bear fruit  What a foolish man to waste his time and energy on something he will never enjoy himself. If he had children it might make sense, but he doesn’t.”The unkind whispers of course reached the old man’s ears. But it didn’t stop him standing by the new trees and admiring them, and helping them in the ways he knew, to grow healthily. As each year went by, the new trees got bigger and stronger, but the old man got weaker.Then one spring, he was unable to venture into his garden to admire their blossom. People noticed his absence and they wondered about him.Soon the news was out: he was very ill. One of his neighbours came to see him.They had been le-long friends and every autumn the old man had shared his apples with her, giving her a large basket of them to share with her big family.It was sadly their last meeting, for the old man passed away before the beginning of summer. When autumn arrived, the apple trees he’d planted bore their first fruit. It all seemed so sadly ironic.But then one day during the autumn, the neighbour’s grandchildren came running into her house, looking excited.“Gran, gran, look!” they called out, holding a handful of ripe, juicy-looking apples.“They were lying in your garden, on the grass over there, can we eat them ”She went to look. The old man had planted the new apple trees close to the low-lying wall where they had always had their conversations.It was the place where they had made and maintained their friendship, always talking and catching up.It was at this wall that he would hand over the basket of apples every autumn.Now the apple trees he’d planted had grown tall, and some of the branches arched above her lawn. The trees seemed to be offering her apples.She realised now why he’d planted the seeds there.Then she noticed that some of the trees were growing by the old man’s other wall, which bordered the main road.The old man used to leave a basket of apples by his gate for the children as they were walking to school. Now the trees arched over the grassy verge next to the pavement, displaying their fruit.They were just out of reach, butthe children were inventive and cooperated with each other, they could find ways to pick them.She reached up and picked a ripe-looking apple, just the way he’d taught her all those years ago when they’d first become friends. She looked at it and smiled.She looked over the wall to the place he used to stand when they had their conversations. She would never see him standing there again, she thought, never have those conversations again.But then she looked at the apple she had picked and smiled. Her sadness lted and she looked at the trees.“You’re still here,” she said quietly to the rustling branches, “and you’re still sharing your apples with everyone.”"},{"url":null,"title":"jack-up-vessel-offshore-wind-farm-now-visible-off-east-lothian-coast","story":"The vessel, installed on behalf of Inch Cape Offshore Limited and operated by

We can see and record what happens and what has happened in the UK as it is , but it is up to the nationalists to show that independence would be better, and how that could come about. There is currently no proposal for independence on the table, so it is quite legitimate to ask for one so that it can be scrutinised accordingly.He also asks why any future proposal that may be produced should be subject to a higher level of electoral approval than in  or . Obviously he sees the Brexit vote as great success, but I think we should look to other countries like the United States, where two-thirds is the required vote for constitutional amendments, or to Switzerland, where they require a majority of all cantonsA simple  per cent + victory does not fulfil the purpose of a referendumbut makes underlying isions more permanent and more bitter.Mr Galloway cites domestic precedents in his defence of a simple majority in these matters. However, unIike him, I do not believe that the British way is always the best way of doing things, especially in constitutional matters.Peter A Russell, Glasgow.NO MORE BRANCH MANAGERSMARK Openshawdetails the many steps available in a free society to bring a recalcitrant politician to heel or justice, in this case the Prime Minister of the UK. This is true of all democracies which have evolved over hundreds of years. Democracy as we understand it today is underpinned by the rule of law and in Scotland the legal system can be traced back to the th century, perhaps slightly older than the English legal system. There are many countries able to trace their democratic roots back in time, although Mr Openshaw appears to allude to real democracy being the preserve of “our islands”.If Scotland became independent, it is clear Mr Openshaw would not be supporting the SNP because of its “omerta-like intolerance of internal dissent”. I think the dictionary definition of omerta might be better applied to the governing party at Westminster with all its alleged dubious contracts to “friends” during the Covid crisis.Mr Openshaw need not worry needlessly about who to vote for in an independent Scotland as he will be able to choose from a number of political parties. These are sure to include existing political parties now independent themselves. With the constitutional question having been settled, from a currently bare cupboard the Conservative and Labour parties might be able to come up with a policy or two which would benefit the new Scotland – they might even get elected as the governing party.No longer would the Tory leader in Scotland be regarded as a Tory “lightweight” by his betters in London or the Scottish Labour leader as a “branch manager” for a single MP sitting in London. What’s not to like Alan M Morris, Blanefield.NATURAL REACTION TO EMPIRE BUILDERSALEXANDER R McKays obsessive hatred of national independencequalies him to join the company of many celebrated figures from history.The Romans viciously suppressed independence movements, the Habsburgs and the Romanovs were angered by them, Napoleon hated them and the British regarded them with indignation. The Ottomans failed to understand them and the Nazis ruthlessly attacked them in France, Belgium, Holland, Greece, Norway, Denmark and any of the other countries they invaded.All these frenzied empire builders have been swept aside by history and independent nations have became the accepted normal.As soon as people began to question the morality of empire building and international plundering, residual sympathisers went on the defensive and, by a spectacular inversion of the truth, condemned \"nationalism\" or \"separatism\" as the cause of all political problems. Any examination of history shows that, on the contrary, the pursuit of national independence is just a natural reaction to the arrogant greed of empire builders and conquerors. They all eventually discover its power but cause incalculable damage before they do.Peter M Dryburgh, Edinburgh.* REBECCA McQuillandisplays the head-in-the-sand affliction widely demonstrated by journalists and commentators who do not seem to understand the dference between the terms nationalism and nationality.She accepts the increasingly obvious fact that the UK Conservative Party is now an alien force in Scotland and that the Labour Party in Scotland is severely hampered by its stubborn unionist stance but continues to maintain that there is virtue in avoiding \"separation\" from England. Eventhe bitter pill of Brexit were to be swallowed without complaint, federalism or devo max, both of which would continue to treat Scotland as a region rather than a nation, will never satisfy the aspirations of the emerging generation among which so many identy their nationality as Scottish rather than British their voting choices are driven by nationality rather than nationalism.I dont think I am better than any of my neighbours and dont want to be any more separated from them than at present but I dont want them to be in control of my home as well as their own.Willie Maclean, Milngavie.DOUBLE STANDARDS FROM GOVEMICHAEL Gove expresses laudable sentiments in Friday’s Herald such as \"government is a team event\" and he boasts of new arrangements that \"put mutual respect and collaboration at the heart of a new, mature partnership .What does he mean then when he contrasts the locations of London and Elgin and those who live there  Does one’s location confer superiority  How can we level upthe really important place to be is London  Could it be that this mindset is so thoroughly ingrained, ministers don’t even recognise it in themselves Doesn’t bode well for the future.Jane Guz, Dundee.POVERTY MUST BE THE NEXT FIGHTI SUGGEST that post-pandemic we will have an opportunity to raise our aspirations beyond a pitul “ to normal”, a “normal” which fails to present a particularly hopeful future for so many, at home and abroad.Is it realistic to hope that signicant numbers within our society will recognise and condemn at long last the structural injustices of ultra-free markets in which only the prosperous and relatively prosperous can thrive while so many others struggle even to survive I am confident that the Labour Party will give the poor more hope of a much better “normal” than would the Conservative Party. I base my confidence on the following statement by Sir Keir Starmer: “I have always been motivated by a burning desire to tackle inequality and injustice, to stand up for the powerless against the powerful. If I see something wrong or spot an injustice, I want to put it right.” Can any reader imagine any Conservatives, other than the handful of remaining One Nation Conservatives, saying that since the advent of Margaret Thatcher  years ago Even during the Thatcherite-tinged New Labour years foreign aid was doubled and more than a million pensioners and more than a million children were lted out of absolute poverty.I await to hear the SNP’s approach in its prospectus for an independent Scotland.

That advice stated that the Scottish Government had furnished information which was  and untruthful in the course of litigation with a former First Minister. The consequence of the uncovering of that  and untruthful evidence were that the Scottish Government immediately had to concede the legal proceedings at a cost to the taxpayer of approximately £ million. One might expect that the Scottish Government would be better served by the legal process in the futurethe regulation of the legal profession were brought under the Government’s own control and the judiciary excluded from that . That would better enable the Scottish Government to furnish evidence in future litigation calculated to achieve the justice that it wanted, rather than the justice which it deserved.The period of public consultation upon these measures has now closed but most people were probably unaware of it in any case and those with an interest in the future of Scottish justice should now request the Scottish Government to bin the proposed reforms and the Scottish Parliament to reject themthe Scottish Government were to seek to legislate upon them.Michael Sheridan, Glasgow.* MAY I sincerely wish Lord Carloway every success in his opposition to the Scottish Government’s plans to reformthe Scottish legal system.I will not waste your space or my time by listing the disasters that have been inflicted on other key institutions, all of which are essential to the wellbeing of a free society, by a set of politicians who are hell-bent on central control, thus weakening the democratic process.Dan Edgar, Rothesay.MAKE OUR ROADS LESS HOSTILEOF all the complaints that Lisella Huttonmakes about cyclists, only the failure to wear hi-viz is not already illegal. What we are lacking is enforcement.I would note, though, that the majority of pavement cyclists I see tend to be slow and careful round pedestrians – probably because the cyclist will come off just as badly as,not worse than, the pedestrian in the event of a collision. Which isnt to say that they are not an annoying nuisance but, given the way some drivers behave, I can understand them feeling safer on the pavement.As for hi-viz, what use is it on the pavement  For cyclists on the road, ious studies have shown that hi-viz makes no dference as far as driver behaviour is concerned, though good lights are an absolute requirement at night. Similarly, the effectiveness of cycle helmets in a crash is at best questionable. One famous study even showed that drivers passed helmeted cyclists more closely than they passed non-helmeted cyclists.The answer to the problem lies in making the roads less hostile with lower speed limits and more segregated cycling facilities – which might even get some people out of their cars and onto their bikes.Boyd Johnston, Paisley.SYMPATHY FOR ANDREWS FAMILYTHERE has been extensive speculation concerning the consequences of the recent developments in relation to the civil lawsuit brought against Prince Andrew by Virginia Giuffre in the United States . That speculation has covered in detail such aspects as the long-term effects on the future stability of the monarchy, the loss of status sustained by the Prince, how the defence of the litigation can be sustained financially, the dficulties associated with the Prince ever seeking to settle the action given his repeated statements asserting his innocence, and his disastrous misjudgement in the first place in getting so close to Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell.In the face of that barrage of publicity, one is left wondering from a human point of view, rather than a state or institutional one: what is the Queen, as an elderly mother, actually making of this furore surrounding Prince Andrew, often referred to as her favourite son, particularly in the year of her Platinum Jubilee  And how are his daughters, Beatrice and Eugenie, endeavouring to cope with this tsunami of awful news engulfing their father  One is not likely to get answers to these questions.

Using the information, we can work out what restoring seagrass meadows will mean, for example, in terms of rebuilding the fisheries in the Clyde - can we enhance our nation’s wealth by putting these habitats back ”The initial satellite data is being “ground truthed” by sending out ers and drones to check it is accurate.This has already been carried out in the clear waters around Westray in Orkney, and the information gained will be extrapolated to other clear water sites like the Hebrides, before being refined for areas with less water clarity like the Firth of Clyde and Firth of Forth.SKY HIGH AMBITION: Dr Richard Lilley, left, and Associate Professor Richard Unsworth with a Project Seagrass drone.  “The potential is huge since this collaboration is also helping to build global knowledge into how to map seagrass using satellites,” said Dr Lilley. “As a small charity, we couldn’t begin to have access to the kind of computing power and expertise that CGI has. We have had these dreams of getting national seagrass maps but it is only through collaboration that we will be able to achieve that, especially in the short time scales we’re working to, because the next five or ten years are going to be critical.“We are facing a bioersity emergency and a climate emergency and unless we start taking better management of our ecosystems we are not going to be able to adapt to the challenges these present.” CGI is not only providing the mapping technology pro-bono but has also committed to planting  bags of seagrass in its first year with the charity.Dr Jaime Reed, of CGI, said the company was excited about the project, particularly as good progress had already been made.“What we are doing is building a system using satellite data to identy where all these patches of seagrass are,” he said. “Once we know what the density is, we can identy the total volume around the UK and set up a monitoring system so we can begin to understand what is happening over time.“We can produce maps to identy where it is in a holistic way. Then we can use that to communicate with local communities and use it for education and outreach. We have made progress very quickly so it shows what can be doneyou put your mind to it.”Dr Reed added: “The other thing that is really exciting is that once we have done this analysis for the UK we can potentially do it where in the world. The coastline of the entire world is many times greater than the UK, so this is a great opportunity to develop something that we can take around the world in order for it to have a much bigger impact.”As well as helping Project Seagrass and other conservation initiatives, CGI has its own net zero plan, aiming to be net zero in the UK by  and globally by .Dr Reed said CGI was one of very few companies in the tech industry that had such an ambitious aim.“We are going harder and faster than a lot of other big industries because we believe we have to do it as it is part of being a responsible business,” he said. “We hope that by making those kind of commitments, by doing projects like this one with Project Seagrass and providing leadership, we can encourage others to follow suit.”www.cgi uk--------------------------------------Pack promotes a sea change in perceptionCHILDREN are also being helped to learn about the importance of seagrass through a very successful STEM project launched by CGI during the first lockdown.Initially created to educate and entertain the children of staff members, it was so popular that the activity packs were released online for anyone to use.The packs in the STEM from Home initiative tackle topical issues and give information and fun activities for children to do both online and offline.The STEM from Home Seagrass pack explains what seagrass is and what it can do to help counteract climate change. The participants learn that the plants absorb and store large amounts of carbon dioxide, produce oxygen and are important in the fight against climate change and bioersity loss. The pack has a video showing children how to make their own Secchi disk. Created in  by Pietro Aneglo Secchi, the device is used to measure water transparency in open bodies of water such as the ocean, lakes and rivers. When lowered into water, the depth at which the black and white pattern becomes no longer visible is the point at which the measurement is taken. This measurement is known as the Secchi depth.The participants learn that water transparency relates to the depth light will penetrate the water to allow photosynthesis to take place to produce oxygen and food – a key process in allowing ocean le to grow and thrive.In this pack there is also a coding project using Pen extension blocks and x and y coordinates in Scratch to draw the locations visited by green sea turtles during their nesting time.Children can also use Scratch to create a game to “save a shark”. The game looks at sharks’ favourite food source, as well as the impact of plastic in the water.Pack creator Luke Kittow, of CGI, said children had responded well to it.“Having industry insight from Project Seagrass has been great because it offers a dferent element to what we can provide,” said Kittow. “Being able to show the science behind issues has been very well received.” "},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com     \u003cpicture","title":"green-scotland-cop26-climate-investigation-full","story":"Our subscribers will get exclusive access as we look to answer the pressing questions in Scotlands climate crisis fight.As the COP conference looms on the horizon, we will leave no stone unturned in a bid to stimulate discussion and debate on this crucial topic.Find out more about our exclusive £ for two months offer here. From the hundreds of sites and big-name companies that broke environmental rules, to the most polluted streets in Scotland, readers can expect ground-breaking exclusives, in-depth analysis, and interactive content – as well as regular live videos, giving you the chance to speak directly with the award-winning reporters behind the stories.Here, you can find every article published in the week-long investigation so far - with this piece being updated daily with new exclusive stories.To make sure you do not miss out on the high-quality insight, join us today by taking out a subscription for just £ for two months here.More than  industrial sites across Scotland have been officially damned as “unsatisfactory” on pollution, according to data from the Scottish Environment Protection Agencyseen by The Ferret.Sepa assessed the environmental performance of two big oil companies, ExxonMobil and Ineos, as “very poor” in .

The symbolic casting of throwlines across the UK is a reflection of our unwavering commitment to keeping people safe at sea.”Maritime minister Robert Courts said: “HM Coastguard is the backbone of our maritime sector and the nation is indebted to its incredible workforce which continues to deliver an exceptional service.”A rural school has been praised for how it handled the challenges of lockdown during the Covid- crisis.

Dr Jaffa is essentially a spokesman and an apologist for the salmon farming industry.#It#s no coincidence that wild salmon stocks have collapsed in all areas of the northern hemisphere where open net salmon farming has developed.#Peter Cunningham, biologist with the Wester Ross Fisheries Trust, said: #It is the salmon farming industry#s inability to manage parasitic sea lice that is the major threat to wild salmon. It is a natural parasite but they multiply and become much higher in number on open cage salmon farms.#Sampling by the WRFT in the spring of  supports contention that cumulative levels of infective sea lice were again much too high between Skye and the mainland of Scotland to protect migrating post-smolt salmon within these waters in the next spring.#Salmon populations in rivers Applecross, Ling, Sheil, Glenmore, Glen Beag, Arnisdale, Broadford, Sligachan and many others around Skye are particularly vulnerable.#  "},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/258343311_483851062940065_6761478433370174788_n.jpg","title":"skyes mavis sails first tall ship at","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine, as part of the Greenock to Leith voyage last year.

So much of what we learn in terms of socialisation and relationships does not happen in a classroom but across all the other day to day activities and interactions that take place.“It is a huge issue. Our young people have lost a lot in terms of their formal education but for me, they have also lost a massive amount in terms of the other areas of development that their education brings.”Portree High School pupil Luke Eveling, who has published a book about facing mental health challenges as a teenager on Skye, believes the pandemic had taken a toll on his age-group.He said: #Lockdown and the pandemic more widely definitely had an effect on young people in school. A lot of my friends are finding it hard to cope with exams and more broadly the pandemic simultaneously. This has influenced how well they are doing at school.#I have a few friends who have turned to serious drug abuse as a way of coping with the combined pressure, and others have stopped going to school completely.”In April , Luke bravely shared his own challenges through his book ‘A Series of Essays About Mental Health’.Within the book, Luke, who lives in Broadford, wrote frankly about a wide range of issues including heartbreak, peer pressure, drug abuse, and suicide. at the time, Luke talked about being diagnosed with Asperger’s and coping with isolation during the pandemic.While last year Luke spoke warmly about the “overwhelming support” he had received from family, friends and the wider community after opening up about his own circumstances, he believed more support services should be made available to help other young people.He added: #There are some, but there just isn’t enough for everyone. Things like having a school counsellor sound good but just don’t seem to reach everyone who needs help.#Councillor Finlayson added: “We know the importance of mental health # people are nervous about the pandemic and have not been able to socialise as before. We already have and will continue to have a situation where some young people will really struggle to get back to being with their peers and to sustaining positive relationships.“Parents are rightly concerned. Their children are in a totally unique situation given the global scope of the pandemic and the impact it has had and will continue to have on how education is delivered.“Supporting all aspects of education in its widest form needs to be a priority for all levels of government from the UK Government to Scottish Government to local government.“We all need to realise that the young people who have been in schools for the last two years have been disadvantaged in many dferent ways.“We need to take account of this going forward in terms of additional resources and possibly a catch-up curriculum and perhaps even more importantly, support for all aspects of young people’s health and wellbeing including mental health.”Assessing the lay of the land in schools across the region, Councillor Finlayson said: “Within Highland we will be continuing to follow the rules and mitigation measures that were in place previously and have come from the Scottish Government # all these things masks in classrooms, social distancing, ventilation in classrooms, limiting contact with other year groups and classes as much as possible will continue. What the rest of the country will be expected to do.“Better ventilation is being encouraged in schools # but we must consider the time of year and the fact that some of the schools within the Highland Council are pretty antiquated and not in the greatest condition.“I am keen that schools should make decisions that suit their own circumstances # because each school is dferent.#"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/annie-johnston-with-John-Lorne-Campbell.jpg","title":"tobar and dualchais a visit to canna south uist and barra in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineI have drawn on an intermittent diary kept at the time, to help with my present memories of the occasions., was by any standard a memorable experience.Campbell, a leading Gaelic scholar already well known internationally, had from the s carried out ground-breaking fieldwork recording Gaelic oral tradition in the Hebrides and in Gaelic Nova Scotia.

I don’t want to see them made legal here’NI woman speaks for the first time about her horror accident and why so many ignore the law on our roadsExpandExpandExpandPreviousNext\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseKarmen Curley in hospital after her crashA volunteer rider takes part in an e-scooter trial in LondonRecovering: Karmen says she is still feeling the effects of her accident FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueKarmen Curley in hospital after her crashClaire McNeillyTwitterEmailJanuary   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailA Co Antrim teenager who sustained horric injuries in an electric scooter accident in the United States has opened up about her terrying ordeal and revealed that she is “very lucky to be alive”.Newtownabbey native Karmen Curley, who is still suffering from the effects of that ordeal in Calornia nearly three years ago, is vehemently against legislation to legalise these vehicles in Northern Ireland.Like others, Karmen— who now has crash-related seizures and suspected epilepsy — has noticed the growing number of illegal e-scooters here and the apparent lack of action on the part of the PSNI.In her first interview since the horror accident, Karmen told the Belfastthat she’s still undergoing tests as a result of the injuries she incurred after being thrown over the front of an e-scooter.“I was in hospital for camera tests last year and I’m still on medication because of the accident,” she said.“I get migraines a lot. The experts aren’t sure what’s wrong with me. They believe it may be post traumatic epilepsy linked to the accident.“My sister told me that as soon as I came round after the accident I started having seizures. I was seizuring in the ambulance on the way to the hospital, whatever way I hit my head.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up “The medics told me I was lucky to be alive. They said a lot of people with my type of bleed on the brain don’t survive so I feel very lucky. EvenI do have epilepsy, I’m glad that’s all I have.”Karmen was just  when she hit a pothole while riding an e-scooter and was thrown over the front of it.After being rushed to UCLA Hospital in Los Angeles, she spent nearly three weeks in intensive care, after being diagnosed with a bleed on the brain. She also suffered a broken collarbone, nose and eye orbital bone.The young woman, who now lives in Ballyclare, said she doesn’t want to see e-scooters legalised.“E-scooters are so dangerous, I definitely don’t want to see them on public roads,” she said.“I see so many kids on them now. I keep thinking I would hate for my child to come off one of them and die. You would just blame yourself for letting them on it.”The accident happened after she travelled to the US to visit her sister Sian, a student at Southern Connecticut State University.The sisters had planned a trip around the west coast of Calornia for two weeks with Sian’s university friends before ing home.Disaster struck, however, when the group decided to rent electric scooters during a day out in Los Angeles.“Obviously when we hired out e-scooters we thought they looked great and it would be an easy way to get about,” she recalled.“You don’t think about the fact thatyou fall off one of them you’re toast.“Nobody showed us how to use one. We downloaded an app and scanned the e-scooter. Simple.“They’re everywhere in America. People travel all over the place on them. It’s probably more common to have accidents there.”Shop worker Karmen said she doesn’t “remember much about” the day of the accident in May .“It was the last day of the holiday,” she said.“We were going home the next morning. We thought we’d gone down to the beach on the e-scooters and… then I ended up in hospital for nearly three weeks.”Her sister Sian launched a fundraising campaign to help with medical bills. Karmen hadn’t taken out travel insurance before the trip. and the treatment cost more than ,a day due to the seriousness of her injuries. “Every time I woke up in hospital I couldn’t remember where I was,” said Karmen.“The accident definitely affected my memory — it’s still not the best.“But I can’t complain. I’m very lucky to be here.”Karmen said it’s distressing when she sees “kids going about on them all the time” near her home.“Nobody seems to thinks about health and safety,” she said.“One of my friends has an e-scooter. I’ve warned him about the dangers and he replied that he’d put his hood up… but you can’t make people listen to youthey don’t want to. “At the very least they should get helmets.”She added: “If you fall off a bike you’ll probably come off the side more than you will flip over the front. I flipped right over the front of the e-scooter.”Dad Frank , a car salesman, is still dealing with the cost of the accident, according to Karmen whose mother Karensuffered an aneurysm and died the year before the accident. The family also tragically lost Karmen’s brother Saul in a car accident in .UUP peer Lord Rogan, who is campaigning against e-scooters, said Karmen’s accident illustrates how e-scooters are “missiles with handlebars”.“Karmen has endured a horrendous ordeal and I am sorry to learn that she continues to suffer from her injuries two and a half years after the terrying accident,” he said.“She knows better than anyone just how dangerous e-scooters are and how much damage they can inflict. They must not be allowed on public roads — not now, not ever.”Lord Rogan urged the PSNI to “prosecute iniduals caught riding these wretched machines on our streets”.“As Karmen can testy, they have the potential to destroy and even end the lives both of riders and members of the public simply going about their everyday business,” he said.“Given their growing popularity, despite the ban, I would also encourage the Northern Ireland Executive to launch a public awareness campaign to highlight the dangers e-scooters pose.“Such a campaign should begin in schools, perhaps led by the PSNI, so our young people understand at any early age that e-scooters are bad news.”He added: “I will continue to raise these matters in the House of Lords and again commend the Belfastfor drawing attention to the scourge of these missiles with handlebars.”Most Read‘I was used’ – former anti-vaxxer in Fermanagh speaks out after husband’s death from CovidVeteran loyalist ‘Flagman’ given  hours to leave Rathcoole estate after UDA gang purgeWoman forced on to streets by UDA has tent burntWhat should you doyou’re still testing positive for Covid after  days UDA godfathers were named to cops by loyalist killer BlairTop VideosPlayBelfast man creates positive Covid test with fruit drinkPlayEmily Thornberry defends Sir Keir Starmer beer picturePlayPark Run participants observe a silence in memory of murdered Ashling MurphyLatest Northern IrelandRevealed:  families did not donate their loved ones’ organsTwo attempted robberies in Carrickfergus at petrol station and shopDUP leader denies deal with Government to bring back double-jobbing years on and some relatives still can’t bear to visit scene of Teebane bombingLearning is king for Carrick Rangers manager Stuart after draw against Glenavon felt like a defeatLatestWatchdog extends investigation into PwC’s audits of defence firm BabcockLondon-Cornwall sleeper trains disrupted for eight weeksList of parties across Government reportedly held during Covid restrictionsAmazon reverses decision to ban customers from using Visa credit cards projects awarded £m in contracts for offshore wind farms,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Overall, their vote percentage dropped by just over a point to .%.However, their percentage losses in some constituencies was much larger.It is possible the party may want all its MPs to stand and Lagan Valley is a stand out as the party dropped from .% to .% there, while the Ulster Unionists and Alliance increased their votes by signicant margins, around %.But there are others to keep an eye on, including East Londonderry where Campbell was an MLA until double jobbing was barred before the  election.The DUP share of the vote in the constituency dropped by more than % but it was not lost to either the Ulster Unionists or Jim Allister’s TUV, both of which also saw decreases in support. It was a lower unionist turnout that was the dference.Campbell — unlike some of his colleagues such as Ian Paisley who gave up their Assembly positions much earlier —  continued as an MLA until the ban on double jobbing was introduced.Strangford is another one to watch. Mike Nesbitt, the UUP MLA for the area, entered the debate yesterday with a y statement arguing against allowing MPs to stand in May.“There appears to be nothing to stop the eight DUP MPs standing for the Assembly, getting elected, and immediately standing down to allow the party to co-opt their replacements,” he said.The DUP will be under pressure in the constituency, represented by Jim Shannon in the House of Commons.At the last Stormont election, the party managed to hang on to three seats despite its share of the vote dropping just over three points to .%.While the UUP increased its share by just half a point to %, Alliance went up by more than % to %.Then there is North Antrim, the Paisley stronghold — and Allister’s.

Doing so will increase the overall number of donors, and ultimately the number of lesaving organs available for transplantation.Under the Organ Donation Bill, people would automatically become organ donors unless they specically opt out.However, eventhe law is passed, the next of kin will still have to give permission before organs are used for transplant — eventheir loved one has not opted out.As a result, the Bill will also rely heavily upon a campaign to raise awareness of the importance of discussing wishes for transplant.Monica Hackett, regional manager for NHS Blood and Transplant in Northern Ireland, said: “We are delighted to see such strong support for organ donation in Northern Ireland.“It is particularly impressive to see how this support has continued to grow, despite the struggles and strains of the pandemic.“However, with thousands still waiting for transplant, both in Northern Ireland and across the UK, there is still a need to further increase support,we are to be able to give all those waiting the transplant they so desperately need.“The Organ Donation Bill aims to increase awareness and support for donation.“However, organ donation will still always be a personal choice and families will still always be consulted.“We urge everyone to take this opportunity to share your organ donation decision with your family and record it on the NHS Organ Donor Register.”Northern Ireland is currently the only part of the UK where an opt-out system for organ donation is not in place.In September, the Organ Donation Bill passed its second reading at Stormont when MLAs approved it by  votes to six.Until last June, the DUP had blocked attempts to pass a bill.However, following talks between First Minister Paul Givan, Health Minister Robin Swann, who proposed the legislation, and campaigners, Mr Givan announced he had given approval for the legislation to proceed to the Assembly.Related topicsPaul GivanRobin SwannNorthern Ireland AssemblyMore On Paul Givan PremiumDomestic abuse laws sunk by collapse of Stormont would be shameful: Naomi Long PremiumStormont slammed over delay in publishing MLAs’ expenses PremiumSam McBrideOpinionA constitutional crisis without precedent may be just weeks away PremiumFionola MeredithOpinionWho will stand up for the people who can’t wear masks NI Executive rule out further restrictions or school closures but warn ‘collective effort’ required amid surging Omicron casesMost Read‘I was used’ – former anti-vaxxer in Fermanagh speaks out after husband’s death from CovidVeteran loyalist ‘Flagman’ given  hours to leave Rathcoole estate after UDA gang purgeWoman forced on to streets by UDA has tent burntWhat should you doyou’re still testing positive for Covid after  days UDA godfathers were named to cops by loyalist killer BlairTop VideosPlayBelfast man creates positive Covid test with fruit drinkPlayEmily Thornberry defends Sir Keir Starmer beer picturePlayPark Run participants observe a silence in memory of murdered Ashling MurphyLatest Northern IrelandTwo attempted robberies in Carrickfergus at petrol station and shopDUP leader denies deal with Government to bring back double-jobbing years on and some relatives still can’t bear to visit scene of Teebane bombingLearning is king for Carrick Rangers manager Stuart after draw against Glenavon felt like a defeatJohn Herron sounds a warning after Larne’s County Antrim Shield joy is short-livedLatestAmazon reverses decision to ban customers from using Visa credit cards projects awarded £m in contracts for offshore wind farmsUnvaccinated older people in Greece face monthly finesStarmer reveals Gary Neville told him he was ‘not being strong enough’Netflix donates benches to local councils in After Le mental health scheme,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Strangford Lough is a vital stopping off point as thousands comes to feed on its shores at low tide. Itrsquos an annual audio and visual spectacle that wildfowl expert Kerry Mackie never misses.As the woodlands burst into colour, songwriter Brigid OrsquoNeill draws inspiration before performing a secret gig at a small converted church on the shores of the lough.On a farm to the south tip of the lough, RSPB ranger Mark McCormick looks for endangered species like the yellowhammer. He explains how his work has helped him overcome PTSD which he suffered after witnessing a terrorist attack on Westminster Bridge in London.Around boats are being removed from the water and repaired, in Portaferry former ferry captain -year-old John Murray is getting his boat, the St Brendan, on to the quay for the winter, with the help of four generations of the Murray family.In the second episode, as winter approaches Hugh Thurgate is moving livestock between islands and Katy Bell from Ulster Wildle checks barn owl boxes at Mount Stewart. Bad weather is coming and preparations need to be made.As winter storms howl, Kenny Smyth makes sure the boats in his boatyard are secure, before retreating to his shed to work on Laragh, his beautul wooden River yacht. Working on the boat reminds Kenny of his father who established the yard after the war.Rough winter weather also gives Heidi McIlvenny a chance to search for shark egg cases, known by some as mermaidsrsquo purses. Strangford Lough provides habitat for sharks and rays and Heidirsquos work provides important research.At her farm near Greyabbey Kerry Angus looks forward to lambing and reflects how the care she provides for her flock is consistent with providing meat for the farm shop. Close by, Kerry Mackie is setting up traps for tagging oyster catchers.At Port Loughan farm, Katy is installing barn owl nesting boxes before the spring nesting season. Itrsquos been a long winter, but installing the boxes is a real sign that spring is on its way.In the third episode spring has sprung and there is new wildle arriving at the lough. As boat owners prepare for summer, Kieron Black says an emotional goodbye to Pavane, the boat owned by his late father, Brian Black, the environmental broadcaster and journalist who died in a tragic accident in Strangford harbour in .The fourth and final episode is set in summer, a busy season as humans and birds flock to the lough to enjoy its un-spoilt beauty and unique habitats.At Slievemoyle farm Mark McCormick from the RSPB is camping out for a dawn chorus survey. He is hoping he will hear the distinctive call of the endangered yellowhammer.Summers on Strangford lough mean long evenings stretching into glorious sunsets. In Portaferry four generations of the Murray family take the St Brendan out for an evening of fishing.Summer is regatta season on the Lough and a big moment for Kenny Smyth and his River class yacht. Itrsquos  years since the Rivers were built, and Kenny is hoping to wrestle a race trophy from his brother, Graham.Away from the buzz of summer activities, Katy Bell is hoping to find healthy barn owl chicks. Wet and extremely hot weather has meant most of the sites have failed this year, but a new site may have some healthy chicks.Out on the lough Kerry Mackie is counting greylag geese. Itrsquos important to monitor the populations as they can cause problems for farmers. Carrying out the counts reminds him of his deep family connections to the lough and a letime of memories.Kieron Black is also out snorkelling, remembering his father Brian. He would always try to fill everyday with experiences, something Kieron also tries to do, as he loses himself in the otherworldly surroundings of the loughrsquos seabed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/12_January2022_Celtic.jpg","title":"Celtic Bhoys kick off new year with win  ","story":"CELTIC Bhoys kicked off the new calendar year by picking up all three points away to long time league rivals Newcastle Swts at a soaking wet Donard Park on Saturday afternoon.An early Shaun Megahey penalty gave The Hoops a lead they would never relinquish before captain Michael Rice and marksman Jay Gibney ensured there would be no late rally from the Seasiders.Newcastle will count themselves unlucky to concede a penalty kick just five minutes in for a handball that they disputed actually came off a green and white jersey.Nonetheless, Celticrsquos ever reliable defender, Shaun Megahey, made no mistake with the spot kick and sent goalkeeper Fintan Canavan the wrong way to open the scoring.The Hoops kept their foot on the pedal with striker Jay Gibney testing Canavan from range. Newcastle did not make things easy for the visitors and constantly remained a threat in attack with the experienced Neil Corr causing problems all afternoon.Celticrsquos Conaill Kerr had his headed goal chalked off after he was adjudged to have fouled custodian Canavan by referee Peter Kelly.Kerr was determined not to be deterred by this and went on a surging run in the next passage of play, dancing around the Newcastle defence to unleash a shot that just whisked wide of the post.This seemed to wake up the Seasiders, who forced Celtic to retreat into their own half largely in thanks to the midfield display of Peter Brannigan.Newcastle nearly had their momentum derailed when lsquokeeper Canavan misplaced a pass to the feet of Gibney, although the Celtic strikerrsquos snapshot landed safely back into the arms of the grateful number one.As the hosts went back on the attack, Richard McInerney combined well with Shane Kearney before the Newcastle number rsquos inviting cross into the box was punched to safety by Celtic lsquokeeper Nathan Curran.The following ten minutes of play consisted of both teams battling for possession in the middle of the park, where man of the match Corey McCartan was notably winning the lionrsquos share for his Celtic side.The Hoops almost doubled their lead when Jordan McCoubrey fired a cross into the Newcastle box where team-mate Gibney managed to poke his head in front of Canavan to round the lsquokeeper.However, with the angle at goal not in his favour, the Celtic number nine saw his effort sail across the line and eventually out for a throw-in. This signalled the last notable passage of play before the half-time interval.Celtic began the restart positively with the ball quickly making its way back to lsquokeeper Curran, who sent a cross field pass to the feet of Stephen Galbraith.The Hoopsrsquo midfielder played a cute first time pass to Gibney, who sumptuously back-heeled to team-mate McCoubrey for a shot on goal that resulted in a corner.Newcastle decided to fight fire with fire and went on the attack. In what was possibly another sign that it wasnrsquot to be their day, the hosts had appeals for a penalty waved off after Brannigan was met with a tackle that sent him to the floor inside the box.The Seasiders enjoyed a purple patch where they hit the visitors with wave after wave of attacks, although they couldnrsquot find the vital touch to put the ball in the net.Celtic lsquokeeper Curran was forced to clear his lines on multiple occasions, and to his credit, The Hoopsrsquo number one remained sharp and focused throughout the  minutes.Peter OrsquoHare and skipper Louis Brunsdon were pulling the strings for Newcastle, but their final ball was just off the mark in what was becoming an increasingly frustrating afternoon for the home side.As the playing conditions began to become increasingly worse, there was a bright light in Celtic youngster Eoin Kelly, who made an impactful appearance off the bench and slowly began to swing the momentum in favour of his side ndash largely also in thanks to team-mate McCartan overturning possession in midfield.Another Celtic substitute, Sean McMahon, forced Newcastle lsquokeeper Canavan to produce the save of the match after his left footed effort was erted outside the post by a spectacular acrobatic e.The resultant corner was met with a similarly impressive save from Canavan, who stopped a point blank flick on header from Kelly.Newcastlersquos purple patch had well and truly ended and this was signied further when Celtic doubled their lead through skipper Michael Rice.After a long ball into the box looped over the Seasidersrsquo defence, the ball rolled invitingly out for Rice to toe poke beyond the impressive Canavan with  minutes left on the clock.The home outfit were not one to give up and went in search of the goal that would set up a nervous last few moments for their opponents.Corr almost awarded his side this opportunity when the ball landed at the veteranrsquos feet with only Curran to beat.However, the stubborn Celtic custodian refused to be bettered and spread his six foot frame as wide as he could to narrow the target and deny the certain goal.Moments later, Celticrsquos Peter Casey was clattered in the middle of the park but referee Kelly waved on the advantage which turned out to be an important call.Megahey gathered the loose ball on the right hand side of the pitch, before squaring a pass to Gibney, who struck a curling effort into the top right corner of the net to round off the scoring.Resilient to the end, Newcastle launched one last attack in search of a consolation goal.Despite the ball hitting the Celtic post in the midst of a goalmouth scramble, Newcastle captain Brunsdon couldnrsquot supply the required rebound and the referee blew his whistle for the final time.After the contest, man of the match Corey McCartan gave his thoughts on his sidersquos performance and winning start to the year.ldquoAll of the boys worked hard, especially coming back from a few weeks off after Christmas, he said.ldquoIt was a hard game and everyone was still stf, so I think it was physically tough for both teams and the weather definitely didnrsquot help.ldquoNewcastle surprised me because of how sharp they were and how high of a level their fitness was, but we got the job done and are now focused on the next game.Newcastle: F Canavan, C Scott, S Kelly, D Allister, J Maginn, P Brannigan, P OrsquoHare, L Brunsdon , R McInerney, N Corr, S Kearney.Subs: D Rooney, C McMahon, C Morrison.Celtic Bhoys: N Curran, S Megahey, R Quinn, B Connolly, M Rice , C McCartan, S Galbraith, P Casey, J Gibney, J McCoubrey, C Kerr.Subs: R Fitzpatrick, E Kelly, S McMahon.Referee: Peter Kelly..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/12_January2022_IrishStreet.jpg","title":"Downpatrick regeneration ‘offers some light’ for year  ","story":"A LOCAL politician has warned that  could be a dficult year for the economy.Downpatrick area councillor Dermot Curran says he fears there could be job losses in the retail sector and has called on Newry, Mourne and Down Council to do all it can to provide support.He said the council should consult with the business community and also consider some form of rate relief.He said the economic situation had been exacerbated by the pandemic and urged the public to adhere to Covid regulations.ldquoThe virus has no respect for age or gender.

For more than six years now I have tried to heal some of the deep isions in our communities. I did so because I could not see how an Ulster ided against itself could hope to stand.

His ‘hardline’ opponents attacked him for failing to stand up to pressure from the Labour government at Westminster for ‘civil rights’ reforms. Two months later he resigned. Under pressure from Westminster, the reforms went ahead.As we approach the May  election, unionism again stands at a crossroads. Within the past year, both main unionist parties have replaced their leaders. They face immense challenges. Like O’Neill, they are squeezed between the expectations of their electorate and the demands of a national government pursuing broader priorities. Although they favour devolution, they cannot credibly argue that the  Agreement has delivered good stable governance. The Assembly has operated for only  of its  years, its ministers do not trust each other, and many voters question its value.The Assembly fails the most basic test for any democracy: there is no effective opposition. Simply by winning enough seats, the five largest parties carve up the spoils. DUP and Sinn Féin ministers stand accused of financial scandal, most obviously over the RHI affair, but the two dominant parties ‘oversee’ their own conduct through the Assembly committee system.Despite the lack of opposition, the Executive is highly unstable. Sinn Féin have shown that Semtex and Armalites are no longer needed to bring down Stormont: merely by threatening to withdraw, they wield a permanent veto over all policy decisions.If as the polls suggest they become the largest party after the election, they will select the First Minister. They would present this as another milestone in unionism’s retreat. Although first and deputy ministers have the same powers, both main unionist parties will likely use the threat of this outcome to persuade voters to vote for them.In this challenging context, unionism has to choose between two broad paths: to keep muddling on with a system which is clearly broken, or to grip the problem resolutely, demand changes in the Agreement, and make Stormont work well for most voters, irrespective of their community background.There are obvious advantages for the British and Irish governments and the Executive parties in doing nothing: nobody will be blamed and no sinecures will be lost. In time, however, events will likely force the pace of reform. It may soon suit Sinn Féin to collapse the Executive again or the election results may call into question the whole sectarian apparatus of community designation, cross-community voting and mandatory coalition.The Agreement requires key decisions in the Assembly — including the selection of first ministers — to be taken on a cross-community basis. This may have seemed sensible in , when it was widely accepted that the republican insurgency was best managed as a conflict between two national identity communitiesin a deeply ided society. But it is no longer appropriate.The electorate has evolved beyond these binary designations. In , % of respondents to the Le and Times Survey described themselves as ‘unionist’, % ‘nationalist’ and % ‘neither’. In , the corresponding figures were %, % and %. With a “neither” plurality, the argument goes, shouldn’t we have a ‘neither’ first minister The coming election might bring matters to a head. If most MLAs designate as ‘other’, rather than unionist or nationalist — mirroring their constituents — they would have a strong case for changing the rules. Otherwise the system would privilege single-community parties over those who prioritise reconciliation, which the Agreement ostentatiously encourages.The main ‘neither’ party — Alliance — is already committed to replacing community designation with a system of weighted majorities for defined votes and to forming coalitions voluntarily by negotiation after each election. So is the TUV, commonly misrepresented as the most ‘hardline’ unionist party. The leaders of the other two unionist parties have also indicated that they want eventually to move to a system of voluntary coalitions with an effective opposition. The strongest resistance comes from Sinn Féin, which claims that the proposed change would lead to its exclusion from government. It clearly doesn’t have much confidence in its ability to attract a coalition partner.Unionists might not immediately benefit: initially, such a reform would probably increase the influence of Alliance as a potential partner for parties from both traditions, as in Belfast City Council. But there is a broader pro-Union argument to be made: that the de-tribalisation of politics is an essential step in constructing the sort of inclusive Northern Ireland which will deliver lasting good government for most people here for the foreseeable future.Although a serious review of the Strand One institutions may be some time coming, unionists should prepare themselves to initiate it when the time is ripe, know what they want, and have a strategy for getting it. They should commit themselves to a Union based on equal citizenship and respect for ersity, in contrast to the ethnic singularity of Irish nationalism.Their message to the electorate should be that having celebrated its centenary, Northern Ireland has grown beyond the tribal politics of the nineteenth-century.Three more points. Firstly, as a signatory to the European Convention on Human Rights, the UK government recognises that everyone in the UK has the right to fair and consistent arrangements for law enforcement, free from political interference. This right was degraded for everyone in Northern Ireland by the concessions which Tony Blair gave the IRA during secret ‘peace process’ negotiations between  and .Such flagrant defiance of the essential principles of ethical government must not be permitted in future. The leaders of unionism must insist on equal citizenship within a consistent legal framework. Everyone in Northern Ireland has the right to be treated as full and equal citizens of the UK. This vital principle is degraded when the British government undermines the rule of law, treats Northern Ireland like a colony, fails to protect its borders or dilutes its constitutional status.Secondly, an immediate and challenging priority is to reverse the damage being done by the Northern Ireland Protocol, rashly and unnecessarily conceded by the UK government as the price of Brexit for the rest of the nation. Whatever their designation, Northern Ireland consumers are already having to pay higher prices for a more limited range of goods.The EU’s punitive control regime is impeding free trade between Britain and Northern Ireland, deliberately erting Northern Ireland’s trading relationships away from Britain, and subjecting Northern Ireland to a swathe of EU regulations over which its people have no say. In signing up for the Protocol, the British government has shockingly acknowledged that it has “subjugated” the Act of Union  — the constitutional basis for the Union – in response to wholly unreasonable demands from the EU.Finally, an overarching task for the leaders of unionism must be at every opportunity to challenge the  narratives of Irish nationalism: the illusion that the partition of Ireland was an historic injustice and the myth that from  to  unionists were uniquely sectarian in their treatment of their nationalist neighbours.Effective leaders must not just manage political problems but also celebrate the qualities of their people. One of the current priorities for Unionist leaders is to restore the reputation of a largely honourable community wickedly slandered.• Dr William Beattie Smith is a former civil servant and author of ‘The British State and the Northern Ireland Crisis -,’ published by the US Institute of Peace• Taken from ‘The Idea of the Union: Great Britain and Northern Ireland’ edited by John Wilson Foster  William Beattie Smith.

It was a part of the annual events: the Rugby Schools Cup final was on Saint Patrick’s Day, some of the Irish regiments recognised it, indeed the Orange Order at one time recognised Saint Patrick’s Day.“So it is something I think we need to recover, and we need to encourage full participation in the Saint Patrick’s Day celebration.

They say that the beach is a sand and shingle beach and has a reputation for being one of the cleanest in the region. There is a coastal walk, chance to go fishing, surfing and views of Tusker Rock.For those owners who may not yet have ventured to the beach with their pups or are concerned about behaviour while at the beach, Wood Green’s dog behaviour and training specialist, Wendy Kruger, has provided some tips to prepare your dog for the beach.• Ensure your dog’s microchip and collar tag details are up to date – just in case.• Get used to checking ground surface temperatures before you take your dog out, as dry sand can be too hot for dogs’ paws on sunny days. To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention. Evenyour dog has a great recall at home, its not something that can be guaranteed in unfamiliar environments with exciting new distractions. Games with toys are a fantastic way to help your dog engage with you when there are other distractions around. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThey set off along Highwalls Road in dry humid conditions to the Dinas Powys golf course, where a number of golfers were out enjoying the peace and quiet of the early morning before a short climb led them to the One o’Clock gate. Here the leader paused to explain that small leaved lime trees can be found in the adjacent wood, which denotes ancient woodland and also that this particular species of tree has never been found further southwest than Monmouth.Entering Park Wood the path between bare trees and over fallen autumnal leaves led them slightly uphill beside Beauville Wood for a circumnavigation of the pretty woodland to a site overlooking Michaelston. Once a pathway on the north eastern side of the wood led up to a summerhouse belonging to Cwrt yr Ala from where they would have enjoyed lovely views over their vast estate land.Exiting through a gateway there was a chance to examine a piece of rock containing crinoids which are marine animals and ancient fossils that predate dinosaurs by  million years and they are classed as plants not animals.A descent on a slippery and rocky track led them to a viewpoint complete with a wooden seat overlooking Cwrt yr Ala House away in the valley. Robert Rous owned Cwrt yr Ala in  and made many improvements to it and it remained within the family until the death of Georgina Anne Rous in . It then passed to Frances William George Gore, a nephew of the last male heir who preferred to remain in London, so he rented out the house to the renowned Cardf brewer W. H. Brain.Prior to  Mr Gore had tried to sell Cwrt yr Ala and the estate lands to Dr Iorwerth Cyfeiliog Peatewho was looking for a suitable place for the newly proposed Welsh Folk Museum to be sited. In fact Peate was later offered land at St Fagans by the Earl of Plymouth for free as the site and became its first curator from  to . During World War Two he was temporarily dismissed for being a pacist and a conscientious objector, but soon reinstated..removeRecent heavy rainfall had made the normal descent via the bridleway a bit like a slalom so instead they followed tracks through the lower part of the wood to join a farm track at the top end of the steep-sided and wooded Cwm George.A rough farm track brought them to the stone bridge over the fast flowing Cadoxton River and out onto Cwrt-yr-Ala Road for the short journey into Michaelston-le-Pit where they made their way to St Michael and All Angels, to view the ‘sporting side’ of the churchyard where the Brain and Merrett families are buried before partaking of refreshments.William Henry Brainwas an English first-class cricketer and footballer who was noted for being the only man to perform the ‘wicket keeper’s hat trick’ of three dismissals off consecutive deliveries and also John Patrick Brain, a Welsh cricketer and wicketkeeper. Sir Herbert Henry Merrett who owned Cwrt yr Ala was a footballer and referee and chaired both Cardf City Football Club and was president of the Glamorgan County Cricket Club despite being a busy industrialist and Chairman of Powell Dyffryn Ltd. Another gravestone celebrated the Reverend Henry Holmes Stewart, a Scottish clergyman who was a member of the Wanderers team that won the FA Cup in  which was the same year he was ordained as a priest.Then making their way through riverside meadows and across a wooden footbridge, the surrounding trees were bearing pretty yellow catkins as they climbed uphill, then down to re-cross the river into the muddy Millfields and make their way back across the golf course to their start.You can follow the group’s exploits at www.penarthramblers.wordpress or Facebook article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Why  Because that’s the fair thing to do – you don’t condemn a man without a thorough investigation.”Six Tory MPs have now publicly called for Mr Johnson to resign due to the saga.Tim Loughtonbecame the latest on Saturday, citing the “terminal damage” the revelations have done to his reputation.Others, such as former party leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith, said it is for Ms Gray to determine what Mr Johnson knew about possible lockdown breaches in No , while newer MPs suggested the affair raises questions about the “moral authority” at the top of Government.West Dorset MP Chris Loder, who was elected in , told BBC Radio ’s Westminster Hour: “I’m not going to call for anyone’s resignation until I’ve seen the facts, but then real action is required, and then we shall go from there.”Andrew Bowie, Conservative MP for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine, said he will wait to read the conclusions of the investigation but admitted there is “a lot of ill-feeling out there and discomfort” on the Tory benches.For a Tory leadership contest to be triggered,  letters of no confidence in Mr Johnson have to be submitted by MPs to Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the backbench  Committee, asking for a vote on his future.Sir Graham does not publicly state how many letters he has received, but reports suggest about  might have been handed in..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: No plan to save PM with  ured meat u policies  u Zahawi article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

The study also provided further reassurance on the safety of vaccination during pregnancy.Pregnant women are being urged to come forward for Covid vaccinations.Prof McBride said: “This new study provides more evidence that having Covid- during pregnancy carries a far higher risk than having the vaccine, particularly in the later stages where it can have serious consequences for both mother and baby.“The message is clear. Covid- vaccination is crucial in protecting women and babies from the le-threatening complications that can be associated with the virus. Anyone who is pregnant and has not received all of their vaccinations, should not put off getting vaccinated until after their pregnancy.“Omicron is continuing to spread throughout Northern Ireland, soyou are pregnant, or hoping to become pregnant it is absolutely vital that you get vaccinated, this includes getting the booster. Vaccination is the most effective way you can protect yourself and your unborn baby.”Dr Carolyn Bailie, Chair, Northern Ireland Committee of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, said: “The evidence clearly shows that pregnancy puts women and their babies at higher risk from Covid- and that is why we encourage women to get vaccinated at the earliest opportunity. “Vaccination can be given at any stage of pregnancy, so please don’t wait until after your baby is born, it is vital that you and your baby are protected during pregnancy.”Karen Murray, Director for Northern Ireland at the Royal College of Midwives , said: “Having the COVID vaccine is safe for pregnant women and their babies and the best thing they can do to defend them both from the virus. “The statistics are stark the vast majority of pregnant women admitted to hospital with Covid are unvaccinated. The consequences of this, particularly late in pregnancy, can be shattering.
