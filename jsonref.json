Williamson must resign and Boris Johnson must return to deal with this crisis.\u0027 Yesterday exams regulator Ofqual said its algorithm used in A-levels and GCSEs was not used for the majority of vocational and technical qualifications (VTQ) - including BTECs.But in a statement tonight, England\u0027s exams watchdog said some exam boards, including OCR and Pearson, will \u0027need more time\u0027 to recalculate results.It said: \u0027OCR have said that their Cambridge National results will issue next week.\u0027Pearson, which initially did not think there would need to be significant changes made, has now decided to revise its arrangements to ensure that students\u0027 qualification-level results better reflect the unit-level results that students have already secured through internally assessed units.\u0027Ofqual added: \u0027Everyone is working as quickly as possible to confirm results as soon as possible, recognising the impact that delays are having on schools, colleges and students. No learner\u0027s result will go down as a consequence of regrading.\u0027Yesterday, Mr Hughes said: \u0027The timing is worrying, because thousands of students were due to get their results in the morning and others have already got results which we know will not go down, but which might improve.\u0027So it is vital for students that this is sorted in days rather than weeks so that students have the chance to celebrate and to plan their next steps. It is a stressful time and this delay will extend the uncertainties.\u0027 He added: \u0027Those students wanting to move onto further or higher education will be most worried about losing out on places.\u0027We are in close communication with DfE, Ofqual and Pearson to particularly make sure that BTEC students applying for universities can still be treated fairly.\u0027Leora Cruddas, chief executive of the Confederation of School Trusts, said: \u0027This late notification will cause very significant challenges for schools, trusts and colleges.\u0027It simply is unacceptable that some of the most disadvantaged students will not receive their grades tomorrow and that nothing has been done to correct this over the past few days.\u0027Dr Greg Walker, chief executive at the MillionPlus group of universities said: \u0027We must ensure that other learners and applicants are not forgotten. \u0027These include BTEC and other applied generals students whose grades may now be delayed for a significant period to rightly ensure they will be on a par with A-level candidates.\u0027Both the Government and universities should ensure that these applicants don\u0027t get squeezed out in these unprecedented circumstances.\u0027 The National Union of Students (NUS) and the University and College Union (UCU) have also voiced concerns. A spokesman for the Department for Education said: \u0027Our priority is to ensure all students are treated fairly, including those who received vocational and technical results last week, such as BTECs and Cambridge Technicals.\u0027These subjects are rightly assessed differently to A-levels, and the overwhelming majority of results are in line with centre assessment grades.\u0027A minority of vocational and technical qualifications used a statistical model similar to the one Ofqual used for A-levels and GCSEs, and Ofqual has asked these awarding organisations to review their approaches to make sure no student is disadvantaged.\u0027   "},{"url":null,"title":"Madeleine McCann prime suspect Christian Brueckner accomplice witness says","story":"Share this articleMadeleine McCann suspect Christian B had an accomplice during child sex crime in Portugal, says witness"},{"url":null,"title":"British holidaymakers reveal minute dash Croatia","story":"Share this articlePortugal holidays back on but Croatia struck from quarantine-free travelHolidaymakers in Croatia pay hundreds of pounds for alternatives routes home to avoid quarantine | London Evening Standard"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8d7e0bf020385a47d51b259f390f24c6b68ddad6/419_222_2721_1632/master/2721.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b4632d1b8d55753fa79efb627847a603","title":"picture essay america 1930s post office murals","story":"Photographer Justin Hamel stumbled on a Great Depression-era mural one day in a New York post office, and was intrigued to learn there are 1,200 of them across the countryThe instinct to try to boost morale during a time of hardship and suffering resonates today as we face the pandemic and economic recession.Modeled on the 1933 Public Works Art Project, the federal government created the Treasury Section of Painting and Sculpture a year later (the name was subsequently changed to the Section of Fine Arts).These programs were designed to employ artists.The mission of the post office murals was multifaceted – to boost morale in communities, employ artists by the thousands and create world-class art that was accessible to everyone. The murals revolved around local folklore, landscapes, industry and, unsurprisingly, mail delivery. They told the story of life across the United States.The first mural I photographed occurred by happenstance – I stumbled upon a mural depicting the 1932 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid, New York. From there the project slowly grew, as I traveled around the country seeking out the unique art of the post office mural.I’ve now photographed about 325 inidual murals though I don’t have an actual tally.From the magnificent depiction of steam engines being built in the post office in Willard, Ohio, to a serene pondside landscape hanging in the sheriff’s office in Dale county, Alabama, or covered wagons crossing a stream in Crawford, Nebraska, each new mural I discovered offered an engaging view into the local histories of the world around us.In small towns everywhere, history was painted by people who arrived in America seeking a better life. Many of the artists employed by the Section were immigrants. José Aceves, a Mexican-American artist, painted the classic western scene Big City News in Borger, Texas.New and Old Methods of Transportation, showing how the rapid pace at which technology was changing rural towns, was painted by the Polish-American Bernard Zakheim in Mineola, Texas. In a Virginia post office lobby, you’ll find a factory valley landscape entitled Appalachia by Lucienne Bloch, a Swiss-born immigrant.As today’s national discussion in the US has shifted towards institutional racism and the place of art and statues commemorating the United States’ racist history, many post office murals are coming under scrutiny for the way they portray the colonization and slavery. Hollis Holbrook’s John Elliot Speaks to the Natick Indians depicts Native Americans enslaved by Puritans while John Elliot preaches Christianity to them.The city of Natick was founded as the first of many “praying towns” by the Massachusetts Bay Colony, where Native Americans would be forced to learn Christianity.However, the controversy surrounding post office murals is arguably nothing new. In the 1950s, a handful of artists were made to testify under the House committee on un-American activities for their celebration of labor and political undertones.Victor Arnautoff’s historic 10-panel The Life of Washington mural at the George Washington high school in San Francisco is in the midst of a fierce fight to be preserved, hidden or destroyed due to its depictions of George Washington as a slave owner and the dead Native Americans the country was founded upon. Hundreds of murals created under the Section of Fine Arts and the broader Works Progress Administration have been lost or purposely destroyed over the years.The Section of Fine Arts created roughly 1,400 murals and sculptures in federal buildings, not entirely post offices. The PWAP, Treasury Relief Art and Federal Art Project commissioned thousands of other paintings, posters, general art classes, etc, including post office murals.All wrapped into one, it is undoubtedly the largest public art project in the US. The most recent politicization of the post office has brought renewed focus to the ways the postal service is crucial to everyday life. Perhaps an unexpected consequence, scaling back hours and funding will also put this unparalleled collection of public art at risk.• Justin Hamel is a documentary and editorial photographer in El Paso, Texas, working at the intersections of climate, labor and migration."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/262bd47df0273479ce12d1d4acff1b965c4f27a8/98_0_2805_1684/master/2805.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=afd758df1e35b1129e4b16cea55a4e28","title":"matt herron chronicler of the us civil rights movement in pictures","story":"The photographer, who covered protesters and volunteers across the south, has died at 89.

But as infection rates have risen again in parts of the region, some earlier curbs have been reinstated.The latest data, which was published on Friday and focused on the services and manufacturing sectors, is likely to concern policymakers and diminish hopes for a V-shaped recovery, signalling slowing growth. IHS Markit’s flash composite purchasing managers’ index (PMI) fell from 54.9 in July to 51.6. Any number above 50 signals growth.“The fallback in the eurozone composite PMI in August suggests the initial V-shaped rebound following the lifting of the lockdowns is already fizzling out,” said Jessica Hinds at Capital Economics.The flow of new business for firms slowed and once again some of August’s activity was derived by companies completing work backlogs. Germany and France, the bloc’s two biggest economies, also lost economic momentum this month, driven by a services slowdown.Apart from those economies, activity decreased marginally in August, IHS Markit said.Growth in the eurozone’s dominant service sector stalled, with the its PMI index falling to 50.1 from 54.7.With demand waning, the bloc’s services firms cut headcount for a sixth month in a row, and more sharply than in July. Economists noted the employment components of the PMIs suggested more gloom ahead in the jobs market.“Those numbers indicate that the worst is yet to be seen in the euro area labour market and clearly points to a gradual recovery path,” said Tuuli Koivu at Nordea Markets.Factory activity – which did not experience quite as sharp a decline as the service industry during the height of the pandemic – expanded for a second month.But in a sign that factory purchasing managers do not expect a big pick up in activity, they again bought fewer raw materials than in the previous month.EU leaders agreed last month a €750bn (£674bn) pandemic recovery fund, but the relief does not kick in until next year. For its part, the European Central Bank is expected to keep monetary policy ultra-loose for a long time.A full bounceback from the eurozone’s deepest recession on record will take two years or more, according to a recent Reuters poll of economists."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6dcc0c33624ef0d4bb352eb09e81e5ef2a4ef5cb/0_374_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3e480dbf5cd43fb2485b36ea5b6e0b01","title":"i dont want to go abroad why am i seething mass of envy","story":"Just the thought of sitting on a plane makes my hypochondriac heart beat triple time. But I don’t want to hear about anyone’s fabulous time in PatmosUnlike Gore Vidal, I do not need my friends to fail so that I can enjoy my successes. But it is the law that if I am doing nothing, then my friends must be equally bored, too. For those of us who suffer from acute Fomo, AKA fear of missing out (to paraphrase Will Ferrell on sex addiction, it’s a real disease, with doctors and medicine and everything!), lockdown was, well, I don’t want to say it was good, because obviously it was terrible. But it was also, on the most base and selfish level possible, a bit of a relief.No longer was I plagued with the constant tinnitus-like buzzing in my brain telling me that something better was happening elsewhere, that everyone was having fun without me. It’s a terrible affliction, one that once propelled me from a wedding in Sussex at midnight to a 40th birthday in Suffolk, and to a 50th birthday party in Ipswich the day before I gave birth. Insane? Possibly. But I didn’t miss out.Not even having kids and skating past my own 40th birthday knocked that neurotic teenage mentality out of me. Instead, it took a global pandemic.At last, I could feel the peace of not constantly wondering where the fun was, because I knew the answer: the fun was nowhere. I couldn’t do anything and nor could anyone else, and while of course I’d prefer everyone to be having a good time, no one having one was an acceptable alternative. I’m basically the fun communist, in that no one is allowed to have more of it than me. And, going by my memories of studying Animal Farm for GCSE, that’s how communism works.So that, I assumed, was how the rest of 2020 would be. It’s the year of Covid, right? Everyone would just stay home – we’re all in this together. Or, as it turned out, not. I’m like the dorky kid in a movie who excitedly thinks everyone’s coming to her slumber party, only to realise that all the cool kids have gone to an all-night rave or, in my case, to holidays in Portugal, Greece and Mallorca.It was just one or two at first. Friends telling me they hadn’t downgraded that week in Andalucia to a weekend in Aberystwyth. “Oh, those crazy daredevils,” I’d think, regarding them the way I used to regard people who train for marathons or go camping by choice. “I guess there have to be exceptions that prove the rule.” Except, I’m the exception. Last weekend, I couldn’t find a single person to carpe diem with me by spending another Saturday in the local playground, because every single one of them was having a fabulous time in Patmos or Portobloodyfino.“Just about to go for lunch on the beach! I’ll call when I’m back!” trilled my text messages. “Yeah, well, I bet they don’t have Magnums in Greece,” I thought, sulkily sucking on an ice-cream while watching my kids in the sandpit. And then I dropped my Magnum in the sandpit. (It turns out they do have Magnums in Greece.)I don’t even want to go abroad – I really don’t. Just the thought of sitting on a plane makes my hypochondriac heart beat triple time in panic. So maybe I’m not the Ms Fun Town I always thought I was. Maybe I’m Little Miss Anxious. This thought does not improve my mood. Maybe it’s because a close relative is still suffering the long-term effects from Covid, so, for once, the risk feels more real than theoretical.Or maybe I just can’t handle illogicality: if I still can’t have friends over for dinner, why would it be fine for me to be packed on a flight with 180 strangers? I get that expecting consistency from a government led by Boris Johnson – a man who isn’t even consistent about how many children he has – is a fool’s errand, but aren’t we supposed to be helping to suppress this virus, not giving it lifts around the continent on planes? The whole thing makes me want to mock up a protest sign: “If your local beautician still has to wear a hazmat suit to give you a bikini wax, then you probably shouldn’t be going on a beach holiday. And not because of body hair issues, just to be clear. I’m a feminist, y’know.” (Note to self: find a big sign.)Looking at social media this summer has become even more of an exercise in masochism than it already was. I’m a seething mass of jealousy and judgment, and the judgment is really just jealousy felt from the moral high ground. Like I said, I don’t want to go away. I just want everyone else to be as neurotic as me.So here I am, still sitting in my kitchen, furiously liking everyone’s holiday photos on Instagram because I’m a supportive friend, but really not liking them at all, because I’m a bitter person. “Isn’t it lovely when the city is all quiet and empty?” I think, truly the last gasp of the desperate. And just then the drilling starts, because of course my neighbours timed their building work to coincide with their holiday. At least they’ll all have to be quarantined for two weeks when they come back, I tell myself, and then they’ll be stuck inside their homes, just like, er, me. And then all will be right with the world again.

Instead, computer modelling was used to assign grades. But when results were unveiled, there was shock and anger at what looked like clear injustices After all end-of-year exams were scrapped, students in England with offers of university places were awaiting their A-level results with more trepidation than usual. Rather than being judged by their exam performance, their grades had been assigned by a computer model that took into account their previous achievements and that of their school.  As Laura McInerney tells Mythili Rao, while at first glance the results last week looked in line with a normal school year, glaring anomalies and what looked to be huge injustices emerged. As pressure built on the government to explain itself, ministers went silent before the education secretary emerged on Monday to announce a major U-turn.  Students who had been downgraded could now use the grades their schools had predicted. But as university places fill up, some are finding it is too little too late.

(Its jellyfish webcam, meanwhile, was highlighted on Reddit as one of “the best links to click while you’re stoned”.)With 1 million followers on Facebook and now 100,000 subscribers on YouTube, social media has long been central to the aquarium’s mission to inspire ocean conservation. Its first webcams were installed in 2001.But with no date set for reopening, Monterey Bay’s only presence during the pandemic is online, and at a time of great financial need. “It’s a lot of pressure right now to be the public face of the aquarium,” said Allen-Greil.The institution is facing a $45m (£34m) shortfall this year and 174 staff have already lost their jobs: “We have needed more than ever this summer to use these tools for fundraising and to make clear our need.”Monterey Bay’s call for its followers to appeal for emergency congressional funding for aquariums yielded 10,000 responses, as well as $27,000 in direct giving.The aquarium has been exploring new potential sources of revenue, such as educational talks held in the world of the game Animal Crossing, live-streamed over Twitch and YouTube tours behind the scenes of the jellyfish and cephalopod exhibits.“We’ve got a ton of requests like, ‘Can you just Zoom my grandmother on her birthday and feed a penguin? I’ll pay’,” said Allen-Greil. “We’re thinking a lot about what that means for us.”Though online initiatives alone would not save the aquarium, she said, “once we’re ready to open, we’re confident that we’ll have people wanting to come.”Until then: “it’s about bringing the ocean to people in their daily lives.”The National aquarium has three webcams: Blacktip reef sharks, Jellies invasion and Pacific coral reef.Spot more than 50 species of fish in this 100ft tunnel.Choose from 10 live webcams and tune in at the listed times for narrated feedings.Explore.org is the largest live nature cam network, with 21 underwater streams.The Aquarium of the Pacific, Long Beach, CaliforniaBoasts round-the-clock surveillance of its penguin exhibit – above and below water.• This article was amended on 21 August 2020 to correct the caption of the main image.

But while it’s my mission to present vegetables in new and exciting ways, I must confess to a niggling doubt: how many more ways are there to roast a cauliflower, slice a tomato, squeeze a lemon or fry an aubergine?The answer, I’m delighted to report, is many, and in my latest foray, I have been joined by my brilliant colleague and co-writer Ixta Belfrage. Our journey of discovery into the world of vegetables has focused on understanding what makes each one distinct, so they can be tasted afresh. It’s about creating flavour bombs, and it’s done in these three ways.One way to ramp up flavour in a vegetable is to subject it to a process before or during cooking. Three recipes in our new book involve cooking celeriac whole for more than two hours, then dressing and serving it in different ways. During the initial cooking, something magical happens. Much of the water in the celeriac evaporates it turns golden brown, and becomes sweeter and richer. This caramelising is key. Whatever you choose to do – if anything – after this is less important the browning process is such a flavour bomb that the celeriac is heavenly eaten at this stage, cut into wedges and served with a squeeze of lemon or a dollop of creme fraiche. Other processes that elevate vegetables to great heights include charring, ageing and infusing.It’s not so much what you do to an ingredient (“process”) or the ingredient itself (“produce”), but the combination of ingredients in the four most important pairings.Acidity Acidic substances can act as preservatives, improve texture (causing vegetables to cook more slowly and toughen up) and, best of all, balance flavours. A favourite sandwich of ours – a mix of olive oil-roasted vegetables and chillies, piled on toasted sourdough with pecorino shavings or crumbled feta on top – wouldn’t hit the spot without the acidic element counteracting the sweetness and chilli heat.Chilli heat Fresh, pickled, dried, flaked, in pastes, oils, butters and spice mixes: our kitchen is crowded with varities of chilli because the question, “What’s needed?” in a dish is so often answered with “chilli heat”. Chillies’ great gift is their ability to marry together a range of flavours to create a singular harmony.Sweetness All ingredients are a mix of things – sweet and salty, sweet and savoury – and these tastes need each other in order to shine. What would bitter cocoa powder be without sweet sugar? Satisfaction is about the combination, the layering, the contrast of tastes. With sweetness in particular, without the complexity, you run the risk of turning your dish into a dessert. Fat Take a simple salad – tomato and basil, say – and it’s one thing: sweet, refreshing and lovely. Add mozzarella, though, or tangy feta, and it becomes something entirely different. It’s no longer just the picture: it’s the entire summer holiday. Add another layer of fat in the form of olive oil and the dish is complete.In some cases, there’s so much going on within the ingredient that it can pretty much do all the work on its own, its deliciousness teased out by baking or toasting or frying.Such ingredients are often intensely savoury, and rich in the fifth flavour, umami (the others are sweet, sour, salty and bitter), the result of flavour compounds called glutamates. Unlike monosodium glutamate (chemically manufactured and liberally sprinkled over takeaways), there are many natural sources: parmesan, anchovies, mushrooms, tomatoes, soy sauce, seaweed, Marmite and ketchup.After years of cooking vegetables, I never cease to be surprised by their chameleon-like ability to take on flavour and metamorphose from one dish to the next. A simple cauliflower can reinvent itself, showing up as a seductive Levantine fritter, then grilled with saffron and raisins, disguised as bulgur in a modern take on tabbouleh, followed by a glamorous savoury cake, a meaty steak, dressed as (coronation) chicken or simply served whole, grilled yet unadorned. This is how wide the range and how wondrous the potential of every single vegetable. Magical, to borrow a term favoured by my five-year-old son.Preparing vegetables hasselback involves slicing them thinly, but not all the way down, so the slices remain held together at the base, like a fan: they not only look great but have deliciously crispy edges all over.To offset the extra work, start with shop-bought ready-cooked beetroots (plain, not in vinegar). If you do end up using raw beets, try to get bunches and use the stems and leaves to make our tempura stems, leaves and herbs.Serves 4 as a side8-10 medium-large beetroots (that’s about 2 bunches), skin on (1.2kg) or 8-10 ready-cooked beetroots (1kg)Flaked sea saltFor the lime leaf butter90g unsalted butter40ml olive oil5 fresh kaffir lime leaves, chopped10g fresh ginger, peeled and chopped1 garlic clove, crushed1 tbsp lime juice, plus 2 tsp to serveFor the lime leaf salsa10 fresh kaffir lime leaves, stalks removed and very finely chopped½ tsp fresh ginger, peeled and very finely chopped½ garlic clove, crushed½ green chilli, very finely chopped (deseeded for less heat)1 tbsp coriander leaves, chopped3 tbsp olive oilFor the yoghurt cream80ml double cream90g Greek-style yoghurtHeat the oven to 220C (200C fan) 425Fgas 7. Place the beets in a baking dish in a single layer. Fill with water to 2cm up the sides, sprinkle on one tablespoon of salt, cover tightly with foil and bake for one hour and 20 minutes, or until a knife goes through easily. Discard water and, when cool enough, peel off the skin under cold running water (wear gloves to avoid staining). Halve larger beetroots lengthways. Reduce oven temperature to 190C.While the beetroots are cooking, put the butter, oil, lime leaves, ginger and garlic into a small pan on a medium-high heat. Gently cook until the butter begins to bubble, about four minutes, then set aside to infuse for at least 40 minutes. Discard the aromatics, then stir in one tablespoon of lime juice and one teaspoon of flaked salt.For the salsa, mix all the ingredients in a small bowl with a quarter-teaspoon of flaked salt, and set aside.In a medium bowl, whip the cream, yoghurt and a pinch of flaked salt until light and fluffy, with medium-stiff peaks, about three minutes. Refrigerate until ready to use.Cut slits in the peeled beetroots at 4mm intervals, stopping about 1cm from the bottom. Place on a small parchment-lined baking tray and fan the slices out. Spoon the melted butter evenly over, especially between the slices. Roast for one and a quarter hours, basting very well every 20 minutes or so, until the edges are crisp and caramelised. Set aside to cool for 15 minutes.Spread the yoghurt cream on a platter, then arrange the beets on top, spooning the butter over. Drizzle over the salsa, finish with remaining lime juice and serve at once.Huge quantities of beets are roasted across the Ottolenghi restaurants, so we’re always on the lookout for clever ways of using the stems and leaves. If you don’t have any, use basil, parsley, sage or chard. Just make sure the leaves are not limp and wet, or hard and dry. The batter will be enough for 100g of leaves and herbs.Make sure your prep is done before the oil gets too hot and have a slotted spoon and a rack lined with kitchen paper at the ready. Tempura doesn’t sit too well, so try to eat it right away.Serves 6 as a snack or a little starter70g beetroot leaves and stems (cut to 8cm lengths), washed and patted dry20g dill, patted dry, in 8cm fronds10g mint, patted dry, leaves picked½ tbsp Szechuan peppercorns, crushed with a pestle and mortarFlaked sea saltFor the tangerine dipping sauce50ml tangerine juice, with bits (from 2-3 tangerines)3 tbsp lime juice1½ tsp maple syrup ½ small garlic clove, finely chopped4 fresh kaffir lime leaves, stalks discarded and leaves finely chopped½ red chilli, deseeded and choppedFor the batter80g self-raising flour80g cornflour, plus 50g for dipping210ml ice-cold sparkling water (small bits of ice welcome)1½ tbsp black sesame seeds700ml sunflower oil, for deep-fryingIn a small serving bowl, stir together all the dipping sauce ingredients with an eighth of a teaspoon of flaked salt, and set aside.For the batter, put the flour, 80g of cornflour, water, one teaspoon of flaked salt and the seeds into a large bowl. Whisk gently until the mixture just comes together.Pour the oil into a medium high-sided saute pan and place on a high heat. Once very hot, lower to medium and test by dropping in a little batter it should sizzle but not brown straight away. In batches, toss stems, leaves and herbs in the 50g of cornflour, shake to remove any excess, then dip in the batter. Lift, shake the excess over the bowl, then place as many pieces in the oil as can comfortably fit without touching. Fry for 30-60 seconds on each side, until crisp and pale golden, then use a slotted spoon to transfer to a kitchen paper-lined rack. Continue with the rest, then sprinkle the lot with the pepper and salt. Transfer to a platter and serve hot with the dipping sauce alongside.In 2016, the German minister for agriculture wanted to ban naming vegetable-based foods after their meaty counterparts, claiming terms such as “vegetarian schnitzel” were unsettling and misleading. Ours aren’t vegetarian schnitzels, they are vegetable ones – a semantic difference but a big one. In any case, we hope our choice of title does not offend.The sauce is a take on the classic Marie Rose but turbocharged. It’s also great in sandwiches and will keep in the fridge for up to a week. Serves 4 as a starter8 red Romano peppers (850g)Salt, flaked sea salt and black pepper100g plain flour4 eggs, beaten100g panko breadcrumbs60g sesame seeds, white andor black16 fresh kaffir lime leaves, stalks discarded and leaves finely chopped1 tbsp nori sprinkles (or blitz a sheet of nori in a spice grinder and use 1 tbsp)600ml sunflower oil, for deep-frying2 limes: finely grate the zest to get 2 tsp, then cut into wedges to serveFor the Marie Rose sauce 1 whole head of garlic, top fifth cut off to expose the clovesSalt and black pepper180g cherry tomatoes4 large red chillies (75g)1 tbsp maple syrup2 tsp Worcestershire sauce½ tsp chipotle flakes60g mayonnaiseHeat the oven to 250C (230C fan)480Fgas 9½. To make the sauce, sprinkle the garlic with salt and pepper, wrap in foil and place on a parchment-lined baking tray with the tomatoes and chillies. Roast for 30 minutes, until they begin to blacken and blister. Remove from oven and, when cool, squeeze the garlic into the small bowl of a food processor, discarding the skins. Add the chillies (deseeded for less heat), tomatoes, maple syrup, Worcestershire sauce, chipotle flakes and a quarter-teaspoon of salt blitz to a coarse paste. Leave to cool, then mix in the mayonnaise and refrigerate until you’re ready to serve.Meanwhile, cut a 5cm slit vertically in the base of each pepper, then place on a large parchment-lined baking tray (you can roast them at the same time as the garlic, near the bottom of the oven). Roast for 16 minutes, turning over halfway, until cooked through and beginning to blacken. Transfer to a sieve, cut side down, to drain any liquid, taking care to keep the stalks intact. Once cool, carefully peel away as much skin as possible without puncturing the flesh, then sprinkle with salt and set aside.Prepare three shallow containers long enough to fit the peppers. In the first, mix flour with one teaspoon of flaked salt and plenty of black pepper put the eggs in the second in the last mix breadcrumbs, sesame seeds, lime leaves, nori, two teaspoons of flaked salt and a generous grind of pepper.Set a large metal rack over one tray and line another with plenty of kitchen paper. Dip each pepper first into the flour, then the egg and finally the panko mixture, shaking off any excess as you go lie it on the rack and repeat with the rest of the peppers.Pour the oil into a large, high-sided saute pan or wok on a medium-high heat. Once very hot, fry the peppers two at a time so you don’t overcrowd them. Lower in carefully and fry for one and a half to two minutes on each side, until golden brown and crisp, then transfer to the paper-lined tray.Serve at once, with lime zest and sea salt sprinkled on top, and lime wedges and Marie Rose sauce alongside.Lime, chilli and garlic are the key flavours here, coming through the oil and the crispy sprinkle at the end. If using dried beans, soak a day ahead with tinned or jarred, add to the cooked shallots with 60ml of water and cook just until heated through.Serves 4 as a side2 banana shallots, finely chopped 2 garlic cloves, crushed4 fresh kaffir lime leaves1 ancho chilli, torn in halfSalt350g black turtle beans, soaked all night in cold water with 1 tsp bicarb of soda (or 800g cooked beans)3 tbsp lime juice½ small coconut, roughly grated (50g)For the fried aromatics 90ml olive oil 2 garlic cloves, thinly sliced2 red chillies, thinly sliced in rounds10 fresh kaffir lime leaves2 tsp black mustard seedsStart with the aromatics. Heat oil in a small pan on a medium-high heat. Once hot, reduce heat to medium, add garlic, chillies and lime leaves, and fry for two minutes, stirring. Add mustard seeds and fry for another 30 seconds, until the garlic starts to turn golden brown. Strain over a bowl. Set aromatics and oil aside separately.For the beans, put three tablespoons of reserved oil into a medium pan on a medium-high heat add shallots, garlic, lime leaves, ancho chilli and one and a quarter teaspoons of salt. Reduce heat to medium and fry for six minutes, stirring often, until the shallots are soft and golden. Rinse beans, then add to pan with 700ml water. Bring to a simmer, lower heat to medium and cook for 40 minutes, stirring occasionally, until cooked but still holding their shape. Remove from heat, cover and leave for 10 minutes.Transfer to a lipped platter or large, shallow bowl. Discard lime leaves and ancho chilli. Drizzle over lime juice and remaining oil, top with coconut and fried aromatics, and serve.We urge you to try our version of rasam, a South Indian broth, despite the longish ingredient list, to discover a whole range of new flavours.Use tamarind pulp, not paste (available in any Indian supermarket), to get the sweet acid kick you’re after.You’ll need to soak the rice for an hour in water. The balls can be made ahead and kept refrigerated in a sealed container return to room temperature before pouring over the hot broth.Serves 4 as a main50g block of tamarind pulp30g ginger, skin on, thinly sliced15g turmeric, skin on, thinly sliced1 large green chilli, roughly slicedSalt250g cherry tomatoes2½ tbsp sunflower oil½ lemon, halved lengthways, cut into ¼cm-thick half-moons (pips removed)1½ tsp cumin seeds, finely crushed1 tsp black mustard seeds2 whole dried red chillies20 fresh curry leaves (optional)3 garlic cloves, crushed3-4 plum tomatoes (300g), coarsely grated and skins discarded (250g)2 tsp caster sugarFor the rice balls200g Thai sticky rice, soaked for 1 hour in cold water, then drained well2 tbsp sunflower oil, plus extra for shaping1 onion, peeled and finely chopped 2 garlic cloves, crushed15g fresh ginger, peeled and grated10g coriander, roughly chopped, plus extra picked leaves and stalks2 spring onions, thinly sliced (30g)For the rasam, add the first four ingredients, 1.2 litres of water and one teaspoon of salt to a medium pan on a medium-high heat. Bring to the boil, then simmer gently for 20 minutes, stirring to break apart the pulp. Push through a sieve into a bowl, then discard the aromatics.Meanwhile, put rice in a medium pan with 220ml water and three-quarters of a teaspoon of salt. Bring to the boil on medium-high heat, then lower heat and cover loosely, leaving a small gap for steam to escape. Cook for 20 minutes, then remove from heat and let sit, uncovered, until cool.Toss cherry tomatoes in one and a half teaspoons of oil. Place a large saute pan on a high heat. Once smoking, add tomatoes and cook, tossing occasionally, until charred and blistered, about four minutes. Set aside. Add lemons and cook until charred, 30-50 seconds a side. Set aside. Turn heat down to medium-high, add remaining oil, cumin and mustard seeds, dried chillies, curry leaves and garlic, and cook for 90 seconds, until fragrant. Add grated plum tomatoes cook for five minutes more, then add sugar, tamarind liquid, charred tomatoes and half a teaspoon of salt. Bring back to the boil and simmer for eight minutes. Set aside while you prepare the rice balls.Put the oil into a saute pan on a medium-high heat. Add onion and cook for seven minutes, until soft and browned. Add garlic and ginger, and cook for 90 seconds. Remove from heat and transfer to a bowl with the cooked rice, coriander and spring onion. Mix well. With lightly oiled hands, form into 12 balls (30-35g each).To serve, heat through the rasam, then add charred lemon slices. Divide rice balls between four bowls, pour over the rasam and top with coriander.These onions are a revelation, and the very definition of low efforthigh impact. Two things are vital, though: the roasting tray must be big enough to fit 16 onion halves (if not, roast fewer, decreasing other ingredients proportionally) and these must be basted well, so they remain moist. Serve spooned over toast, mashed potatoes or rice, or with roast chicken.Serves 6 as a sideHeat the oven to 260C (240C fan)500Fgas 10. Halve the onions lengthways, trim tops and a little off the bottom (you want the halves held together at the base).Whisk butter, miso and one litre of warm water until fully combined.Space apart the onion halves, cut side down, in a 40cm x 28cm high-sided baking tray or dish. Pour over the miso water, cover tightly with foil, bake for 35 minutes, then remove foil and turn onions cut side up. Baste well and cook, uncovered, for 45 minutes, basting every 10 minutes, until very soft and deep brown.Carefully transfer to a platter, pouring sauce over. Serve at once.This is as fresh as a potato salad will get, thanks to the large quantities of lime, garlic, chilli and Thai basil poured over it. It will make a good light supper with broccoli and will also partner well with salmon or roast chicken.If you can’t get hold of Thai basil, use an equal combination of coriander and ordinary basil. The salsa won’t stay bright green for long, so make it just before you’re ready to serve.When jerusalem artichokes are in season, we like to roast them and add to this salad. If you’re not a fan, substitute them with the same amount of potatoes (in which case they’ll all be boiled, so no need to turn on the oven).Serves 4 as a side600g small to medium salad potatoes (or 1.1kg, if you’re not using jerusalem artichokes), peeled and cut into 3-4cm pieces Salt and flaked sea salt 600g jerusalem artichokes, peeled and cut into 3cm pieces (500g)  75ml olive oil 50g breakfast radishes, thinly sliced 3 limes: finely grate the zest to get 1¼ tbsp, then juice to get 3 tbsp 1 small garlic clove, roughly chopped 15g fresh ginger, peeled and roughly chopped 28g Thai basil, 20g roughly chopped, the rest picked leaves to serve 1 large green chilli, finely sliced into rounds 30g smoked, ready-roasted and salted almonds, roughly chopped (or ordinary ready-roasted almonds) Membership Event: Flavour, with Yotam Ottolenghi and Ixta Belfrage Heat the oven to 230C (210C fan)450Fgas 8 (if roasting artichokes). Put the potatoes into a large pan, cover with cold, salted water, bring to a simmer, then cook for around 10 minutes, or untilcooked through but still holding their shape. Drain and set aside to cool for 15 minutes.Meanwhile, mix artichokes (if using) with one tablespoon of oil and half a teaspoon of flaked salt, and spread out on a parchment-lined baking tray. Bake for 18-20 minutes, tossing halfway through, until golden brown and cooked through. Leave to cool for a few minutes, then put into a large bowl with the cooled potatoes.While the artichokes are roasting, mix the radishes with one tablespoon of the lime juice and a quarter-teaspoon of flaked salt, and set aside.In a spice grinder or the small bowl of a food processor, blitz the lime zest, garlic, ginger and the 20g of Thai basil with one teaspoon of flaked salt and the remaining 60ml of oil to get a bright green paste. Scrape into the bowl of potatoes, with the remaining two tablespoons of lime juice. Gently stir through the radishes (including the liquid) and the picked Thai basil leaves.Finish with the chilli and almonds, and serve.On paper it may not sound as if it would work, but the combination of figs, Chinese rice wine and ricotta is marvellous. This dish is a fine balance of sweet and savoury, so it’s important your figs are ripe and sweet. If they aren’t, increase the amount of maple syrup a little.The infused oil and cooked figs need time to marinate, so make them a day ahead if you like. The figs can be cooked up to three days before and kept in the fridge (just bring back to room temperature before you assemble the salad). You can even leave them in the fridge for up to three weeks to ferment (or at least become a little funky) they make a great addition to a cheese board.Serves 4 as a starter8 ripe purple figs, halved (320g) 1 tbsp soy sauce 2½ tbsp maple syrup 2 tbsp Shaoxing rice wine (or pale dry sherry) 2½ tsp Chinkiang vinegar (or half the amount of balsamic vinegar) 60ml olive oil 2 red chillies, finely sliced into rounds (20g) 1 lemon: finely shave the skin to get 5 strips 60g rocket 140g ricottaHeat the oven to its highest grill setting. Toss the figs with the soy sauce and one and a half tablespoons of maple syrup, then arrange, cut side up and spaced apart, on a medium, parchment-lined baking tray. Make sure there is no overhanging parchment that could burn under the grill. Roast for 12 minutes on the top shelf of the oven, until they are soft and caramelised, but still holding their shape. Return figs and cooking juices to the bowl, with the rice wine, vinegar and remaining tablespoon of maple syrup. Gently mix, then set aside for at least one hour (or overnight) for the flavours to come together.Meanwhile, heat the oil in a small pan on a medium heat and, once hot, fry the chillies for three minutes, stirring to separate the slices. Add the lemon strips and fry for 30 seconds until fragrant, then immediately pour into a heatproof bowl and set aside to infuse for at least 30 minutes (or overnight).Arrange the rocket on a platter and top with the figs and dressing. Dot with spoonfuls of the ricotta, finish with the infused oil, chillies and lemon strips, and serve.• Extracted from Ottolenghi Flavour, by Yotam Ottolenghi and Ixta Belfrage, published by Ebury on 3 September at £27.

Being around good food most of my working day has made me so, but, having always been a curious eater, I guess it all started at a very young age. Recently, however, the simple fact that my eyes are bigger than my stomach, plus the price that I pay around my waistline every time I bite into something tempting, has forced me to reconsider my snacking habits. So humour me while I engage in a bit of wishful thinking, imagining the perfect snacks, prepared with attention and much thought, and consumed only when it’s right and proper.Bagna cauda is an Italian dip made from anchovies, garlic and olive oil. This version includes cooked and fresh herbs, which increases its savoury intensity and vibrancy. Don’t feel as if you need to stick to the vegetables mentioned here you can use any you have to hand to dip into the sauce, or just use some toasted pitta chips instead, if you prefer.Prep 35 minCook 45 minServes 6 as a snack200ml olive oil, plus extra for drizzling2 onions, peeled, halved and thinly sliced (300g)70g parsley, roughly chopped70g coriander, roughly chopped50g dill, roughly chopped6 spring onions, trimmed and finely sliced (75g)½ tsp ground turmeric2 tsp cumin seeds, roughly crushed in a mortar15 garlic cloves, peeled and left whole12 anchovy fillets in olive oil, drained (40g)75ml lemon juice20g mint leaves, pickedSalt and black pepperFor the crudite (optional)1 radicchio trevisano (or red ene), leaves separated 150g baby carrots, peeled100g sugar snap peas, stringy bits removed150g rainbow (or breakfast) radishes, halvedPut three tablespoons of oil in a large saute pan on a medium-high heat. Once hot, add the onions and cook, stirring occasionally, for 12-15 minutes, or until softened and well browned. Transfer half the onions and their oil to a bowl and return the rest to a medium heat. Stir in 50g each of the parsley and coriander, 40g of the dill and all the spring onions, and cook, stirring often, for 15 minutes, or until the mix is deeply green and fragrant, but not at all browned. Add the spices, cook for three minutes more, then turn off the heat and leave to cool.Meanwhile, put the garlic and remaining 155ml oil in a small saucepan, for which you have a lid. Cover, put on a medium-low heat and leave to cook for 10 minutes, stirring once halfway, until the garlic has started to soften. Add the anchovies, replace the lid, cook for another 10 minutes, then turn off the heat and leave to cool.Put the herb and garlic mixtures in a food processor with the lemon juice, mint, remaining parsley, coriander and dill, a quarter-teaspoon of salt and a good grind of pepper, and blitz smooth. Transfer to a bowl, top with the reserved browned onions and stir them through a little. Put the bowl on a board or slateand arrange the prepared crudites all around it. Finally, drizzle a little oil all over the crudites, season lightly and serve.Make these crisps your own by using any mature cheese you have around instead of the parmesan, and adding your favourite dried herbs or spices. If you want to save time, buy a good commercial brand of tapenade instead of making your own a quick pesto or chilli sauce would also work as an alternative.Prep 20 minCook 55 minCool 35 minServes 4 as a snack650ml water¾ tsp chilli flakes (optional)2 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed2 tbsp olive oilSalt and black pepper150g quick-cook polenta80g parmesan, finely gratedFor the tapenade75g pitted kalamata olives1½ tbsp capers½ small shallot, peeled and roughly chopped (30g)1 lemon – juiced, to get 1 tbsp, and zest finely grated, to get 1½ tsp2-3 tbsp (10g) parsley, roughly chopped1½ tsp cumin seeds, toasted and roughly crushed in a mortar60ml olive oilCut out two roughly 40cm x 30cm pieces of greaseproof paper and lay them flat on a work surface.Put the water, chilli (if using), garlic, a tablespoon of oil and a teaspoon of salt in a medium saucepan and bring to a boil. Turn down the heat to medium-low and slowly pour in the polenta, whisking constantly to avoid any lumps. Cook for about two minutes, or until the polenta starts to pull away from the sides of the pan, then add the cheese and cook, stirring continuously, for a minute more, until nicely melted into the polenta.Working quickly now, pour the polenta on to the centre of one of the pieces of greaseproof paper and top with the other piece. Use a rolling pin to roll and spread out the polenta evenly, until it’s about ½cm thick, then leave to cool completely and firm up – about 30 minutes. Heat the oven to 220C (200C fan)425Fgas 7. Peel away the top sheet of greaseproof paper and brush the exposed polenta with another tablespoon of oil. Use a sharp knife to cut the polenta into uneven squares of about 3cm x 3cm in size (mismatched shapes add to the charm of the finished dish). Spread the polenta squares over two large oven trays lined with baking paper, then bake for 20 minutes. Swap the trays around in the oven, bake for 15-20 minutes more, or until lightly golden, then remove and leave to cool for about five minutes.Meanwhile, put all the tapenade ingredients bar a tablespoon of the oil in a food processor, season with plenty of pepper and pulse to a rough paste.

There was a shout from somewhere in the stand and, Seven Nation Army playing for her this time, Wade clenched her fist and broke into a broad smile. Teammates in orange ran over and embraced her, some sense of vindication perhaps, however short-lived.No, Glasgow City didn’t lead and, no, they weren’t going through, but no one had expected them to do either of those things – and at least they had left some mark. Ultimately, though, Wolfsburg left a far greater mark on them and may leave a lasting mark on this competition. So impressive here, they took their opponents apart piece by piece from start to finish and must be considered contenders, a side with so much quality and confidence, quick and clever players in every position. Svenja Huth and Pernille Harder, in particular.Glasgow had already let in five by the time they scored and they would let in a further four, the gulf between these two clubs gigantic. But then they knew that, underlined as it was even underlined by the subs’ bench. Never mind the names, look at the numbers: 11 for Wolfsburg, five for Glasgow. And, as if that abyss wasn’t wide enough, the tournaments only part-time team hadn’t played since November while the Germans had won their restarted league and cup, 66-1 on favourites to win this match. It had been hard enough for Glasgow to get a team here at all.Glasgow’s founder had said that it makes her “giggle” to see the teams they were up against. Here was a moment to smile, at least, something to take home from an evening that was largely chastening, reality allowing little room for romance. Mostly, they wore more pained expressions, especially when the final cruel blow was delivered.With seven minutes left, Glasgow took off the goalkeeper Lee Alexander. She had saved three penalties to bring them here. Now, though, she had let in eight. Erin Clachers replaced her and immediately saw Harder smash a shot against her bar. Then she too let one in, helplessly watching an own goal loop over her head off Leanne Ross in the last minute.That was one of two own goals Glasgow’s desperately unlucky captain scored. There were also four goals from the superb Harder, two from Ingrid Engen and one from Felicitas Rauch. The doubt had always been not so much if Wolfsburg would score as when, and how often. Some had genuinely predicted double figures, which was avoided at least. Small mercies. The answer to the first question was 15 minutes the answer to the second was eight.Harder got the first of them, which was not much a surprise either, a shot from the edge of the area giving her a 35th goal this season. She wasn’t about to stop there, either. Engen headed in a corner well inside the six-yard box to make it two soon after., Wolfsburg turning the screw and allowing no way out. The ball was theirs alone, used smartly, comfort in everything they did. A gorgeous nutmeg from Ewa Pajor somehow didn’t get the finish it deserved but it was relentless, so much of it building on the rightIt wasn’t until the 37th minute that Glasgow produced their first shot and by then their opponents had taken 13 and they added a third goal on 44 minutes, another slick move concluding with Huth’s beautiful ball bent in for Engen to finish. There was still time for another before the break, the look on Rachel McLauchlan’s face an increasingly familiar picture of helplessness as a free-kick was given away. It was played short and Harder smashed in a shot from 20 yards.Wolfsburg were not done, even if the game was, and Harder definitely wasn’t. Ten minutes after the restart she had her hat-trick. Another Huth cross, another header, and it was 5-0. Glasgow got theirs, but still Wolfsburg came again, again, again and again. Four minutes later Rauch made it 6-1, Harder got the seventh – Huth again the provider. And just when it seemed it couldn’t get worse, two more, horrible moments followed, self-inflicted this time, Wade’s moment of wonder now buried under a pile of goals."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e2e33afd3a4fe7e07f0f80f99455349d12072bd/0_202_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=d31a03f4c35df7e06d1afbb4ce89548a","title":"fit in my 40s at home cycle a tour listen hamilton","story":"With a turbo trainer I can join cycling groups or races, add music and hit the virtual roadCycling is one of those in-the-moment pursuits, when you’re outdoors, going nowhere, quite fast, for the hell of it, with a breeze in your hair, and you can’t imagine doing it any other way, least of all in a gym. (Except when it’s raining, and you do need a gym.) But in the absence of gyms, people went crazy for the turbo trainer. The one I borrowed for a week was the Zwift Tacx Neo 2T, which has its downsides (mainly cost) but also many qualities: principally, even the biggest idiot in the world can affix it to their bike – remove your back wheel, attach the trainer at the sprocket and you’re set.And this is where modernity actually makes life more interesting, rather than just harder: riding indoors on your own is boring. Riding with Zwift – an app which has tailored programs, races with other users from all over the world, grand tours through CGI scenery – is not boring. I’ve actually done it before, but only at its London HQ, and it’s hard to get truly enthusiastic when you’re politely feigning immediate enthusiasm.Zwift is quite cagey about its user numbers, though don’t ask me why. The spokesperson, Chris Snook, would only tell me concurrent users, the peak numbers of people on it at the same time, which surged (unsurprisingly) with the pandemic to 35,000. It is impossible, in other words, that you won’t find someone at your own level, however low that level is. And this is a recent thing: “Historically,” Snook said, “we really targeted enthusiasts, used a lot of professional cyclists, and that can be a bit daunting for beginners.” All that was upturned this year, when it added training programmes and competitions for novices.But there’s still no cure for idleness, and I abandoned the idea of racing quite early on, because even people who claim to be useless are still quite plucky. I mainly did tours, at pathetic speeds, genuinely enjoying myself. The thing I loved above anything was that you can blast yourself with music, there being zero chance of getting run over. Sometimes I’ll try a podcast while I’m on the road, but listening to Hamilton from start to finish is just too dangerous, even for a high-risk personality.The big draw, generally, is that you can create private groups and cycle as if you’re in a club, which accounts for the massive spike in sales this year. You do need a turbo trainer, and to have signed up, but they don’t have to be as expensive as mine: I saw one for £99 on wiggle.I’m not that interested in other people, because they’re all faster than me, and also: music. But the world of Zwift (along with other, smaller platforms such as BKOOL and sufferfest) has turned out to be the Zoom of fitness, probably the best single fix for the unbearable atomisation of 2020. And then, once you’ve got your set up, you can carry it through to other, less major calamities, like a bit of rain.The ramp test is a way of measuring your fitness, or FTP (functional threshold power). It’s basically a warmup then a steep climb."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/27461c37ca96d72b1ad6f3c3f6c201dea44aec95/0_0_6016_3610/master/6016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=33297d9692c99d0f054ab24749cfeb5b","title":"marmalade was originally made from which fruit the weekend quiz","story":"From a teacher to an emperor, test your knowledge with the Weekend quiz1 Edinburgh teacher Christina Kay inspired which character?2 Which Englishman is a patron saint of Germany?3 What is the only great ape in Asia?4 What term for favouritism comes from Latin for nephew?5 In recycling, what is cullet?6 Which ex-prime minister infamously hosted a TV chat show?7 In 1571, Fatehpur Sikri became the capital of which empire?8 Marmalade was originally made from which fruit?What links:9 Dartmouth, Devon Annapolis, Maryland Lanvéoc, Brittany?10 Carduelis carduelis Carel Fabritius Donna Tartt?11 Tarsal (7) phalange (14) metatarsal (5)?12 Jennings Gunter Shilton Dalglish?13 Apostate emperor Moby last Stuart monarch first Hanoverian TV Mallett?14 Carder leafcutter mining honey?15 Horatio Nelson Saddam Hussein Edward Colston?1 Jean Brodie (in the Muriel Spark novel).2 St Boniface.3 Orangutan.4 Nepotism.5 Broken or waste glass.6 Harold Wilson.7 Mughal empire.8 Quince.9 Location of naval academies: Britain US France.10 The goldfinch: scientific name painted 1654 picture wrote novel.11 Bones of the foot.12 Most-capped footballers of home nations: Pat, Northern Ireland Chris, Wales Peter, England Kenny, Scotland.13 Enid Blyton’s Famous Five: Julian Dick Anne George Timmy.14 Types of bee.15 Statues destroyedremoved: Dublin, 1966 Baghdad, 2003 Bristol, 2020."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/99af71b1e3c7e08d453f2cb99f60174d9ae971cd/0_0_1630_1866/master/1630.jpg?width=645\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5dda7bc4af0c0409910a8b1a244e77ee 645w","title":"living in the uk are you planning to move out of a city or urban area","story":"We would like to hear from people who are moving to smaller towns or more rural areas and what their reasons areAre you planning on moving out of a city?Some have noticed an increase in people wanting to move out of cities amid an increase in home working and a desire for more outside space.Whether you are buying or renting, if you are moving out of a city centre to a more suburban or rural area, we would like to hear from you.

They explain why they no longer fear nightclubs and why farming is the futureAnd so a summer has passed without a single tent unwittingly erected next to an all-night soundsystem, a single wristband being slipped off and passed back, a single bottle of supermarket vodka decanted into a bottle of mineral water. This has been our first year without dance festivals or open nightclubs since the second summer of love (although there has been a surge of illegal lockdown raves). Even as aspects of normal life return, the one thing most Brits haven’t done since early 2020 is dance with one another.So while it makes sense that Taylor Swift would release an album of folky introspection during this time, it seems almost perverse that Disclosure, whose whole rave-on d’être is to headline festivals in home counties woodland, or come on at 3am at an Ibiza superclub, would choose this moment to release their first album in five years.“It does feel strange to make an album of club music when all the clubs are closed,” says Guy Lawrence, speaking over Zoom alongside younger brother Howard, from their studio in Guy’s basement. He’s got his hair neatly slicked and is surrounded by flashy production gear. “But after a few months of delaying we realised this was a perfect time to release an album called Energy which has a lot of positive messages about strength and courage. OK, we finished it in November so we didn’t make it intentionally for a pandemic, but it does work well.”It is true that Energy’s title track – which samples a motivational speaker hollering, “Right now, you should feel invincible” – could easily be used in some kind of BBC clap-for-carers compilation. But the record also feels like a departure for a band who started out 10 years ago only planning to make a few UK garage productions and put them on Myspace.I first interviewed the brothers for the  in 2013 when Howard was still a teenager, Guy was yet to turn 22 and all their songs were made on one laptop, mostly using plug-ins they’d illegally downloaded. By that point they were already playing big headline shows, but still seemed in awe that Latch and White Noise, two songs they’d worked on above their parents’ auction house in Surrey, were riding high in the charts.What was impressive about Disclosure in those early years was how they straddled every dance music faction: their songs could be heard in trendy deep house raves, student nightclubs and the changing rooms of Topman. Their debut album Settle embodied that have-your-cake-and-eat-it approach. It featured a bunch of middle-tier UK vocalists such as Sasha Keable, Eliza Doolittle and Jamie Woon – the kind of acts who might support Ed Sheeran for a UK tour. Yet the undeniable songwriting and fresh take on UK garage meant it was a critical success, nominated for a Mercury, Brit and Grammy.Two years later they followed up with Caracal, which repeated many of the same tricks but this time with access to nicer gear and a higher calibre of international artists including the Weeknd, Lorde and Miguel. It went to No 1 in the UK and top 10 in the US. By 2016, just three years after their debut album, they were headlining the Other stage at Glastonbury and curating their own huge festival, Wild Life, on the East Sussex coast.At the time of their debut, Howard in particular seemed weary of their new lifestyle. He’d only just decided he liked dance music and was still opposed to most of the trappings that came with it. “I don’t really like crowds,” he said then. “Loads of slobbering, drunk people isn’t that fun when you’re not drunk. I love the music in the clubs we play I just don’t necessarily love the people.”Both brothers laugh when I read this quote back to them now. “Well,” says Howard, “when you’re 15 and you go to a club, it’s a pretty terrifying place. I wanted to get to our shows as late as possible, get straight on stage and get the hell out. I felt really unwelcome, I was only there to work.” He has warmed to the club experience in the intervening years, but still has never done drugs. “I realise they are an important part of dance music, though – I did think about trying MDMA at one point, for research.”While Howard still has mixed feelings about their lives as dance superstars, Guy relishes it. Even during lockdown, he’s been in LA with his girlfriend, working on the record and doing a Boiler Room set from his front room surrounded by potted plants. Howard, by contrast, took his money from the first record and bought a plot of land out in the Sussex countryside.“When we came off tour five years ago I got my house, and planted, like, 1,000 trees and started growing food. I still buy flour and milk but a large amount of my food I grow myself. I get pleasure out of being out in nature and watching things grow. You grow a bit with them,” he says philosophically.Howard is quiet when we’re talking about live shows, preferring to reflect on their career via reference to the works of Ernst Gosch, the father of syntropic agriculture, which he has been reading about in lockdown.“Gosch says that everyone knows the important role bees play in pollinating the plants, but they don’t do that tactically to pollinate plants, they just do it because they want the nectar. All animals are the same. Lions can keep the populations of gazelles down, but they’re just thinking: ‘Ooh, bet I could eat that weak gazelle.’ I think in any aspect of life, you can do something for selfish reasons, but it ends up helping other people more than you would imagine.”That ide, between the extroverted house head and the introverted naturalist, replicates itself in the studio. Guy spends hours obsessing over production and instrumentation, but it’s Howard who tends to give the songs their pop sensibilities, writing the chord sequences and lyrics. “When we started making music, Guy would make these really credible underground 2-step beats, and I’d come in and accidentally make it a hook. I’d fuck up his experimental underground thing and make it a hit,” says Howard, only half joking.“You’d ruin it!” Guy retorts. “I’d be like: ‘Mate, I had this ready to be a Boiler Room smash!’”“I’d be like: ‘Sorry Guy, I accidentally got it playlisted on Radio 1.’”“It’s never a fight,” Guy assures me. “We saw the best results when we just fell into those roles.”That way of working can be heard on Energy, an album that has overhauled the Disclosure gameplan. Gone are the Balearic bangers. Instead, the duo have used a familiar palette of sounds and applied it in unusual ways rich textural production that encompasses deep house, R\u0026ampB and bedroom pop. Beats don’t just loop round but lurch off in unexpected directions.Also scrapped are the name collabs and Brit School singers – perhaps a response to muted reviews to their last album. They have brought in a series of vocalists and rappers, all of whom are themselves at the more boundary-pushing end of their respective fields: Slowthai, Kehlani, Cameroonian singer-songwriter Blick Bassy, the Internet’s Syd, Malian singer Fatoumata Diawara, rapper Mick Jenkins, and the odd legend such as Kelis or Common. It makes for a more varied record, where vocalists feel like genuine collaborators, and the songs are greater than the sum of their parts.A lot has changed in dance since Disclosure first emerged: questions around privilege and profiteering have come to the fore. There was little mention in the press back then that Jungle, an act founded by two white men who went to private school in west London, kept their identities secret, instead using mostly black faces in their music videos. But now Diplo regularly has to answer questions about culturally appropriating dancehall culture and the dance act Housekeeping chose to delete all their social media after it emerged one of its members was a millionaire private landlord who has been linked to the gentrification of Brixton market.So it is notable that on an album made by two white, home-counties men, every credited collaborator on the record is a person of colour. Singers perform in multiple languages and the n-word is littered throughout – their collaborators arguably lending Disclosure the credibility of their more erse backgrounds. When I begin to raise this, Guy launches into an answer that you get the sense he knew he was going to have to give.“What people need to know is when we’re choosing our features it’s never for ersity reasons. It’s always two questions: ‘Can you sing or rap?’ and ‘Are you a nice person?’” He says they’ve wanted to include rap, for example, in their music since the beginning, “but when you’re from Reigate in Surrey, there aren’t a lot of rappers. Once you get past album two, suddenly you can hit up rappers and they’ll actually respond to you. Artists like Kelis and Common will actually take our call.”Guy is probably aware that many of the producers that came out around the same time as Disclosure – Secondcity, Duke Dumont – have been accused of not properly crediting the vocalists on their record. In those cases the producers were white men and the vocalists black women. Guy is adamant Disclosure would never make the same mistake. “I think a lot of the cultural appropriation talk comes from people not getting a fair share … if you credit the person, give them a good cut on the publishing, everybody’s happy.Assuming big questions about cultural ownership can be solved with the right publishing splits is perhaps naive, but then with 10 years at the coalface of an increasingly commercialised industry, Disclosure remain refreshingly uncynical. “I get to do exactly what I want every single day,” says Guy. “It’s not the meaning of life but we’ve managed to find great meaning in life. It’s not like we’re oil tycoons either we’re putting something positive in the world. Just in the right place, at the right time, doing the right thing.”Energy is out from Friday"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5754cf84bb6ded9b8ed632c10919a6c07021af61/0_182_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3d75d874ec522ff453219714a6a504ac","title":"michel barnier brexit time wasting uk means post brexit deal unlikely says eu chief ","story":"Brussels’ chief negotiator says talks often go backwards as UK fails to grasp EU red linesMichel Barnier has accused the British government of “wasting valuable time” and warned that a post-Brexit deal between the EU and the UK looks “unlikely”.With two months to go until the EU-imposed deadline of October, the EU’s chief negotiator said: “Frankly I am disappointed and I am worried.” Barnier said he was “a little surprised” because Boris Johnson had told EU leaders earlier this summer he wanted an outline deal by July.After two days of talks with the British, Barnier said: “Too often this week it felt as if we were going backwards more than forwards.” At this stage an agreement seemed “unlikely”, he said. “I simply do not understand why we are wasting valuable time.”His opposite number, David Frost, struck a more hopeful note, while acknowledging there had been little progress.The UK’s chief negotiator said: “Agreement is still possible, and it is still our goal, but it is clear that it will not be easy to achieve … We have had useful discussions this week but there has been little progress.”Privately the UK rebuffed Barnier’s accusation of time wasting and blamed the EU for slowing down talks.“The process block now is the EU’s insistence that we must accept their position on state aid and fisheries before we can talk about anything else,” said a senior UK negotiating official. “I mean obviously we’re not going to do that. So it’s frozen.”The downbeat assessments came after two days of talks in Brussels and a private dinner between Barnier and Frost. On Thursday, Frost gave Barnier a fresh draft free-trade agreement in an attempt to break the deadlock. Known as a “consolidated legal text” the document merges existing EU and UK draft texts, in an attempt to speed up an autumn agreement.The British official said they had not expected the text to be discussed this week, but hoped “to inject a spark” in the process. “Really, it’s to make the point that we have been saying that it’s time to move to text-based discussions,” they added.Barnier said the document had been “useful” to understand the UK position, but added that it failed to understand the EU’s red lines on the “level-playing field”, common standards on environment, workers’ rights and state aid to give Britain tariff-free access to the EU single market.Sticking to the EU’s well-established position, Barnier rejected any attempt to fast-forward trade negotiations, ahead of other parts of the talks, such as fishing rights and British hauliers’ rights to deliver goods in the EU.Barnier’s insistence on “parallelism” has long frustrated the British. The EU’s approach “makes it unnecessarily difficult to make progress”, said Frost.Frost, who said last week a deal could be reached in September, added there were “significant areas” to resolve. “Even where there is a broad understanding between negotiators, there is a lot of detail to work through. Time is short for both sides.”The EU has said there will be no trade deal without an agreement on fishing, as it insists European boats maintain access to British waters. On the subject, Barnier said: “We have made no progress whatsoever on the issues that matter.”British negotiators share this view, but accuse the EU of failing to understand that the government wants a major change from the status quo. EU member states, which claim centuries-old fishing rights in British waters, want to maintain current access, although Barnier has hinted he is open to compromise.Similarly, the UK negotiators are frustrated by the EU’s wish to bind Britain tightly to European rules on state aid in exchange for a free-trade deal. The EU fears generous subsidies to UK companies could tilt the playing field against EU firms.“Things are focussing down, not necessarily helpfully, on the issues of state aid, subsidy policy and fisheries policy,” said the UK official. “What’s frustrating here is that Michel Barnier said in his press conference just now, ‘Brexit means Brexit’, which is of course correct. They don’t apply that in this area where they want to see us continuing arrangements that are very like those that we’re bound by as members of the EU,” they added.“When the EU realise that that needs to change it will be much easier to make progress.”The two sides also failed to make progress this week on long-standing disagreement over lorry drivers’ rights after Brexit. Barnier expressed surprise about the UK debate about the loss of haulage rights after Brexit, while stressing that any future access would depend on accepting EU standards on hauliers’ working time and other regulations. Citing recent press reports, he said: “We have seen an emotion that surprised me four years after the Brexit vote … the UK has decided itself to lose the benefits of the single market. It was their choice. It was not our choice.”The talks are scheduled to resume on 7 September in London."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fe8e62f4e7da27d243e09993b65f47120c948205/0_187_653_392/master/653.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=b3a658e91ca5f2b6c71a4a6f72775931","title":"covid climate change royal institution christmas lectures planet earth users guide pandemic","story":"Experts to explain how pandemic offers chance to pull planet back from the brinkCovid-19 has provided a crucial opportunity to make drastic changes to tackle climate change, experts behind this year’s Royal Institution Christmas lectures have said.The talks, Planet Earth: A User’s Guide, will take audiences on a deep e into our planet’s workings, from rock formation and Earth’s ancient climate, to the fundamental role of the oceans and the makeup of the air we breathe.Each of the three lectures will be presented by a different scientist from a trio of experts: the oceanographer Dr Helen Czerski, environmental scientist Dr Tara Shine and geologist Prof Chris Jackson.“What gets the three of us really excited is that we’re not going to tell you about all these parts in isolation, we’re trying to paint for you a picture of how our planetary system works and where we are as one species within that,” said Shine, speaking over Zoom from Ireland.Joining the conversation with a large image of a bioluminescent bigfin squid behind her, Czerski said she hoped her lecture would encourage viewers to see oceans were more than just the “blue bit” of the planet but the heart of its engine.“The reservoir of water the Earth has, that’s its battery of energy from the sun – it shifts, it carries heat, it holds heat, it moves it around, it moves chemistry around. If you didn’t have that the Earth would be uninhabitable,” she said.While the Blue Planet series by David Attenborough in 2018 has been credited as fuelling a drive to reduce plastic waste, Czerski hopes this year’s lectures will trigger a bigger shift in how we view the oceans. “People were upset by the plastic. And that’s fine. But it’s not the point,” she said.For Jackson, the lectures bring the opportunity to set out how the climate has changed over the planet’s 4.5bn-year history.Understanding the Earth’s systems, and our impact on them, raises crucial questions.“Are we going to say the Anthropocene was the time that humans destroyed the planet,” Shine said. “ Or are we going to say it was the time that humans nearly destroyed the planet and just pulled it back from the brink?”The team believe Covid-19 presents a new opportunity to take action on climate change, as countries make drastic changes to infrastructure, jobs and investment.“One of the excuses people give for not doing things about climate change is, ‘Oh, there’s this enormous system and it’s too hard or too expensive or too difficult to change it because that’s the way it is’,” Czerski said. “What’s happening now is that systems are having to change.”“Covid is a restart button,” Shine said. The pandemic provided an opportunity to build on developments such as the EU green deal, while opening conversations about risk and resilience.“To be resilient to the next pandemic we have to build some of the same core skills and capabilities that we need to be resilient to climate change,” she said, adding that such challenges were interconnected.A growing body of research has found destruction of ecosystems allows animals that carry potentially deadly diseases to proliferate, increasing the risk of another pandemic.But, Czerski stressed, Covid was far from welcome. “The scientists and the policymakers who are concerned about climate change are extremely sympathetic to the massive suffering a huge number of people have had through this pandemic,” she said.“The entire point is that this is what societal change looks like when something changes.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c377a7482e29588af92e4e2a56891d13925bd9ef/0_172_2060_1236/master/2060.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1b586b34dbbcb63fa0c68967088b78fa","title":"ruaridh mcconnochie i just want to get back into england contention rugby union","story":"The Bath winger insists he is fitter than he has ever been and is determined to rediscover the best of himself on the fieldThe rise of Ruaridh McConnochie has been among English rugby’s most heartwarming stories. From lower-league obscurity with Nuneaton to an Olympic silver medal in 2016, followed by a switch to 15s with Bath and thrilling late-bolter selection for Eddie Jones’s 2019 World Cup squad, he offers a ray of hope to every aspirational lower league player out there.For as McConnochie also makes clear, the ramifications go beyond a few inidual disappointments. Any dreams Team GB had of replicating their Rio achievements could be dynamited even before they start preparing for Tokyo. “It’s going to be a big ask for them. To go into a World Series not even knowing whether there is going to be an England side is backs-against-the-wall time. I think it would really be a huge waste of such a good bunch of people and I hope something comes of it before the new World Series season restarts. I’ve so much to be thankful for in the three years I was in sevens. It stood me in such good stead to come into 15s and perform.”It could also end up costing more in lost morale and profile than it saves financially in the short-term, particularly in the light of the benefits other nations are deriving from their sevens pathways with the Test game growing more quickly by the month. There was no more elusive back in the world last year than South Africa’s Cheslin Kolbe, also a 2016 Olympic medallist, while New Zealand’s Caleb Clarke is merely the latest All-Black-in-waiting to have cut his teeth in the abbreviated format.Which prompts an uncomfortable question: where would the long-striding McConnochie be now if the funding axe had fallen when he was an emerging sevens wannabe? Sliding doors and all that, but the 28-year-old is a prime example of the talent lurking beyond the confines of Premiership academies. As Bath head to Leicester this weekend, for example, it will stir memories for the former University of Gloucester student of the unglamorous twice-weekly trips he made to the Midlands to train and play for Nuneaton. “We used to play at clubs such as Scunthorpe … in winter they always had a bog in one corner of the pitch. You didn’t want to get trapped at the bottom of a ruck up there.”Welford Road in August will be luxurious by comparison and McConnochie’s horizons have also been broadened by his brief taste of international rugby last year. Having pulled out injured on the eve of his scheduled first start against Wales, his debut against Italy in Newcastle in the last warm-up game before the squad left for Japan was a big moment.“It was a weird few weeks. I false-started two weeks in a row so there was a massive sense of relief. I probably didn’t play my best against Italy – it was a game that didn’t really flow initially – but if anything it just makes you want it more. You want to have that experience again.”Hence the reason Bath’s director of rugby, Stuart Hooper, believes there is more to come from the winger, surrounded as he is by other spectacular back-three operators such as Anthony Watson, Semesa Rokoduguni and the still-injured Joe Cokanasiga. McConnochie feels the same, having spent lockdown trying to outdo his housemate Max Clark on the fitness front. “We made a home gym in the garage it was good to have someone to compete against each day, rather than just doing it on your own. My gym scores are as good as they’ve ever been.”The next objective is to rediscover the best of himself on the field. McConnochie is five kilos heavier than in his sevens days – “I don’t think I’d be able to carry my current weight for 14 minutes of sevens it may sound short but it was hell” – and his ability to break tackles was among the reasons he caught Jones’s eye. He has another chance to do so today, with the England head coach set to be in attendance. The latest from England is that they want to see him on the ball more often, an ambition shared by every Bath three-quarter.“We’ve had long conversations as a backline,” says McConnochie. “We’ve got some incredible outside-backs here and we want them to get their hands on the ball as much as possible. We want to have at least 10 touches per game – and that doesn’t just include catches and kicks that go nowhere. We’re excited and last weekend against London Irish was a good first marker. I feel we can still get much better.”The aforementioned 34-17 victory over Irish also showcased Bath’s improving scrummaging and a win in Leicester would mark the first time in the 107-year fixture that Bath have won three games in succession at Welford Road. Leave some vapour trails down the wing and McConnochie might yet force his way back into England contention this autumn. “I just want to get back to where I was when I was getting picked for England: being confident in my attack, beating people and using my best attributes to do that.”And if his phone remains silent? “If it doesn’t happen, it doesn’t happen, but as long as I’m happy with my own performances I can’t ask for more. The timing of lockdown was quite good for me. The last proper break I got from rugby was in 2017 so mentally it’s been quite refreshing. The big thing that’s changed is the personal pressure I put on myself: to maintain standards and keep up with everyone else. The likes of Anthony Watson have been training the house down … you want to try and challenge them as much as possible.”Bath’s frequent flyer has some ground to make up but confounding lengthy odds is his speciality."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/54051c45f32af165d480de2e179f309804265614/0_280_3918_2351/master/3918.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cc97f66004ba6dfda6331deeb74b885f","title":"zak crawley england cricket pakistan test match ageas bowl","story":"The 22-year-old England batsman delivered on his huge potential with a coming-of-age innings against PakistanZak Crawley pushes the ball through point for a single. The scoreboard operator at the Rose Bowl clicks another run on to his total. Up in the England dressing room, an analyst logs the run on his laptop, along with its associated metadata: a full-length ball, just outside off-stump, seaming away slightly, played off the front foot, with control. On Sky Sports, a graphics operator adds the run in real time, moving England’s score to 28 for one. Meanwhile on Cricinfo’s live database, Crawley’s innings score and live career average are updated accordingly.These days, cricket can increasingly feel like a game drowning in data. Watch a day’s play on television and you will be beaten into submission by an increasingly elaborate array of graphs and graphics, tables and lists, numbers of significance and numbers of pure irrelevance. Tune into Test Match Special and Andy Zaltzman is cheerily reeling off all the records and milestones that have been ticked off in the last 15 minutes.This is fine. This is normal. Cricket has always been the sort of sport where you can indulge in as much or as little of the number-crunching as you wish. In an often mystifying game, numbers offer the illusion of shape and plot. Some tell entire stories in their own right: 952-6, 501*, 99.94, 19-90.The problem comes when you start to imbue the numbers with a weight and a significance that they are unable to bear. This is particularly true of new or young players in international cricket, for whom the early part of their career can often feel like a mad scramble to identify some pattern in the data. Proposition one: Dom Sibley gets caught down the leg side a lot. Proposition two: Dom Sibley has still only played a handful of Test matches and it’s preposterous to draw those sorts of firm conclusions based on a mere sliver of available evidence. Only one of these really holds any water, and unfortunately for Sibley it’s not the one you can build articles and Third Man analysis segments around.The other main problem arises when you confuse the power to explain with the power to predict. When you confuse evidence with knowledge. When Crawley walked out to bat shortly before 11.30am with England 12 for one, there was nothing in our existing frame of statistical reference to suggest that when he returned to the pavilion that same evening, he would do so with 171 unbeaten runs to his name. His previous highest Test score was 76. He had a first-class batting average of 31, with three centuries in 73 innings. Based on the gloomy overheads, you might have pegged him to a low score. But you wouldn’t have known either way.Crawley is one of those batsmen who dictates situations. Partly this is a function of his height, which drags bowlers off their lengths, narrows their margin for error, minutely shifts the terms of engagement. He pulls and hooks attractively, drives with a big stride, leaves firmly and aggressively. His temperament appears sound for a player of his 22 years. Joe Root describes him as “the youngest 40-year-old he’s ever met”. None of the above is provable, by the way. You can’t justify it with numbers. Which is why, as of 11.24am on Friday morning, Crawley remained all conjecture, all potential, a vessel of hope and promise that needed a big number to give it some heft.Perhaps the most impressive part of his innings was the way he adapted himself to the challenge. He counterattacked against the swing of Shaheen Afridi. Against Mohammad Abbas, he advanced so far out of his crease he was in serious danger of obstructing the field. The early spin of Yasir Shah was driven, driven, driven, and then classically cut for four. Against the pace of Naseem Shah, he stood tall and played the ball at the top of its bounce. As Pakistan tried to tempt him into a false shot, he slowed his pace and left judiciously. As the field went back, he pushed and jabbed for singles. As Pakistan tired in the evening, he cashed in.Those who have seen plenty of Crawley in county cricket have long argued that his talent transcends his numbers. Canterbury is a tough place to open the batting. His breakthrough season in 2018 saw him master some torrid surfaces. Michael Vaughan and Marcus Trescothick both succeeded at Test level despite modest county records. All of this, some will argue, is evidence that Crawley has what it takes to be England’s No 3 for the long term.But in a way, none of this is any more definitive. Anyone pencilling Crawley in for the Gabba or making bold comparisons to Len Hutton or Jonathan Trott is, like everyone else, simply peering into the fog. Cricketing nous and empirical data aren’t a simple binary. Just as talent can’t purely be defined by numbers, you can’t extrapolate a Test career based on a gut feel. As he walked out, Zak Crawley was still an unknown quantity as a Test batsman. All we can really say for certain is that we know a little more about him now."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/243da1ae60ddeaa36265fb72983658a5d3b3ccc8/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=11784f93867de978e81ea4a583cd3742","title":"ms dhoni departs cricket with the sport now shaped to his image","story":"The rise of Dhoni-ism has been about Indian empowerment, Indian fearlessness, an unapologetic celebration of Indian might – a reflection of the shifting tides of cricket itselfAnd so it goes on. In the past week there has been a surge of Pharaonic tributes, ritual farewells, and apparently genuine shock at the retirement from international cricket of MS Dhoni.Dhoni is 39 and hasn’t played a game in more than a year. He has been a brilliant player, not to mention a luminous, transformative presence. It is a process that has now found further expression in the luxurious depth, volume and emotional reach of his retirement tributes, from former pros lining up to offer tearful social media posts, to gushingly phoney corporate high-fives, to pundits, journalists and fawning corporate interests.Naturally, retired Australian cricketers with an eye on a subcontinental second career have been in the vanguard of this Dhoni-dolatry. Shane Warne and Ricky Ponting got in there smartly.Best of all, and most nauseatingly soppy, was probably Adam Gilchrist, who stapled a cardboard Dhoni mask across his face, lit 1,000 Dhoni-shaped candles and sat weeping inside his private India Cements branded replica shrine, before typing with a single finger: “You did it with style, flamboyance and above all else, calmness. Your own way. The Dhoni way. Glly” and throwing himself out of a 17th-floor window.Does any of this seem a little odd? Or a little off-key? Reading the Dhoni farewells in isolation it would be tempting to conclude a combination of Pelé, Charlemagne and Spider-Man had departed the scene as opposed to, say, a world-leading wicketkeeper-batsman and fine all-round captain.The point being the tone here is not only overblown and ingratiating. It’s also inaccurate. In reality Dhoni has been a sharp rather than soft-edged presence. The rise of Dhoni-ism has been about the assertion of will, about Indian empowerment, Indian fearlessness, an unapologetic celebration of Indian might – in itself a reflection of the shifting tides of the sport itself.The landscape Dhoni entered was red ball, Ashes coloured, high elbowed, a slightly fraying colonial sport. He departs with the world shaped to his image, the most important figure in cricket’s commercial landscape.Others will now reap the benefits. Dhoni, World T20 victor, king of the IPL, mould-breaking performer, has lived this process, coloured it and given it a human face. So yes, those retirement cards are going to be gushing, awestruck and even a little fearful.This loss of scale is separate from Dhoni’s greatness as a sportsman. Forget the leadership, the multiformat all-rounder stuff, judged as a white-ball batsman his numbers are astonishing. Dhoni took risks, chased totals, played without fear and still averaged 50 in ODIs over a 15-year career.As with most famous athletes there were various career phases but even these seemed iconoclastic and punkish. This was key to early Dhoni. When Sachin Tendulkar, his predecessor as lord of all things India, batted you felt the presence of this cold clear square of light, the platonic ideal of high-functioning orthodoxy. By contrast Dhoni has been entirely himself. My favourite Dhoni incarnation is the long-haired breakout star.There was a wondrously brutal 148 against Pakistan in his first year with India, an innings that felt in itself like a rejection of what had gone before, a torching of the reedy-voiced handbook.In time Dhoni was more remote, more obviously consumed by leadership, a life spent in the captain’s suite, phone ringing off the hook. But his technique became more insistently unorthodox, a cricketer who seemed to create different angles and noises, a different set of textures.I was in Cuttack three years ago to see Dhoni score his last international century, an innings of sculpted violence marked by the deep thud of the Dhoni bat.Even his wicketkeeping style seemed pointedly his own. Most wicketkeepers are artisans, below-stairs figures tied to their scullery. Dhoni kept wicket as an act of command, stopping the ball with pads, knees, any available part of the Dhoni presence. Dhoni does not bend for the ball. The ball bends for Dhoni.With this in mind much is made of his small-town roots, the willingness to face down India’s structures and hierarchies. Dhoni’s refusal to bend the knee seems to have opened up the talent pool in that dressing room.After which he was ready to face down the rest of the world too and with a waspishness and a certainty of will that was abrasive, often irresistible. Asked about India’s batting failures on the 2014 tour of England and the pernicious influence of T20 cricket, Dhoni sat back, smiled and told the English media: “Don’t be jealous of the IPL.”There were snorts of admiring laughter but also a sense of destiny in the room. Sport will often produce these notable figures during times of cultural and economic revolution. It is fascinating as an Englishman to feel that recentring of a sporting culture, to spectate on an industry regeared around its largest, most vibrant market. And to feel how it might have been cheering from the outside during cricket’s Anglocentric centuries.Dhoni lived that change, informed it, shaped its details, became a kind of embodiment of new India, its WG Grace, its Babe Ruth. Pay tribute! Whether through an accident of history, or just sheer force of personality, we all live in a Dhoni-shaped world now."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9869d06b77bb8c5c87e5e9a75c4fb2ad1cc19f32/21_0_5368_3223/master/5368.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3481514b26043ac8482a25222b257867","title":"italians do it better an expert guide to hosting an amalfi inspired dinner party","story":"Giulia Rhodes speaks to some in-the-know Italians about how stunning seafood and verdant produce can add a touch of the Amalfi coast to your next dinner partyFrom authors and actors to designers and directors, the glamorous set has long flocked to Italy’s Amalfi coast. And it’s not hard to see why.A film-set perfect 25-mile ribbon of mountainous coastline, its colourful villages, fragrant lemon groves and deep blue sea form a Unesco world heritage site.And as with all Italian regions, the local food and drink is inextricably tied to the culture which means that even if you can’t actually strut your stuff in Positano, you can cook up a bit of Italian sunshine in your kitchen.Alessandro Savelli is CEO and founder of UK-based Pasta Evangelists, which makes premium fresh pasta and sauces for home cooking – with next day delivery across the UK – in addition to its coveted concession in Harrods, now back open for business following the easing of lockdown restrictions.He learned to make pasta with his grandmother. Step one, he says, is to understand the culture. “I am Italian. I love food. I love pasta. I love cooking. Meals in Italy are when the family comes together to talk and enjoy delicious food. It is the highlight of our day. Food is not just seen as a necessity.”He celebrates the regional roots of Italian cuisine, sharing culture and stories to support local speciality pasta dishes. The food of the southern Italian Amalfi coast is different to that of his native Genoa, in the north, but it is close to his heart.“We go every year. My wife is from Naples and we married in Capri. I love it. The people are friendly, funny and loud, and the cuisine has everything – from amazing fish and seafood, fruits and vegetables to wonderful pizza and pasta. I discovered dishes that only really exist in that area.”His personal favourite is spaghetti alla nerano, with fried courgette and provolone cheese. While scialatielli – somewhere between linguine and tagliatelle in shape – with Amalfi lemon, ‘nduja sausage and mascarpone, features on the Pasta Evangelists’ Amalfi week menu.“Pasta dishes are about simplicity, freshness and few ingredients. We can bring that to your home,” he says. Although he admits he can’t deliver the full experience. “In Italy, we do tend to take the sunshine for granted.”Carla Bollati, a retired doctor from Turin, was introduced to the area around Amalfi by her late partner Gennaro, a Neapolitan. “I have a deep sentimental attachment,” she says. “And the tastes are a lovely way to travel to happy memories.”She was struck by the area’s scenery from her first visit. “It is a crowded landscape that cannot be changed. But there is also such special light and colour, the perfume of lemons, so many wonderful flavours. All the senses are covered.”The people and cuisine of the south are, she says, another huge draw. “They cook with what the area has to offer. Try a mozzarella there and you will understand what it is supposed to be.”Culinary roots and rules are revered, she adds. “If I cooked Neapolitan pasta e fagioli – with beans – for Gennaro, it had to be with broken odds and ends of pasta. Shells just wouldn’t be right. We Italians are so tied to the history of our food and the habit of coming together to eat it.”Italian food expert and cook, Paola Maggiulli, who runs the Tiny Italian supper clubs and cookery courses, agrees. But she insists it is a very inclusive tradition. To create an authentic Italian dinner, she says, the starting point is confidence.“Anyone can make Italian food. It is about flavour, not technique. With a few quality ingredients you can make incredible dishes.”Having spent much of her childhood in her father’s south London Italian deli, she recommends taking time to shop for good ingredients and learn the stories behind them.“In normal times, what is special about Italian food is the connection and time with other people. That might be planning the menu with friends or helping your grandmother prepare Sunday lunch for the extended family. Community and family are everything. Sharing the experience of eating with people you care about just makes you feel better.”So what would Maggiulli serve for a feelgood dinner inspired by the Amalfi coast?“I would want those incredible lemons,” she says, suggesting simple spaghetti with lemon, parmesan, olive oil and basil as a first course.“Amalfi seafood is beautiful, too. So perhaps a main of braised octopus, mussels cooked in white wine, or a frittura mista platter of fried squid and prawns,” she says. A chocolate and almond cake – a torta caprese after the island of Capri – would end the meal nicely.When you host your party, build the convivial atmosphere by serving the food on large dishes in the middle of the table, for guests to help themselves, and make sure the conversation, as well as the drinks, are flowing.For the latter, Daniele Umoette, former bar manager and drinks brand ambassador from Carpi in the northern region of Emilia-Romagna, suggests a gin spritz aperitif to kickstart the evening.“Mix blood orange flavoured Malfy Gin Con Arancia with Fever Tree Sicilian Lemon Tonic and a splash of prosecco over lots of ice in a nice glass, and garnish with some fruit such as blackberries, pink grapefruit slice and some aromatic herbs such as sage,” he says.Admittedly, your after-dinner stroll will probably be a little less glamorous than the nightly passeggiata in Positano. Maybe next year.

This year, with staycations booming, boutique bell tents are all the rage, and whether you’re a Hyde Park regular, or head to the Isle of Wight every summer, you don’t have to miss out. Pitch your tent in the garden – or indoors if it’s raining – swing open the patio doors, pour yourself a Malfy Gin and tonic, and cue up your festival playlist. Designer wellies optional.UpcyclingNesting has taken on new meaning as we’re spending more time than ever at home, meaning that we are looking to make our personal spaces as cosy and reassuring as possible. With major home improvement projects put on hold, we’re looking at subtler ways to spruce up our living spaces, often going hand-in-hand with the crafts we’ve taken up to help while away our extended free time. Repurposing old units and reupholstering much-loved chairs are at the top of many DIY lists – and when it comes to themes and patterns, rainbows and bright, uplifting shades are the order of the day.Micro garden partiesWith our close friends and family having been out of bounds for so long, we’re getting to know the neighbours. WhatsApp groups for inidual streets and blocks of flats are springing up across the country as we look closer to home for friendship, support and entertainment.Scaled-down garden parties comprising small groups of neighbours dressing up and bringing over their own food and drinks – nibbled and sipped at a respectful distance – make for eclectic gatherings and unexpected new friendships being forged.Staying ‘in-in’Now we can no longer go “out-out” – and with loungewear fatigue firmly setting in – summer is about dressing up for virtual socialising. Many of us are seeing more of our friends than ever as we plan regular catch-ups via online video calling, from family quizzes to propping up a virtual bar with friends, while Royal Ascot 2020 saw thousands of us donning fascinators in front of the TV in aid of frontline charities. So as the weather warms up, it’s time to cast off your lockdown look and raise a glass of Malfy Gin in style.Locally sourced picnicsWith public transport still only used for essential travel and some of our favourite parks and gardens closed, we’re exploring the green spaces closer to home for a suitable patch of grass on which to spread our blankets.The best-dressed picnic baskets are filled with treats that support local producers, from honey collected by local beekeepers and veg from the farmer’s market, to unique small-batch cheeses and British charcuterie sliced on to artisanal sourdough. Explore your local high street to see what gems you can unearth.Home cooking with a little helpOnce we realised how much mess keeping a sourdough starter alive entails, the appeal of devoting ourselves to becoming expert home chefs faded fairly fast. With more food businesses pivoting to offer meal kits designed to be finished off at home for that personal touch, there’s no better time to start enjoying gourmet food delivered to your door (without worrying about it getting cold). For a taste of Italy, Pasta Evangelists offer artisan pasta and sauces via next-day delivery across the UK, which can be whipped up at home in minutes. With dishes inspired by culinary traditions found across Italy, from Venice to Sicily, you can be taken on a foodie journey with all the taste and minimum effort.Growing lupinsSince lockdown began, gardening has shot up in popularity, with garden centres opening some time before other non-essential businesses.

They’re called the US Postal Inspection Service and they had authority to arrest Bannon and they did so … Somehow, the deep state launched agents of the US Postal Service to arrest Mr Bannon.”The “deep state” is supposedly a conglomeration of bureaucrats and law enforcement agents which exists to thwart Trump’s agenda. Bannon enthusiastically propagated the theory when he was Trump’s campaign manager in the 2016 election and then a senior adviser in the White House.However, since leaving Trump’s employ he has repeatedly cast doubt on the theory.In Deep State: Trump, the FBI and the Rule of Law by James B Stewart, published last October, Bannon said the “deep state conspiracy theory is for nut cases”, because “America isn’t Turkey or Egypt”.There is a formidable government bureaucracy in the US, he told Stewart, but “there’s nothing ‘deep’ about it. It’s right in your face.”Bannon also described to the journalist Michael Wolff, for his book Siege: Trump Under Fire, advice he gave to a ghostwriter working on Trump’s Enemies: How the Deep State is Undermining the Presidency, a book by Trump aides Corey Lewandowski and David Bossie.As quoted by Wolff, Bannon said: “You do realise that none of this is true.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c5618df491b42efb4645a1ea49464a9e95eb33e6/0_264_5082_3050/master/5082.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a2dc844fc0a2321fd48b4d8180c1a197","title":"berlin rename mohrenstrasse moor street black philosopher anton wilhelm amo","story":"Campaigners welcome decision after years of protest against ‘Mohrenstraße’ nameBerlin authorities have announced they are to rename  Mohrenstraße (“Moor Street”) in the city’s Mitte district after the country’s first black philosopher, Anton Wilhelm Amo.The decision follows years of protest by postcolonial campaigners, including historians and ethnologists, who had criticised the street name as racist.Campaigners welcomed the decision on Friday, which comes in the wake of a worldwide reassessment of the entrenched legacies of historical racism and colonialism.“Berlin is making history,” said the association Berlin Postkolonial in a statement. “We welcome this decision as an internationally visible signal against racism in the public realm.”The announcement followed a meeting among councillors from Berlin’s Mitte district at which the Greens and Social Democrats voted in favour of the move. They overruled a motion by the leftwing faction proposing the establishment of a naming committee which would have consulted the public over an alternative name.Campaigners are now waiting to see if the city’s public transport authority, BVG, will still press ahead with its controversial decision last month to rename Mohrenstraße on the U2 metro line as Glinkastraße, after the Russian composer, Mikhail Glinka. That name is considered highly problematic because he and many of his works are perceived as antisemitic.Intensive political discussions about renaming the street have gone on for more than 15 years. It was viewed as offensive by many who argued that the name derived from black slaves in Germany in the late 17th century, while others saw it simply as an old-fashioned term not meant to be derogatory.But the recent Black Lives Matter demonstrations gave the row a new impetus. Some protesters renamed the street and metro station George Floyd Street with temporary placards, after the African American man killed during police arrest in May. Others added an “umlaut” or two dots over the “o”, turning it into “Carrots Street”.Opponents of the street name have long since referred to it simply as ‘M-Straße’.The initiative to rename the street Anton Wilhelm Amo came from the association Decolonize Berlin.Amo was brought to Berlin as a child slave from what is now Ghana in 1707 by the Dutch West India Company and had to serve as a so-called Kammer Mohr or “chamber moor” in the Prussian court. He later went on to study in Halle and Jena universities and became Germany’s first black philosopher. He is also believed to have been the first African-born student to attend a European university.Opposition to the renaming came from the far-right party Alternative für Deutschland (AfD). Its MP Martin Trefzer said those in favour of a name change were “sinning against the cultural identity of the city”. Oliver Frederici of the Christian Democrats (CDU) said “we disapprove of the obsession with renaming things”.Mnyaka Sururu Mboro, of Berlin Postkolonial, who has been hosting critical tours on the subject for more than two decades, said: “This is a great day: Berlin is banishing an offensive word from the city, and with Amo is honouring a campaigning scholar from Africa.”Protesters continue to call for the renaming of Onkel Toms Hütte, a metro station in the south-west of the city named after the 1852 novel by Harriet Beecher Stowe, Uncle Tom’s Cabin, objecting to the racist connotations.

When the figure is above 1, an outbreak can grow exponentially.The official figure has previously reached 0.8-1.0 for the UK as a whole, but it has never moved above 1, although previous modelling has suggested it may have edged above this threshold in some regions.“We have been seeing indications that these values may be increasing, with estimated ranges increasing slightly from previous publications,” the team behind the data said. They urged caution, however, noting: “Recent changes in transmission are not yet fully reflected in these estimates because the data used to calculate R and growth rate reflect the situation from a few weeks ago. It is also important to recognise that these are estimates, and there is a high degree of uncertainty with them.”Dr Michael Head, senior research fellow in global health at the University of Southampton, said: “We are seeing increases in new daily cases, and now we have an R number estimate that is approximately at the 1.0 threshold. The data suggests that as people mix more freely, there are probably increases in community transmission.“This is to be expected, but highlights the problems in coming out of lockdown, particularly when there are many thousands of active cases in a population,” he said, adding that difficulties in controlling the virus could be aggravated with the onset of winter because fewer people will be willing to meet outdoors.The north-west, London and the south-west could all have R values above 1.0, but the team said the estimates for the latter two regions were not robust because of factors such as low case numbers or a high degree of variability in transmission across the region.Dr Jasmina Panovska-Griffiths, an expert in mathematical modelling at University College London, cautioned that when infection levels fall, there is high variability in transmission across the country and disease is spread down to localised clusters, R becomes a less useful figure.Kevin McConway, emeritus professor of applied statistics at the Open University, said local outbreaks were the most important focus, and that the R figures and growth rate did not show a clear trend. “It could be that the epidemic is growing, but it probably isn’t, it’s probably declining, though not very fast,” he said.Weekly data from the Office for National Statistics suggested that the coronavirus infection rate in England was continuing to level off, with around one in 2,200 iniduals having the virus and about 2,400 new cases a day for the week of 7–13 August, down from around 3,800 new cases a day the week before.“There is not enough evidence to say at this point that there has been a fall in incidence in the most recent week, therefore we continue to report that the incidence rate for England has levelled off,” the team reported."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d402bd53605955a4190f202e7cb21517dc435ca/46_260_2993_1796/master/2993.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=83c03a9d7ba37e0d71c5f47eaa40508d","title":"uk cheap food could fuel covid 19 spread says who envoy","story":"Exclusive: Cramped work and home conditions may be behind infections in factories, says expertBritain’s demand for cheap food could be fuelling the spread of the coronavirus in factories, a leading health expert has warned, as analysis shows nearly 1,500 cases across the UK.Cramped conditions in some factories and in low-paid workers’ homes, spurred by the UK’s desire for cheaply produced food, may have driven infection rates in the sector, according to David Nabarro, a World Health Organization special envoy on Covid-19.In the early stages of the pandemic, the UK avoided the scale of Covid-19 outbreaks seen in meat factories and other food processing plants in countries such as the US. But a  analysis suggests that reported UK outbreaks of the disease are now increasing in frequency, with examples of cases spreading into the wider community.While there is no suggestion of breaking social distancing rules, factories by their nature involve large numbers of workers under one roof.Unions say most of those working in UK meat, poultry and other mass food production plants are foreign migrant workers who share accommodation and transport. Nabarro, speaking in his capacity as a professor at University College London’s Institute for Global Health, raised the issue of low pay, which may mean employees exposed to the virus feel pressured to keep working. A culture of cheap food was based on driving production costs down – but at a price, he said.“It may well be that in keeping production costs down, we end up with a situation where the people who work in food processing are under very, very tough working conditions and are paid relatively small amounts of money compared with other roles.“So one could argue that this is not so much structural issues in society as a consequence of the perpetual pressure to get quality of food up and prices down. And so a part of this may require thinking carefully about how much to pay for particular kinds of food.”Nabarro said working and living conditions for food factory staff could create a perfect storm for the spread of the coronavirus. “If people are living in very high-occupancy, cramped conditions and they’re sharing transport, that obviously is another way in which transmission is likely.“So, if you add it together, the conditions inside the plants seem to contribute to the spread. The conditions of living and travel seem to contribute to spread. And the way in which money is handled if you’ve got to isolate may also contribute to spread.“So, the hypothesis that I have developed is that, in these cold plants where work is very intense, there are quite a lot of factors that come together that make infection with the virus more likely.”His comments may be seen to echo criticism of fast fashion for driving a culture of cheap clothing.Figures compiled by the  suggest at least 1,454 cases linked to food factories across England, Scotland and Wales.Northern Ireland, whose authorities do not publish specific statistics on the number of workers in the region’s large food processing sector, made food plants secondary only to healthcare when it was considering priorities for its contact-tracing app.In June, Boris Johnson acknowledged the problem in food processing plants, telling the Commons that ministers were investigating, but neither the government nor health officials were able to produce data looking specifically at it."},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Activist says ongoing denial about scale of crisis contrasts with urgency of Covid fightEvaluation suggests using ecosystem thresholds to develop policies is not best approach\u0026lsquoExtensive Irish commitment to data centres\u0026rsquo could cause cost to consumer, study finds"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"The by-the-wind sailor\u0026rsquos sworn foe, the violet sea snail, floats upside-down alongside itMichael Viney: North Atlantic\u0026rsquos top predator now shares island with 13 other speciesMichael Viney: The wayside ashes of the west stand as defiantly healthy emblems of their kindInidual ants are certainly not smart, but their group wisdom may exceed our ownMichael Viney: Irish numbers have more than doubled since the counts of Operation Seafarer in 1970Michael Viney: A predator denning in parks, gardens and wasteland gets mixed responsesA beefed-up, independent National Parks and Wildlife Service would be just the ticketMichael Viney: Wild grasses have loved the mood swings of our climate this yearAnother Life: As one of many of the world\u0026rsquos declining seabirds, puffins are now receiving much more necessary and serious attentionAnother Life: A new book on the founders of the Tyler Prize shows their political influenceAvian science journal Ibis reports \u0026lsquogreat conservation concern\u0026rsquo about the speciesAnother Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillClaire Twomey’s coronavirus journey started mildly enough – and hasn’t stopped.“Initially, it was only a headache, and sinus pain last March, and I lost the sense of taste and smell. Then I spent four or five days in bed with a ferocious fever, a cough and migraines.”She attempted to go back to work, but her fever and cough worsened and she spent another four weeks in bed with a high temperature.Despite periods of apparent improvement, months later, she’s still coughing. “A trip up the stairs aggravates the cough. I go to the shops and I suffer a loss of breath.Ms Twomey is one of a large and increasing cohort of coronavirus patients who are experiencing longer-term effects of the disease. In Ireland and across the world, doctors are linking the virus to a bewildering variety of symptoms and, as time goes on, they are finding many of these are slow to resolve.Dublin GP Nuala O’Farrell describes the virus as “the imitator of all known diseases”.“Headache, dry cough and fever, we all know about. Diarrhoea, blistery lesions that look vaguely like shingles on the trunk, chilblains, chest pain, tachycardia, arrhythmias, pericarditis (swelling of heart tissue) and of course elderly people who are just ‘not themselves’, can all be symptoms of Covid.”Rollercoaster rideA number of her patients have been on a rollercoaster ride of symptoms since contracting the disease. “One woman went from doing spinning classes four times a week to, two weeks after testing positive, being hardly able to walk up the stairs. Her head was splitting, she had no sense of taste or smell and every bone in her body was aching. Eight weeks on, she is only beginning to recover.”Ms Twomey, too, has found that being fit provided little protection against the disease. “I did yoga, I ran. Now if I try to do anything, I have to take to the bed for four or five hours. I have aches in my arms and legs. I’ve gastro issues, and tingling sensations on my skin.”“When we say that the vast majority of people have a mild illness and recover that is true,” says Dr Mike Ryan, the World Health Organisation’s head of emergencies. “But what we cannot say at the moment is what are the potential long-term impacts of having had that infection.“We hope that everybody who recovers from Covid-19 will make a full and permanent recovery but there are enough people out there having difficulties with their exercise tolerance, having difficulties with their breathing and potentially having long-term impacts on their cardiovascular system.”International findings dovetail with the experiences of some Irish patients. One international study suggested 10 to 15 per cent of people, including some mild cases, do not enjoy a quick recovery. In Italy, 87 per cent of one group of patients who had been hospitalised were still struggling two months later.It remains too early in this novel pandemic to say how long patients’ symptoms will endure, and whether the virus will give rise to chronic disease.The ergence in patients’ symptoms is driven by the varying way the virus attacks the body, often leading to inflammation and blood clotting as well as respiratory ailments.Notable too is the number of patients who say they were previously fit and healthy but are now having lasting problems, as well as “up and down” nature of many patients’ recoveries.SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, is proving remarkably adept at disrupting many areas of activity in the body. It uses a spike protein to attach itself onto cells’ ACE2 receptors, found in the lungs, heart, gut, kidneys, blood vessels and nervous system. Often, the damage is done as much by the overweening inflammatory reaction of the body as to the original infection.“We still don’t know what we’re grappling with in terms of the long-term cardiac manifestations,” says consultant cardiologist Dr Crochan O’Sullivan. “The interaction between the virus and the ACE2 enzyme triggers its entry into cells in the body.”Stroke is a particular risk linked to coronavirus given the role of the virus in making patients more susceptible to blood clotting.Ms Twomey says what really exhausts her is having to deal with three or four issues at the same time. “The fatigue is like nothing I’ve ever experienced in my life. It’s like a crash.”Her yo-yo experience of the disease prompts her to remark that “my recovery is worse than the initial experience”.Along with her parents, who also tested positive for the virus, she attends the Mater post-coronavirus clinic in Dublin. “They’ve been great,” she says, “but there’s only so much they can do. They still don’t know the answers”.Dr Killian Hurley is a respiratory consultant at Beaumont Hospital, where he heads up a post-coronavirus clinic, and the RSCI. Over the last six months the clinic, which takes referrals only from patients who were hospitalised, has seen more than 100 patients.Severe fatigueThe clinic provides patients with access to specialists from a variety of disciplines including respiratory medicine, intensive care, infectious diseases, psychology and psychiatry.Dr Hurley says patients come with a wide variety of lasting symptoms, including continuous shortness of breath, cough, severe fatigue, anxiety and other mental health issues.Some of those who spent periods in intensive care are suffering a form of post-traumatic stress disorder, he says.Many have lung problems months after their disease experience. “They still have abnormalities on their chest X-rays there’s scarring there, particularly among those who were in intensive care.”For a small group, even walking a short distance after six months causes them difficulties. Generally Dr Hurley finds that the more severe their illness was, the more severe are their continuing after-effects.“This is a totally new disease. We don’t have 40 years of research into this. My sense is, though, that it will be a mild disease for many, with a good chance of eventual recovery.”However, many patients are “terrified”, he acknowledges, and “frightened about what the future might hold”.Stressing the need to identify problems early, he says the health service needs to be proactive in following through with patients in a standardised way.This is difficult when only 50 to 75 per cent of health service capacity is available due to coronavirus restrictions, and while the system is continuing to battle new infections.He says his “hope” is that the residual problems of most patients will resolve over the space of a year, as happened with other respiratory syndromes.Ms Twomey has set up an online support group for coronavirus survivors, which now has more than 400 members.The Facebook group is providing a forum for discussion, sharing of experiences and guidance.Suffering“People feel they don’t have answers to their questions. They’re frustrated because there isn’t one place for them to go to seek those answers,” she says.Many people suffering symptoms, including those who were never tested because their symptoms didn’t meet the criteria in place at the time, and those whose tests came back negative, are not eligible to attend the clinics and so have to plot inidual recovery journeys.But in mid-April she developed fatigue and nausea. One day she “couldn’t get out of bed”.Because she had only one of the symptoms required at the time to be sent for testing, she never got a diagnosis.She says her condition worsened, as she developed shortness of breath and heart palpitations, “brain fog” and loss of memory.“It came that I couldn’t remember the right word to use in a situation. Or I would be looking at words and not recognising them, or saying the wrong word,” she says.Eventually she got a test, but to her distress it came back negative.Still her condition did not improve. “I used to run or walk 15km a day, but now I couldn’t leave the house. I’d have a couple of good days, and think things were fabulous for a week. And then the next day, it would hit me like a train again.”Still suffering from a “rollercoaster of symptoms” after 16 weeks, she had to stop working and tending her garden. “I’ve had relapse after relapse. It’s the uncertainty and the not knowing that is so hard to take, not being able to live a normal life and the impact on your mental health.”She realises others have it worse but wonders how long her symptoms will persist.“I don’t think I can cope with another six months of this. People don’t understand how long term this can be, and the damage that can be done.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Estimated 25,000 Hindus living in Ireland, says director of Vedic Hindu Cultural CentreShannon Heritage had warned heritage sites would close in less than two weeksMartin says new Covid-19 law will target businesses \u0026lsquoendangering public health\u0026rsquo rather than house partiesAs patients report longer-term effects, it remains too early to say how long symptoms will lastPoliticians would be unwise to underestimate level of public anger about revelationsHandling of crisis has transformed view, from \u0026lsquopale, male and stale\u0026rsquoJohn Mullan (49), children Tom\u0026aacutes (14) and Amelia (6) die but mother Geraldine survivesInternal study for first time details force\u0026rsquos relationship with ethnic minoritiesSinn F\u0026eacutein leader says event, attended by more than 80 people, was \u0026lsquothe last straw\u0026rsquoCounty\u0026rsquos lockdown extended as cases are \u0026lsquostill high\u0026rsquo, but schools to reopen as plannedFears series of errors this week risks stability of Government as it faces into challenging periodCouple who were due to marry next week have had to postpone wedding againOrganisation says it believed event complied with guidelines under protocol agreed with Department of TourismGarda public order unit on standby as group and far-right supporters prepare to rallyCool, sunny and breezy temperatures forecast for the weekendRestrictions on Laois and Offaly lifted as financial aid package announced for KildareCalleary and Buttimer resign, garda\u0026iacute begin investigationLocal businesswoman says there should not be one rule for politicians \u0026lsquoand one rule for us\u0026rsquoEU commissioner says he did not come from Kildare to event with more than 80 peopleStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Plane carrying \u0026lsquopoisoned\u0026rsquo activist takes off as authorities accused of delaying evacuationDecision to transfer Kremlin critic ill with suspected poisoning after day of lobbyingProtests over last two months most serious threat yet to prime minister\u0026rsquos administrationLack of foreign visitors has facilitated increase in poaching and loss of revenueReport by US intelligence agencies sheds light on actions \u0026ndash and inactions \u0026ndash that created global crisisTens of thousands evacuated as record-breaking rains hit country\u0026rsquos southwestCountry entering dangerous new phase of rising infections in small towns and villagesUS president \u0026lsquopatently wrong\u0026rsquo when telling Minnesota crowd New Zealand situation \u0026lsquoterrible\u0026rsquoPolling put back by four weeks as 49 Covid-19 cases recorded in AucklandStudent-led demonstrations gain momentum testing laws protecting royal familyCovid-19 outbreak spreads to more than 30 people and extends beyond capitalJacinda Ardern sounds warning as number of cases in locked-down Auckland rises to 17Hundreds of police had raided Apple Daily in move decried as assault on press freedom\u0026lsquoGoing hard, going early with lockdown is still the best response,\u0026rsquo Jacinda Ardern saysReturn to nationwide restrictions announced by PM Jacinda Ardern in surprise press conferenceReaders queue from 2am to buy pro-democracy tabloid after owner Jimmy Lai\u0026rsquos arrestFair Work Commission\u0026rsquos decision that man made \u0026lsquooffensive\u0026rsquo video overturned on appealMaria Ressa\u0026rsquos news organisation Rappler is a buffer against dictatorship in PhilippinesLai has been a prominent democracy activist and an ardent critic of BeijingAuthorities warn against complacency as other countries battle a resurgenceStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4335611.1598033102!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"alexei navalny gets go ahead to be evacuated to germany","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAlexei Navalny: Fell ill on a flight on Thursday. Photograph:  Mladen AntonovAFP via Getty ImagesAlexei Navalny is set to be airlifted to Germany for specialist medical treatment as Russia’s most prominent critic of the Kremlin remains in a coma after a suspected poisoning.The decision to allow for his evacuation after repeated denials came at the end of a day of intense lobbying by his family and supporters. They argued that remaining in a Siberian hospital was a threat to his life and was being ordered by Russian authorities who did not want the substance that had caused his illness to be discovered.President Vladimir Putin’s best-known critic ending up in hospital after drinking a cup of tea at an airport has underscored the threats against opposition activists in Russia. It has sparked demands by global leaders for a full investigation, following contradictory statements from the doctors treating him.Anatoly Kalinichenko, deputy chief doctor at the hospital in Omsk in southern Siberia where Mr Navalny has been in intensive care since Thursday, told reporters that they had found no traces of toxic substances in his system, and that he was “demonstrating a positive trajectory” and was “quite stable”.“The diagnosis of poisoning will remain at the back of our minds. But we don’t believe the patient was poisoned,” Mr Kalinichenko said.But earlier on Friday, Ivan Zhdanov, head of Mr Navalny’s Anti-Corruption Foundation, said a police officer had told him Mr Navalny was poisoned with a substance “that poses a threat not only to him but to those around him” and that those treating the activist were required to wear protective equipment.Appeal to PutinApproval for Mr Navalny to fly to a Berlin hospital on a plane provided by private donors was granted late on Friday, after Mr Navalny’s wife Yulia made a public appeal to Mr Putin. The European Court of Human Rights said it was considering a special plea to permit the journey.Mr Navalny (44) had been in western Siberia meeting opposition candidates for local elections next month and filming video for one of his viral anti-corruption investigations on YouTube.He fell ill on a flight from Tomsk to Moscow on Thursday and collapsed in the plane’s bathroom, where he groaned in pain before passing out and falling into a coma. The plane made an emergency landing in Omsk.As doctors continued to reject appeals for him to be granted permission to take the flight to Germany on Friday, Mr Navalny’s family said they feared the delay could harm his health or be part of a cover-up to make it impossible to determine what substance caused him to lose consciousness.“We think they are doing it so that the chemical substance in Alexei’s body disappears and there isn’t a trace left - that’s why they won’t hand him over. He’s not in a good condition and we obviously can’t trust this hospital,” said Ms Navalnya.German doctors who arrived on the plane were allowed to see Mr Navalny and told Kira Yarmysh, Mr Navalny’s spokeswoman, that they believed he was in a stable condition and could safely handle the flight.‘Medical decision’Dmitry Peskov, Mr Putin’s spokesman, earlier on Friday denied that the Kremlin was aware of any impediment to transporting Mr Navalny, except that it was “exclusively a medical decision”.Police prevented Mr Navalny’s team from speaking to the German doctors when they visited the hospital, after which the Siberian doctors claimed they had mutually agreed Mr Navalny was not fit to travel.The apparent poisoning would be the sixth such attack on Russian opposition activists in the past five years. Police refused to investigate all of the incidents, while doctors were unable to determine what was allegedly used to poison the activists.The EU expects “a swift, independent and transparent investigation” and that if poisoning was confirmed, “those responsible must be held to account”, bloc spokeswoman Nabila Massrali said in a statement.Mr Navalny’s exposés of official corruption on YouTube have earned him a wide following and a string of powerful enemies among Russia’s officials and oligarchs.As the price of his activism, Mr Navalny has been jailed 13 times for protesting against Mr Putin, sentenced to a lengthy prison sentence that judges abruptly commuted the next day after it sparked a rally outside the Kremlin, and harassed around the clock by trolls allegedly working for St Petersburg businessman Evgeny Prigozhin.In 2014, his younger brother Oleg was jailed for three years in a case Mr Navalny described as “hostage-taking” in retaliation for his activism.BlindedLast year Mr Navalny claimed he was poisoned with an unknown substance that provoked a severe allergic reaction while serving one of his many short jail sentences for protesting against Mr Putin. In 2017, a pro-Kremlin activist attacked Mr Navalny with a chemical that left him partially blind in one eye.The EU and UK expressed concern over Mr Navalny’s health on Thursday, while French president Emmanuel Macron said France and Germany would offer “all necessary assistance to Navalny, in terms of healthcare, asylum and protection”.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4336751.1598075227!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"kremlin critic alexei navalny en route to germany for treatment","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMedics upload Alexei Navalny into a German special medical plane at an airport in Omsk, Russia. Photograph: Kira YarmyshAlexei Navalny’s press team via APGravely ill Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny, who was in a coma following a suspected poisoning, was en route to Germany early on Saturday to receive medical care after the opposition activist’s allies accused the Russian authorities of trying to stop his evacuation.Mr Navalny’s life was not in immediate danger, he was in an induced coma and his brain was in a stable condition, the medical staff at a hospital in the Siberian city of Omsk said on Friday.Mr Navalny was delivered to Omsk airport in an ambulance minutes after midnight GMT (1am Irish time) and his plane took off two hours later, a Reuters witness said. Kira Yarmysh, Navalny’s spokeswoman, said his wife Yulia was also on board.“The fight for Alexei’s life and health is just beginning and there is a long way to go, but at least the first step has been taken,” Ms Yarmysh wrote on Twitter.Mr Navalny, a long-time opponent of Russian president Vladimir Putin and a campaigner against corruption, collapsed on a plane on Thursday after drinking tea that his allies believe was laced with poison.German doctors flew in to evacuate Mr Navalny (44) at the request of his wife and allies who said they feared authorities might try to cover up clues as to how he fell ill and that the hospital treating him was badly equipped.Medical staff at the Omsk hospital initially said on Friday that while Mr Navalny’s condition had improved slightly overnight he was in too unstable a state to be safely transported out of the country.But late on Friday they said they would not object to him being moved after the German doctors were granted access to Mr Navalny and said they thought he was fit to travel.A senior doctor at the hospital, Anatoly Kalinichenko, said the hospital could help transport Mr Navalny to the airport and that he would be moved within several hours.“We have taken the decision that we do not object to him being transferred to a different hospital,” Mr Kalinichenko said.AppealMr Navalny’s wife Yulia earlier sent a letter to the Kremlin directly appealing for it to intervene and grant permission for him to be allowed to be flown out.“It’s a shame it took so long for the doctors to make this decision. The plane has been waiting since morning, the documents were also ready then,” Ms Yarmysh, Mr Navalny’s spokeswoman, said on Friday evening.Alexander Murakhovsky, the head doctor at the hospital, said earlier that Mr Navalny had been diagnosed with a metabolic disease that may have been caused by low blood sugar.He said traces of industrial chemical substances had been found on Mr Navalny’s clothes and fingers and that doctors did not believe he had been poisoned.Mr Navalny has been a thorn in the Kremlin’s side for more than a decade, exposing what he says is high-level graft and mobilising crowds of young protesters.He has been repeatedly detained for organising public meetings and rallies and sued over his investigations into corruption. He was barred from running in a presidential election in 2018.Mr Navalny fell ill while flying back to Moscow from the Siberian city of Tomsk where had met allies ahead of regional elections next month. He was taken on a stretcher, motionless, from the plane and rushed to hospital after it made an emergency landing in Omsk. – ReutersStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4336759.1598080644!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus who says world could rein in pandemic in less than two years","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA doctor checks the breathing of a patient in the intensive care unit dedicated to Covid-19 at the Ineram Hospital in Asuncion, Paraguay. Photograph: Jorge Saenz AP PhotoThe world should be able to rein in the coronavirus pandemic in less than two years, the World Health Organisation has said, as South Korea reported the most daily infections since early March and expanded social distancing measures across the country.The WHO’s chief, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, struck a partly optimistic note when he drew comparisons between the Covid-19 pandemic and the with the 1918 flu pandemic, saying technology could help end the spread.“We have a disadvantage of globalisation, closeness, connectedness, but an advantage of better technology, so we hope to finish this pandemic before less than two years,” he told reporters.By “utilising the available tools to the maximum and hoping that we can have additional tools like vaccines, I think we can finish it in a shorter time than the 1918 flu”, he said.The WHO also recommended that children over 12 use masks in the same situations as adults as the use of face coverings increases to stop the virus spread. In fresh guidelines developed in cooperation with Unicef it said children should wear “a mask under the same conditions as adults, in particular when they cannot guarantee at least a one-metre distance from others and there is widespread transmission in the area”.The advice came as South Korea reported 332 new cases on Saturday, including 315 local infections. The figure is the highest since March 8th, when it recorded 367 infections.Major citiesAll of the country’s 17 major cities and provinces reported cases for the first time since January, Yonhap news agency reported. It said stricter social distancing rules would be imposed outside the greater Seoul area, from Sunday. The government had previously raised social distancing rules in Seoul, Incheon and Gyeonggi province to level two in the three-tier system.Karaoke bars, clubs and computer cafes were ordered to close and Sunday church services have been banned.South Africa’s Covid-19 infections passed 600,000 on Friday, although the number of new cases has been declining since a peak in July. Despite imposing one of the world’s toughest lockdowns at the end of March, when the country had only a few hundred cases, South Africa saw a surge in coronavirus infections that has left it the hardest hit on the continent.The government eased lockdown restrictions this week to allow most of the economy to re-open. But president Cyril Ramaphosa cautioned that cases could surge if people failed to maintain vigilance.The health ministry said in a statement South Africa now had a total of 603,338 cases and 12,843 deaths - accounting for more than half of the continent’s cases and around 47 per cent of its deaths.BrazilBrazil reported 30,355 new cases of the coronavirus and 1,054 deaths, the health ministry said on Friday. Despite this, the WHO’s emergencies director Michael Ryan told a virtual press conference that there was a “clear downward trend in many parts of Brazil”.The country has recorded nearly 6,900 deaths and more than 290,000 cases in the last seven days, according to the UN health agency: “The acceleration of cases has stabilised but there’s still a very high number of cases and a large number of deaths,” Mr Ryan said.“Credit to the health workers and the communities in Brazil for taking the necessary actions to stabilise the situation,” he said.“We’re in that difficult period in Brazil where it looks like things could be getting better. The question is: is this a lull, can this be continued and can we see that downward trend?”Brazil has more than 3.5 million cases of Covid-19 since the pandemic began, while the official death toll is more than 113,00.In Europe Germany, France, Spain and Italy, all saw infection levels rise to rates not seen in months, sparking fears over a second wave on the continent.In Spain’s capital Madrid, officials recommended people in the most affected areas stay at home to help curb the spread as the country registered more than 8,000 new cases in 24 hours. The figure was a 1,000-case jump on the previous day.France reported 4,500 new cases on Friday, the second consecutive day of more than 4,000 new infections - numbers not seen since May - with metropolitan areas accounting for most of those infections.Germany reported 2,034 cases on Saturday, its highest daily cases since 25 April. In other coronavirus developments:Global cases of coronavirus stood at 22.8m, and deaths at 797,000.Mexico’s health ministry on Friday reported 5,928 new confirmed cases of coronavirus infection and 504 additional fatalities, bringing the total in the country to 549,734 cases and 59,610 deaths.Travellers from France to the United Kingdom will be required to self-certify that they are not suffering coronavirus symptoms or have been in contact with a confirmed case within 14 days preceding travel, the British government said on Friday. – Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4335647.1598002396!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"alexei navalny profile an irritant to powerful russians","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Alexei Navalny: Several times each year, he and his team would drop a blockbuster investigation. Photograph: Pavel GolovkinAPThe Russian opposition leader had irritated some of Russia’s most powerful men with his slick YouTube investigations into the industrial-scale corruption that he says has proliferated under Vladimir Putin. His subjects were livid. Viktor Zolotov, the head of Russia’s 300,000-strong national guard, threatened to pound Navalny into a “juicy steak” for what he calls libellous fabrications from one exposé. A company tied to Yevgeny Prigozhin, a Russian catering magnate nicknamed “Putin’s chef”, successfully sued his Anti-Corruption Foundation for $1.6 million over a report on tainted school lunches. And courts had blocked a video about Dmitry Medvedev, the country’s prime minister and former president, that helped spark street protests in Moscow in the summer of 2017.Navalny, a trained lawyer who began his investigations into Russian state energy companies in the late 2000s (his main outlet was a LiveJournal blog), has an operation that has grown into a guerrilla newsroom, an opposition research centre and a campaign strategy headquarters seeking to unseat the United Russia party by channelling votes to its most likely opponents.But he has remained a muckraking investigative journalist, employing corporate records, drone footage and social media content to show how Putin’s circle has siphoned off billions and package it in a way that appealed to millions of internet-savvy Russians.“Navalny’s main activity is his investigations into the primary feature of Putin’s regime: corruption,” said Lyubov Sobol, an ally and a lawyer at his Anti-Corruption Foundation. “He is the main opposition figure in Russia because of these investigations.”He has faced years of pressure for that. Navalny was also poisoned while behind bars in 2019 and was attacked in 2017 with a green dye that left him partially blind in one eye. He has spent months in jail for protests, and months more in courtrooms in a series of criminal cases.Those around him have suffered too. His brother spent 3½ years in a penal colony for embezzlement, a case that the pair had called politically motivated. A key investigator was detained and sent to the remote Arctic for his mandatory military service.And Sobol’s husband, Sergei Mokhov, an anthropologist, went into convulsions in 2016 after he was stabbed with a syringe in his upper thigh. Sobol has blamed an ally of Putin’s for the attack, and in an interview on Thursday, called poisoning the “hallmark of the Kremlin”.Siberia investigationNavalny was on a work trip before regional elections when he was allegedly poisoned, she noted, hinting that he was working on an investigation in Siberia. But she believed that an order for an attack on him would have to come from higher up in the Russian government.“It’s unlikely that some small, local official, or even a local governor, would step up to such a serious crime,” she said.The Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said it was necessary to wait for test results showing what caused Navalny’s condition. The state news agency Tass reported that police were not considering deliberate poisoning.Navalny occupied positions in the liberal Yabloko party in the early 2000s before gravitating toward nationalist politics by the end of the decade. In 2008, he bought stakes in five Russian energy companies to gain access to their financial releases. In 2010, he published a leaked report that suggested up to $4 billion was stolen from Transneft, a state-controlled company, during construction of a pipeline.He emerged as an opposition leader during the 2011 Bolotnaya protests, when more than 100,000 Russians came out to protest against vote-rigging in parliamentary elections on the heels of an announcement that Putin would seek a third term as president.He ran for mayor of Moscow in 2013, losing with 27 per cent of the vote, and went on to organise boycotts of the 2018 presidential elections and this year’s nationwide vote, which would allow Putin to remain in power until 2036.Organised crimeBut several times each year, he and his team would drop a blockbuster investigation, tying a former prosecutor general to organised crime, putting Putin’s spokesman Peskov on a luxury yacht he could not afford, or identifying the lavish, apparently taxpayer-funded gifts a government banker gave to his mistress, including a plaque on a Central Park bench that read: “Don’t forget we are of the same blood. I LOVE YOU.”“I think his general activity is very irritating: the investigations, the political activities, his desire to take part in elections,” said Petr Verzilov, the publisher of Mediazona, who faced a poisoning attack in 2018 that he described as “exactly like Navalny’s”. “The Kremlin realises if they jail him it will just raise his popularity and lead to mass protests … but you expect that a physical attack, a poisoning, that this could happen.”Somehow, he had skirted the grisly fates that had met others such as Boris Nemtsov, a close ally, who was gunned down in sight of the Kremlin in 2015. He has said he does not know how.“People are always asking me this,” he told the  in 2017. “I have no answer to that question. I suppose the most likely is that they didn’t manage to lock me up when they could have done easily, and then after a certain point it became more difficult.” – Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4335701.1598013937!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit uk time wasting makes deal unlikely says barnier","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBrexit negotiator Michel Barnier: “Frankly I am disappointed and I am worried.”  Photograph: Yves HermanPOOLAFP via Getty ImagesThe EU’s Brexit negotiator has warned that valuable time is being wasted in trade talks with the UK as he accused his British counterparts of failing to make progress on topics of key interest to Europe during the latest round of trade negotiations. Michel Barnier said he was disappointed, concerned and surprised by the lack of progress displayed in discussions that took place in Brussels this week, reiterating that at this stage an agreement between the two sides still looked unlikely and that there was a risk the two sides would fail to ratify a deal by the end of the year. “Too often this week it felt as if we were going backwards more than forwards,” Mr Barnier said at a press conference following the conclusion of the latest negotiations. “I simply do not understand why we are wasting valuable time.” The failure to advance the discussions that began on Tuesday evening leaves only a narrow window in which to agree the text of a trade agreement, translate it into multiple European languages and obtain ratification before the post-Brexit transition period ends on December 31st. While both the UK and EU insist they want a deal, EU officials decried a lack of momentum on the British side in the wake of Thursday’s session, with one describing it as “puzzling”. David Frost, the UK’s chief negotiator, acknowledged in a separate statement that there had been “little progress” during the week’s talks, but he also insisted that a deal remained possible even if it would not be easy to achieve.State aid and fisheriesThe EU wants the two sides to push towards a common understanding on the topics of state aid and fisheries, rather than leaving these highly sensitive topics until later in the talks, but British negotiators are seeking to advance to a legal text in other areas where the two sides are closer together.Lord Frost criticised the EU’s approach on Friday. “The EU is still insisting not only that we must accept continuity with EU state aid and fisheries policy, but also that this must be agreed before any further substantive work can be done in any other area of the negotiation, including on legal texts,” he said. “This makes it unnecessarily difficult to make progress.”Mr Barnier complained that he was not seeing any willingness on the UK side to take on board the EU’s priorities, adding that the need for a “level playing field” that ensures fair competition in areas including state aid would not go away and was a non-negotiable precondition to any trade deal.“No international agreement was ever reached without the parties agreeing to common rules,” he said. The notion of a zero-tariff, zero-quota agreement without level playing field provisions and a balanced deal on fisheries was a “non-starter” for the EU, and the absence of progress in these areas was blocking everything, he warned.British negotiating officials said the talks were stalling due to the problematic issues of fishing and state aid, over which they accused the EU of seeking to maintain the status quo.“What is frustrating is that Barnier wants to see us continuing arrangements very like those we had as members of the EU. The principle of ‘Brexit means Brexit’ is a good one and should be applied across the board,” the official said.“The process block now is that we must accept their position on state aid and fisheries before we can talk about anything else. We’re obviously not going to do that, so we’re frozen.”Key concernsMr Barnier confirmed that the UK had presented a draft legal text for the trade deal during the round of talks, but he added that this had not addressed the EU’s key concerns, serving instead as a reminder of the UK’s existing positions.Lord Frost added that the UK was seeking a relationship that ensures Britain regains “sovereign control of our own laws, borders, and waters” and is similar to other agreements struck by the EU elsewhere. “When the EU accepts this reality in all areas of the negotiation, it will be much easier to make progress.” A dinner between Mr Barnier and Lord Frost was held on Thursday evening after negotiations concluded, which officials suggested was tense following the lack of progress. “It was a very nice dinner, we had courteous and friendly discussions but we didn’t hide the difficulties between us,” one inidual said. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: Olivier DoulieryAFP via Getty ImagesIt was late afternoon on February 2nd, the eve of the Iowa caucuses. We were jammed into a high-school gymnasium in Des Moines, the state capital, for Joe Biden’s closing rally.No one thought he would win the primary season’s talismanic opening contest the following day. Nor was he expected to come close to beating Bernie Sanders, the socialist Vermonter, in New Hampshire the next week. Though he was still ahead in the national polls, the 77-year-old former vice-president was treated as yesterday’s news.A crowd of several hundred was waiting unexpectantly. Biden entered roughly half an hour late, accompanied by a phalanx of retired politicians: John Kerry (76), the former secretary of state Chris Dodd (75), the retired senator from Connecticut Tom Vilsack (69), former governor of Iowa and Harold Schaitberger (73), president of the International Association of Firefighters.The oxygen seemed to drain from the room. As Biden’s surrogates spoke one after the other, the air got progressively thinner. By the time the candidate got up to speak, it was positively embalmed. “This is like a wake,” joked one veteran television anchor. Biden’s low-key soliloquy did little to lift the energy.Such are the limits of conventional wisdom. Twenty-seven days later, Biden grabbed the Democratic mantle after sweeping the South Carolina primary. With the notable exception of Sanders, who fought on for another five weeks, most of the rest of the field dropped out and endorsed him. It was a breathtaking twist.With hindsight, Biden officials say they always knew he would be the Democratic nominee. They were playing the long game. “We made a decision from the start not to listen to the loudest voices on Twitter,” says Stef Feldman, Biden’s policy director. That was not how many sounded at the time. When I asked a Biden staffer in Des Moines about the campaign’s mood, he used the TV anchor’s same funereal analogy.Who could blame them? Biden’s long history of running for the White House offered no cause for hope. Over a  of more than 32 years, he had not won a single primary. In 1987, he crashed out months before the voting began, having been accused of plagiarising a speech by Neil Kinnock, leader of the British Labour party.In 2008, he quit after having won just 0.9 per cent of the Iowa caucus vote. “At that point, most people thought his presidential career was over,” says Shailagh Murray, then a journalist with the Washington Post, who went on to become Biden’s deputy chief of staff. He had at least another 12 years to go. Nobody that night imagined that Barack Obama, winner of the Iowa caucus, would go on to pick Biden as his ­running mate.Ceremonial presidentThe vicissitudes of Biden’s 50 years in politics ought to make anyone sceptical of forecasts for this November. In the absence of time machines, we can only go by the numbers. Both the betting markets (about two to one in Biden’s favour) and the polls (an average eight-percentage-point lead over Donald Trump) suggest Biden will be America’s 46th president.What manner of president would he make? Half of Washington claims to know the man well. At a year above the median US male’s life expectancy, many expect him to be a ceremonial president. Even Biden’s close friends admit his energy and power of recall are not what they were.His would be a restorationist presidency – an erasure of what he is fond of describing as the Trumpian “aberration”. Others, notably Trump, depict him as a geriatric prisoner of the Democratic Party’s left. Most agree that whatever his agenda, and whatever the time of day, he would probably still talk too much.The word “logorrhea” (a tendency to extreme loquacity) has recently come into fashion. Biden’s campaign is keen to emphasise he would not, like Trump, be the “Twitterer-in-chief”.Those who know him the best – many of whom spoke to me for this profile – are in little doubt about the character he would bring to the presidency. Their Biden may stray too readily into schmaltz. But his empathy for people is real. In this pandemic-blighted election year, that quality could count for a lot.“Biden is the same guy I first met in 1969 – he was full of piss and vinegar,” says Louis Susman, a Chicago-based investor and former ambassador to the UK. “He doesn’t suffer from inner demons, he doesn’t bear grudges and he loves being around people.”Should he make it to the White House, Biden would have completed the longest marathon in US political history. No other serious figure has tried this long to make it over the finishing line in recent history.A majority of Americans were not born when Biden first entered national politics. At 30, he was the fifth youngest senator in the country’s history after he won office in 1972. Biden’s 48-year political career is older than John F Kennedy, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama when they were elected.Yet he sounds remarkably similar today to the ambitious, blue-collar Irish-American that he was then. Staffers tried and failed to get him to avoid using words such as “record player” during the 2020 primaries. Calling someone a “horse’s ass” is no longer thought to be cutting. In an interview with Kitty Kelley in 1974, Biden worried about being seen as a “gay young bachelor” around Washington – by which he meant “happy”, not “LGBTQ”.So popular are Biden’s anachronisms that there is even a “Biden insult bot” – a Twitter algorithm – to which fans can turn. “You got something stuck in your craw, you milk-swillin’ circus peanut,” reads one tweet. “Shut your piehole, you hood-winked britch soiler,” reads another.‘Amtrak Joe’Most American voters already know of the ­tragedy that struck Biden in his early career. A few weeks after he was elected to the Senate, he lost his wife Neilia and one-year-old daughter, Naomi, in a car crash while they were Christmas shopping in Delaware, his home state.His sons, Beau, aged three, and Hunter, aged two, survived but were hospitalised with severe injuries. Most people would have disintegrated. Biden considered not taking his Senate seat. In the end, he was persuaded to be sworn in at the hospital beside one of his sons. He said he could only continue in politics if he saw his kids every morning and night.Thus was born “Amtrak Joe” – the senator who took the 90-minute journey each evening from Washington to Wilmington to say goodnight to his sons. He commuted until 2008, long after the boys had grown up. Subtracting a tenth of nights for other travel, and nearly half the year for recess and weekends, I calculate that Biden spent at least 21,000 hours – or three years of his life – on that train.“He knew the names of every conductor and they all loved him,” says Paul Laudicina, Biden’s legislative director between 1977 and 1982. “Often, he would still be talking when he boarded, and I would go to Wilmington with him and then cross the platform and come straight back.”In the 1974 Kelley interview, the famously acerbic journalist said Biden “reeks of decency”. He nevertheless managed to sound almost Trumpian about his deceased wife. “Let me show you my favourite picture of her,” he says, holding up a snapshot of Neilia in a bikini. “She had the best body of any woman I ever saw. She looks better than a Playboy bunny, doesn’t she?” Kelley described his office as a shrine to Neilia.Biden recently conceded that he has been too invasive of women’s personal space – “handsiness” has also entered the DC lexicon. Unlike some of his contemporaries, however, he has not been dogged by rumours of infidelity. A former Senate staffer, Tara Reade, accused him earlier this year of sexually assaulting her in a corridor in 1993. Biden denies it and her story has been criticised as inconsistent.In 1977 Biden married Jill Tracy Jacobs, a teacher based in Wilmington. On their first date he dressed in a jacket. When he dropped her back home he shook her hand. According to What it Takes, the ­celebrated 1988 campaign book by the late ­Richard Ben Cramer, Jill said she could not believe such men still existed. “Jill is Biden’s least appreciated strength,” says Susman, who often hosted the Bidens for Thanksgiving in his Nantucket home.Much of Biden’s sense of gravity comes from her. Even when her husband was vice-president, Jill Biden continued to teach every day at a community college in Northern Virginia. When he left office in 2017, the Bidens’ net worth was less than $500,000. They still hadn’t paid off the mortgage on their Wilmington home.Irish-Catholic and handsomeUntil he was rescued from near-certain genteel decline by Obama, Biden was defined by his disastrous 1988 presidential bid. Most of the people who helped him on that jinxed quest, including Ted Kaufman, his long-running chief of staff, Michael Donilon, his chief strategist today, and Donilon’s brother Tom, Biden’s foreign-policy adviser, are still around him.They are mostly Irish-American and very tight-knit. Cathy Russell, Tom Donilon’s wife, was Jill Biden’s chief of staff when she was “second lady”. Her husband is tipped as a possible secretary of state. Kaufman is running Biden’s presidential transition – that long and rickety bridge between victory and inauguration.In the 1988 campaign, Biden tried to present himself as the new John F Kennedy – young, Irish-Catholic and handsome. It never quite took hold. Then he saw a video of Kinnock’s soaring oratory – “Why am I the first Kinnock in a thousand generations to be able to get to university?” That was the middle-class poetry Biden had been lacking – the story of how the sons and daughters of coal miners had been lifted up by the welfare state, Britain’s version of the New Deal.“He grabbed that tape and took it home he inhaled the thing,” wrote Cramer. “It was like when Barbra Streisand came on the radio – Kinnock was singing Joe’s song.” For the most part, Biden credited Kinnock’s words. But the rival Michael Dukakis campaign found one tape where Biden had not. They leaked it.Suddenly, Biden was inundated with calls asking whether his grandfather had been a coal miner (none of his forebears had been). “It looked like Joe didn’t just steal the words, it looked like he ripped off Kinnock’s life,” Cramer wrote. A few months after dropping out, Biden had a near-fatal ­aneurysm. Then another. He was given a 50-50 chance of ­surviving the first nine-hour operation.“Joe wouldn’t be alive today if he had still been running for president,” says Kaufman. “He wouldn’t have had the time to get his headaches checked out.” Or, as Biden said when he emerged from the anaesthetic: “Now I know why the campaign ended like it did.” For what it’s worth, Kinnock’s Labour Party lost the election too.Emotional antennaeBiden’s 2008 loss left less of a mark on him, partly because he became vice-president less than a year later. “How could you begrudge losing to Barack Obama?” says Murray. “Obama was like The Beatles.”The campaign Biden still regrets was the one that he didn’t fight in 2016. His reluctance stemmed from another tragedy, the death in 2015 of his son Beau from brain cancer. But he had little encouragement from Obama, who had already committed to backing Hillary Clinton. Biden’s internal polls show that he would have beaten Trump. But he had little chance of wresting the crown from Clinton, whose machine he could not hope to match.In his memoir Promise Me, Dad, named after Beau’s request that his father stay in politics, Biden recounts his anger following a Politico story that he was exploiting his son’s death for electoral purposes. “It exceeded even my worst expectations of what the opposition was going to be like,” he wrote. In truth, he could not discuss running without breaking down. “He would literally start to cry every time we raised the subject,” says a Biden ­confidante.In another cycle, Biden’s lachrymosity might have been an albatross. During coronavirus, his emotional antennae look like a virtue. More than 165,000 Americans have now died in the pandemic. That toll is likely to be approaching a quarter of a million by early November.Trump’s inability to express condolences for America’s grieving families could not be further apart from Biden’s. In 2016, anger was the dominant political emotion. In 2020, it feels more like sadness. “If Trump were matter, then Biden is anti-matter – their characters are opposites,” says Laurence Tribe, a Harvard law professor who has been advising Biden on constitutional matters since the mid-1980s.When Biden was vice-president, Norm Ornstein, a veteran Congressional watcher, lost his son in a tragic accident. “The moment he heard, Biden telephoned and spent an hour on the phone with me and my wife, talking us through it,” says ­Ornstein. “The next day I received a handwritten letter of condolence from him. There is nothing fake about his sympathy. He feels it deeply.”Andrew Yang, the maverick hit of the Democratic primaries, says: “When most people hadn’t figured out who I was, Joe took me aside and was very gracious and friendly. This was just as true when things were going badly for him – he’s always steady and good-natured, in public and in private.”‘Shoot. Me. Now’Some in Biden’s world admit they have one or two concerns about the election and beyond. Chief of these is his tendency to make gaffes. In that sense, the lockdown has a silver lining: there is no campaign trail to avoid. Zoom is easier to manage.When Obama was elected to the US Senate in 2004, Biden invited him to join the foreign relations committee, of which he was chairman. Having listened to a trademark Biden disquisition, Obama scribbled a note and handed it to a staffer. It read: “Shoot. Me. Now.”When the two men were discussing how they would handle their White House relationship, Obama said: “I want your advice Joe, I just want it in 10-minute, not 60-minute, increments.” For the most part, Biden complied.Sometimes, he could not help himself. The term “Bidenism” – self-inflicted public humiliation – has long been in currency. “Stand up Chuck, let ’em see ya,” Biden once said to a Missouri state senator in a wheelchair. “Folks, I can tell you, I’ve known eight presidents, three of them intimately,” he said in praise of Obama, adding: “I promise you, the president has a big stick, I promise you,” in a mangled rendition of Theodore Roosevelt’s dictum about speaking softly and carrying a big stick.Fear of such miscues saw the Obama camp “quarantine” Biden for most of the 2012 re-election campaign. This year’s actual quarantine could thus be helpful.Many in Biden world are betting that his choice of Kamala Harris as running mate will immunise him against a record of racial gaffes. Earlier this year, Biden apologised after saying that “you ain’t black” if you would consider voting against him. As a mixed-race American of Indian and Jamaican heritage, the Harris pick will buy Biden more protection.Given Biden’s age, she is far likelier than most running mates to become president. As Biden discovered in the primaries, she also knows how to throw a punch.It is hard to find anyone in Biden’s circle who is losing sleep over three debates with Trump later this year. As Biden showed in 2008 with Sarah Palin and in 2012 with Paul Ryan – the Republican running mates of John McCain and Mitt Romney – he is a surprisingly taut debater.Trump, meanwhile, seems to be afflicted with his own severe dose of logorrhea. His recent boast in a Fox News interview that he recalled five words in order in a cognitive test was greeted with mockery. “I have two words for you,” says a senior adviser, when I ask about Biden’s age and prolixity: “Donald Trump. ”Biden’s peopleNor is the campaign worried about Twitter. When I asked two Biden officials whether he composed his own tweets, or would know how to send one, I got an unexpectedly constipated response: “No one has ever asked us that.” It turns out that Biden does not physically send his own tweets but is involved with their substance.Their second concern is ageing. At 74, Trump is only a smidgen younger than Biden. The difference with Trump is the people with whom Biden would surround himself. Chief among these is Ron Klain, a long-standing Biden aide who is likely to be White House chief of staff. Tony Blinken would probably be his national security adviser.Other top-job contenders would include Tom Donilon and Susan Rice (successive national security advisers to Obama), Kurt Campbell (who ran Asia policy for Obama), Jake Sullivan (who leads Biden’s campaign policy), Nick Burns, a former under secretary of state, and Bill Burns (no relation), a former deputy secretary of state. Michèle Flournoy, a former under secretary of defence, is tipped as a likely Pentagon chief.One adviser predicted that Biden would choose Romney, the Republican senator from Utah, as his secretary of state. That would annoy Vladimir Putin’s Russia, whom Romney described as America’s “number one geopolitical foe”. It would also upset most Democrats for very different reasons.Either way, the contrast between Biden’s friends and the parade of often bizarre cameos that have staffed the Trump administration is glaring. The current president is now on his fourth chief of staff and sixth national security adviser. By contrast, most of Biden’s coterie have known him for decades.“What leaps out about Biden’s people is their competence,” says John Podesta, a senior official in both the Clinton and Obama White Houses. “Neither he nor his team need training wheels.”There are also lingering worries about Hunter Biden, who has long been a source of concern for his father. “Joe has a total blind spot about Hunter,” says a close family friend.Hunter was discharged from the US Navy because he tested positive for cocaine. He launched various business ventures while his father was vice-president. He was accused of monetising the Biden name and subsequently got a seat on the board of a Ukrainian gas company.Trump’s attempts to extort Ukraine to supply Biden opposition research resulted in his impeachment last year (though he was acquitted by the Senate). “The campaign just has to keep Hunter out of the picture,” says the friend.Radical platformWhat would Biden actually do in office? Tackling the pandemic would be the first, second and third priority of any incoming president. Little can happen while the US economy is under semi-­permanent lockdown.Beyond that his economic platform is radical by the standards of any recent Democratic president, including Obama. “We would have the largest mobilisation of investments since world war two,” says Feldman. “We would start by putting pandemic logistics and supply on a war footing.”Some people compare the gargantuan challenges of today to 1932, when Franklin D Roosevelt won the election in the middle of the Great Depression. In spite of running a fairly bland campaign, FDR then embarked on a streak of “bold, persistent experimentation” that would remake America.But the differences are more interesting. For all its ravages, coronavirus is not as intractable as the Great Depression. By next January, the world should be closer to having a vaccine. Biden would also be fulfilling the first rule of any job – always follow an under-performer.He could achieve a lot in his first 100 days simply by covering the basics, such as launching a national coronavirus plan, shunning Twitter and not insulting foreign leaders. “If you have an American president at foreign summits eating with his mouth closed and not throwing cutlery around, the world will give him a standing ovation,” says one adviser and friend.Low-hanging foreign-policy fruit that Biden would pluck in his opening days include rejoining the World Health Organisation, the Paris agreement on climate change and the Iran nuclear deal, says Jake Sullivan. He would also convene a global summit to tackle Covid-19.Domestic steps would include stopping work on the US-Mexico border wall (such as it is), setting up a daily coronavirus briefing led by Dr Anthony Fauci or Ron Klain (who led Obama’s Ebola team) and picking an attorney general who would embrace planks of Black Lives Matter’s criminal-justice reform agenda.In his dealings both with Republicans and foreign leaders, Biden would place great stock in personal chemistry. Enjoying the company of people is one area where Biden is as different to Obama as he is to Trump. “The thing that Biden most likes is what Obama liked the least – the ­personal stuff,” says Podesta. Nick Burns says Biden revels in the “constant gardening” of diplomacy – talking frequently to his counterparts.Wishful thinkingSceptics point out that today’s Republican Party is unrecognisable to the one with which Biden grew up. Should he emerge intact from transition with a paranoid Trump, the chances of the defeated party working with him will be slim. Woke nativism will prove a more durable pathogen than Covid-19.Moreover, Biden’s global honeymoon would be unlikely to last long. Most people view his musings about restoring the status quo ante – going back to the world before Trump – as wishful thinking, not that geopolitical trends were particularly stable during the Obama years.China looms far larger today than it did in 2016. Biden’s favourite European, Angela Merkel, Germany’s chancellor, is due to retire by next year. And Biden will neither be inclined – nor likely in a position – to offer Britain’s Boris Johnson the US-UK trade deal he craves.Tony Blinken, Biden’s senior foreign policy adviser, says Biden’s scepticism about Obama’s ineffectual Afghanistan surge looks better and better in hindsight. “I respect Gates tremendously but he just wanted approval for his Afghanistan plan and Biden disagreed,” he says. Biden was in favour of US intervention in Bosnia in 1995, he adds, to convey that Biden is not some ­inveterate peacenik.But Biden’s biggest migraine would probably be at home. In the coming weeks, Trump is likely to make a lot of Biden’s “socialist” agenda – the hundreds of billions he has pledged to spend on everything from college education to rural broadband.Should Biden follow Obama’s example and pick Wall Street-friendly economic advisers, the left’s distrust would soon resurface. Last week, Lawrence Summers, Obama’s chief economic adviser and Bill Clinton’s Treasury secretary, ruled out joining a Biden administration. “My time in government is behind me,” he told the Aspen Security Forum.Happy passengerTo many people’s surprise, the left has largely fallen into line. Bernie Sanders dropped nearly all his most-cherished demands to agree a joint platform with Biden. This is in stark contrast to Sanders’s stand-offish – and simmeringly uneasy – ceasefire with Hillary Clinton in 2016.An estimated one-fifth of Sanders’s supporters in 2016 either sat on their hands or voted for Trump. Biden has not adopted a universal basic income, Medicare for all or a wealth tax – Sanders’s top three priorities.Yet the Vermont senator seems to be a happy passenger on Amtrak Joe’s train. Their policies may differ but their values are not miles apart. “Biden believes that his ultimate calling is to make life better for the middle class,” says Jared Bernstein, an economic adviser. “His watchword is ‘dignity.’” Ted Kaufman adds: “Biden and Bernie may disagree ideologically but they respect each other’s integrity.”Might such charms work on Republicans? I spoke to many people in Biden’s world and none thought the Republican leopard was likely to change its spots. One said: “Joe is still a romantic about the Senate. He will have to learn the hard way.”The omens for old-fashioned Biden-style bipartisanship are not cheerful. Yet there is an improbability to Biden’s odyssey that should give anyone pause. The lyrics may be corny. The music is not. It is an odd mix of Shakespearean tragedy and Shakespearean comedy.I have heard people describe Biden as the embodiment of America’s can-do spirit. Shailagh Murray called him a “spiritual optimist”. A campaign official talked of his “strategic empathy”. I have also heard people call Biden a “clown”, including a former Obama official.Biden loves to talk of when “the man meets the moment”. The joke is that he has said this about himself every time he has run for office. There has never been a moment where Biden does not think he should be residing in the White House.But like a stopped clock, perhaps this time he is right. “Life is about choices, right?” says a former senior CIA official who has interacted with Biden over more than three decades. “Biden or Trump?” He admitted that he occasionally saw Biden as a “mediocre” politician. But he added that Biden always struck him as fundamentally decent, which sounds like a subversive quality in today’s Washington.“Even if you thought that Biden was mediocre,” he continued, “you would take mediocre over catastrophic every time.”– Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020Full coverage of the US presidential election 2020Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"can learn boriss sojourn scotland","story":"They sought him here they sought him there. Was Boris in Tuscany? The Caribbean?Neither, it turned out. The Prime Minister, his girlfriend Carrie Symonds, baby Wilfred and dog Dilyn were enjoying a humble holiday in Applecross, on the western Scottish coast, overlooking the Isle of Skye, in a three-bedroom cottage with a little bell tent in the nextdoor field.The field, it turns out in classic, chaotic, Carry On Boris style, belonged to an irate farmer - who wasn’t happy with Boris pitching his tent and lighting a fire on his land. Now their cover has been blown, Johnson and his family have fled back home three days early.The characteristically unkempt Boris was photographed grimacing outside the hillside cottage, sporting a black beanie hat and a seersucker shirt. The hat is a useful touch on the Scottish coast, whatever the weather. This year is a record year for midges, the wee beasties that eat you alive on northern waters.The cottage costs £1500 a week in peak summer season. That isn’t surprising in Covid-hit Britain, where foreign destinations are subject to sudden quarantine imposition, and seaside cottages are gold dust – with tales of gazumping and prices doubling overnight.Still, however much domestic cottage prices have soared, this Scottish cottage is some departure from Boris’s Christmas getaway with Carrie, when he stayed in a £40,000-a-week villa in Mustique. Little wonder then the internet chatter has been ablaze with musings over whether this cottage was a mere foil: were he and Carrie really staying at the much more luxurious Fairmont in St Andrews, local gossips mused.Boris did not disclose to the press where he was staying for his holidays. The showman journalist of yesteryear was never backwards in coming forwards. But, since he became Prime Minister last year, he has shown an uncharacteristic taste for privacy. He has preferred not to talk about his four children from his marriage to barrister Marina Wheeler, or his child from another relationship.The same shyness applies to his holidays. Foolishly, in light of his curtailed holiday, Boris didn’t go for the public photocall previous prime ministers opted for, in exchange for privacy for the rest of their holidays. This was a mainstay of the David Cameron years, when he was photographed every year in Ibiza or Cornwall, having a snack in front of the cameras. There was no fakeness in the Cameron holidays in Cornwall. They love the place so much that, after he left office, he bought a holiday home there.Do we have a right to know where our senior politicians take their holidays? As a journalist, Boris would accept we do even if he’s in no hurry to tell us where he’s going. And it’s true that the choice of destination does reveal a lot about our various leaders.In his unflashy holiday, Boris was harking back to Prime Ministers of the old days. Harold Wilson always went with his family to his beloved Scilly Isles bungalow. The three-bedroom bungalow was built for the Wilson family in 1959, and was used by his widow Mary Wilson until her death in 2018, aged 102. Last year, it went on the market for the first time, at £425,000.Margaret Thatcher wasn’t really one for holidays – she loved work too much. In 1984, her two-and-half week summer holiday in Austria and Switzerland was crammed with meetings – from visiting a chipboard factory to dining with Austrian Chancellor Fred Sinowitz. She also fitted in appointments with German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and former UN secretary-general Kurt Waldheim, and dinner with ambassadors. Gordon Brown, too, was not a natural, fun-loving holidaymaker. More recently, we were treated to the sight of Mrs May walking off her troubles on hiking holidays in Wales and Switzerland.The king of the flash freebie summer holiday was Tony Blair. With wife Cherie and young family, he took full advantage of the fabulous Tuscan 1,300-acre estate, Fattoria di Cusona, in the family of Prince Girolamo Strozzi since 1524. As Boris himself wrote at the time in the , “The Tuscan palazzo of Girolamo Strozzi was where Tony Blair forged one of New Labour’s few hard-edged ideological positions: he was pro-sciutto and anti-pasto.”In that same 2008 article, Boris said it was completely fine that Prime Ministers should stuff Skegness and take their trunks in search of southern sun. It fits with his libertarian instincts that no one should be forced to holiday anywhere they don’t want to.The classicist Boris (his holiday reading in Scotland was the Roman philosopher Lucretius) is particularly keen on holidays in Greece. His father Stanley has just got into hot water for visiting his family villa in Greece during lockdown, in order to “Covid-proof” the property for holiday lettings. Boris also got into hot water as Mayor of London during the 2011 London riots, when he was trapped with his family on holiday in the Canadian Rockies, touring its remote peaks in a campervan with a dodgy mobile phone signal.To be fair to Boris, he is completely used to the discomfort of the British countryside. He spent childhood summers on Exmoor, on the family farm bought by Stanley Johnson‘s father. The farm stars in the new book about austere holidays, British Summer Time Begins – the School Summer Holidays 1930-1980, by Ysenda Maxtone Graham.Rachel Johnson showed Maxtone Graham a photograph of Boris and the family in the farmyard in 1970. Maxtone Graham writes, “They all look happy, but the children look quite grubby, with muddy knees and unwashed, unbrushed hair, clearly wearing any old rugged, stained item they’d found on the floor and managed to pull on. It was all gumboots, dirty gym shoes or bare feet on the scrubby ground.“Rachel Johnson said of the Johnson summer holidays on Exmoor, “’Neglect’ doesn’t do it justice. We were hungry all the time. We eat stale digestives that have been put into the Aga. It didn’t make them fresh. It just made them taste burnt.“Other highlights of Boris‘s childhood cuisine were three chief recipes: rice salad with tinned tuna and roughly chopped onion, apple crumble and Carnation-milk ice cream made by “mixing Carnation with cocoa powder and putting the mixture into a pewter-coloured ice tray...it was basically milky ice with jagged shards.”And, if the Johnson family compound in Somerset is tough in summer, there’s not much cold comfort in winter either. One guest describes snow falling on her head at night – in one of the farm bedrooms.It is this old-fashioned, austere childhood that explains Boris’s approach to clothes, cuisine and comfort – he is indifferent to all three. As someone of his generation, born in 1964, that sort of deprivation was completely standard. Yes, he went to Eton and Oxford and was in the shamelessly plutocratic Bullingdon Club (as, I must confess, so was I), but he was never a rich kid on pampered holidays, effortlessly whisked from Continental hotspot to Caribbean hideaway by private jet.He would have been completely at home in the rugged beauty of the Scottish coast. He would even have taken pleasure in any vigorous gales sweeping through Britain in the aftermath of Storm Ellen. As his holiday clothing so far revealed suggests, he is not one for dedicated wet-weather gear – cagouls, Gore-Tex and the like. Even after suffering a near fatal bout of COVID-19 earlier this year, he is perfectly happy in a beanie hat and yesterday’s pants.Twenty-four years Boris’s junior, Carrie Symonds was brought up in an entirely different Britain. She was born into a world of unbelievable comfort – duvets, air con, central heating and cheap flights to exotic locations. Social media photographs show her in a skimpy bikini, piloting speed boats through tropical waters.She won’t have found much use for a bikini on the Scottish coast - although, if she wrapped it around her head, it might just have kept the midges off her ears.Harry Mount is author of The Wit and Wisdom of Boris Johnson (Bloomsbury)More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"exclusive manchester teen joined islamic state twin sister held","story":"A woman from Manchester who joined Islamic State as a teenager alongside her twin sister is alive and being held with her young son in a controversial camp run by Syrian Kurdish forces, sources in north-east Syria have confirmed to The .Salma and Zahra Halane were 16 when they fled their home in Chorlton in June 2014 to travel to Syria, but their fate has not been known since IS lost the last of its territory in fighting against Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) in March 2019.Zahra was recently caught trying to escape from the sprawling Al Hol camp, where she had lived for 16 months, and was transferred last week from a women\u0027s prison to a new high-security extension to Roj camp, where humanitarians worry the most dangerous IS supporters are being moved, sources in the camps said. Salma’s whereabouts is unknown but she is also believed to be alive. Dubbed the terror twins in the media, Zahra and Salma remain committed IS supporters, according to women in Al Hol.The fact that their presence went unreported and that at least one of them attempted to escape illustrates the danger of leaving tens of thousands of jihadists under the guard of a militia in a war-torn country, experts say.The Halane twins, who moved to Manchester at a young age from Denmark, crossed into Syria in July 2014, shortly after IS declared a caliphate.The twins, whose elder brother had reportedly travelled to Syria the year before, moved to Raqqa, the caliphate\u0027s capital, and soon married Islamic State fighters.Their youth and apparent enthusiasm for life under IS attracted widespread attention, and their journey to jihad was later copied by the Bethnal Green trio - teenage girls from an academy in London of whom only Shamima Begum is known to have survived.By early 2019, the once sprawling caliphate was reduced to a small pocket of territory outside Baghouz in eastern Syria. While tens of thousands of IS supporters like Ms Begum surrendered to the Western-backed SDF, many remained missing.Ms Begum’s classmates Amira Abase and Kadiza Sultana are believed to have died, but others without identification documents entered the camps, where there was little to stop them giving partial or incorrect biographical information.Last month Russia Today Arabic aired an interview with a woman The  has identified as Zahra after she was caught trying to escape from Al Hol, where some 10,000 foreign women and children live in overcrowded and unsanitary conditions in an annex separate from over 55,000 Syrian and Iraqi citizens in the rest of the camp.“I want to go back home,” the woman says, speaking Arabic.A network of corrupt guards and drivers using hidden compartments inside water tankers has developed to traffic people from Al Hol into Turkey.The cost is about £12,000, according to researcher Vera Mironava, and is often sent by relatives abroad via informal money transfer systems. A woman who escaped from Al Hol said she knew the twins in the Islamic State and afterwards in the camp.“I\u0027ve known them for over five years,” the woman told The , speaking anonymously. “We visited each other”.“I don’t know where the other one might be honestly but they left together,” she said, referring to Salma and their escape attempt. The  has also reviewed screenshots of messages purportedly from other women in Al Hol confirming the twins are alive. They know Zahra by her nickname Umm Zubair and Salma as Umm Abdurrahman. Zahra has a four- or five-year-old son named Ismail, while Salma’s son was reportedly killed in fighting at Baghouz. The government is believed to have revoked the twins’ residency and subjected them to an exclusion order, meaning they would be unable to reenter the UK. A Home Office spokeswoman said: “We do not comment on inidual cases.” The twins have told camp authorities they are Danish and are believed to want to return there.Denmark\u0027s foreign ministry said it does not comment on inidual cases or provide specific numbers concerning Danish nationals in northeast Syria.Relatives in the UK indicated to The  that they know the twins are alive. Speaking at the family’s home in Manchester, their mother Khadra Jama said: “They have been banned from the UK.”Speaking through a translator she added: “The UK government did not help me when they left. They were 16 years-old when they left, they have been away for six years and they left from the airport and nobody helped them.”She declined to comment further, as did other relatives contacted by The . Leaving thousands of IS supporters like the twins in insecure Syrian camps undermines efforts to prevent a resurgence of the group, said Shiraz Maher, director of the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation at King\u0027s College London.The SDF and the US-led coalition against Islamic State have repeatedly called on governments to repatriate their citizens.“The best disposition option for detained foreign terrorist fighters is for home countries to repatriate, prosecute, and, where appropriate, incarcerate them,” said coalition spokesman Capt Matthew Morris.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"mercy statisticians pandemic","story":"Just as the assassination of JFK was the first global event to take place in the age of rolling TV news, Covid-19 is the first pandemic to happen in the age of daily statistical bulletins. We have become glued – or perhaps imprisoned – by the endless onslaught of figures for deaths, new cases, hospitalisations.Our lives can be thrown upside down when they move in the wrong direction – any country that starts registering more than 20 new cases per 100,000 people can expect to be put on Britain’s quarantine list. Last week, the whole of Auckland was sent into lockdown after the New Zealand government announced four – yes, four – new cases in the city.Only belatedly are we coming to realise that the statistics fed to us do not always mean what we think they mean. Until last week Public Health England was counting as a Covid death anyone who had died after testing positive for Covid 19, even if that was months ago, they never showed any symptoms and went on to be run over by a bus.This morning it transpires that the statistics for hospitalisations were compiled in the same way – anyone who went into hospital and tested positive for Covid 19 was counted as a Covid case, even if they had fallen off a ladder. By the same token, the common cold could be made out to be consigning to emergency wards and killing many tens of thousands of people in Britain every year.There’s another statistical oddity we need to be aware of, too. In recent weeks Spain has become the seat of what has been called Europe’s ‘second wave’. Recorded new cases have leapt since bottoming out in June, with 35,582 of them being recorded in the last seven days – constituting a peak nearly as high as that in April. Yet if so many are catching Covid 19 why aren’t they dying or going to hospital?While there has been a small rise in hospitalisations in recent weeks it is nothing compared to what was happening in the spring. In the past seven days, 1407 have been hospitalised with Covid 19 and 122 have died – compared with nearly 900 deaths every day at the height of the epidemic. While you would expect a lag between new recorded cases and deaths, in the spring there was only a gap of seven days between peak new cases and peak deaths. The ‘second wave’ in new cases has been evident for seven weeks now.It is only when you look at the small print in the Spanish health ministry’s daily dispatch that you realise something amiss. Up until 10 May, Spain was only counting in its daily tally on new cases people who had tested positive in PCR tests – the ‘do you have it?’ test which detects traces of the actual virus in swabs of the nose and mouth.From 11 May, however, Spain started adding to the figure people who had tested positive in IgM tests, assuming they had also displayed some symptoms. The IgM test is the ‘have I had it?’ test, which looks for antibodies in the blood. This doesn’t start picking up cases until around 14 days after infection. In other words, Spain is counting in its daily total people who had the virus weeks ago.Sooner or later we are going to have to have an inquiry into the role of statisticians in the Covid 19 crisis. They will have to be put in the hot seat and grilled as to whether they contributed to the sense of panic which has gripped so many people and disrupted normal life for so long.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"national trust plans better manage carbon impact visits","story":"The National Trust is planning to discourage visitors from making lengthy journeys to its country properties, according to a briefing document seen by the .Under the proposals, the trust is seeking to “reduce journey times and increase non-car access” to its vast portfolio of stately homes and gardens. In doing so it hopes to “better manage the carbon impact of visiting”.The document said there will come a need for a “shift from a reliance on days out to more flexible community use”.The plans, contained in a 14-page briefing document entitled “Towards a 10-year vision for places and experiences”, will raise eyebrows amongst some of the National Trust’s most loyal members for whom a day out by car to a country property is one of its great joys.Written by Tony Berry, the heritage charity’s visitor experience director, the document was drawn up in response to the lockdown which it says has accelerated “some tricky choices” for the National Trust over “which activities to stop, start and continue”.The National Trust, which has six million members, is proposing 1,200 redundancies to make up for the financial shortfall caused by the pandemic. It employs 15,000 staff and 70,000 volunteers across its huge estate of historic houses and castles. It is not clear how the Trust could achieve more localised visits when so many of its properties are away from urban centres in rural areas hard to reach without a car.It complains that “its current visitor model puts a disproportionate load on peak times” and that the “outdated mansion experience” largely serves “a loyal but (by 2030) dwindling audience”.Mr Berry instead promotes a new vision over the next decade by “building long-term, deep and sustainable relationships with people who live close by. That will allow us to better manage the carbon impact of visiting, by reducing journey times and increasing non-car access”. Critics of the National Trust’s current management will raise concerns that the charity plans to raise more money by increasingly hiring out stately homes for “specialised experiences”.The charity has been accused in recent years of ‘dumbing down’ and under its current proposals to save money its national specialists in areas including textiles, furniture and libraries face redundancy.Dr Amy Boyington, an architectural historian said: “This again feeds in to the whole ‘dumbing down’ of history within the NT, where it believes that to be accessible to everyone it needs to make history flashy, punchy and Disney-esque.”Dan Hicks, author and curator at Pitt Rivers Museum in Oxford, said: “As well as just houses and gardens, the National Trust cares for nationally significant collections of objects, archives, photographs, and more – so the prospect of losing expert librarians, archaeologists and curators is deeply worrying.”In a statement, the National Trust said: “The Trust document on a vision for places and experiences was an internal discussion document to look at possible ways forward as we emerge from the coronavirus crisis. It is not a strategy.“We remain committed to, and passionate about, the country house and arts and heritage. And we will not dumb down.We will always welcome the enthusiasts and the specialists and provide them with experiences that are tailored for their interests, such as at places like Kingston Lacy and Petworth – where we ensure those treasure houses are presented to the highest possible standard.“But we also want to ensure there is something for everyone in our houses, taking visitors from their first encounters with our heritage and onto discovering ever-greater treasures from different houses. “We accept that the presentation of some of our houses can be improved and we need to make sure they are meaningful and relevant for the 21st century. We want to move away from a one-size-fits all model and to focus on the ersity of our places and ensure we make the most of our collections.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"opposition belarusian politicians questioned alleged attempts","story":"Two prominent Belarusian opposition figures on Friday spent hours being questioned by prosecutors over alleged attempts to “seize power” from President Alexander Lukashenko amid weeks of unprecedented protests.Maxim Znak, attorney for a former opposition presidential candidate, and Sergey Dylevsky, a worker from the Minsk Tractor Works who has emerged as an unofficial blue-collar leader, were interviewed the day an investigation was launched accusing them and other opposition figures of plotting to topple Mr Lukashenko.Mr Znak and Mr Dylevsky told reporters outside the investigators’ offices that they had to sign a non-disclosure clause, barring them from going into details of the case.They have not been charged.Both men were earlier this week named as members of the Coordination Council, an ad-hoc body formed by the opposition to oversee what they believe is an imminent transition from Mr Lukashenko.The European Union called for the criminal probe to be dropped.The Belarusian leader of 26 years earlier this week appeared to be facing an inevitable fall from power. Protests have been smaller in recent days, though larger rallies are expected this weekend. On Friday evening, several thousand people poured out into the central streets of Minsk to form a human chain, waving national flags in defiance of the government crackdown.Passing cars honked in support.Mr Lukashenko was awarded a landslide victory at the Aug 9 presidential election, which was widely perceived as brazenly fraudulent. Subsequent anti-government demonstrations were brutally crushed by riot police, who spent the following three nights chasing unarmed protesters, firing rubber bullets and throwing stun grenades. Nearly 7,000 people were detained across the country.The opposition’s rally of 200,000 last Sunday has been described as the largest in the country’s history.Opposition candidate Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya Friday made her first public appearance after fleeing Belarus the day after the election and surfacing in Lithuania. She urged more workers to join crippling industrial strikes. A visibly distressed Tsikhanouskaya told the news conference that she would come back to Belarus only when she feels safe, but refused to say if she had been intimidated into leaving.The wife of a blogger who was barred from running in the election earlier this year and subsequently jailed, Mrs Tsikhanouskaya called on Mr Lukashenko to step down and said that the brutal crackdown has destroyed his legitimacy forever.“The violence has to stop, political prisoners need to be released and a new, free and fair elections need to be held,” she said.“The people of Belarus will never accept Lukashenko.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"singapore scientists find coronavirus variant milder infections","story":"Researchers in Singapore have discovered a new variant of the Covid-19 coronavirus that causes milder infections, according to a study published in The Lancet medical journal this week.The study showed that Covid-19 patients infected with a new variant of SARS-CoV-2 had better clinical outcomes, including a lower proportion developing low blood oxygen or requiring intensive care.The study also showed the variant, which has a large deletion in a part of its genome, elicited a more robust immune response.The study involved researchers from various Singapore institutions, including the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID), the Duke-NUS Medical School and the Agency for Science, Technology and Research.These studies provide the first convincing data showing that an observed genetic change (mutation) in SARS-CoV-2 has affected the severity of disease in patients, said Gavin Smith at Duke-NUS.The scientists said the findings had implications for vaccine development and treatments for Covid-19.The variant, which likely came from Wuhan, China, was detected in a cluster of infections that occurred from January to March 2020. In Singapore, the virus was transmitted from person-to-person across several clusters before being contained.An expert told Reuters this week that mutations in viruses may be a good thing.

I don\u0027t need to take these other precautions\u0027, he said, saying his agency believed social distancing and self-isolation of the sick were much more important.While he admitted there was no study showing that face masks did in fact reduce adherence to other guidelines, he pointed to the trajectory of cases in countries that have mandated them.There is now a continuous and even increased spread in a number of countries who implemented face masks,  he said.There is a belief that if you just have face masks, you can forget about everything else, you can run your subway with full trains and so on.Norway last week recommended the use of face masks on public transport in Oslo, and Finland on public transport nationwide, putting Dr Tegnell\u0027s agency under growing public pressure to follow suit.Scientific Forum Covid-19 Sweden, a group of 45 Swedish researchers critical of Sweden\u0027s strategy, argued last Sunday in the Dagens Nyheter newspaper that masks should be worn even by students and teachers in schools.The scientific data is clear at this point, with most studies  showing that face masks do limit the spread, and to my knowledge not a single study showing they increase the spread, so why are they so stubborn? said Lena Einhorn, an author with a PhD in virology, who is part of the group.But Jonas Ludvigsson, professor of clinical epidemiology at Stockholm\u0027s Karolinska Institute, who on Monday attacked the group for cherry-picking and misrepresenting studies, said that the different approach Sweden had taken was best explained by the unusual independence of its government agencies.In the other Nordic countries, politicians often have a stronger role than the experts at public health agencies. Frode Forland, Dr Tegnell\u0027s Norwegian counterpart, told the  he believed Dr Tegnell had a valid argument against face masks.We\u0027ve been stressing that it\u0027s still much more effective to keep distance than to wear a face mask, he said. If you keep one metre\u0027s distance, the reduction of risk of infection is about 80 per cent, but if you wear a face mask it\u0027s about 40 per cent.He estimated that even with the rising number of cases Norway is currently experiencing, about 70,000 people would have to wear a mask for a week to prevent a single infection.  On Wednesday, Johan Carlson, the Director-General of the Public Health Agency and Dr Tegnell\u0027s boss, appeared to soften the agency\u0027s stance, telling a press conference that the issue over face masks is not at all dead, and that the agency was working on a review of the available evidence before issuing a list of recommendations to Sweden\u0027s government on September 1st.But Dr Tegnell said the agency was unlikely to recommend face masks to the general public across Sweden, unless the rate of infection increases dramatically.There might be a role for face masks if you have increased incidence in a limited geographical area and you want to do everything to stop it as quickly as possible, he said.But he said that Sweden was seeing a downward trend in most regions of the country. If that changes then of course we need to think about more measures, but its a bit unusual to install more measures when you are in a downgoing trend. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"wont people run thenational trust trust nation","story":"The National Trust: could an organisation want a better name? To be national and to be trusted is the ambition of every major British charity, institution, business and political party*. Since its foundation in 1895, the National Trust has, on the whole, lived up to its name. It is the most successful heritage organisation in the world. That is why it has more than 600,000 acres and nearly six million members.It is interesting to recall the trust’s full name. It is The National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty. This title links buildings with gardens, landscapes and coastline. Whenever people within the Trust have tried to break that link, there has been trouble. Whenever they have strengthened it, there has been success.Historically, there has always been a tension between what a great former supporter, Sir John Smith, called “the Lilies and the Boots”. The Lilies were the aesthete curators who cared about the collections and fabric of the more than 200 historic houses. The Boots were the land agents who wanted to make the estates work and preferred the great outdoors.This tension was usually more creative than destructive. The relationship between what is built by man and what is grown by harnessing nature is a glory of the British landscape. The National Trust has maintained this relationship, and sometimes improved it. That is what ensures its appeal to people of all classes and widely differing tastes. Members understand that it is all one thing – what Beatrix Potter, inventor of Peter Rabbit and Tom Kitten, called “a noble thing”. Because she believed this, she bequeathed the trust 4,000 acres of the Lake District. Its current headquarters is called Heelis – her married name – in her honour.But in recent years, something else has entered the fray. Now Covid-19 has brought it out into the open.This week, two documents have found their way into the public domain. The first, from the NT director, Hilary McGrady, introduced a “consultation” on the “Reset Programme”. In plainer English, she means job cuts. The trust is losing £200 million this year, caused, she says, by the coronavirus.There is the usual patter about bioersity and carbon footprint, ersity and inclusion, “community”, Equality Impact Assessments, “unconscious bias” and “how the collections came to be” (which I take to be a coded reference to the profits of slavery). But in essence, the paper is lists and charts of lost jobs and new ways of working, mainly by centralisation. Food, for example, will come from “Whole Trust Delivery Teams”, not from the land and gardens the trust owns.Although the curators – the trust’s unique knowledge bank – will be cut by less than some areas, their expertise will diminish. Instead of being experts on one big thing, such as paintings, furniture, or textiles, they will be allocated to cover everything in a single century. This makes no sense when great houses have usually developed architecturally, and in their collections, over centuries. Blickling Hall, in Norfolk, for example, is Tudor, Jacobean and 18th century, with 19th-century alterations as well.Behind Ms McGrady’s 41 pages lies an implied admission that the trust has overreached, nearly doubling over ten years. It has been the Cecil Rhodes of heritage colonialism, grabbing too much, too fast. Now it has suffered a non-fatal but worrying cardiac arrest.The other document is called “Towards a 10-year Vision for Places and Experiences. Version 2.1”. It is written by Tony Berry, the Trust’s Director of Visitor Experience. The first thing to note about the Berry plan is its visuals. There are pictures of children building sandcastles, a family travelling in a driverless car playing with screens through a futuristic urban landscape, robots, wheelchairs, and a mock-up of the Houses of Parliament being flooded by global warming. Nowhere is there an identifiable picture of a trust property. There is no photograph of a trust house at all.That last point is presumably intended, since Mr Berry says that the “outdated mansion experience” has to go. He wants “revolution”, not “evolution”. Out goes the “asset-led approach (our primary role is to present the English country house as a distinctive part of our heritage).” In comes the “audience-led approach”: houses should no longer be presented as “country house former homes” but “repurposed as public space in service of local audiences”. “Everywhere… we will move away from our narrow focus on family and art history.”As for gardens, they will not just be beautiful places of tranquillity and “heritage”, but places of activity “where issues like climate change are acknowledged and tackled”. Perhaps some ingenious horticulturalist like the chap who produced the loganberry should develop a fruit called the berryberry in honour of Tony and his visitor experiences. It would be green at all times, and run through one’s system with frightening speed.If Mr Berry’s ideas were to be pursued, several things would happen. First the donor families, many of whom inhabit part of their former house, or a house on the estate, would rebel. If their gift was being “repurposed as public space”, why should they continue, as many do, to lend its contents to the trust, or, on death, to transfer them to it as “acceptance in lieu” of tax, instead of selling them on the open market?Second, the Berry vision might break the great National Trust Act of Parliament of 1937 specifically designed to rescue country houses for the nation. It would also call into question the unique privilege granted to the trust by its original Act of Parliament of 1907, which states that no property once given to the trust can be taken away from it except by the will of Parliament. Why should the trust be allowed to keep buildings whose historic interest it disregards?Finally, National Trust members are usually fascinated by the family stories in its properties, as part of the human dimension and historical context. They do not see most of the properties as neutral backcloths for entertainment, let alone for lectures about the environment. They like their romance and their narrative. Mr Berry loves using the word “narratives”. He says people are searching for “narratives to define their own identities”. Yet he never mentions the great common historical, social and geographical identity in all these places – the word “Britain”.It should, in fairness, be said that the gleam in Mr Berry’s eye is not the agreed policy of the National Trust. Ms McGrady has hurried to point this out. But his views are not untypical of those who talk of “visitor experience” and “interpretation”, yet seem actively to dislike the real experience of a place with a history – a history which, all too often, they seem proud not to know.This is a problem much more widespread than the National Trust – a problem in schools and universities and parts of the public services and the BBC. It is a culture – or rather a lack of culture – which needs to change.Here is the full sentence from Beatrix Potter from which I quoted earlier. “The Trust,” she said, “is a noble thing, and humanly speaking – immortal. There are some silly mortals connected with it but they will pass.”*Footnote: The National Trust covers the whole of the UK except for Scotland. The Scottish National Trust is a separate (and much less secure) body.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"abyssal spider trailer watch poster plot release date","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.‘Is 2020 not bad enough?’The Independent employs reporters around the world to bring you truly independent journalism.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.The first reviews are in for Tenet, Christopher Nolan’s eagerly awaited movie – which has left critics thoroughly ided.Tenet, which will be released in the UK on 26 August and in the US on 3 September after several delays due to the coronavirus pandemic, has been deemed both entertaining and “cerebral” by some, but lacking and confusing by others.Some critics noted that while spoilers are usually a concern when writing a movie review, this time around they would be hard-pressed to say too much about the plot, because it’s too convoluted to do so.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“For once, spoiler sensitivity might be the reviewer’s luckiest break, absolving me of even attempting an explanation of a plot so contorted it’s best not to worry about it,” Jessica Kiang wrote in The New York Times. “Even the scientist played by Clémence Poésy, here exclusively to deliver exposition, eventually cops out. ‘Don’t try to understand it, feel it’ is the best advice anyone offers.”Leslie Felperin shared a similar impression in The Hollywood Reporter, writing: “If it seems like this review is shying away from describing the plot, that’s not just out of concern to avoid spoilers. I watched the movie twice for this review, and still feel very confused about what is supposed to be going on and why.” Later on, Felperin adds: “Altogether, it makes for a chilly, cerebral film — easy to admire, especially since it’s so rich in audacity and originality, but almost impossible to love, lacking as it is in a certain humanity.”Tenet is Nolan’s most confusing film, but thrilling to get lost inOthers, however, praised the plot’s complexity. Among them was The Independent\u0027s Clarisse Loughrey, who deemed the film ”seemingly engineered for multiple viewings” in a four-star review, adding: “Does it matter all that much, though? Tenet is a thrilling place to get lost in. ‘Don’t try to understand it. Feel it,’ explains Laura (Clémence Poésy), who serves as one of the film’s exposition machines. The advice is directed as much to us as it is to the film’s hero. But while the appeal of Nolan’s films usually comes from watching all the pieces fall neatly into place, the final picture bringing a sense of order to existence, the director has found himself increasingly drawn towards chaos.”  Guy Lodge similarly noted in an overall positive review for Variety: “A concrete cornucopia of global chaos and threat, in which humanity’s survival depends on the minor matter of reshaping time and space, Tenet looks well suited to an anxious age.” While deeming Tenet ”no holy grail”, Lodge still praised it as ”dizzy, expensive, bang-up entertainment of both the old and new school”.Tenet won’t save the multiplex – cinema’s future lies in reinventionYet, not everyone was equally taken with Tenet. Jonathan Romney was cautious in his praise, writing in The Los Angeles Times: “Truth be told, Tenet is not the absolutely sui generis wonder you may be expecting. It’s basically espionage adventure, but with a science fiction backbone: Nolan ups the ante on Mission: Impossible by making the impossibility not just physical but quantum physical. And he goes about it expertly, bullishly and with giddily perverse intent to bewilder.”Anna Smith’s review in Deadline calls Tenet a “film you can miss”, and “chiefly one for those numerous and ardent Nolan fans”. “It may be hard to find Tenet’s dense sci-fi concept truly exciting on first viewing—frankly, there is so much else going on demanding your attention,” Smith notes. “But it is easy to sit back and revel in the wonder of the big-screen experience, and to immediately want to see the film again. And again. Those who love the challenge set by a complex audio visual puzzle will be well served — and with little else major to compete at the box office, time is on their side.”On a similar note, Mike McCahill’s IndieWire review deems Nolan’s film “a humourless disappointment”, and elaborates: “Nolan is not invested in the meat-and-potatoes plotting of lesser mortals. He trades in big-picture concepts, and his latest is tried-and-tested: a device that reverses matter. Careers too, apparently.”The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

All money raised from the auction will go to The Independent’s appeal partner, The Felix Project, London’s largest food surplus distribution charity. Our campaign has so far raised £7.5m towards our £10m goal which includes a pledge to open London’s largest community kitchen to tackle food poverty.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHighlights from the Sotheby’s Help the Hungry auction include a drawing from Tracey Emin, a series of three etchings by Anish Kapoor, Mark Wallinger’s “Ghost”, and Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s “We Have Only Got Each Other” placard.British-Nigerian artist Yinka Shonibare also joins the catalogue with his “Unstructured Icons - Aristocrat I” alongside a pair of polished steel reliefs by Michael Craig-Martin and a floral plate by Chinese artist Ai Weiwei.   How to support our campaignSotheby’s senior director Oliver Barker said: “We are grateful to the artists who have generously contributed their works and we’re looking forward to channelling part of the excitement of our major sales in London this month into a cause which will provide food and comfort to the capital’s most vulnerable.”  Evgeny Lebedev, proprietor of The Independent, said: “We are delighted to be raising money with Sotheby’s and some of the world’s leading contemporary artists to help build London’s biggest community kitchen that will continue to feed those in need for years to come.”The Felix Project distributes nutritious food that would otherwise go to waste to 350 frontline charities, schools and holiday programmes in London.Founder Justin Byam Shaw said: “Although our food is surplus and donated to us and we have over 1,500 volunteers, our costs are still spiralling. “The coming unemployment crisis means we are in this for the long term. This new community kitchen will provide a high-quality meal for homeless Londoners, cooked by great chefs using surplus food.” Turner Prize-winning artist Mark Wallinger said: “I am delighted to contribute to help raise funds for The Felix Project, a fantastic charity that does such vital work in providing food for vulnerable people throughout London, work that is ever more necessary in our current crisis.”Sotheby’s Help The Hungry Auction will go live on 20 July and will run until 30 July.Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Swindon is now the fourth worst affected area in the UK when measured as a proportion of population, having seen a 200 per cent increase in new cases over the last seven days.It has nearly as many new cases per person as Leicester, which was the first place to see tougher local restrictions put in place after the nationwide lockdown lifted.The UK as a whole remains a long way off its peak levels from April and May, when daily new cases frequently reached above 5,000.Yet local spikes could see the recent upwards trend continue if not brought under control, as has been the case in other countries like France and Spain.Having endured a big surge in cases during the early stages of the pandemic, London has since seen its number of daily cases drop at an even greater rate than the rest of the country.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

At a time when Londoners from all walks of life are struggling due to the impact of coronavirus, the importance of love and care from others has been magnified tenfold.The phrase comes from a work made by the artist Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith – one of several fantastic lots in an auction kicking off today at sothebys to support The Independent’s Help the Hungry appeal.Over the past four months we have raised more than £7.5m for food redistribution charity The Felix Project – a cause for which we have pledged to raise £10m as well as to open central London’s largest community kitchen.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe auction is an opportunity to get your hands on works by some amazing artists – more likely to be seen on the walls of a museum than your living room. They can also be viewed at Sotheby’s, 34-35 New Bond Street.Ceramic has been a recurring motif for Ai Weiwei (a 1995 series of photographs showed him dropping a Han dynasty urn) and he has often used porcelain, for centuries a secret formula known only to Chinese makers. Flowers, too, are significant – when his passport was taken Ai put a bunch of fresh flowers in a bike basket outside his studio every day until he was able to travel freely. This small plate holds a great deal of meaning.Yinka Shonibare deconstructions of icons of western power couldn’t be more current. This elegant woodcut print, using vivid Batik textiles, transposes animal masks from Mali onto the faces of English aristocratic figures enriched off the back of colonisation and slavery. The patterns of textiles overlay the repeating patterns of power and show how history’s long fingers reach into our present.Unfailingly optimistic, Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s work is always a call to care. He’s known for his colourful and impassioned but peaceful slogans (“Make Art Not War” seems like a good standard to live by) and his advocacy of art as a tool for education and understanding. We Have Only Got Each Other quotes his late mother, the artist Deirdre Borlase, spoken in response to the isions revealed during the Brexit campaign — but its universal meaning is clear.I’m a sucker for a good drawing – I’ve always felt that even at 500-odd years distance, it’s the form that brings you closest to an artist the sweep of a human hand that has just left the page. After many years of deeply mining her own emotions and experiences in her work, Emin is an artist at the height of her powers. Her raw, almost agonisingly expressive draughtsmanship gets me every time and this little sketch nails the feeling of having a really good cry.These three etchings – a supremely generous donation from Anish Kapoor, more usually known for the interactive theatricality of his large-scale sculptures – exude a quiet drama. Their simplicity belies their seductiveness velvety and intense, they draw you in, never quite revealing their secrets.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Wallinger was inspired by X-rays of Old Masters, which he thinks of as akin to spirit photography: “The revelation of the invisible, supernatural life of a painting.”A reminder of the pre-lockdown era, when we were able to wander the Hayward Gallery and bathe in the sea of pulsating colour that was Riley’s superb exhibition. This screenprint is from a series that vibrates right off the paper (Tate owns an edition of Elongated Triangles 5, so you’ll be in good company if you get your hands on this one).The essence of things is what Michael Craig-Martin seeks in his work, and colour is part of seducing the viewer to really look at the objects that make up our world. These sculptural reliefs in polished steel come from a series that pays homage to designers and architects whose vision has shaped what we think of as “modern”. You can’t sit on them, but look at them. Aren’t they beautiful?Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.It was a moment that had been a long, long time coming, and when it did Kamala Harris grasped it with both hands.On a night freighted with history, the senator from California officially accepted the Democratic Party’s nomination to be vice president, the first woman of colour thus selected by a major party, and only the sixth woman in total in the US ever added to a ticket.In a speech that spread over more 15 minutes, and perhaps representing the de facto keynote address on the third night of the convention despite top billing going to Barack Obama, her words were at once warm and hopeful, yet firm. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesShe paid respect to the political pioneers that had gone before her, breaking the ground that would help allow a black American woman of South Asian heritage, build a career such as hers. And she paid tribute to her family, particularly her mother, Shyamala Gopalan Harris, who came to the US at the age of 18, and raised Kamala and her sister after their parents orced. She died in 2009. Ms Harris said that when her mother gave birth to her, aged just 25, at Kaiser Hospital in Oakland, California, she may have struggled to see just what lay in store for her daughter.DNC 2020“On that day, she probably could have never imagined that I would be standing before you now speaking these words: I accept your nomination for vice president of the United States of America,” she said. Ever since Joe Biden indicated in March of this year that were he to secure the nomination he would choose a woman as his running mate, there had been widespread anticipation he would select a woman of colour. Such a strategy appeared all the more vital and fair, following the killing by police in Minneapolis of an unarmed black man, triggering protests for racial justice that swept not just across the US, but around the world.In selecting the 55-year-old former prosecutor, Mr Biden said his main priority had been to find someone who could step into the job on day one, not merely a sound bite for a 77-year-old man, who will be the nation’s oldest president by far should he defeat Donald Trump in November.In her comments, Ms Harris noted that this week marked the 100th anniversary of the passage of the 19th amendment, which gave some women – white women – the right to vote.“So many of the black women who helped secure that victory were still prohibited from voting, long after its ratification. But they were undeterred,” she said. “Without fanfare or recognition, they organised, testified, rallied, marched, and fought—not just for their vote, but for a seat at the table.” No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And these women inspired us to pick up the torch, and fight on.”She named several female civil rights and political leaders — “Mary Church Terrell and Mary Mcleod Bethune. Fannie Lou Hamer and Diane Nash. Constance Baker Motley and Shirley Chisholm”. Ms Chisholm was both the first black congresswoman and the first black woman to make a run for the White House, back in 1972.“We’re not often taught their stories,” she added. “But as Americans, we all stand on their shoulders.”Trump’s strategy for dealing with the DNC is about to backfireMichelle Obama to hail Biden’s ‘grit and passion’ Why I can’t shake my disgust about being forced to vote for BidenMichelle Obama’s keynote speech at DNC expected to be major hitHer comments followed by an equally impassioned and hard-edged address by Mr Obama, who probably for the first time in four years in public, criticised Mr Trump by name. He said he feared for the state of the nation’s democracy should he secure a second term.“I did hope, for the sake of our country, that Donald Trump might show some interest in taking the job seriously that he might come to feel the weight of the office and discover some reverence for the democracy that had been placed in his care,” said Mr Obama. “But he never did.“If Mr Obama’s speech was heavy, and sombre, Ms Harris was able to inject a fair degree of energy into her words. Joe Biden will be relying on this verve to drive his campaign in the final three months, across a country beset by anxiety, economic hardship and the challenge of combatting the coronavirus pandemic. “Years from now, this moment will have passed,” said Ms Harris.  “And our children and our grandchildren will look in our eyes and they’re gonna ask us: Where were you when the stakes were so high? And we will tell them, not just how we felt – we will tell them what we did.” Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

In fact, I wonderin some ways we’ve ever had it so good.In football, the Leeds, West Brom and Fulham fans among us have the precious memories of heart-stopping promotion moments to cherish for ever.Similarly, while Liverpool fans would have preferred to have partied with their team, none of them will ever forget the evening Cha did them a favour and the title was theirs. And the intensity of Watford and Bournemouth fans’ misery at relegation will have been no less keenly felt without them being present.In fact, let’s be honest, under the circumstances they might well have been far better off at home anyway.Whether we were there or not turns out not to have mattered quite as much as we thought it would.Watching at home, we even got used to the crowd noise sound-effects. They seemed like the daftest idea ever at first, but so skilfully was it done that I was quite at home with it by the end of the season.I’ve loved the cricket too. I can’t tell you how much I normally enjoy being there for these matches, they’re the greatest joy of the sporting summer. Hordes of inebriated, sunburnt fans howling on their teams, whether I’m one of them, or watching at home, are all part of it. But watching the West Indies and Pakistan Test series unfold even without the mayhem of the crowds has been wonderful.Will, for example, Chris Woakes’ performance in the first Pakistan Test live any less long in our fondest memories for having been played out behind closed doors  Will Chris himself be any less delighted with it  Will his grandchildren care as he rocks them on his knee and tells them about his four fabulous days at Old Trafford in the weird summer of  Actually, you could forgive Chris for not being desperate to have crowds coming back. He played out of his skin behind closed doors in Manchester, and saw his football team, Aston Villa, save themselves from relegation in another deserted stadium days earlier.As for the snooker, pandemic or not, spectators in or out or a bit of both, we were still captivated.As it happens, I watched the Fulham v Brentford play-off final, and some of the snooker, in a sports bar in a hotel in Dubrovnik, Croatia, while an absolutely apocalyptic electric storm raged outside. I sat there with a handful of other Brits, riveted to the screens even as the roof of the place proved unequal to the task of keeping out the rain. What I can only describe as a waterfall soon started cascading into the middle of this bar. And yet we watched on, intently, as teams of Croatian hotel staff rushed around us with mops, buckets and a big kind of water Hoover thing. Nothing could tear us away. Even when something fused and it all went dark, we just filed on to the terrace and watched the storm with one eye, while with the other we watched data from the snooker and football flash up on our phones. Pandemics, floods and whatever  — bring on the plague of locusts — nothing, but nothing, can stop the sport getting to us, and us getting engaged with the sport.And nothing, ever, can stop Ronnie O’Sullivan being Ronnie. First he said the players were being treated like lab rats, then he said a lot of his fellow lab rats were hopeless snooker players anyway. And then he goes and wins the thing. You can’t keep a good bad mad man down, can you Why has sport still managed to grab us by the scruff of our necks in these troubled times  I think there are three reasons: Firstly, we missed it so much when it wasn’t there at all. We loved it before, but we really didn’t know how much until it was completely taken away for us.Secondly, without the crowds, though they are missed, what we’ve been left with is the naked, untrammelled intensity of sporting endeavour. There’s no noise and fervour in the stadia to detract from the purity of the contest.And thirdly, most importantly, the bond between sport and us, between those who play it and those who watch it, is so strong that nothing, but nothing, can ever break it.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I can excuse the caution of Boris Johnson and Gavin Williamson deciding it was better to be safe than sorry in the early days of an unknown pandemic.But as the weeks turned into months and Generation Corona effectively lost a school year, I will never forgive the militant teaching unions for keeping them shut regardless of the social cost.It was a partisan play designed to damage a Tory government at a time when politics should not have mattered one iota.Unfortunately, the A-levels mess this week was depressingly inevitable from the moment the school gates slammed shut.A knee-jerk decision to cancel all exams without waiting to seethere was a way they could be sat in a socially distanced manner meant the current crisis was unavoidable.This situation CANNOT ever be repeated — but I’m fearful it’s already happening.Coronavirus is now being used as an excuse not to provide anything slightly dficult or complicated in all areas of our lives.But when it comes to education, the costs of that lazy caution are too great.I don’t know about you, but much of the development I experienced at school was down to my social interactions and extracurricular activities, rather than solely what was taught on the blackboard.Yet many schools are intending to use Covid- to justy axing breakfast and after-school clubs, banning music lessons and school productions, and stopping sports.It breaks my heart to see these opportunities indefinitely wrested from our youngsters with no scientic evidence to back up why.But it is being caused by a desire from adults to avoid ato normality.A King’s College London study this week revealed a majority of the public are supportive of our nightmarish “new normal”, with  per cent believing employees should be able to keep working at home until a vaccine is discovered and administered.This is cloud cuckoo land thinking. While the progress in Russia and at Oxford University looks positive, there is no guarantee we are going to have a vaccine at all.  So here’s an unpleasant newsflash: Covid is going to be part of our lives for many years. After all, smallpox is the only infectious disease to ever have been eradicated.Selfish adults can ruin their own lives by giving in to irrational hysteria, but they shouldn’t be allowed to destroy the fair education of our kids.The fightback against militant education unions, box-ticking bureaucrats and cruel social distancing regulations for students must begin today.MUCH media attention this past week has been focused on Labour MP Dawn Butler’s dubious claim that London cops are institutionally racist because they pulled over her and a black mate, even though they were driving in a vehicle with tinted windows, meaning the officers had NO IDEA of their colour.What’s far more disturbing is the release of new figures showing violent assaults on Met officers have increased by  per cent in the past three months, coinciding with a period of social unrest sparked by coronavirus and Black Lives Matter protests.Our police are under attack from all angles.They are filmed by baying members of the public desperate to show discrimination but unable to release their own body cam footage.They are accused of racism simply for arresting criminals.Andwe’re not careful, they will give up trying to stop many crimes because the potential repercussions aren’t worth it.DISTURBING news for celebrity lovers: The stars you probably think are nice are usually utter horrors in real le and those with bad reputations publicly are often delightful off camera.That’s my experience after two decades reporting on the entertainment industry both here and in Hollywood.So I’m fascinated to see a celebrity not being nice is now an offence that can see them be “cancelled”, becausethat goes on, there won’t be many left on the telly.This week, in one of the biggest celebrity reporting injustices I’ve ever seen, Nadia Sawalha was hit by claims she is nasty behind the scenes.Believe me, I saw it all over ten years working at ITV Daytime, but can vouch that the Loose Women star is one of the kindest and most genuine people I have ever met in the toxic world of showbiz.To suggest she is some sort of fake is beyond the pale.Nadia is adored by everyone backstage, her best friend is one of the broadcaster’s make-up artists, and she cares deeply about the folk she works with.While some TV stars don’t know the names of crew members they’ve worked with for years, Nadia befriends most of them.The vulnerable, self-deprecating, caring and honest-to-a-fault list you see on Loose is the real woman I know and adore.FIRST the US broadcaster HBO axed Gone With The Wind, before introducing a so-called “trigger warning” to the start of the classic film.Now it has sparked further outrage by doing the same thing to the Mel Brooks classic Blazing Saddles.If this woke attack on our culture continues, soon virtually every old film favourite will come with a sombre introduction by a liberal university professor outlining the social ills you’re about to witness.That got me thinking about what will end up being said before my three favourite films of all time :Grease: Contains ious examples of toxic masculinity, with Kenickie inappropriately invoking rape culture when he asks DannySandy “put up a fight”.The Wizard Of Oz: The scarecrow uses make-up to change the colour of his skin in an early example of blackface.The Sound Of Music: Glamorises a handsome young Nazi soldier called Rolf and features emotional abuse by the captain of his children, including the use of a whistle for discipline.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Office for National Statistics data showed footfall at all retail locations is up to  per cent from a low of around ten per cent in early April.Shopping centres and High Streets are back to  per cent of last years levels of visitors.Ninety-three per cent of businesses are back open. Seventy-seven per cent of firms said there was no risk or a low risk they could go bust.Goods vehicles are once again clocking up their usual mileage. And overall road traffic is just nine per cent lower than before lockdown.Tonight, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said: “It’s great to see people back out and about, using our roads to boost business and drive our economic recovery.Sun readers will be happy to see that we’re setting out plans to spend £billion on improving our roads — reducing congestion, pollution and journey times. And we aim to cut through red tape and get projects done faster.”But while many drivers are getting back on the roads, commuters are still shunning trains and buses.Train passenger numbers are only at  per cent of last year’s levels. And bus usage is at just  per cent of what it was.In London, where millions of office staff are still working from home, Tube passenger numbers are  per cent the level of last year. The capital’s buses are only  per cent full.A third said lockdown had not aff­ected their turnover for this year. But half said they had seen a decrease.Just one in eight of the workforce remains on furlough.Chancellor Rishi Sunak’s Eat Out to Help Out Scheme to boost restaurants, cafes and pubs was used  million times last week. Data up to Monday of this week showed road traffic just nine per cent lower than the equivalent Monday in February. Britain’s White Van drivers are back to  per cent of pre-Covid- rates.ONS senior statistician Chloe Gibbs said: “Road traffic data shows the number of car journeys is ing to normal levels as people venture out to shops and travel to work.”But many huge firms are still telling workers to stay home and it is having a major knock-on effect on rail, Tube and bus commuter numbers and the wider urban economy.It is a huge blow for cities like London, Birmingham and Manchester. Their centres became ghost towns during lockdown.Cafe chains including Pret a Manger have announced job cuts as a result of having fewer customers.Rail usage has slumped to  per cent of last year’s levels, the Tube at  per cent and buses at  per cent.NEWS that Britain is bouncing back to normality is music to our ears.Last month, behavioural scientists worried that nervous Brits might let the economy tank rather than come out of hibernation. But they underestimated our resilience: High streets up and down the country are bustling once again . . . and ever-dependable White Van Man is back out on the road.We caution, though, against getting lulled into a  sense of security.New ONS data reveals that a whopping  per cent of employees are STILL on furlough, proving the extent to which the job retention scheme continues to prop up the economy.As the scheme tapers off, it’s inevitable that thousands of hardworking and blameless employees will be let go.We’re concerned too about the future of offices — and the cleaners, shop owners and transport workers who depend on their survival for work.On the Continent, the vast majority of city workers are back behind desks. But in the UK, business districts are ghosttowns as white collar employees find they like the work-from-home lestyle.It would be churlish not to celebrate today’s good news. But celebration must be tempered with pragmatism: The scarring effects of lockdown will be felt for months,not years, to come.For a full recovery, we must all make a concerted effort to shore up the economy by going out to work, pubs and the shops.  Tonight Tory grandee Iain Duncan Smith warned: “Office workers, civil servants, those in big companies are really being shown up by the self-employed and small businesses who are all getting back to work and are thus helping the economy.“Its down to these businesses and their office workers to recognise their responsibility, and get back to the office so they can help all the smaller businesses, the cafes, restaurants and bars in the centre of our towns and cities, so they are able to prosper again.”A No spokesman said: “This data shows our economy and society have reopened successfully — and it is hugely encouraging this has happened without a resurgence in the virus.”WE all faced tough times during lockdown and only when it was right did Prime Minister Boris Johnson give the green light for our shops to reopen.But customers have stayed away in droves, leaving the retail landscape looking like a series of ghost towns.Figures from the Office for National Statistics estimate that around , people in England currently have the coronavirus — less than . per cent of a population of around million.And while our neighbours in Europe have flocked backed to their offices, we’ve been more wary over here.Around  per cent of French white-collar workers are back at their desks,  per cent of Italians and  per cent of Germans.Here, it is just  per cent.That has a knock-on for those city centre businesses that rely on those workers for trade, such as sandwich shops and dry cleaners. Not forgetting trains and buses that ferry workers around.Already the job losses are piling up, with Marks  Spencer announcing it is shedding , staff over the next three months.I fear it could get a lot worse with many more thousands of jobs lost across the High Street.Pre-Covid, there was the hustle and bustle of happy shoppers thronging the stores while office workers were spending in their breaks.It breaks my heart to know that shoppers are staying away in their millions and thousands of staff are losing their jobs, with countless businesses being brought to their knees.But it’s not just down to the public, we need action right from the very top of government.People need to have their confidence boosted, and while everyone appreciates we are in unprecedented times and it is tough, it is also the responsibility of the Government to show the way back, just like our counterparts have done in EuropeWe need support for entrepreneurs with low rents in new or abandoned units. And councils could use their compulsory purchase powers to turn empty buildings into places where businesses can thrive once more with good, safe public transport.Add to that safe cycling, rent “holidays” and flexible-term agreements to help get businesses back on their feet.So come on shoppers, shop and office workers, let’s get our High Streets and city centres buzzing again.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In the Iowa caucuses, the first electoral contest of the campaign to become his party’s candidate, the -year old finished in a humiliating fth place. “I’m not going to sugarcoat it. We took a gut punch,” Biden declared after the disastrous result. One commentator on the news outlet CNBC was even more scathing: “His presidential hopes are finished.”Yet today, Biden stands on the threshold of the Oval Office. Victory is in his grasp. Having clawed his way back into the primaries and won the Democratic nomination to challenge Donald Trump, he could soon be the most powerful man on Earth. It is certainly his fight to lose. Some nationwide opinion polls put him no less than  points ahead of Trump, whose popularity has taken a battering because of the coronavirus crisis and the consequent economic recession. This week’s Democratic convention, including his own powerful, well-crafted speech last night, will have done nothing to undermine his lead.But with some worrying signs of mental decline, Bidens coronation could mean the reigns of power are actually handed to the hardline leftists around him - rather than to the ageing politician himself.What makes Biden’s comeback all the more remarkable is that his two previous attempts to reach the White House failed so miserably. In  his campaign fell apart after he was exposed plagiarising one of the speeches made by Neil Kinnock during the British General Election the previous year. Some of the passages were lted almost word for word. “Why am I the first Kinnock in a thousand generations to be able to go to university ” asked the Labour Leader.“Why is Joe Biden the first in his family ever to go to university ” asked the Democratic Senator. It does not say much for either Biden’s creativity or his judgement that he had to seek secret inspiration from a socialist mediocrity widely known at Westminster as the Welsh Windbag.In  Biden did even worse, dropping out after a woeful performance in the Iowa Caucuses, where he gained just one per cent of the total vote. During the campaign, he regularly put his foot in his mouth, most notoriously when he described his rival Barack Obama as “the first African-American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy”.This year, after Iowa, his chances seemed to be heading in the same sorry direction.But then, in the following months, he gradually emerged as the front-runner. This was mainly because the other leading candidates were seen as either too extreme or too unlikeable. Senator Elizabeth Warren was a hard advocate of toxic identity politics who unconvincingly claimed to have Native American blood. Bernie Sanders was North America’s answer to Jeremy Corbyn, complete with revolutionary economics and brutish tax plans. Peter Buttigieg was a sanctimonious mayor of a small city in Indiana, without any experience of the national stage.In contrast, Biden had not only been a Delaware senator for  years, but had also served as Vice-President throughout Obama’s time in the White House. Through these roles, he had built up a reputation as a moderate, helped by his image as an ordinary, down-to-earth guy rather than a member of the Washington elite.The son of a used car salesman, he was born in Scranton, Pennsylvania, the place where the US version of Ricky Gervais’s comedy The Office was set. His popular appeal was further enhanced by his personal story of having to cope with agonising grief, which he spelt out in raw, emotive terms last night.The catalogue of anguish includes the loss of his first we and daughter, killed in a car accident in  and the death of his son Beau from brain cancer in . Yet none of this can hide a disturbing reality about Biden, one that makes him profoundly unsuited to be the leader of the free world or the commander-in-chief of the US military.It is something that the Democrats have desperately tried to downplay, along with much of the media. But, the fact is that Joe Biden is in steep mental decline. Already by far the oldest Presidential candidate in history, he shows all the signs of advancing senility. He might be able to read effective from an autocue, as he showed last night, but in other settings, away from the podium, he regularly stumbles over his words, confuses facts, loses his train of thought, and lapses into coherence. His supporters say that he has always been “gaffe-prone” and that is true, but the problem goes much deeper. In the past, Biden could be sharp, even witty, as he showed in his triumphant  Vice-Presidential debate against the Republican Paul Ryan.Today, when speaking off the cuff, he struggles to string basic sentences together.Without the help of a teleprompter, this is a man who mixes up his we and sister, gets the names of countries wrong, and keeps repeating the same phrases. In one bizarre outburst in Iowa, he called a female reporter “a lying, dog-faced pony soldier”. In another contribution, he declared that he will “choose truth over facts”. With a delusional grasp of arithmetic, he has said that million women will be put back to work by his tax credit plan, that million Americans have been killed by guns since , and that million have died from Covid-. That is why, throughout the campaign, his minders have tried to keep him in his Delaware home, almost like a hostage. Major interviews have been banned, public appearances strictly rationed. It is a strategy that his team cynically justy by claiming that they want to protect the -year-old candidate from Covid-. But the determination to shield the potential next President from any accountability makes a mockery of democracy.It might seem bizarre that the Democratic party should march under the tattered standard of such a weakened general. But from the viewpoint of political operators on the left, his decline actually makes him an ideal candidate.His senility might have to be concealed from the public, but it can be ruthlessly exploited in private. Broken and bewildered, Biden is a puppet whose strings can easily be pulled by his hidden masters. Behind the thin veneer of his supposed moderation, the radicals can seize power and enact their hardline policies, like defunding the police, imposing financial reparations for slavery, rewriting American history, confiscating wealth, promoting transgender ideology, extending public ownership, and widening the scope of affirmative action. Precisely because he is now an empty vessel, a Biden Presidency would mean the ruthless enforcement of woke dogma. In fact, its unlikely that he will last a full four-year term. Therefore his Vice President Kamala Harris, an ambitious operator can start preparing for her reign.But perhaps she should not be too hasty. The Democrats’ opportunism could backfire badlyvoters become alienated by the idea of an enfeebled President.After all, the American political structure – in contrast to our Parliamentary system – is built on the concept of a strong executive headed by a powerful, elected head of state. Already Trump, never one to pull his punches, is running adverts that highlight concerns about the “cognitive decline” of “Sleepy Joe”. The commercials seem to be having an impact. Almost  per cent of Americans do not think that Biden will serve a full term, while other polls show the race narrowing. Trump could also be boosted by revulsion at the radical Democrats’ agenda, especially the collusion with urban violence.In  widespread unrest fuelled by the civil rights movement enabled the Republican Richard Nixon to defeat the Democrats under Hubert Humphrey. Famously, Nixon said that the “silent majority”, ignored by the media, had spoken. Today the same public mood could give Trump a second term.It would be no more than the Democrats deserve for their eagerness to hide the real Joe Biden.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Government has scrapped caps on student numbers but many universities are still grappling with finding enough space for the number of kids who met the terms of their offers. Universities admissions body UCAS found that an extra , students now have the grades to get into their first choice uni.Ms Donelan said in a letter to vice-chancellors: “Where possible, try to prioritise those from disadvantaged backgrounds for admission this year.”The failed algorithm for deciding A-level grades was ditched earlier this week in a massive Government U-turn, meaning more students met their university offers. But universities are concerned about litigious middle-class parents who might take up legal actiontheir kids dont get a place and have to take a gap year, according to The Times.Watchdog The Office for Students has backed the move to give priority to poorer school leavers. Chief exec Nicola Dandrige said:“While it is for universities to make inidual admissions decisions, students from disadvantaged backgrounds must not be allowed to slip through the net as admissions decisions are made.”But one admissions head has said universities may not follow the instruction, which does not set out how disadvantaged should be defined. There is a range of criteria normally relied on to decide who is from a deprived background - including those who lived in particular areas or attended schools where fewer people go onto higher education, as well as those from low-income families or ethnic minority backgrounds.The admissions head said: “In hard choices like these they would normally look at GCSE grades or parts of the personal statement. “I fear that many may already feel they have met their targets for disadvantaged children getting into university this year so have done enough.”Head of the Higher Education Policy Institute Nick Hillman, said it was not a simple decision. He said “If I was a vice-chancellor, or running admissions, I would worry that the wording is open to all sorts of challenges, even legal ones.“Do they have sufficiently robust information to make that fine judgment  Is it based on parents’ salaries, or ethnicity, or other characteristics  It is open to interpretation. How do you satisfy this without opening yourself up to potential legal challenges  No one is against giving an extra leg-up to people from very under-represented groups but there are a lot of litigious middle-class families out there and schools are very keen to ensure their progression rates are good this year.”Head of UCAS, Clare Marchant told BBC Radio  it was the right thing to do to prioritise poorer kids who are less likely to be able to take a gap year. She said: “I think it is absolutely the right intention. I think we know from all of our survey work that those from most disadvantaged backgrounds really, really worry about money. And sothey are deferred for a year, or asked to defer for a year, we’re likely to see a drop-off. And so that’s the real intent behind that.She added: “I think what I would say is that universities are very inidual, they make inidual decisions, but all of them, having spoke to a number of them at Universities UK over the course of the last days and weeks, are looking to be as super flexible — they want students to come to them.”The Office for Students is fighting off demands from campaigners that disadvantaged children should be given compensationthey have to take a gap year. Durham University has gone a step further to free up places and tried to convinced students to take a gap year by offering them a bursary.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Recent changes in transmission are not yet fully reflected in these estimates because the data used to calculate R and growth rate reflect the situation from a few weeks ago. It is also important to recognise that these are estimates, and there is a high degree of uncertainty with them. They added: For this reason, Sage does not have confidence that R is currently below  in England. We would expect to see this change in transmission reflected in the R and growth rate published over the next few weeks as we gain more certainty of what is currently happening.Meanwhile, experts have issued caution over the accuracy of the R rate estimate when cases are so few.Prof Keith Neal said that local Covid clusters can also push the R rate up for an entire region when it may just be one small area.The epidemiologist at the University of Nottingham said: “Making estimates of R with small number of cases becomes increasingly dficult and inaccurate.  Hence the wide range of the estimates.It comes as the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics published today suggests that new coronavirus infections have levelled off.An average of , people per day in private households in England were estimated to be newly infected with Covid- between August  and .This is lower than the previous estimate of , new infections per day for the period August  to .However the ONS said there is not yet enough evidence to say for definite that there has been a fall in new infections in the most recent week, and therefore we continue to report that the incidence rate for England has levelled off.A Government spokesperson said: The very slight movement in the R number reinforces the importance for all of us of staying alert to control the virus and save lives.“But the number is an estimate with a high degree of uncertainty due to areas with lower case numbers or iabilities across the UK. It is only one indicator of how the UK is faring – ONS statistics also published today suggest that infections have levelled off.“We are in a far better position to deal with this virus than at the start of the pandemic but to continue to keep us all safe we must remember to wash our hands, cover our faces, keep our distance and get a testwe have symptoms, so that NHS Test and Trace can keep the virus under control.Earlier today, an intensive care specialist said that he is seeing fewer patients needing critical care for Covid-.Dr Ron Daniels, a consultant in the West Midlands, suggested it could be because those who are most vulnerable to the disease have already died, while a spike in Covid cases could be among young people going out more.He told BBC Radio s Today Programme: I think there are considerations around the positivity rates, but were not looking at the case fatality rates and we’re not looking at hospital admissions.Weve seen cases go up since the beginning of July, and still our hospitals are relatively empty of patients with this condition. We’re seeing very few patients admitted to hospital, let alone requiring intensive care.Experts say that the rise in the R rate is to be expected as the country eases out of lockdown - and warn that the virus is still spreading.Dr Yuliya Kyrychko, a mathematician at the University of Sussex, said: “The latest estimates of R number appear to indicate that in all regions of England, the estimates of R number have either remained the same or have grown in the space of one week. Most worrying about this is the possibility that in several regions, including London, South West and North West, the R number exceeds , suggesting a possibility of a substantial growth in new infections in these regions in the near future. With ONS data estimating around , new infections in England and Wales in the week - August, this means that the infection is still very prevalent across all of the UK, hence it is of paramount importance that people continue to follow the guidance on protection and social distancing to prevent major local outbreaks.The list is based on the percentage of the population with symptomatic Covid- from data submitted by more than . million app users in the UK.Here is this weeks full list...These latest figures were based on the data from , swab tests done between August  to August . Dr Michael Head, a senior researcher in global health at the University of Southampton, said: “We are seeing increases in new daily cases, and now we have an R number estimate that is approximately at the . threshold. The data suggests that as people mix more freely, there are probably increases in community transmission. This is to be expected, but highlights the problems in coming out of lockdown, particularly when there are many thousands of active cases in a population.Suppressing COVID- is extremely dficult. We know that most cases are transmitted within the indoor environment.It’s currently August, and so outdoor meetings are possible, but as we head towards the winter, fewer people will be inclined to meet outside. That raises dficult questions about how best to handle social contacts across the winter months, particularly with the increased potential for transmission from younger populations, who usually have relatively mild cases, on to vulnerable populations where the consequences can be more serious.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Politicians have repeatedly let us down, their lack of clarity is baffling and there still appears to be no coherent plan.I’ve watched as people cared for the sick and mourned their dead, and at times, like many of you, I’ve been overwhelmed by dread.Then I look at my friend and colleague Kate Garraway, who has had to bear the burden of her husband Derek being ambushed by Covid- in April.Kate has been extraordinary, which is why I am furious with those who have criticised her for ing to work, when they have absolutely no idea of what she has been going through. She has decided to step back from GMB for a while to concentrate on Derek and their children and those who have criticised her should be ashamed of themselves for making things even more dficult for the whole family. Derek may now be free of the virus but the after-effects have been catastrophic.The poor man has been in an induced coma, and although now more aware of his surroundings, he is still extremely ill.Kate’s mantra “where there is le, there’s hope”, has kept her going, and I reckon on some level Derek is aware of how much she and their children, Darcy, , and -year-old Billy are willing him to make a recovery.Kate has been astonishingly brave and positive throughout this whole ordeal, although she was tearful this week when talking about Derek’s recent birthday. His family sang Happy Birthday to him via Facebook, which must have been bittersweet for all of them.She has had to maintain a brave face for her children and give them some sort of stability for the past five months.To try to further give their lives a bit more normality, Kate went back to work last month.In fact, she was actively encouraged to do so by doctors who felt it was essential for her wellbeing, and frankly, she has to make a living because she has two children to take care of.I know coming back to presenting duties on Good Morning Britain wasn’t easy for Kate, and there have been a few wobbles when she has given updates on how Derek is doing, but all of us are so proud of the way she has coped.That’s why the nasty, malicious carping from moronic trolls is so upsetting. How dare they have a go at Kate for hosting the show and having the “audacity” to smile and laugh at funny items with her co-hosts. It’s sickening, and no matter how much anyone tries to ignore such malevolent cretins, Kate will have been deeply hurt.I had a horrible feeling this might happen, but thankfully the vast majority of viewers wish her nothing but the best, and would be overjoyed to see Derek on the road to recovery. All of us admire Kate’s courage and honesty and know that even in the darkest of times, it’s vital to hang on to positivity and yes, to even have a giggle at something silly or absurd.Watching their mum back on TV gave much needed routine and stability to Darcy and Billy, especially seeing her smile and having fun. They knew it didn’t mean she is not worried sick about their dad, but were well aware he would want her to continue working and providing for the family.As a journalist, Kate has amassed so much knowledge about Covid- and she has also been tested to her very limits.Typically, she wants to pass on that knowledge to help others and is planning to write a book about her experiences and what she has learned during this tough time. It was always her plan to do a self-help book and she had begun it before the pandemic, but now her wise words will be even more relevant and helpful than ever. I can’t wait for the day when Derek is back home, growing stronger every day and the whole family is finally reunited, and I hope she is back at work with us very soon.Happy Birthday Madonna –  years old, mad as a box of frogs but looking utterly radiant surrounded by her children at a party in Jamaica.She can be infuriating and even downright bonkersbut there’s no one quite like her.She’s a trailblazer, was always a staunch ally for the LGBT community before it was trendy and has always paddled her own canoe.Long may Her Madge continue to reign, especially as right now we need some light relief wherever we can get it. I’M not in the least bit surprised that “dad bods” have become so popular among women of all ages. These are the bodies belonging to men who proudly show off rather cute little pot bellies and love handles.Becoming softer round the edges usually happens to blokes after the birth of a couple of kids, when they start to comfort eat due to lack of sleep and stop being obsessed with going to the gym.These boys trade top-of-the-range bikes and tight Lyrca cycling gear for comfy joggers while pushing a pram, and are all the better for it.Having a dad bod is also seen as a sign of confidence, being happy in your own skin and showing that you enjoy le and that having a weekend pizza and a couple of beers is more than OK.I reckon there’s nothing more off-putting than a man with a ripped six-pack who is no stranger to the mirror and exists on steroids and just steamed vegetables.They are usually dull, self-obsessed and not in the least bit alluring.Dad bods are far less intimidating and much more fun to cuddle. Like a lot of men, famous stars including Leonardo DiCaprio and Zac Efron have developed the Dad Bod during lockdown and have been roundly showing off their new physiques.I think they are far more sexy and desirable than when their cheekbones could cut through a home-made loaf. You have to get the balance right, though. When it tips over into a very large balcony hanging over “the nursery” then that’s no longer a Dad Bod but just a big old beer gut and it shows a man who has simply given up and is on a fast track to obesity and a heart attack. BRITNEY Spears is a grown-up woman with two teenage sons, a hugely successful music career and an adoring fan base. But the -year-old has less freedom than an impoverished girl in a Jane Austen novel.Since her much-publicised meltdown in  – when she went into a beauty salon and shaved her head, looking like a little lost deer caught in the headlights – Britney has had very little control over her le.Her father Jamie has legal “conservatorship” over his daughter, basically deciding where and how she lives her le and conducts her career. He also keeps hold of the purse strings.Last year he stepped away from the role, citing health problems of his own . . . and Britney doesn’t want him back.Thirteen years ago she was clearly suffering with mental health issues and needed her father’s help.But now Britney understandably wants control of her own destiny.This week she decided to fight back and took to the courts to have her human rights and civil liberties restored.But her bid was unsuccessful and she will need to wait until February  before taking further action.She is a fragile woman and obviously needs support. But looking at it from the outside, the kind of control her father exerts over Britney’s le seems way too much.Surely some kind of compromise can be reached, with the situation regularly revised to ensure Britney isn’t left feeling trapped like a songbird in a very gilded cage.I SIMPLY cannot begin to imagine the pain actor John Michie and his family are going through right now.This week, the man who supplied the drugs that killed John’s daughter in  had his manslaughter conviction quashed.Louella Fletcher-Michie had gone to a music festival with her boyfriend, Ceon Broughton, who gave her the hallucinogenic C-P drug and filmed her tripping for hours. Belatedly realising she was in real trouble and crying for her mum, he phoned her family. They rushed to the scene but were too late to save her. Crucially, he did not at any point take her to a medical tent or seek expert help.This week a High Court judge decided that evenhe had called for paramedics, it was not clear Louella would have survived – so Broughton’s appeal against his sentence of eight and a half years was upheld. Broughton has to live with his actions but not from behind bars.Meanwhile, John and his family – who have maintained a dignied silence through the most recent twist of the kne in their tragedy – continue to mourn their lost Louella.For them, it is a le sentence of heartbreak and pain.JUST when you thought reality telly’s Below Deck couldn’t get any better, they go and set a whole series in Tahiti.There are all the usual shenanigans. Entitled and demanding guests, the crew squabbling one minute and at it like rabbits the next and Captain Lee sailing above it all while coming out with hilarious one liners like: “I’m madder than a p***ed-on chicken”, which I plan to use as often as possible in my daily le.Meanwhile, all the action takes place amid the amazing sunrises and stunning sunsets of the South Pacic.It’s no exaggeration to say that this utterly ludicrous, vacuous and extremely daft series has kept me sane during these scary times.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We stutter.”Video of the inspiring two-minute speech has obtained more than .million views on Twitter.The courageous boy added: It was really amazing to hear that someone like me would become vice president.He told me about a book of poems by Yeats he would read out loud to practice.He showed me how he marks his addresses to make them easier to say out loud. So I did the same thing today.Brayden praised Biden for making him feel better about his speech disorder.He told his audience: “I’m just trying to be a kid. And in a short amount of time, Joe Biden made me feel more confident about something that’s bothered me my whole le.Joe Biden cared. Imagine what he could do for all of us.“Kids like me are counting on you to elect someone we can all look up to.Braydens speech prompted widespread support from social media users.Pam Keith, a Florida Dem nominee, tweeted: I want to say this to Brayden Harrington .Young, Sir: You humble me. I am in TOTAL AWE of your courage. You have a titanic spirit and unshakeable will.You made the worst bully look pathetic, ridiculous and so very small. I salute you.Another Twitter user wrote: I’m an adult who gets nervous talking to a group of  people I know. Brayden Harrington is a  year old struggling with a stutter who spoke to millions of people.I can’t even comprehend that kind of courage.Journalist Dan Rather wrote to Twitter: Brayden Harrington, the -year-old boy with a stutter.Pure, unnished, courage.Last year, Biden opened up about his lelong struggle with a speech problem.His reveal came after Donald Trumps former press secretary appeared to mock him for stuttering.Sarah Huckabee Sanders faced backlash after posting about the former US Vice Presidents delivery during Thursdays Democratic debate.In a since-deleted tweet, Sanders wrote: “I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I hhhave absolutely no idea what Biden is talking about,” as the debate was wrapping up.Biden had been discussing children who suffer from speech impediments when he made the stumble.He later took to social media to talk about his battle with the speech disorder.Biden tweeted: I’ve worked my whole le to overcome a stutter. And it’s my great honor to mentor kids who have experienced the same. It’s called empathy. Look it up.Stuttering and stammering - both considered the same thing - refers to a relatively common speech problem in childhood which can persist into adulthood.A stutter can present itself in a few ways it can cause the person to repeat syllables, make words sound much longer or sometimes words can get stuck and not come out at all.It can y in its severity in dferent people, some who are barely affected at all while others can find the condition debilitating.It’s hard to say what causes children to start stammering but the NHS reassures parents that it won’t be caused by anything they have done.ltgtAccording to the National Institute on Deafness and Other Common Disorders, approximately three million Americans stutter.The NIDOCD explains: Stuttering affects people of all ages. It occurs most often in children between the ages of  and  as they are developing their language skills. Approximately  to  percent of all children will stutter for some period in their le, lasting from a few weeks to several years.Most children outgrow stuttering. Approximately  percent of children recover from stuttering. For the remaining  percent who continue to stutter, stuttering can persist as a lelong communication disorder.They add that the development of speech is complicated and depends on many factors and that problems can occur when parts of this developing system aren’t quite coordinated.There are two types of stuttering, developmental and neurogenic.Developmental stuttering is the most common type and occurs in young children while they are still learning how to talk.Neurogenic stuttering is the type that could show up in the aftermath of astroke, head trauma, or other type of brain injury, according to the NIDCD.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I co-hosted with the brilliant Jayde Adams, we had turns from Kerry Godliman, Shappi Khorsandi, Nathan Caton and Ed Gamble, and video messages from Aisling Bea and Nish Kumar, audiences watching on Zoom — something no one had ever imagined five months ago — on Facebook, and on Twitch, which I had assumed was an app for people in their twenties to chat each other up and worse.It was a brilliant night and the absolute kicker was that we had people in the room with us laughing .They were told not to overdo it for fear of aerosol transmission, but by God it felt good to have a real flesh-and-blood audience in front of me.Because here’s the thing about stand-up comics — they need an audience the way fish need water or Gavin Williamson needs chaos.But what we’ve discovered over the past couple of months, via these streamed gigs and now via gigs like the one I did on Sunday afternoon, in a car park under a gazebo, is that audiences seem to need stand-up too.It’s incredibly flattering, even for an old stager like me. On Sunday I played to  people prepared to ignore what the weather app on their phone might be saying, bring their camping chairs and sit in a car park in Tring, Herts.The comedians all seemed to savour every second of being on stage, of the delicious business of strangers laughing at their jokes together and sharing a mo-ment, a communal moment that means a lot after all these long months of doing what we’ve been asked and staying apart.Psychologically, what that might say about comedians is maybe not the thing we want to dwell on, what sort of wreck would need the laugh-ter of strangers to get them through the day  Move on!But this weekend’s gigs and the ones now springing up all over the country show that we all need the laughs it seems, the audiences too, and that nothing beats seeing it live, right there in front of you. And we can hear the laughs through the masks, don’t worry. There are more and more gigs springing up now, promoters and venues are innovating like mad, councils are doing everything they can to help get things off the ground.Some of these shows are outdoors, weather permitting affairs, some of them are under marquees and the like. Theatres are just getting going with shows with reduced capacity — at some places they’ll take your temperature on the way in, but it’s worth it for the laughs.Listings are popping up all over social media — you’ll find something near you. Don’t miss out. The shows that have been put together so far have been unforgettable and,nothing ,and when theatres do get up and running again, you can say: “Remember the time we saw this comic in a car park ”There’s something pretty exciting about seeing someone you’d have to go to an arena to see playing in a pub garden, too. Andit rains, well, stf upper lip and a good raincoat should get you through that. Hand on heart, the threat to our business is really worrying, like it is to any other right now, becausethe clubs close they will cut off the chance for new comics to get their acts together — literally — and for the new talent to come through. It’s all right for the likes of me, but the people who were set on going to the Edinburgh Fringe this summer — an event that has produced a ton of the funny people you might be familiar with — won’t get the chance for this year to be their year. Everyone has to start somewhere, andthe venues die, the whole thing dies.And that’s why it has been so amazing to see stuff being put on all over, in courtyards, pub gardens, car parks — even the biggest names can be seen doing their thing under an awning or gazebo — the audiences totally up for it and loving every moment. Because stand-up, like le, will find a way. And Jeff Goldblum knows, he used to do a bit of stand-up.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But many forces do not publish data for misconduct.One recently retired officer said: “Until all our police forces come out and provide figures the public will believe we are happier hiding the reality of police corruption than dealing with it.“No wonder shows like Line Of Duty are so popular. We should be using its success to encourage more openness.But instead, many forces are battening down the hatches, trying to push the subject off the public agenda.”As fans hang on for season six of the hit drama — and catch up with re-runs — here are some cases of police corruption where real le was stranger than fiction.IN Line Of Duty, “H” is the codename for a senior officer, or possibly a group of officers, who control bent coppers on behalf of an organised crime gang.Real-le corruption has reached the upper ranks of the police also.Met Commander Ali Dizaei was jailed in  for perverting the course of justice, using his position to frame a man.He became the most senior copper in  years to be given a prison sentence.That represented a spectacular fall from grace for a man who had been in charge of , officers across West London.A few years ago, I tracked him down and persuaded Dizaei to meet me. He insisted HE had been framed by corrupt, racist officers afraid he would spill the beans.It was hard to work out whether this was a smokescreen orhe really had been caught up in something so toxic it had cost him his career.CAREER-crook Hunter, played by Brian McCardie, spread murder and mayhem through Line Of Duty’s anti-corruption unit AC-.But his crimes pale beside those of real-le bank robber and cocaine baron Mickey Green, who had close links with corrupt police here and in Western Europe in the Eighties and Nineties.The West Londoner employed a stable of bent coppers to stay one step ahead of the law. It is alleged he got corrupt detectives to frame his criminal rivals too.Green is believed to have bribed his way out of a drug-smuggling charge in Spain. He already had links to Italian Mafia and Colombian drug cartels, pulling off huge cocaine deals with the world’s most dangerous drug baron, Pablo Escobar.One ex-detective believes Green had enough evidence of corruption to bring down many senior officers in the South East, making him untouchable.IN series three, DC Arnott Martin Compston is accused of being the gangland informant and corrupt cop known as “The Caddy”.Arnott also finds himself framed for the murder of Lindsay Denton.In real le, officers working to expose corruption risk facing trumped-up charges because they are considered “rats” by colleagues. . . sometimes even including law-abiding officers.They know these allegations come with the territory.One of my sources told me that, in the summer of , an anti-corruption officer on one force was accused of sexually abusing his niece.It later emerged she had been pressured by criminals to make the complaint.The case was dropped when the niece withdrew her statement to police.That came after her father was recorded referring to the accusations as . The father later admitted he had convinced her the abuse had taken place.“That manshould have been prosecuted, at the very least, for wasting police time,” the same detective believed.“But the officer in question begged his superiors to drop everything – all for the sake of his family.”The officer never recovered from the ordeal and was eventually moved from the anti-corruption unit to a desk job.The same detective added: “He split up with his we and his kids can’t get what he was accused of out of their heads. Poor b*****d.”ZEALOUS Ted Hastings Adrian Dunbar heads up Line Of Duty’s AC- unit.I have encountered a handful of Hastings types over the years but one stands out.I first met “Bfo” in the mid-Seventies, when he was chief of detectives at a suburban police station and I was training as a journalist.Bfo wore his heart on his sleeve, was softly spoken, respectful to women and prepared to talk over a pint with the “enemy”, as journalists were considered by police at the time. There is no way Bfo was on the take. Like Hastings, he earned incredible loyalty from his detectives as he was ready to put himself on the line for them.Bfo later headed an anti-corruption unit in a notorious period in police history.“No one  wanted the f***ing job,” he told me. “But I saw it as a challenge and I knew the bosses would keep well away from me. Most of them hated my guts and wanted me to screw it up.”Like Hastings, Bfo was brilliant at getting inside the heads of his colleagues.“I know instinctively when something’s wrong,” he said. “I don’t get angry with people who lie to me. I keep it gentle, low-key.“Then they usually tell me the truth. You can’t run an anti-corruption unit on fear. You need to pull togetheryou’re to smoke out the bad apples.“I can see a lot of me in Hastings. But he needs to watch his back. He’ll be sacricedhis superiors get twitchy.”A FORMER policeman I have known for more than  years, nicknamed “The Grinder”, makes Line Of Duty’s corrupt John Corbett – played with such force by Stephen Graham – appear relatively harmless.Grinder has always claimed he is NOT corrupt and that he was only labelled as such by scheming colleagues.That came after he infiltrated a gang of renegade crooked officers in a bid to help his superiors bring them to justice.Instead, those officers claimed HE was the corrupt one. Most of that group took early retirement before any charges were brought, so it is impossible to know for sure who was telling the truth.When I visited Grinder at his villa last year, I could immediately see that he had earned a lot more money over the course of his career than most ordinary police officers could claim to.Behind the wrought-iron gates was a substantial property with a long driveway, swimming pool and tennis court.There were CCTV cameras dotted around, while two rottweiler guard dogs bounded out of the back door.Grinder, now in his seventies, said: “I don’t deny I had to pull a few stunts back then.“But I wasn’t a bent copper like they all tried to make out.“The ‘rules’ of the game were very dferent back then.“You had to do certain things in order to put the bad guys away.”A GANG similar to Line Of Duty’s Organised Crime Group was led by Liverpool hood Curtis “Cocky” Warren.After being acquitted of drugs charges in , Warren crowed at customs officials: “I’m off to spend my £million from the first shipment and you can’t f***ing touch me!”Having police on the payroll was crucial to his criminal empire. Among them was Elmore Davies, a senior copper with Merseyside Police who was jailed for trying to get one of Cocky’s acquaintances off a firearms charge. Cocky also used corrupt officers to help him land huge shipments of cocaine from Colombia.A former Liverpool detective said: “Cocky made sure a lot of his bent coppers joined him on actual dealings with the Colombians. That meant they couldn’t wriggle out of involvement. They were completely incriminated, just the way Cocky wanted.”Warren was jailed in  and is still behind bars.Some in the Liverpool underworld fear his eventual release will spark a gang war with corrupt police at its heart.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And while many will be excited to see friends and learn again, some parents might be anxious about what it all entails. Englandaposs schools have officially been told the raft of changes theyaposll have to make when they reopen to all children in September. So what will class rooms look like, and can you keep your daughter or son offyou donapost think it will be safe  Here is what you need to know     Will schools reopen in September in the UK  In all likelihood - yes or certainly the vast majority of them.In August, Boris Johnson said it was a moral imperative to get children back into the classroom.But after months of time out of the classroom, and with Covid- still circulating it will take a lot of effort to make that promise a reality. In July, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson announced Governmentaposs plan to send all pupils back to school in September. But it isnapost impossible to rule out local lockdowns perhaps leading to some areas having dferent rules. Did some pupils already go back  Before the summer break some children already went back to the classroom. Primary schools and nurseries began to reopen on June  for children in reception, Years  and  and in nursery. Secondary schools, sixth forms and colleges opened for face-to-face contact from June  for students who were then in year  and  - and facing exams next summer.  When are schools supposed to go back  Schools are supposed to go back in the first week of September. Some schools will go back earlier as their summer holidays end in August, such as in Leicester and Scotland. Do I have to send my son or daughter back to school  All children will be required to be back at school - meaning parents could face finesthey keep them at home. The guidance says it is vital for all children toto school to minimise as far as possible the longer-term impact of the pandemic on children’s education, wellbeing and wider development. With theto mandatory attendance, local authorities can fine parentstheir child misses school.  Could pubs and restaurants be forced to close  There has been no official announcement on this but Chris Whitty, the Chief Medical Officer for England, has warned that for any more relaxation of lockdown we would need to reintroduce some restrictions to balance it out. Professor Whitty said getting children back into the classroom is pivotal for the wellbeing of our country but that relaxing the rules further would absolutely, inevitably lead to a surge in infections. He warned we had probably reached the near limits of what can be reopened. Anne Longfield, the children’s commissioner for England, had said the reopening of schools should be prioritised, insisting they must be first to reopen and last to closeany restrictions were reintroduced. How will children be kept safe and what will the classroom look like  Schools are being told to keep classes or year groups apart as much as possible to prevent the virus spreading. This means limits on mixing in hallways and a ban on assemblies, collective worship and choirs - as there is an increased risk of infection from singing and shouting. Break times and lunch could be staggered to keep children apart. Social distancing should be maintained, although the guidance accepts that teachers may not always be able to stay two metres apart from pupils. Classrooms should have forward-facing desks to limit the spread of the virus and windows and doors should be opened where possible to improve ventilation. Strict cleaning measures should be in place along with access to handwashing facilities and sanitiser for pupils.  What happensthere is an outbreak Schools will have to declare an outbreakthey have more than two coronavirus cases in two weeks or there has been a surge in pupils taking sick days where they might have coronavirus.Mobile testing units can be sent to schools to stem the spread of the virus.

It was due to end in England and Wales on Monday. Mr Starmer welcomed the extension, but said it should be extended further.He said: The government’s eleventh hour u-turn on the evictions ban was necessary - but such a brief extension risks offering only short-lived relief to tenants.The ban must not be lted until the Government has a credible plan to ensure that no-one loses their home due to Covid. The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government has now confirmed the four-week extension. But Sir Terence Etherton, Master of the Rolls - Englandaposs second most senior judge - confirmed the extension in a letter this afternoon. He said Justice Secretary Robert Buckland had written to him yesterday to confirm the extension. He wrote: The CPRCmet earlier today. It considered the extremely unusual nature and timing of the letter of direction from the Lord Chancellor but by majority considered that it was bound to follow the direction. He aded: This -week extension to the stay relating to housing possession cases, will allow for further work to be done to prepare for the stay to be lted which in many respects can be welcomed. The Housing Law Practitioners Association also said it had been confirmed to them, tweeting: We have now had official confirmation that the stay on possession proceedings will be extended to  September. Earlier, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps hinted a u-turn was on the cards. He told LBC radio: I know that getting that balance right between the renters and the landlords is something that my colleagues in the housing ministry are working closely on, and I think they will make further announcements about it shortly, which Iaposm not privy to right now.Polly Neate, chief executive of Shelter, said:   “The government has today recognised the very real danger that tens of thousands of renters are in. It is right for the government not to lt the ban when it risks exposing people to eviction and the threat of homelessness with no means of defence. “The government must use this short window of time wisely to put proper safeguards in place for renters. People are still falling behind on their rent – , private tenants since March - leaving them vulnerable when the ban does end. And we all know even more economic storm clouds are gathering. “A bullet may have been dodged with this extension, but as soon as Parliament s, it must give judges extra powers to stop renters being evicted because of ‘Covid-arrears’.   Facing eviction this Christmas, is not a present anybody wants.” But the National Residential Landlords Association did not welcome the news.  Ben Beadle, CEO of the National Residential Landlords Association has said:“A blanket extension is unacceptable, especially so close to the deadline.   “An enormous amount of work as gone into finding a balance between supporting tenants who have been affected by the pandemic and preventing signicant financial harm to landlords, in accordance with the Government’s promise. This announcement satisfies no-one.  “Landlords have been left powerless in exercising their legal right to deal with signicant arrears unrelated to Covid-, antisocial behaviour and extremely disruptive tenants who make le miserable for their neighbours and housemates.   “Private landlords cannot be expected to foot the bill for government failure. There must now be a plan to support households to pay their bills and to compensate landlords fully for their lost income.  “Only this will give both tenants and landlords security and reduce the risk of widespread tenancy failure.” "},{"url":null,"title":"michael goves department alone spent","story":"NewsMichael Goves department alone spent £m on consultants and marketing during Covid- crisisEXCLUSIVE: The Mirror found a string of government contracts signed by the Cabinet Office for \"consultancy services\", \"intelligence\" and \"media analysis\" related to the Covid- epidemic from May to August ShareCommentsByMikey SmithPolitical Correspondent:,  AUG Updated:,  AUG News \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Many deals were handed out without any competition, under urgent procurement arrangements to react to the pandemic. London-based start up Signal AI was paid almost £, to perform media analysis on the Governmentaposs Covid- communications, while accountancy giant Deloitte was paid £ million for urgent consultancy services. Another urgent contract saw the taxpayer fund a £, survey of the people of Tunisia about their attitudes to the coronavirus pandemic. A Cabinet Office spokesperson said: As part of the British Embassyaposs work in Tunisia small scale research was commissioned into attitudes and behaviours to COVID- to inform the Tunisian Governmentaposs public health communications.

US firm Efficio was paid £, to give advice on the provision of consultation for the effective management structure operating model of a large, complex Covid- contract. Rachel Reeves, Labouraposs Shadow Cabinet Office Minister said: Spending millions on media work won’t make up for political incompetence or mixed messages from ministers.No amount of spending on public relations will undo the damage Dominic Cummings did by challenging the sense we were all making sacrices together.All too often the Government’s approach to procurement has been shambolic or questionable in its decisions and so we need more robust checks and balances put in place. Another contract was handed to Tussell Ltd, a firm owned by Angus Tugendhat, the cousin of Tory MP Tom Tugendhat, and former Tory minister and peer Lord David Young. They were paid £, for an analysis of Government contracts handed out in relation to Covid-. The firm has a system which aggregates contracts and invoices from multiple data sources across government and provides analysis of spending by all departments. Mr Tugendhat told the Mirror his cousin had no input into the business. He added that the contract had been awarded directly because his firm offered a service the Government needed, and no other company could provide.  It was revealed earlier this month that Topham Guerin, the firm of political campaigners behind the Toriesapos  digital campaign strategy, were handed £m without competition for campaign coordination services.The firm is understood to have been behind the decision to rebrand the partyaposs Twitter account as a fake fact checking service during election debates.

There were , extractions of multiple teeth in under-s in England in   – costing £.million, according to latest NHS spending figures uncovered by the Local Government Association. That works out at  per working day – a rise of % compared with the , extractions carried out in  , which cost £.million. Town hall leaders and dentists said the shocking numbers highlighted the dangers of too much sugary food and drink in youngsters’ diets, as well as poor oral hygiene.They fear the situation is likely to have worsened during the coronavirus lockdown when children were stuck indoors. British Dental Association chairman Mick Armstrong said: “Itaposs inevitable these figures will go from bad to worse, as lockdown diets, the suspension of public health programmes and the collapse in access take their toll. “Government cannot remain a passive observer. Any retreat from public health activity will hit England’s most deprived communities. “Ministers must ensure the prevention agenda does not become another casualty of this pandemic.” The LGA’s Community Wellbeing Board chairman Ian Hudspeth said: “These latest figures demonstrate the damage which can be done to young people’s teeth through too much sugar intake. “The fact that, due to the severity of the decay,  operations a day to remove multiple teeth in children and teenagers have to be done in a hospital is concerning and also adds to current pressures on the NHS. “We need to do all we can to reduce how much sugar our children eat and drink, including investing in oral health education so that everyone understands the impact of sugar on teeth and the importance of a good oral hygiene regime.  “Untreated dental care remains one of the most prevalent diseases affecting children and young people’s ability to speak, eat, play and socialise.” The vast majority of the extractions were due to tooth decay. The severity of decay meant the removals has to be performed in hospital under general anaesthetic, rather than at a dentistaposs surgery, the LGA said. Previous public health research revealed % of five-year-olds in  had dental decay. Some % of children from more deprived areas were likely to have dental decay compared with % of youngsters from less deprived areas – meaning kids from poorer backgrounds were more than twice as likely to suffer with rotting teeth. The LGA called for more cash to tackle public health problems – including reversing what it said was a £million cut in the public health grant to councils between   and  . It wants the grant lted to at least £.billion a year by  . Action on Sugar nutritionist Katharine Jenner said: “These findings are truly shocking, especially as many parents have no idea their children are eating and drinking so much sugar. “Added sugar has found its way into many food and drink products and, aside from contributing to obesity and Type  diabetes, the widespread availability of sugar leads to toothache and unnecessary suffering – mentally and physically. “We need to dramatically reduce sugar in our diet and take serious action on sugar now.” Dr Saul Konviser, of the Dental Wellness Trust, said: “Everyday we, as dentists, see a large number of children that require not just a simple filling but often multiple fillings or extractions, which is often a result of consuming too many sugary foods and drinks. “What is worse is that it is almost completely unavoidable. “From the work that we do, we know strategies such as oral health prevention and toothbrushing programmes in schools and nurseries is one way of supporting this long overdue “prevention better than cure” ethos. “We now urgently call on the Government for more funding – especially as lockdown prevented many children from accessing a clean toothbrush and toothpaste.

Charlotte Phillips had bought the new home in Lipson, Plymouth, to make le easier for her and her family, and even moved in her -year-old mother and  year-old auntie alongside her husband and  month-old daughter. But once the family moved in on June , she was shocked to discover live wires, leaks and incorrect plumbing.The mum-of-one had viewed the property twice before moving in but claims the issues were aposhidden awayapos and not spotted before they moved in, Plymouth Live reports.She says she was told she didnapost need to survey the house and instead a aposdesktop and drive-byapos survey was conducted - where a valuer will drive past a property to check on the external condition and ensure that the property is consistent with its surrounding properties. As a result of the poor condition of the three-storey house, the family  are now having to pay out £, to fix the problems. Charlotte said: We bought the house to make it a better, more easier le for all of us as my mum and auntie was renting and my mum is my carer. We didnapost want to have any renovations as realistically we didnapost have the money to do it and didnapost want all of that hassle. The owners were there when we moved in and we noticed there was stuff in the garden and they said, aposKeep it mateapos and drove off. So we had to have someone collect the rubbish because there was a lot of it, and thataposs when the disaster started. We came across a couple of live wires, so I got a plumber to come out and do a service for me on the boiler. He looked at it and said he wouldnapost touch it, so I asked, aposWhy apos As far as we were concerned it was only two yearsapos old. He said he thinks itaposs a lot older than two years and he couldnapost touch it. So I thought, aposBrilliant!apos We have no certicate and no service history on the boiler. I still have no information on that. We moved in to find live wires left cut - one we ended up finding when we had a leak come into the kitchen underneath the bath next to were the bath had not been plumbed in correctly. So we are now having to replace the whole bathroom due to the damage to then find out the walls and ceiling have to come down due to the wet and damp damage that has been left. The angry mum says her mental health is aposthrough the roofapos. As soon as we solve one problem another comes along, and this is how itaposs been now for six weeks, she said. We were told we didnapost need a surveyor and we were advised not to, which upsets me, but then speaking to other people actually the problems weaposve come across wouldnapost have been picked up in a survey because theyaposre not plumbers, theyaposre not electricians, they donapost take bath  off, theyaposre not going to take the ceilings off to check all this. So they wouldnapost have even seen any of this damp. My mental health has gone through the roof. On top of that Iaposve got my mum whoaposs , my aunt whoaposs . It just hurts. My little one is constantly non stop so my mum was always up and down at our old house helping me when I wasnapost having a great day.

If you are wondering whether to pour the milk in first or let the hot water take preference then Grant Harrold can offer some pearls of wisdom. The former royal butler has revealed not only how to make the perfect cuppa but heaposs also shared an insight into the Queenaposs favourite tea. He said the -year-old monarch is a fan of Assam and Earl Grey tea and she prefers to have milk added after the hot water. Mr Harrold, who worked for Prince Charles from  until , said since the th century this has been the traditional way to serve tea and it has been adopted by the royal family. He previously spoke about his tea-making skills on the BBC Three comedy show Miss Holland. I am sure the Queen enjoys her Assam or her Earl Grey the traditional way, made with tea leaves in a teapot and poured into a fine bone china teacup, he said. She will also use a strainer. It is also a myth that members of Royalty use their pinky when drinking, I have never seen that happen once. The tradition began when potter Josiah Spode created bone china teacups which didnapost crack when filled with boiling hot tea.What do you think  Join the debate in our comments shown belowBut for those who couldnapost afford the expensive and high-quality cups they continued to pour milk into their teacup first. The two methods were often used as a way of telling how wealthy an inidual is. Mr Harrold said the steps to making a perfect royal cup of tea is to pour the tea into the cup from a teapot. Then you add milk to the cup after the tea before you stir back and forth.  But while you are stirring you must never use a circular motion and never touch the side. To drink prefect tea perfectly you should sip and not slurp. Grant tweeted out his advice on making the perfect tea to his , followers this week to mark aposAfternoon Tea Weekapos.

Some .% of Blackpoolaposs population are apparently symptomatic, up by .% on last weekaposs figures, according to the Covid Symptom Study application. Blackpool is joined by Dundee, Merthyr Tydfil, Nottingham and Halton as places on the top  list of places experiencing signicant symptoms but which are outside current local lockdown zones.  Manchester, Kirklees, Rochdale, Salford and Blackburn with Darwen, are the other hardest-hit areas. Blackpool, Halton and Manchester have taken the top three spots on the list, with rates roughly  times the national average. However, experts are not too concerned about the latest figures as the rates were  times higher in April and May. Tim Spector, professor of genetic epidemiology at Kingaposs College London, which developed the app, said: “The trends are flat which is reassuring despite the multiple small outbreaks we have been seeing across the UK in places like Manchester. Our survey data is consistent with the ONS household survey, which estimates slightly higher numbers due to the inclusion of asymptomatic cases.  Some .% of Blackpoolaposs population has symptoms, based on data from the  app users in the town. This is an increase on last week when .% reported symptoms. Halton, which topped last weekaposs list, has seen a slight increase in its population symptom rate, with the figure now at .%. Manchester and Merthyr Tydfil have a rate of .%, while Kirklees has .%, Rochdale has .%, Dundee has .% and Nottingham, Blackburn and Darwen and Salford have .%.

The denim perennial has been in production since  and is a favourite of Hollywood stars and manual workers alike. Second place went to the s-defining Mary Quant-style miniskirt, while Leviaposs denim jackets, UGG boots and Fred Perry polo shirts completed the top five. The poll of , UK adults saw Barbour wax jackets, Ray-Ban Wayfarers and Hunter wellies also feature on the list. Thomas Berry, director of sustainable business for Farfetch, which commissioned the study as part of its drive to raise awareness of sustainable fashion, said: Now more than ever, customers are interested in making considered purchases that will stand the test of time. From pre-owned denim to iconic designer pieces, customers are willing to seek out and to invest in pieces that are conscious, durable and also timeless, regardless of trends. Nearly a fth of those polled named Christian Louboutinaposs famous red-bottomed shoes as an iconic statement piece. Although in terms of memorability, the classy designer shoe only came one place above the gardeneraposs favourite - Crocs. It also emerged that at some point in their lives,  per cent of adults have owned a classic Ralph Lauren polo shirt, and one in six have worn some iconic Nike Air Max trainers.  Half of those polled would still wear any of these memorable trends from years gone by, and three in  have hunted in a charity shop or vintage store to find one specic piece of clothing. Many of the items in the list have been handed down to Brits, who didnapost quite realise what they had, as three in  got rid of items given to them by older relatives, only to regret it later. But just under six in adults now say theyaposd rather have fewer quality pieces in their wardrobe, than lots of cheap items which wouldnapost last as long.  The average adult spends about three hours, and £, a month in charity or vintage clothing stores, with a third actively enjoying aposthe huntapos of finding the perfect garment. More than one in  have even spent a DECADE or longer searching high and low for that one mythical item which will complete their wardrobe.And  per cent agree that fashion is cyclical, and what was once trendy will become trendy again in the future.Despite the desire for more long-lasting clothing, only eight per cent of Brits say they aposalwaysapos shop sustainably, although  per cent apossometimesapos manage to.# The research, conducted via OnePoll, also found  per cent have cut down on clothes shopping in general to reduce their carbon footprint, while  per cent buy from stores which have good green credentials. While a further four in  will be sure to clear space from their wardrobe by giving away old clothes, before buying anything new.Following the findings, Farfetch have created a aposfashion footprintapos tool which gives people the chance to consider the environmental impact of their shopping. Thomas Berry added: The tool allows consumers, when choosing to make a purchase, to consider which materials can reduce the environmental impact of their purchases, and to see the environmental savings of incorporating pre-owned products into their wardrobes. To remind people of the iconic items and test their knowledge, Farfetch have created the ultimate quiz for fashionistas to try out. The top  most iconic fashion items of all time . Leviaposs s .

The bookaposs authors Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand spoke to more than  sources - including the coupleaposs friends, staff and royal aides - to learn the key information about their short time in the royal family. The book, called Finding Freedom, has made a catalogue of fascinating revelations about The Duke and Duchess of Sussexaposs lives before they quit the royal family including gts given to them by their powerful supporters. It claims generous benefactors loaned the couple private jets and they were even loaned houses or offered luxury accommodation with peppercorn rents and even hotel rooms had their rates hugely slashed.The array of freebies afforded to the royal couple by generous pals amount to millions, the Daily Mail reports.According to the book Meghan may have been offered a heavily discounted hotel room for her first date with Harry in July  at Soho House in central London. The authors wrote in the book: She settled on an outfit and then got started on her make-up in her suite at Soho House’s Dean Street Townhouse property. Meghan had been offered a heavily discounted stay at the five-star Dorchester Hotel but chose the luxurious room secured by Markus [Anderson — Soho House director and Meghan’s friend] instead. As a celebrity and influencer, Meghan was regularly offered free holidays, travel discounts, and the like. But she turned down the Dorchester amid a Hollywood boycott after the hotel chain’s owner, the Sultan of Brunei, introduced sharia law in his country, including death by stoning for those found guilty of gay sex. A suite at Soho House in Dean Street costs from £ a night - it is not known how much Meghan paid for it. Following their first date the couple enjoyed a short courtship before they got married in May . During that time they were aposput upapos in a private four-bedroom cottage in the Cotswolds Soho Farmhouse and at the Soho House property at Babington in Somerset, thanks to more generosity by Mr Anderson - managing director of the Soho House Group. The cottage typically costs £, a night. The book says: He put them up at a private four-bedroom cottage, tucked away from the main members’ Soho Farmhouse.  In Oxfordshire, barely an hour-and-a-half outside of London, it was the perfect retreat from the city. Although the stone house stood on  acres of English countryside, they still enjoyed sashimi and other Japanese dishes delivered to their cottage from Pen Yen, one of the restaurants on the property. Mr Anderson, who had a front-row pew at the coupleaposs wedding, also arranged for Meghan and Harry to spend a weekend at Babington House, a Georgian manor near Bath. Babington House is owned by Nick Jones, the husband of TV and radio presenter Kirsty Young. When news of the coupleaposs romance broke in October  Meghan’s best friend, Canadian socialite and stylist Jessica Mulroney, was tasked with helping her get to the UK for a private visit. According to the book Meghan flew in a private jet which would cost around £, for a one way trip to London from Toronto. The book says: Jessica arranged for her to use the private jet of the Canadian real-estate power couple Krystal Koo and Michael Cooper. Long-time friends of Jessica’s, the couple had run interference in the past for Harry and Meghan and were more than happy to help.  Fancying a trip to London themselves, Krystal and Michael joked about hiding Meghan in one of the new suitcases Meghan had bought.’ Inge Solheim, an adventure guide from Norway, had previously helped out Harry and his then girlfriend Cressida Bonas and in January  he was asked to arrange a trip to the Arctic Circle for the couple. This included a week in a cabin in Tromsö at the very tip of Norway. Finding Freedom mentioned the trip, saying: There, Harry and Meghan enjoyed seven days of dog-sledding, whale-watching, dining on local delicacies and snuggling to watch as the aurora borealis lit up the skies. Guests wishing to spend a week in a luxury tent with glass roof would have to fork out £,, while business-class flights to Tromsö costs around £,. The book does not claim the holiday was a freebie.  When the couple got married in St Georgeaposs Chapel dfusers by luxury scent brand Diptyque adorned the building. They cost £ each and in the book the the authors said coverage of this matter proves media bias against the couple but they were ‘provided by Diptyque’. It is not clearthey were given to the couple for free. Harry and Meghan enjoyed a secret honeymoon which, the authors note, they had flown to on a private jet loaned by a friend. They spent the majority of the week-long trip in the sun at a location so private, most of their friends still don’t know where it was. Two months after their wedding Meghan and Harry enjoyed a break with the actor George Clooney and his lawyer we, Amal, at their home on Lake Como. George arranged a private flight for the couple which would cost from £,. The book notes: A few months after the drama with her father, George Clooney arranged for Harry and Meghan to fly from London to Lake Como on his own private jet.  During the couple’s successful tour of Australia in October , they were supported by Meghanaposs best friend Jessica. Jessica helped to style Meghan and travelled privately to be with her. Jessica’s husband, Ben Mulroney, the son of former Canadian PM Brian Mulroney, was also there and at the time he was Canada’s top TV anchor . The book says: In Sydney to take on engagements and host the fourth Invictus Games, Harry and Meghan managed to sneak out for an evening off with Jessica and Ben Mulroney, the latter of whom was covering the Games for Canada’s CTV network. The couple had announced Meghan’s pregnancy on this tour. A real-estate billionaire loaned them his home for an intimate and completely secret evening with a five-course meal prepared by a private chef. The billionaireaposs generous gt is valued at around £,.  Pregnant Meghan flew back to London with Amal Clooney and her twins after her lavish baby shower in New York in February , as the book confirms The flight home would have cost at least £,. Meghanaposs kind-hearted pals, which include tennis champion Serena Williams, paid for her to stay at the Mark Hotel. The total estimated bill is around £, which includes the penthouse suite which costs a whopping £, a night. Finding Freedom also claims the couple and baby Archie enjoyed a trip in Elton Johnaposs took Elton’s private plane from Ibiza to the singeraposs home in Nice, France, in the summer of  which would have cost £,they had booked it privately. The trip resulted in the couple being accused of hypocrisy as Harry launched his ‘eco’ travel initiative Travalyst soon afterwards.  The book claims Harry regretted ignoring the advice of Press supremo Sara Latham, who had warned him he would face criticism. Harry’s trip to an eco summit in August  attracted further controversy after he spoke about protecting the environment. He flew to the event at a hotel in Sicily in a privately rented jet and used a helicopter to get to the resort in Verdura.The Camp Google summit brought together celebrities and the rich and is believed to have cost the tech giant  million.The book says Harry flew one way by private jet — and the company picked up the bill.

Saaba Mahmood, , pocketed state benefit handouts on behalf of her aunt and uncle over a five-year period - even though she knew they were living in their native Pakistan. But when she was caught, Mahmood, of Heald Green near Stockport, Greater Manchester, said she did not realise she was unable to claim on the behalf of relatives who lived abroad. She also claimed she lacked skills in understanding how to live in society as a responsible adult and added that she did not realise her offences were not victimless crimes. At Minshull Street Crown Court, Manchester, Mahmood admitted four charges of failing to disclose information to make a gain and one offence of fraud but was given  months jail suspended for  months. Prosecutor Julian Goode said: These are cases relating to benefit claims on behalf of her aunt, uncle, and mother. She acted as an appointee for them and in that capacity and she had a duty to disclose changes in circumstances that would impact the claim. She claimed Disability Living Allowance on behalf of her aunt between January  and September , and Employment Support Allowance between February  and October . She was acting as her auntaposs appointee and as a result both benefits were paid directly into her bank account. There is evidence to show her aunt left the UK in January  to go to her daughteraposs wedding in Pakistan but fell ill there and did notto the UK until  October . The defendant did not disclose this and continued to receive those payments in her behalf between February  and October . These payments totalled £,.. Her uncle claimed Disability Living Allowance between November  and October  and Employment Support Allowance between October  and October . The defendant became his appointee in July . She got the credit into her bank account, but he was out of the country between November  and October  and again between October  and June  and June  and December . The defendant failed to report the change and the overpayment was £,.. The defendant became an appointee for her mother in July  and on  August  she said her mother was able to care for her uncle and received Employment Support Allowance. On  October  she reported the change that her mother had stopped caring for her uncle. The overpayment in this case was £. The total overpayment was £,.. The defendant was interviewed on  February last year and confirmed her aunt had been living in Pakistan between  and . She said she did not know she needed to reportsomeone was abroad. She said she had reported that her uncle was in Pakistan in September . She said she completed forms between June  and November  in which she failed to mention he was in Pakistan. A breach of trust was involved. At an earlier hearing a lawyer for Mahmood said she would benefit from programmes to help her understand these are not victimless offences. They added: She lacks skills in understanding how to live in society as a responsible adult. At Thursdayaposs hearing in mitigation defence lawyer Isobel Thomas said: She is genuinely remorseful and has repeated this on a number of occasions to let the court know how sorry she is. She pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity. Only one of the claims was fraudulent from the outset and that claim was worth £.  Immediate custody will have a signicant harmful impact on others. She has eight children aged between one and  who have to go into foster care as her husband has schizophrenia and is unable to care for them. Her youngest two children are very close to her and sleep by her. One of her daughters has been assaulted in the past and appeared as a witness at a Leeds Crown Court trial. She is nervous of men and other people. Her husband gets very distressed when she isnapost there and may have to go to hospitalshe were sent to prison. She is a carer for her aunt who has dementia, hepatitis C and kidney failure. She has never troubled the courts before and no longer claims benefits. She would comply with all requirements of a suspended sentence. Mahmood was also ordered to complete  rehabilitation requirement days and  hours of unpaid work."},{"url":null,"title":"new data shows surge new","story":"NewsCoronavirus surge in Swindon - new cases in week as Bury and Stoke infections on risePublic Health England data released today reveals  local authority areas have rates of  new cases per , or higher, with  showing an increase in seven daysShareCommentsByDave BurkeIan Jones:,  AUG Updated:,  AUG Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video coronavirus-numbers-uk-deaths-rise-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

He is merely resting, avoiding those who would give him the last rites. Last week’s decision to close the Bradley surface mine in Co Durham was greeted as the death knell of the fuel that made Britain prosperous. But the obituaries are premature. Big open-cast mines and tiny underground collieries are still in production and a new deep pit is planned in Cumbria. We have dug coal since Roman times and our love affair with burning “black diamonds” in our hearths is not over yet. Despite virus problems, coal mer­­chants insist they have “plentul stocks for everyone to enjoy on their solid fuel fires for many years to come”. Good news for those who like to watch the flickering flames and gassy spurts of fire. The Government has set a deadline of  for a carbon-free UK and  for phasing out coal-fired power stations. Already, weeks go by without it being used for electricity generation. But coal is still needed for making steel and cement. And fireclay, found in the same seams, is vital for brick making. The last big deep mine, Kellingley in North Yorkshire, closed in . However, more than  surface mines continued operating at the end of that year and replacements are in the pipeline. Eight million tons of coal were used in the UK in . Two-thirds was for pur­­poses other than electricity generation – and % was imported from countries such as the US, Russia and Colombia, arguably with a bigger carbon dioxide footprint than home-produced coal. And that’s important because environmentalists insist, correctly, that coal is earth’s number one pollutant – though our contribution to global CO from coal is minute compared to China and India. That doesn’t stop campaigners fight­­ing to scrap the planned Woodhouse under­­­sea colliery in Cumbria which would extract . million tons of coking coal a year for  years – mainly for export to European steel works. The site, close to Cumbria’s last deep pit in Whitehaven, which closed in , would create  jobs. But despite West Cumbria Mining insisting it will be very dferent from th-century pits, opponents demand: “Leave The Coal In The Hole!” Had these campaigners been around a century ago, when King Coal employed . million men and women, they would have been laughed off the muck-heap but local politicians are nervous in the face of the well-­organised and funded Green lobby.  Back in the North East, Bradley, near Dipton, is closing with the loss of a dozen jobs after an application to extend its operations was rejected. Gavin Styles, boss of owners Banks Mining, says: “I am angry, frustrated and sad to have to tell my highly skilled and loyal team, most of whom live in surround­­ing communities, that we will no longer be able to employ all of them even though there is signicant demand for the coal and fireclay they produce. “While British industry still needs coal it is obvious that it is better for our climate and for our jobs to mine it here rather than exporting our jobs and increasing global greenhouse gas emissions by relying on coal imported from thousands of miles away.” Durham and Northumberland were the heartlands of the coal industry. The earliest record of mining is in  and by the th century it was the staple industry of the North East. At its peak after the First World War mining here employed more than , – my family among them. I should ­declare an interest: my great-great-greatgrand­father Joseph was manager of Ryhope colliery, Sunderland, in the s. What’s more, he was the joint inventor of the Routledge and Johnson miners’ safety lamp. Put that in your pipe and smoke it, tree huggers. I can’t imagine what old Joe would say about the timidity of politicians too frightened of the eco-warriors to approve even surface mining. But I suspect it would be forthright.  There are not enough jobs in the North East to sneer at the prospect of skilled and well-paid employment. There are still pockets of mining in the Forest of Dean, where “free-miners” have a ,-year-old birthright to dig coal, ore and stone.This has so far escaped the attention of eco-disrupters, who have been much in evidence recently, protesting at the burning of woodpellets in the Drax power station inNorth Yorkshire.The fuel is made from trees felled in Mississippi which is taken to the eastern seaboard of the US, shipped to Liverpool and brought over the Pennines by train. #AxeDrax, a coalition of Extinction Rebellion and others, wants to end Drax’s “tree-burning and its train of destruction”.Ironically, the power station was visible from the pithead gear at Kellingley colliery and burnedits coal before moving on to what it calls “the largest decarbonisation project in Europe”.But you don’t have to burn the stuff to get the most out of coal. It is a key chemical feedstock. The Nazis even made petrol out of it. Scientists insist there is a future in gasication of coal, with the right investment.

An outbreak linked to the Greencore Factory, which makes sandwiches for the upmarket retailer, will see staff and members of their households having to isolate for  days. The Department of Health said that local testing data and analysis from the Joint Biosecurity Centre had shown a spike in cases in the area to be almost solely down to the outbreak at the Northampton factory. The site employs , people and initially did not close its operations despite reporting dozens of cases. The department said: The factory will close voluntarily from today and employees and their direct households will be required to isolate at home for two weeks. The Health Secretary will introduce regulations to ensure that this self-isolation period is legally enforced. Anyone who leaves isolation prior to the two-week period ending without reasonable excuse will be subject to fines. The outbreak saw Northampton upgraded to an area of interventionapos due to the spike in infections. While Birmingham has a coronavirus infection rate of . per , people, Northamptonaposs rate is far higher at . as it is a much smaller place. In all intervention areas bar Northampton, possibly because the outbreak is so localised, restrictions have been imposed, while enhanced support zone councils have received more backing and mobile testing units have been dispatched. The Department of Health said Health Secretary Matt Hancock would bring in regulations to ensure that this self-isolation period is legally enforced and warned that anyone who does not abide by the rules without a reasonable excuse could be fined. Director of Public Health Northamptonshire, Lucy Wightman, told the BBC: The factory will close voluntarily. Most employees and their direct households will be required to isolate at home for two weeks.  Northamptonaposs incidence rate has hit . per , people, in the week ending  August. Mrs Wightman said the current situation is fragile in the East Midlands town. She said: If we donapost keep continuing to work together to reduce the transmission of the virus there is a very real possibility that further and stricter intervention measures and a possible local lockdown will follow. A message sent to staff at Greencore, and shared with the BBC, states the company has decided to put all colleagues working at the Northampton siteon a period of  days self-isolation.  It adds: We know this will come as concerning news for all our colleagues. We will therefore send further updates to you on the action you need to take shortly. Please stay safe. A spokesman for Greencore said the company had taken the decision to temporarily cease production at its Northampton facility from the end of today as a result of the ongoing COVID- outbreak in the Northampton area and at the site. This decision will allow all remaining colleagues at the site to self-isolate as a precautionary measure, and has been taken as part of the regionaposs ongoing efforts to reduce the spread of the virus and keep our colleagues safe.

The TV survival legend has agreed to spearhead a new drive to get hundreds more female recruits to become frontline troops in just a few months time. Grylls, , has secretly agreed his organisation Be Military Fit will join up with recruiting giant Capita to improve applicants’ fitness levels. Capita has hit recruitment targets over the past two years, but wants to help the MoD create a more gender-inclusive Army. It follows a high drop off rate in female recruits applying to join up and then either falling short on fitness or not going to basic training for other reasons. As much as  per cent of all candidates signing up to join the Army are females, after new gender inclusion rules now mean women can fight alongside male soldiers. But as many as  per cent of them have fallen slightly short on strict fitness tests which are just as gruelling as those undertaken by male candidates. This comes despite Army commanders noticing that females who do join the Army very often out -perform their male colleagues in toughness. Bear Grylls – joint owner and figurehead of BMF - told the Daily Mirror exclusively: “Be Military Fit has the military expertise, nationwide reach and a community fitness for all philosophy that ideally positions us to support Capita and the Army. “The goal is simple: to improve physical performance and readiness of potential recruits. “Our instructors and members come from a broad range of backgrounds which enables us to provide anyone who wishes to join the Army with the best possible chance of passing the Armyaposs entry standards. “Weaposre hugely proud to be part of this initiative and in collaboration with the Army and Capita we look forward to making a positive impact to our Armed Forces. “Women have proved to be some of the best recruits weaposve had lately in the Army and have proved time and time again to be just as strong as men.” "},{"url":null,"title":"student travel firm sta ceases","story":"NewsStudent travel firm STA ceases trading in UK putting hundreds of jobs at riskThe company, which has more than  stores in the UK, said it had no choice but to cease trading due to the devastating impact of the coronavirus pandemicShareCommentsByDave Burke:,  AUG Updated:,  AUG NewsSTA Travel has ceased trading, it announced this evening \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Tragic Matthew Mackell, , was found dead in a park on May . Now Matthewaposs dad Michael Bond, , says his son, who loved maths and dreamed of becoming an accountant, achieved an A in Finance, his favourite subject. Mr Bond told Kent Online: Itaposs a bittersweet feeling because Iaposm proud and I congratulated him at his grave but I just wish he was here. I donapost know about any of his other subjects yet. Matthew was in his first year of sixth form at Skinnersapos Kent Academy in Tunbridge Wells, Kent. In a note found in his school diary, the teen had expressed how lockdown made him anxious about his exam results and what it meant for his future. Mr Bond added: He was worried about his results and he was scared he was going to be in a dead-end job and he didnapost know where to go with lockdown. He lost his job too because of the virus and it all had a knock-on effect. As students across the county found out their GCSE results, Mr Bond is urging anyone who may not be happy with their marks to speak up and seek help. He added: My advice is go and sit with a teacher and talk to them because they are still there to help. Just because schools are closed doesnapost mean thereaposs no-one to talk to. An investigation by the Independent Office of Police Conductis looking into how police staff handled contact with the schoolboy who dialled  before taking his own le in picturesque Dunorlan Park in Tunbridge Wells, Kent earlier this month.  Police and paramedics went to the scene but he was pronounced dead. Mr Bond said the last time he saw Matthew was when he asked himhe wanted his room hoovered before he left to go for a walk at around pm. The Skinners Academy student said not to bother as he would do it himself when he got back but he tragically never ed home. Speaking after his sonaposs death, Mr Bond added: I just canapost believe itaposs happened. He left a message on his mobile phone screensaver saying aposHi youaposve found me. Tell my family I love them and to be there for each other. Iaposm struggling through le.apos I knew he was a popular lad to be around, always making people laugh, but Iaposve found out how strong he was. He didnapost have any problems in the world but in his mind he had too many - especially with the lockdown. Older brother Chris Mackell says a notebook the family found since Matthewaposs death shows the A-level student feared for his future and how lockdown would affect his school results.

And inspiring Georgie has now vowed: I’m here to show you how much of what you see on Instagram isn’t aposreal leapos. She has shared dozens of photos showing how a small waist, abs and peachy bum can be faked as she urges women to remember cellulite, dimples, rolls and stretch marks are all aposnormalapos. Do you have a similar story to share  Email webnews@mirror In one of the images, Georgie poses in front of the mirror wearing a black bikini. The image on the left shows her kneeling down showing off her seemingly perfect body. The picture next to it shows how a dferent pose can give a completely dferent impression. In the caption, she wrote: Don’t be fooled by what you see on here, neither of these images have been edited but as an influencer I have taught myself how to make my body look good in photos. It doesn’t mean that I actually look like that in real le though. In fact most of the time when I upload a aposbikini beach babeapos image... I’m sitting like I am on the right, hair in a bun, no makeup, with my rolls just chillin. In another set of pictures, Georgie reveals how dferent types of lighting can make a huge dference. She wrote: These photos were taken one minute apart. The first in soft lighting with my front in the sun and the shade in the back.  The second with my front in the shade and the harsh lighting on my back. That is the only dference in these images, so next time you see an image of yourself in harsh lighting... remember it’s just harsh lighting.

The image is enhanced through multiple ways and carefully curated to create something that’s completely unrealistic. You are perfect just as you are andyou start to forget that... remind yourself that it’s all trickery on here, it’s not real.  Your normal, unposed body is just as beautul as your aposbest shotapos. Normalise normal bodies. In another message to her followers, she wrote: Don’t let one snap shot of someone’s day define how you feel about yourself. When you’re on social media... you’re looking at the aposhighlightsapos of someone’s day. That one best shot of the day should not define your reality because it isn’t real le or realistic. Majority of people on IG will only choose to share that highlight so please don’t compare yourself to that one good shot of the day.

But while Storm Ellen may finally start to let up, it seems that the summer heat could be gone for good. For the remaining days in August, forecasters predict a mixed bag weather-wise, and while there will still be some sun, any hope of another heatwave before we move into September appear remote. The Met Office said an unsettled outlook was expected with temperatures below average for the time of year. Temperatures are unlikely to exceed -C in London in the next fortnight, according to the BBC, by which point September will have arrived. In Manchester, high temperatures will often struggle to get over -C, with wind and rain are expected too, meaning what is left of summer is set to be a little damp. Overnight, gusts of up to mph buffeted parts of the south-west of England and Wales on Friday, causing the RNLI and HM Coastguard to urge members of the public to be cautious in coastal areas. South Wales Police said a -year-old girl died following an incident in a river in east Cardf on Friday evening. Emergency services, including a police helicopter, responded to reports of a girl in the river in Ball Lane, Llanrumney, at around .pm. At about .pm a -year-old girl was located and despite the best efforts of emergency services she sadly passed away, the force said.  Some  flood warnings remained in places across parts of the UK on Friday night, meaning flooding is expected, while the Environment Agency issued a further  flood alerts for swathes of the south-west. A yellow wind warning issued by the Met Office expired on Friday evening, with no further warnings expected over the weekend, according to forecaster Matthew Box. Itaposs still going to be breezy and blustery tomorrow, but winds will not be as strong as they have been today, he said.  Heavy showers could hit parts of central England with the potential for thunder on Saturday, while southern parts of the country are expected to see sunny spells. Further north it is a mixed bag weather-wise, Mr Box said, with some cloudy but also sunny spells towards the east. The Met Office said in its long-range weather forecast that the outlook is generally unsettled. A spokesman said: The outlook period begins generally unsettled with strengthening winds accompanied by showers or longer spells of rain across much of the UK.Towards the bank holiday weekend, these spells of rain and strong winds may perhaps become more confined towards northern and eastern areas, with the driest conditions mostly likely in the south. Although, the southwest may see some further spells of wind and rain at times. Temperatures should be near or slightly below the average for this time of year, with a potential for some frost overnight, but otherwise feeling warm in any sunnier spells. Although confidence is low into September, it is likely that the first part will see a transition into a more zonal pattern, with the north unsettled and the south generally drier and warmer. The strongest gust recorded on Friday was mph at the Needles on the Isle of Wight, while Mumbles Head in Swansea saw winds of up to mph. HM Coastguard urged members of the public to keep their distance from the waves, while the RNLI advised visiting leguarded beaches whenever possible and to avoid storm watchingswells become high.

But she was baffled as she was only wearing a high-waisted two piece from Amazon, with only about three inches of her stomach showing. And what made matters worse - her pal did not back her up. The woman was at a baby swim class where, she explained, she is often one of few mums who enter the pool with their babies while most couples have the dad enter the water while the mothers sit on the sidelines. This day, when she took her six-month-old to the class, there was a new baby. She takes up the story on Reddit: Today, there was a new baby at swim class! He looked to be about the same age as my son. As the father got into the pool, he said hi and I ed the greeting. I then asked him how old his son was and we made about  seconds of small talk before the class started,” the woman explained. “After class was over and my son and I were leaving the pool area, this man’s we approached me and said aposyou know,you are going to continue to swim with husbands and fathers, you should really dress more modestlyapos. Stunned, the woman explained there was only about three inches of her stomach showing and it was not like her voluptuous curves were a distraction or anything. She did not have a moment to think, so in her shocked state she simply replied: Thank you for your opinion. She walked off but, unable to shake off what had happened, she asked her friend about it later. But instead of sharing in her horror at the body-shaming at the pool, her mate told her maybe she should think about her swimwear fashion choices. She said that I should invest in a one-piece , she said. She then continued that she would also be uncomfortable with a swim class that had other women who were showing off too much skin to her husband and children.

Former Prince’s Foundation vice-chair Eileen Guggenheim, now dean of the New York Academy of Arts, is claimed by a former student to have introduced her to Epstein, who later abused her. Lawyers for Guggenheim have vehemently denied the accusations. Maria Farmer, , alleges she flew to his New Mexico ranch in  for a study trip where she was encouraged to flirt with him as he was a big NYAA donor. She claims she and her younger sister, Annie, were later abused by him and his alleged madam, Ghislaine Maxwell. A report by the NYAA insists Guggenheim, , played “no role” in introducing the Farmers to Epstein, concluding there was “no evidence to credibly support” her claims.  Another student who went to Epstein’s Zorro Ranch in Santa Fe in  said the young women were pressured to play games that involved “sexual objects” with Epstein and Maxwell. Guggenheim denied being present. Three ex-students confirmed the meeting, one calling it the “weirdest dinner party I’ve ever been to”. Guggenheim had denied ever being in the ranch. When Farmer, Ursula Ruedenberg, and one other went public with their claims, Guggenheim said she saw the property under construction but “did not visit any home there or have a meal there”. Her lawyers said: “Ms Farmer’s claims with regard to the ranch are inconsistent and have changed over time. “Ms Guggenheim’s visit was very brief she took a tour of the grounds with the former students and left shortly thereafter. That explains her initial failure to recollect having ever travelled to the ranch.  “It was only after seeing a photograph which depicted Ms Guggenheim, Ms Farmer, and three former students during the daylight... on the grounds, that she recalled her brief visit. She does not recall being inside any building on the property, anything out of the ordinary occurring, nor any of the students reporting an incident to her. “Ms Farmer has said she found her visit unsettling, which she has attributed to the presence of Epstein and Maxwell. Notwithstanding her explanations long after the event, in the context of how events transpired, she subsequently accepted a job with Epstein.”  Guggenheim said: “Had any student expressed to me their personal discomfort over actions by Mr Epstein I would have immediately addressed the situation and offered my support. At that time neither I nor anyone at the NYAA had any knowledge of Mr Epstein’s predatory behaviour.” Farmer claims Guggenheim “asked me to sit on his lap and flirt with him... ‘Do it for the academy, Maria’.” Guggenheim’s lawyers said: “The allegation Ms Guggenheim encouraged Ms Farmer to flirt and sit on Epstein’s knee is categorically denied and completely baseless.It is denied Ms Guggenheim had at the material time any knowledge of Ms Farmer meeting Epstein.” In a report commissioned by the NYAA, lawyer Jim Walden – who was previously the Academy and Guggenheim’s personal lawyer – found there was no evidence linking Guggenheim to any of Epstein’s abuse. The report said: “It is dficult to give any credence to Farmer’s claim that Guggenheim was in any way responsible for Annie Farmer’s meeting of Epstein or her sexual abuse by Epstein and Maxwell.” Several NYAA board members quit over the response.

But the health chief has called on the world to unite as success depends on finding a vaccine.The Ethiopian biologist and WHO official told a briefing in Geneva: And in our situation now with more technology, and of course with more connectiveness, the virus has a better chance of spreading, it can move fast because we are more connected now. But at the same time we have also the technology to stop it and the knowledge to stop it. So we have a disadvantage of globalisation, closeness, connectedness but an advantage of better technology. So we hope to finish this pandemicless than two years. He urged national unity and global solidarity.That is really key with utilising the available tools to the maximum and hoping that we can have additional tools like vaccine.  More than . million people have been reported to be infected by the coronavirus globally and , have died, according to Reuters.Some scientists have suggested coronavirus could follow a similar pattern to the deadly Spanish flu, which swept the globe in three waves, claiming about  millions lives.It broke out in March  and mainly affected the elderly and infirm during the First World War. By August , it was hoped the pandemic was coming to an end, but the death spiked again in September to November. But the virus had developed into a new strain, and this hit young, healthy people.  The president elect of the Royal Society of Medicine Professor Roger Kirby said in July: The winter is coming and almost certainly a second wave of this virus is coming. What we saw in  was the virus change and the second wave was dferent from the first wave and it affected a dferent group of people - particularly younger people. Pandemic experts fear Covid- could go through a similar aposW curveapos as the Spanish Flu - the deadliest pandemic in history. The Spanish Flu first saw a aposU curveapos - two major spikes in deaths among the very old and very young. But this became a aposW curveapos - as death rates spiked among healthy  to -year-olds. Doctors in America are also said to fear death trends will be similar to those documented in the Spanish Flu. Dr. Raul Vasquez, CEO of the Greater Buffalo United Accountable Healthcare Network, said in July that the Spanish Flu came in three waves, with the aposU curveapos representing the first two waves.But in the final wave, the curve on the graph became a W shape as a third demographic of those aged  to -years-old saw disproportionate deaths, and not just the old or very young.  In the Spanish Flu pandemic, it was all over by the summer of . The brutal reality then was that everyone who had caught the virus had either been killed, or had developed immunity to it. While some countries have managed to reduce transmission of COVID-, Dr Tedros today warned that progress does not mean victory. He referenced several countries which had experienced new outbreaks, saying: These countries are a cautionary tale for those that are now seeing a downward trend in cases.” Much more research is needed on the impact of mutations in the coronavirus, WHO epidemiologist Maria Van Kerkhove said today. She said: A special working group has been formed to identy mutations ... and weaposre looking at how we can better understand what the mutation means and how they behave. India neared the million mark for coronavirus cases today, while Latin Americaaposs death toll passed , as the region reported more than , fatalities a day over the last week. The reproduction aposR rateapos number of infections in the United Kingdom has risen and may now be above , indicating a risk the overall epidemic is growing. Spainaposs equality minister has asked regions to order the closure of brothels to try to prevent new outbreaks, as daily infections rise to ,. Sweden plans to allow more spectators at cultural and sporting events. Poland reported  new cases, its highest daily increase.

Then, the day before, we had to train indoors because the undersoil heating hadn’t been switched on and I ended up breaking my leg.“I had been so high and was then so low.“My debut turned out to be against Dundee away.“I had been on the bench before and people had been saying: ‘You are going to get your debut.’#I thought: ‘Oh no, don’t say that because I will be a nervous wreck.’“I was just a wee, skinny boy“Then I got the call and we were winning - at the time.“There was then a counter-attack and they scored to make it -. I was like: ‘Oh no, I can’t concede two goals in  minutes.’“Thankfully, it finished - and after the game I was celebrating but the other lads were saying: ‘We just scraped it.’#For me, it was brilliant.”INTERVIEW: Out of favour under Robbie Neilson and out of love with football, Dundee United#s Cammy Smith has new lease of le under Micky Mellon\" title\"#INTERVIEW: Out of favour under Robbie Neilson and out of love with football, Dundee United#s Cammy Smith has new lease of le under Micky Mellon# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp dundee-united-cammy-smith-robbie-neilson-micky-mellon embed # secretYUfQSdqJ\" data-secret\"YUfQSdqJ\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

Of those,  were in the NHS Grampian area, compared with  in Tayside,  in Greater Glasgow and Clyde and four in Lanarkshire. No new deaths had been recorded in the last  hours.At her daily coronavirus briefing, Ms Sturgeon described the position in Aberdeen as “an improving situation” and said there was “no evidence” of transmission into Aberdeenshire or Moray.Ms Sturgeon said that when the local lockdown is reviewed on Sunday, the government would look at bringing Aberdeen into line with the rest of the country on some aspects of coronavirus policy, such as casinos and bingo halls reopening.We all hope and are optimistic that Aberdeen will be on the road back –not to complete normality then at least as much normality as the rest of the country very soon.”Nicola SturgeonElsewhere in Scotland, such venues are scheduled to come back into use on Monday. Previously, Ms Sturgeon has indicated that she would look at reopening Aberdeen’s non-licensed cafes on Wednesday.“On Sunday… we will review the lockdown restrictions in Aberdeen again,” Ms Sturgeon said. “And at that time we hope that we will be able to set out a firm timetable for the lting of these restrictions.“At that point we will also set out whether some of the changes that were announced more generally for the country yesterday – for example, the reopening of venues like bingo halls – will also apply in Aberdeen.”She added: “We all hope and are optimistic that Aberdeen will be on the road back –not to complete normality then at least as much normality as the rest of the country very soon.”The first minister added that there was “no evidence to suggest there had been wider transmission” beyond the city of Aberdeen.“That is something that has been looked at very carefully, particularly around Aberdeenshire, particularly given some of the travel patterns and proximity of communities there,” the first minister said.Ms Sturgeon said the cluster associated with those who gathered in the city’s pubs was now under control. But there was an “ongoing concern” about cases not associated with the cluster, but things were improving. In total,  cases have been identied in the Grampian Health Board area since the July .Of those,  were associated with the pub-linked cluster, and , contacts have been identied from those  cases. In the last  hours, there had been an additional seven cases not associated with the original cluster.Earlier this week Aberdeen City Council leaders expressed frustration that the city had not been allowed out of its three week lockdown earlier, warning that , jobs were at risk as a result of the coronavirus.Aberdeen City Council co-leader Jenny Laing said: “Of course we have to be mindful of public health, but we also have to be mindful of the economic implications, which could have an impact on public health as well.#It is about balancing competing harms. Economic damage could harm public health through unemployment and poverty. That’s why we thought, in line with the incident management team, that restrictions on travel, household gatherings and hospitality could have been lted earlier.”At her briefing, Ms Sturgeon repeated her warnings about house parties, saying indoor social gatherings were proving one of the major drivers of community transmission of the virus.She said: “That tells us that we need to be incredibly cautious about these kinds of gatherings.“I want to ask everybody again today to remember the advice that is in place and to comply with it.”Economy Secretary Fiona Hyslop repeated her plea for the UK Government#s furlough scheme to be extended, particularly in the hospitality and tourism industries.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

We are therefore taking the precaution at this time of advising that all staff self isolate for  days from the date they were last on site.“Additionally, we ask all pupils and their households to self isolate for  days from Thursday, August . Guidance has also been shared with the families on what this means for them and how they will be supported.”Paul Clancy, Dundee City Council executive director of children and families services, said: “I would like to reassure families that this action is being taken to keep everyone safe.

further factories linked to tayside coronavirus cluster as cases discovered across three council areas","story":"Two further factories have been linked to a growing coronavirus outbreak in Tayside, as new figures reveal the region now has the highest risk of local transmission anywhere in Scotland.The number of cases linked to the  Sisters food processing plant in Coupar Angus has risen to , and Nicola Sturgeon confirmed  employees have now tested positive for the virus, along with nine of their contacts.Speaking during the Scottish Government’s daily coronavirus briefing on the day Scotland recorded its second-highest number of new cases since May, Ms Sturgeon said  of the  new positive tests recorded overnight were in Tayside.A total of  of the new cases were in the Grampian health board area,  in Greater Glasgow and Clyde, and four in Lanarkshire.NHS Tayside announced on Thursday that anyone living in a household with a factory worker from the  Sisters site, including children, should self-isolate at home and get tested for Covid- as soon as possible.Ms Sturgeon said not all of the  Sisters workforce live in Coupar Angus so the situation involves people stretched across Perth and Kinross, Angus and Dundee.The first minister also confirmed two contacts #have links to other food processing factories in Tayside”, although it is not yet clear which businesses are affected.#The incident management team is now carrying out risk assessments at both of these sites,#Ms Sturgeon said.#There#s no evidence that this outbreak has spread to either factory at this stage but, as you can imagine, that is something that is being looked at very closely.#Ms Sturgeon said lockdown restrictions similar to the ones introduced in Aberdeen two weeks ago had not been imposed because there was currently #minimal evidence of community transmission in Tayside#.However, she said she could not rule out introducing further measures in the future and the situation would be kept under #very close review#.A new method of tracking the outbreak has revealed Perth and Kinross has the highest risk of local coronavirus transmission anywhere in Scotland and may require “greater vigilance” from health officials.The region has  surged past other areas dealing with local outbreaks, including Aberdeen, which became the site of Scotland’s first local lockdown following a cluster linked to pubs and bars in the city.A new Scottish Government report considered whether the current number of Covid- infections exceeds what health officials would expect at this stage of the epidemic, based on a new modelling system from Warwick University.It found six local authority areas – Perth and Kinross, Dundee, North Lanarkshire, Angus, Glasgow and Aberdeen – had exceeded expected levels but figures are beginning to trend towards normal.The new method is designed to be more useful than the R number – the average number of people infected by each person – because this figure can be volatile when the overall number of deaths is low.The report states: “While metrics such as the reproductive rate – R number – have been useful in guiding our response to coronavirus so far, the models we use rely on numbers of deaths to track the epidemic.“These have fallen to low levels, which means we need to find new ways to monitor trends in the epidemic.“One of the ways we can do this is to calculate whether the number of confirmed infectionsin each area exceeds the number that was expected, given the number recorded across the country – this is called ‘exceedance’.”Areas with an exceedance level above six are deemed to be at a higher risk of local transmission and may require “greater vigilance”, according to the report.In the week leading up to August , the only areas above this limit were Perth and Kinross, at ., and Dundee, where a number of workers at the  Sisters chicken factory live, at ..Angus came in at ., Aberdeen at ., and levels in Aberdeenshire are beginning to fall back towards background levels.The report stated in most cases the figures are “a reflection of a small number of cases” however, the ongoing nature of the outbreak in Perth and Kinross “may be a cause for concern”.Speaking about lessons learned from the clusters on Friday, Ms Sturgeon said indoor social gatherings are one of the major drivers of community transmission.She warned against defying guidelines on the number of people allowed indoors at once, which she said presented “a very signicant risk”.“That tells us that we need to be incredibly cautious about these kinds of gatherings,# she said. #I want to ask everybody again today to remember the advice that is in place and to comply with it.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including

He did that.The players have been sanctioned with fines by the club and are awaiting the outcome of a disciplinary hearing next Friday having been served with notices of complaint by the SFA. They could yet be hammered by the SFA with bans of two to eight games.There is no point punishing the club and supporters by dropping them in a game where Aberdeen desperately needed to secure the first points of the season.New signing Ross McCrorie showed his versatility on the right of a back three.The -year-old played at right-back on loan at Portsmouth last season.Prior to that he played in Rangers’ first team in central midfield.This was McCrorie’s first game since the play-off semi-final with Portsmouth on July . There were no signs of ring rust.It was a solid debut in defence, where he was composed and cool in and out of possession.Similarly impressive was new signing Tommie Hoban, who made a welcometo the Dons starting line-up after  months of injury hell.Hoban played on the left of the back three.This was the former Watford defender’s first competitive game time since suffering cruciate ligament damage while on loan at Aberdeen against St Mirren in February .For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancellation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Evening Express website including all Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening Express n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb and ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t tMonthly n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayUnlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

It has taken a national emergency to get the government to acknowledge that it needs our compliance and, for that, must give us the information we need.Suddenly the choices we make are seen as vitally important, and we have a part to play in achieving success for ourselves and our community. Can this be a foundation for a future partnership that could transform the health of Scotland and the pressure on our services As a physiotherapist I became aware that there was little that one could do to impose solutions there had to be a relationship that involved two way listening, mutual trust and support to do what was necessary. In this pandemic Nicola Sturgeon has said that we have behaved in a way that saved lives and protected the NHS.When this is over we could be at the beginning of another le-altering journey.It will demand a huge sht in expectations. There is an amazing bias in society towards the idea of decrepitude and dependency in old age, when in fact encouraging dependency increases a slide into that very state. During past months many of these attitudes have been exposed and caused outrage but they are long standing and deep seated.If you have been trying to escape into fiction you might have no better idea of what is possible. Alison Flood interviewed crime writers about their work, and this is what she found.Ian Rankin is now writing about a John Rebus who has health issues, James Lee Burke has his detective Robicheaux meditating on mortality in his early s and Mark Billingham has slowed his Tom Thorne down a bit because he is in his s. Michael Connelly does not believe that it is credible to have his Harry Bosch with a badge and gun and still working for the LAPD, this in a country where the President is  and one of the presidential hopefuls .Worst of all, Sara Paretsky created a feisty, strong woman for her books, only to succumb to popular misconceptions and stop her age at  because she didn#t #want Vi to be helpless#.These fictional creations battle the evils they see in their society.

Without action and proper investment from central government vital public services will be at risk.This news of huge strain on local authority budgets comes as the SNP is delaying in opening up Scotland’s hospitality and tourism industry. Instead of following other parts of the UK and opening the sector on July , the separatists are forcing businesses to wait until July .This delay will cost businesses millions at a time when thousands of jobs are already on the line.The SNP is risking people#s livelihoods. It needs to accept responsibility for that and take action now.Councillor Alastair Redman,Sir,People occasionally ignore the elephant in the room to support their point of view, but in his latest letter, Councillor Alastair Redman has ignored an entire herd in his living room.In his latest rant he states that the SNP is failing councils as the cost of coronavirus could hit more than £ million, but surely these costs would be the same no matter who was in power He also suggests that #essential local services have been underfunded for years# yet fails to mention the years of needless austerity cuts, actioned by his party and their collaborators, to bail out the greedy and risky practices of the banks, which reduced funding to a devastatingly low level in general. It is worth noting that the Scottish Government has put a greater percentage of their curtailed income into NHS Scotland than any part part of the UK. This has helped NHS Scotland to outperform all of the others, in the UK, for the past five years. This is paying idends now.He s to his familiar attempt to insult by referring to citizens who want to take responsibility for making and managing decisions and working to make their country prosper within the priorities set by its citizens as #separatists#. I’m glad to be described as a separatist because the alternative is to be an apologist for an unrepresentative government in Westminster and to abdicate decision making to that same out-of-touch group.It is Councillor Redman’s final point, however, that demonstrates his blinkered sycophancy. His suggestion that the Scottish Government should follow the example of other parts of the UK. Could he really be saying that we should follow the chaotic shambles and incompetence that has emanated from his chums at Westminster  Does he seriously think that any sensible person, irrespective of their own political affiliation and from any of the devolved nations, would swap what their government#s have done for the Westminster model Sadly, nowhere in his missive does Councillor Redman take time to mention the health and safety of our citizens.It is this, together with scientic advice and without political point scoring, that is driving the Scottish Government#s response to this tragic pandemic.Kevin MacKaveney, TarbertSir,Following reports of littering around Argyll and Bute, including the Isle of Islay, the issue was discussed at a recent meeting of Islay Community Council where community councillors heard that items like rubber gloves have been found dumped in ditches.It is always very disappointing to hear about littering and fly-tipping but doubly so in an area like Islay where residents take such an understandable pride in their environment.We also need to bear in mind that items like disposable gloves can pose a threat to livestock. As well as being profoundly antisocial, this kind of behaviour can be positively harmful.Those acting irresponsibly should remember that there can be serious consequences to their thoughtlessness.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSPSir,We all have a role to play in the recovery of the country’s tourism industry after its reopening on July .Scots could help by taking a trip, visiting an attraction or experience, shopping locally, dining out and booking a staycation.Scottish tourism is facing its biggest challenge in a generation and will need financial support for some time to come to help it recover. The Scottish public has a crucial part to play in helping this happen.It#s easy to not think of yourself as a tourist in your own country but many of the experiences that we often enjoy with loved ones, such as holidays, shopping or eating out, all contribute to our visitor economy.July  marked a new era for the industry as we start to welcome back visitors and take our first steps on the road to a safe and responsible recovery. However, reopening won’t be the same for all businesses, many are still adapting to this #new normal#, so it#s important that we recognise that as we move forward to try and restore our industry.We look forward to helping Scots rediscover their own country in a way that is safe for everyone # visitors, residents and those working within the industry. Recovery will require our collective efforts and we must act as one to ensure the best possible outcomes for the whole of the visitor economy.Malcolm Roughead, VisitScotland chief executive"},{"url":null,"title":"the time for change is is now july 17 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThis isn’t really a campaign, it’s just the things that we should all be thinking aboutwe want Argyll # and the world – to be a recognisable place for our children and grandchildren to live in.The economic crisis could be seen as an opportunity to get started on the work that we know needs to happen.I think that many people in Argyll could continue to work from home people who have lost their jobs could be retrained, or use their existing skills, to do the work that is necessary for Argyll to become carbon-neutral. Walking and cycling infrastructure needs to be improved, trees can be planted, and renewable energy can be expanded and made more efficient.Transport and food are the most obvious areas for behavioural change in Argyll. We need to be promoting the benefits of electric cars and making them preferable to petrol or diesel cars.We can easily bring food production and consumption closer together by shopping and eating more locally and more naturally. Farming in Argyll is generally quite low impact, but does not have the capacity to feed everyone in the area, meaning that we have to buy in meat which is less sustainably farmed to make up the dference. If everyone ate only the meat that is produced locally, we could dramatically reduce the emissions caused from the transport of imported meat, as well as supporting our local market and ensuring that it remains natural and sustainable. Reducing food waste is also an easy behavioural change.Acting on climate change is all about thinking of others. Across the globe, the people who see the most adverse effects of climate change so far are those who are already marginalised and vulnerable.Kindness and common decency indicate that we must act with the needs of these people in mind, with the knowledge thatwe do not act, ‘these people’ will soon become us and our children.One thing that I think would make a huge dference would bewe all took #our whole selves# to work with us.Whatworld leaders were constantly thinking: #what would my children say about my role in this decision # This kind of moral thinking would make a huge dference in the future of industry and politics, and the more we educate the next generation, the more influence they will have on their parents.Everyone can make changes such as cutting down on their meat and dairy consumption, shopping locally, re-using plastic containers, recycling, composting, reducing food waste, buying fewer new things, using a renewable energy supplier, and cutting down or cutting out air travel.At the Paris Agreement in ,  nations decided to take measures to limit the global temperature increase to . degrees above pre-industrial levels. Our current behaviour will not allow for this.A rise of  degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels will mean that large areas of land around the equator will be uninhabitable, resulting in huge numbers of refugees fleeing for their survival. Sea level rise caused by the rapid melting of the ice caps will mean that small island states such as Kiribati and Tuvalu will be submerged. The combination of the loss of arable land and ocean acidication due to temperature increase will mean global food shortages, such that we have never seen before.The rich will still be able to buy food, but those who are already marginalised and vulnerable will find it increasingly dficult to access basic amenities like food and clean water, further stretching the inequality gap.It’s not too late to make changes, but it soon will be.We all need to have climate change in the forefront of our minds when making any kind of decision, be it personal or business. It is an omnipresent issue and every decision, however big or small, will have an effect."},{"url":null,"title":"science matters are aircraft vapour trails harmful","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAlthough much reduced by the Coronavirus pandemic, everyone has seen the vapour trails produced by high-flying aircraft as they streak across the sky. But what are they  and are they harmful Officially called contrails , these ephemeral, cloud-like structures are primarily made of ice crystals. They form at altitudes over , metres from water vapour in the aircraft’s engine exhaust as it freezes almost instantaneously at temperatures below minus  degrees celsius. There are, however, plenty of other volatiles and solid components in engine exhaust, including soot particles that often act as a nucleus around which the ice crystals form.Official figures show that air traffic contributes around five per cent of greenhouse gases. Yet these estimates only account for CO emissions. They do not include the effect of contrails, which can persist for hours and even expand into cirrus clouds several miles wide. These clouds, which are most abundant over North America and Europe, trap heat within Earth’s atmosphere, so do they improve our climate or contribute to global warming Air traffic has been steadily increasing year-on-year, so, assuming the coronavirus effect is a temporary one, estimates suggest that the distance flown by passengers will double every  years, and that air traffic will quadruple by . Therefore, it is imperative to determine how the increase in clouds created by contrails might affect us.In a recent study*, scientists used a climate model to analyse the future impact of contrails on climate change, taking into account their predicted increase balanced against any likely changes in engine soot emissions.The results show a three-fold increase in contrail cirrus coverage by , despite a  per cent reduction in soot emissions due to improved fuel and engine efficiency. These predictions cover all major air traffic routes and are mostly due to increased air traffic volume, although a sht to flying at higher altitudes also contributes. The area with the greatest increase will be Eastern Asia, where the largest rise in air traffic is expected.This previously unaccounted for, non-CO, climate impact of air traffic is now reckoned to have a more damaging effect on climate change than all the CO emitted from aircraft engines.*Atmos.

But it has also been a time of positive change and reflection, prompting people to be more creative. Writing, be it poetry, song writing or short stories, for example, has given many a way of making sense of this time, of sharing their feelings and looking after their mental health.For those who have found it dficult to know where to begin, Seil author Kenneth Steven offers this advice to help you start your creative writing journey.For me, there are two essential ingredients when it comes to setting out as a creative writer: time and space. By creative writing I mean poetry, short stories, novels and children’s writing: everything involving the use of the imagination.When someone claims they don’t have time to write, I don’t believe them as it’s a question of making time.PD James started writing when nursing a dying husband: he needed care all through the day. There was a part of the night when finally he went to sleep and she had the chance to put pen to paper, so that was what she did. If we are serious about wanting to write, we will make time.For many years I lived in Dunkeld, close to the entrance to the cathedral. When friends heard my address they would roll their eyes and say: ‘What a place to be. And you’re lucky enough to be a writer.’Except it wasn’t that easy. The truth is the modern world invaded even that idyllic corner of Scotland.First, there were thousands of pilgrim feet and voices. I was driven mad by not being able to find sufficient quiet. My former we watched a great deal of television. It was a tiny flat and the distant murmur of low voices maddened me because I couldn’t concentrate.It was she who suggested # probably to stop the grumbling # that I should have a cabin built in my mother’s garden in Aberfeldy, a place where I could hide away to write. After considering the idea for a few days, I realised she was right.When finally I sat down to start working in that simple shed among the trees, the words poured from the pen. I will never forget those first days. Poem after poem appeared as though by magic on the page. For me # and after many years of leading creative writing sessions, I would suggest for the vast majority of others too # finding real quiet makes all the dference.But it doesn’t have to be a hideaway in a garden it can be a living room or a bedroom or an attic – just at a time when others in the household are asleep or absent.There are few rules for creative writers, but one I have discovered is that we are all larks or owls. We’re either attracted to early morning or late evening.I have yet to meet anyone who has said they’re drawn to the mid-afternoon # what I term # hammock time, though that’s when I wrote in the Aberfeldy cabin. I’ve come to believe strongly you will use the time you are given. If that’s what you have, you will adapt to that rhythm.But I quickly came to realise in my cabin that I couldn’t simply turn on good writing like a tap. We go into our creative space weighed down by the modern world. We live lives beset by emails, phone calls and text messages. We are all expected to respond quickly.I think creative writers are generally poor when it comes to practice writing. The creative lives of visual artists, actors, singers and musicians are dominated by practice. Why should it be dferent for those from the writing community What do I mean by practice writing  Describing the view out of the window going back into memory to capture a moment as evocatively as possible imagining a dialogue between two characters. There’s no end to the possibilities. What practice writing provides is creative grounding. It brings us from being all over the place in our minds to give us creative focus.What this practice allows us to do is to start, then to pour ourselves into what I like to call deep writing. It creates a kind of doorway so the real writing can begin.Kenneth Steven is best-known as a poet. Sixteen of his collections have been published and he writes and presents poetry-related programmes for BBC Radio. He is also a Scottish novelist and children’s author. He’s written two handbooks on writing and led workshops and worked as writer in residence at home and abroad. www.kennethsteven"},{"url":null,"title":"if walls could talk","story":"Susan WindramUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsStrachur Smiddy opened its doors again on Saturday, August , after an uncertain few months due to Covid-.The museum will only be open on Saturdays and Sundays, until Sunday September , but for now families can again enjoy stepping back in time in the th-century blacksmith’s smiddy, which has been carefully repaired and restored to its original state and now acts as a working museum with with forge, bellows and anvil, cobbled floor, tools of the trade and beamed ceiling.Browse through the Smiddy’s collection of fascinating artefacts and tools.

Keep your wall colours neutral, like white and grey, but use your curtains, bedding and cushions to inject splashes of colour.Buying new bedding and hanging a new set of curtains can cost a lot less than a few tins of paint once you factor in all the rollers and brushes yoursquoll need to buy, plus it will take less time too.Once yoursquove bought the cushions, next time yoursquore thinking about changing the colour, just buy new covers and match the size of the cushions. That means you can store the others away, pass them on to a friend or use them in another room.Donrsquot forget about artwork. You can find some really trendy prints online and IKEA is great for cheap frames too. Make sure you buy the same size prints each time, meaning you can keep the same frames. You can update the frames easily too with a cheap can of spray paint.Canrsquot afford a new carpet  Yoursquoll be amazed at what a good deep clean and adding a colourful or patterned rug can do.If your furniture is looking a bit tired, upcycle with a lick of paint and new door handles. You can pick up a tin of furniture paint from most hardware stores or online and you can buy cute, quirky doorknobs from eBay or Etsy, or even just try spray painting the existing ones.Metal accessories like curtain rods and light fittings can benefit from that spray paint too!Upcycling is a great way to keep costs low, give a much loved item a new lease of le and is good for the environment by cutting out waste.Living roomMoving on to the most used room in the house, this can be the most dficult to update as it no doubt has many uses. From the TV room to the playroom to the dining room, your living space probably needs to be more practical than anything .

With recycling centres and charity shops open again therersquos no excuse. Spend the weekend sorting through any unwanted items and donate where you can.For storage solutions, you need to think outside the box ndash literally. Vacuum bags are ideal, they normally come in multipacks of ious sizes and are really cheap. Great for anything soft that is taking up a lot of space. Winter clothes, quilts and blankets can be reduced to a tenth of the size and slide under the bed nicely.If floor space is a problem, then the sky is the limit. Consider storing items that arenrsquot needed on a regular basis above units or wardrobes. Think about shelving units that are tall and slim, rather than long and bulky.Cheap and cheerful plastic, canvas or cardboard boxes can help to keep everything in place while adding a splash of colour and style. Perfect for keeping clutter off the floor.Shelves above radiators are a great way to use otherwise wasted space.If the kids are desperate for some space, a reading nook or kids study area can easily be achieved under the stairs or a window. A simple storage box with a couple of cushions on top will create a comfy seat and can double up as extra storage.Hooks can be attached to pretty much anything like bedroom doors and inside cupboards ndash again keeping items off the floor will create the illusion of more space. In the kitchen, using hooks to hang pots and pans and magnets for knives can free up cupboard space and make a statement.Knowing where things are is half the battle when considering storage options, so think about clear plastic boxes or bags that are easy to see into and can be labelled.Flexible furniture like extendable dining tables, sofa beds and even clothes rails are ideal as they have multiple uses and can be stored away easily when not in use.Let there be lightLighting and mirrors are your friends when it comes to making a smaller room feel bigger. Change large floor lamps for smaller wall lights and when it comes to wall colour, stick to pale colours and swap out heavy curtains with blinds. Luckily, a big tub of value white paint goes a long way. Let in as much light as possible, give the windows a good scrub and update yellowing lightbulbs to bright white.OutdoorsIs it time to rethink that huge sofa set and professional sized goal posts  When buying furniture, think small, light and foldable so that they can be stored away in a shed or cupboard or easily moved around. Updating your garden furniture doesnrsquot need to cost the earth, yoursquoll find some really great bargain sets in supermarkets like Aldi, Asda and Tesco and homeware stores like BM.Another way to make it feel bigger is to simply give it a good tidy. Yoursquoll be surprised at how much space you do have after clearing out those unwanted flowerpots, cutting the grass and trimming back the hedges.Your home is an investment, to be enjoyed for a long time and with these simple but effective ideas, you can enjoy the space you have for longer."},{"url":null,"title":"young-people-scotland-can-get-250-free-starting-new-job","story":"Young people across Scotland could be in line for as much as pound free from the Government for starting a new job, thanks to a new benefit.Its hoped the payment, which is open for applications from today, will help young people with the financial dficulties of starting a new job - including buying new clothes, travel and get childcare.It is estimated around  young people will benefit from the new financial support in its first year.What is the benefit The Job Start Payment is a one-off sum of pound for  to -year-oldsthey have been unemployed for at least six months.The upper age limit rises to  for care leavers and the payment increases to poundthe person has a child.How can I qualy for the payment To qualy for the payment, which will be delivered by Social Security Scotland, the person applying must have received a job offer for paid employment.They must be out of paid work and must have been receiving one of the qualying benefits for six months or more at the time of the job offer:Income-based Jobseekerrsquos AllowanceIncome SupportIncome-related Employment and Support AllowanceUniversal CreditWhat has the Scottish Government said Social Security Secretary Shirley-Anne Somerville said: ldquoI am delighted that our Job Start Payment is today now open for applications it really couldnrsquot come at a better time to support our young people to take up job offers.ldquoYoung people are among those whose job prospects have been hardest hit by this pandemic.

keep up standardsthe workers involved were reduced so drastically.Benny Rankin, GMB Scotland organiser, said: ldquoWe are doing all we can to assist our members affected by these redundancies but

vision for the future of this course.Musselburgh Racecourse was run jointly by East Lothian Council and Lothians Racing Syndicate for more than a decade under the Musselburgh Joint Racing Committee.However, issues within the committee led to the British Horseracing Authority demanding an independent inquiry into its governance, which revealed a toxic relationship had developed between the two parties.The council set up Musselburgh Racing Associated Committeendash a new governance body ndash to oversee it as it sought a third-party operator to take over the management of the

the Tesco store off Olivebank Road.He claimed that the drive-thru, which would operate  hours a day, seven days a week, would be ldquonext to the most congested roundabout in the county.The former SNP councillor for Musselburgh West said: ldquoTragically,  local objectors and , petitioners have less value than the share value of these gigantic corporations.He called on councillors on the planning committee, which will debate the proposal on Tuesday, to halt the ldquobetrayal.Mr McAllister also lodged a formal objection, citing a range of concerns including traffic congestion, pollution, litter, obesity, residential amenity and economic damage.He claimed: ldquoThe custom predicted for this -hour McDonaldrsquos drive-thru and the intensity of the declared deliveries needed to service it are on an industrial scale. The impact on Olivebank Road would be truly calamitous.The plan will go before a lsquovirtualrsquo meeting of the planning committee after being called off the delegated list by ward councillor Stuart Currie because of the level of local concern.He said: ldquoI have called this application off the list to ensure that all the concerns raised by local residents are discussed and elected members can understand not only the strength of feeling but also the planning issues that exist as a result of this application.Musselburgh  Inveresk Community Council has lodged an objection, citing traffic congestion, emissions, and the facilityrsquos close proximity to local schools as concerns.A public campaign lsquoNo McDonaldrsquos in Musselburghrsquo was also launched in a bid to halt the plan, highlighting concerns such as increased traffic congestion, litter and air pollution.The planning report stated that there were  written representations to the application and, of these,  were objections.It said: ldquoThe councilrsquos road services advise they accept the conclusions of the traffic network modelling exercise, that the traffic impact associated with the proposed development would be minimal and there would be no adverse impact on the operation of the local highway network.ldquoMany written objections are made on the grounds of the proximity of the proposed drive-thru restaurant to Musselburgh Grammar School, and that such a facility promotes unhealthy eating and thus would lead to harmful health consequences.ldquoThe East Lothian Local Development Plan  does not contain any policies restricting the location of drive-thru restaurant facilities to a certain distance from schools, or any other educational establishments. Nor does it contain any policies relating to unhealthy eating or the health consequences of proposed developments. Thus, and in the absence of national guidance on health consequences of proposed developments, no signicant weight can be given to these matters.The report added: ldquoOn the matter of air quality, the public health and environmental protection officer advised that the proposed development was anticipated to result in up to  customer vehicles visiting the premises daily, which was a signicant number of additional vehicles given the proximity of site to the Air Quality Management Areaon Musselburgh High Street.The officer agreed with the conclusion of McDonaldrsquos Air Quality Assessment that impacts upon air quality at ldquosensitive receptors would not be signicant. The officer advised that, whilst it was acknowledged that additional traffic would have an impact upon queuing and reduce traffic speeds, the composition of the increased traffic would be from passenger cars, which are less polluting than HGVs and buses.The officer concluded that the proposed development would have ldquono harmful impact on air quality nor on the objectives of the AQMA and would not harm the amenity of the area.A McDonaldrsquos spokesperson said: ldquoWe look forward to progressing with this application and believe a new McDonaldrsquos would bring signicant investment to the local community, as well as create at least  new jobs.A supporting statement from the company added: ldquoThere are few restaurants in the country who can claim to have made so many positive changes to support healthier lestyles. McDonaldrsquos believe that the lessons they have learned in making these changes can be used to support a wider drive to reduce obesity.Planners are recommending the plan be approved with a number of conditions, including submission of litter and pest management plans.A council spokesperson declined to comment, saying the planning committee would consider the application next week."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-forces-postponement-brunton-pantomime","story":"Theatre organisers were looking forward to presenting the family favourite Aladdin during the festive period.But they have taken the ldquoextremely dficult decision to postpone the show until .A Brunton spokesperson said: ldquoThe Brunton is closely following Government advice as it becomes available.ldquoThe importance of having socially distanced measures in place once live performances are able to take place again will be crucial for the safety of our customers, staff, cast and freelance creative team.ldquoThese measures will mean that the audience size for live performances at The Brunton will be vastly reduced.\"The live interactive family experience which The Brunton panto delivers will also be affected.Last years pantomime was Cinderella.Michael Stitt, chairman of The Brunton Theatre Trust, said: ldquoIt is with great sadness that we announce the postponement of our  pantomime.ldquoThe Brunton panto is a much-loved tradition that is central to many peoplersquos festive celebrations ndash a tradition that we enjoy bringing to le every year.ldquoWe are aware that, although this is the right decision to take, it affects many ndash the cast, crew, and creatives that make the show every year, The Brunton staff and, of course, our wonderful audiences who join us to shout out at the baddies and laugh along with the dame.ldquoSo letrsquos think of it merely as a postponement, not a cancellation, of our treasured panto.

E-bikes offer a greater mileage for commuting with less physical effort required and a safer means of physical distancing.ldquoE-bike public hire stations, which will be managed by another company, will be installed in Musselburgh at the Brunton Hall and next to Musselburgh Train Station in autumn.ldquoE-bike hire areas in other towns across East Lothian are proposed. In addition, discussions are ongoing with local bike shop businesses as to how they can support the public hire scheme.Public Bike Shareschemes have been introduced across the world, with many using docks which lock the bicycles in and release them for a small fee or with use of a card to users however, their success in the UK has been limited, with vandalism a major concern.In London, Santander Cycles operates a successful scheme which has spread to Swansea and Milton Keynes, with users issued a key to access the bicycles, which cost pound and allow free use for the first  minutes and then charge pound for every additional  minutes.East Lothian Council said that as well as Musselburgh, there were plans to have public hire stations for e-bikes in Haddington town centre and at Prestonpans Railway Station, Longniddry Railway Station, Memorial Square in Prestonpans, Civic Square in Tranent and Memorial Park in Cockenzie, each of which would have capacity for eight bikes.East Lothian MP Kenny MacAskill described the changes as ldquoreclaiming the streets.He said: ldquoThis is a challenge but equally an opportunity, offering other public health improvements, as well as the required social distancing. Reducing air pollution and promoting walking and cycling will have benefits for us all. Providing adequate car parking remains essential, with vehicular access understandably restricted. Itrsquos not easy but it can be done. As communities on the continent have discovered, people reclaiming their streets has benefits for all.Iain Gray, East Lothian MSP, said: ldquoThe substantial increase in the number of people walking and cycling, both locally and across the UK, was one of the positive unintended consequences of lockdown.ldquoThis clearly brings benefits for both the health of the iniduals doing more walking and cycling, and for the environmentit means fewer vehicles on our roads.ldquoTherefore, I welcome measures to encourage and support the continuation of this growth in walking and cycling as we move out of lockdown.ldquoHowever, changes must be designed and implemented with ongoing consultation with the local communities affected.In a report to councillors, Peter Forsyth, the councilrsquos assets manager, revealed ambitions to make the most of the side effects of lockdown.He said: ldquoThe Covid- shutdown has resulted in less air pollution and reduced greenhouse gas emissions primarily due to extensive travel restrictions. Other positive impacts have included reduced energy consumption, and increased walking and cycling. Accordingly, there are opportunities for a lsquoGreen Recoveryrsquo, adapting to new ways of working with increased changes to travel behaviour all in support to the transition to a low carbon economy and low carbon lestyles for the longer term that will enable us to continue to tackle the climate emergency.A council spokesperson said: ldquoAs part of Spaces for People, we are proposing the installation of e-bikes in suitable locations. E-bikes are becoming increasingly popular as an active travel option which could be potentially attractive as an alternative form of clean, green transportation.

This is how I heard about an otter at the Esk for the first time three years ago.A few people mentioned they had seen this elusive creature a few years ago, but never since.The otter became my new photography challenge. I tried visiting the river at dferent times of the day, especially at dawn and dusk, when otters are more active, always trying to keep the noise down to a minimum.After two years of searching, my hope was gone and I almost gave up. Until one sunny day in April during lockdownhellipThe weather that day was enjoyable, so Chris and I decided to go on a walk. The local path was very busy the dog walkers, cyclists, families with children and joggers were enjoying the sun whilst social distancing.As always, I kept my eyes low on the water hoping to see the kingfisher.As we followed the river upstream to the area at The Grove, I spotted something moving in the water.I grabbed Chrisrsquo hand and I pulled him down on the ground right behind a bush.It was not a kingfisher but something I did not expect to see in the middle of the day... an otter fishing!We managed to crawl down the slope and lie down so we would not disturbit.Whilst I was photographing the otter, I also heard a cheery pee-pee-pee and saw the kingfisher flying past the otter. What a day!Since then I have seen the otter a couple more times.The Eurasian otter is a secretive, semi-aquatic species with chocolate brown fur, webbed feet, and a powerful tail. Their thick coats are built of two layers of fur: an inner layer that works as insulation, and the outer, waterproof layer. The two-layered system prevents their skin from direct contact with water and subsequent temperature loss.Their nostrils and ears stay closed as otters swim underwater.Despite being excellent swimmers, they cannot hold their breath underwater for long periods the average time underwater is about  seconds as they e.Otters are solitary, territorial animals, that live in underground holes called lsquoholtsrsquo.

Butthe free traders and corporate influencers in Westminster get their way and deregulate the law that currently governs genetic engineering there, gene edited foods could be green lighted, unlabelled, for English plates, so that most people wouldnrsquot realise that they were eating them.Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland would then be put under heavy international corporate pressure to do the same.Like the old guard, now stigmatised, genetically modiedfood before it, with its unhappy history of failures to deliver and creation of new problems, such as the creation of herbicide-resistant super-weeds, proponents of gene editing spin futuristic yarns about all the miracles theyrsquore rustling up for us.Less starchy potatoes and corn, pork from super-muscly pigs, spicy tomatoes, and mushrooms that resist browning, are some front runners. In fact the mushrooms have already bypassed US Department of Agriculture regulation.How can this second wave of genetically engineered foods be a realistic prospect when the first lot were so unpopular in the UK and the EU that the general public shunned them Proponents claim that gene editing is a precise, safe technology with predictable outcomes. Sound familiar  They say that theyrsquore only making very small changes to the genetic make-up of foods, merely mimicking what might happen through natural mutation.Tellingly, they seek patents for these altered foods. Patents are only grantedyou can show an inventive step that is man-made. So claims that gene editing is simply causing changes that could happen naturally go out the window.Donrsquot worry, though, they assure us that gene editing carries no more risk than conventional breeding. In fact, there is no evidence to support this blaseacute assertion because no feeding studies have been carried out in either humans or animals.Along with scientists from around the world, I attended a briefing on gene editing led by the London-based molecular geneticist Dr Michael Antoniou. It left me deeply concerned. He flagged up the growing body of gold standard scientic research that highlights the unintended and potentially dangerous risks that gene edited foods pose. Far from being precise and predictable, these lab-based, articial interventions damage plant or animal DNA, not just at the intended site of the genetic alteration, but where.For instance, it emerged last year that a hornless bull gene edited by a Minnesota company was unintentionally contaminated by bacterial genes from another species. https:www.technologyreview     recombinetics-gene-edited-hornless-cattle-major-dna-screwup Gene editing alters how genes , which can create new allergens and toxins.

Question : who said: ldquoI am sorry  Was it a Gavin Williamson or b John Swinney  Question : who said: ldquoI would like to apologise to all those young people whorsquove been affected by this. Was it a Gavin Williamson or b John Swinney You get where Irsquom going with this, donrsquot you  The answer to all the questions is: it doesnrsquot matter because they are interchangeable. On the question of the initial results, both Nicola Sturgeon and Boris Johnson defended them at first. Ms Sturgeon said they were ldquocredible Mr Johnson said they were ldquorobust.This was then followed by remarkably similar protests from pupils. In Scotland, they held up placards that said ldquoI am not a postcode. In England they held up placards that said ldquoI am not a postcode.Then came the apologies. Mr Swinney said: ldquoWe now accept that the risk of undermining the value of qualications is outweighed by a concern that young people, particularly from working class backgrounds, may lose faith in education. Mr Williamson said: ldquoIt became increasingly apparent that there were too many young people that quite simply hadnt got the grade they truly deserved.\"Some people say the two situations are dferent they say the UK Government should have seen what was coming because of the fiasco in Scotland and I understand that to an extent. But to suggest that the Scottish Government handled the situation well and the UK Governmentrsquos approach was chaos is misleading. Look at the trajectories Irsquove outlined above: theyrsquore the same.The dference is our reaction. When the fiasco first hit in England and the Tories stood by the exam results, I was texted by a colleague of mine who insisted on voting Yes in  despite me telling him not to. His text contrasted the responses of the Tories and the SNP. The SNP, he said, admitted they screwed up, whereas the Tories dug their heels in. There was similar reaction on Twitter: ldquoat least the SNP had the grace to accept they were wrong and apologise.So when the Tories also apologised I texted my colleague back. Presumably, I asked him pompously, you now have the same respect for the Tory U-turn as you had for the SNP one  ldquoBetter late than never, he replied. ldquoBut they dragged their feet for days hellip and its yet another U-turn. They are very good at them, arent they I know a lot of you will agree with my colleague, but itrsquos me whorsquos writing this column, not him, so I get the last word and itrsquos this: the Tory apology in England reveals how biased we are in Scotland. If we trust someone ndash and a lot of people in Scotland trust the SNP ndashwersquore willing to give them the benefit of the doubt and accept their apology. Equally,we do not like someone ndash and a lot of people in Scotland do not like the Tories ndash wersquore more likely to judge them and dismiss their apology as too little too late.The word for all of this is bias and thatrsquos fine in a way because wersquore all guilty of it ndash we are all more likely to react to people rather than facts. But bias operates even when the facts are the same: I refer you the facts outlined above ndash they are the same. Some people may say the bias towards the SNP is well founded: theyrsquove governed Scotland well. They may also say the bias against the Tories is well-founded: look at their record.

The leader of its family policy unit is Cristina Odone, former editor of The Catholic Herald. As such its , among others, is to shore up classic Conservative family values, at the heart of which is marriage. Sadly, the present Prime Minister seems not to have received the memo.Setting aside for the moment the religious and political leanings of those behind this report, its conclusions show the stark and widening gulf between the married well-off and the unmarried poor. Medicine has long recognised the advantages ndash especially to men ndash of tying the knot, but the CSJrsquos findings focus on the enormous benefit that marriage bestows not on the couple, but on their children.Despite being lauded by David Cameron as ldquoa great institution, few subjects have been more ripe for ridicule. The butt of stand-ups down the ages, matrimony is the gag that never stops giving. It can be plumbed endlessly for laughs by the cynical, the wry, the embittered and the romantic. Yet the conclusions of the Centre for Social Justicersquos report are anything but funny.Their statistics show that those on low incomes are far less keen to wed than the wealthy. Once children are born, cohabiting parents are almost four times more likely to separate before a child is five than married parents. The health and educational attainment of children with broken family backgrounds are worse, and their likelihood of having a criminal conviction by the age of  doublestheir parents separated before they were five.These statistics certainly cast matrimony in a starkly black and white light. And it gets worse. The middle classes are not only more likely to marry, but % of high earners do so, compared to % of the poorest. If a straight line can be drawn between cohabitation and unstable family relationships, that is bad news for youngsters from disadvantaged backgrounds. Butmarriage truly is the key factor in this downward trajectory,a set of vows and a certicate and a wedding video is the glue that holds the middle classes together, then that is a whole other issue. Suddenly a custom that previously was prevalent across the classes is in danger of becoming a status symbol. Marriage, by this calculation, is synonymous with money.I grew up in the wake of the Beatles and the moon landing, when walking down the aisle was no longer essential, evenyou hoped to have children. Nevertheless the stigma of cohabiting, or becoming parents before you wore a wedding ring, took a long time to fade. When finally it became commonplace society grew more civilised, acknowledging that couples didnrsquot require an official document to take themselves, and be taken, seriously. Cohabiting was no more a byword for casual than marrying was for happy. Yet now, it is deemed a red flag for social disadvantage.The direct correlation between marriage and class suggests that money is at least part of the explanation. Those who are strapped for cash either consider it irrelevant, or not for the likes of them. And the more it is perceived to be for the better off, the less it will appeal to people further down the social spectrum.You canrsquot help wonderingthe wedding industry, as opposed to marriage itself, has created expectations that the hard-up simply cannot meet. With the average Scottish wedding now costing over a staggering pound,, this comes as no surprise. Increasingly the concept of marrying is bound up with the wedding. The status of the couple and their families is proclaimed by the nature of the ceremony, the wedding venue, and the sumptuousness of the reception. Not to mention stag and hen weekends and parties beforehand.It takes at least a year, and usually a lot longer, to book, plan and save for the big day. Ultimately, though, what matters is not the trappings, but making the vows, whether in a religious setting, or a registry office. The seriousness of the bond lies in the couplersquos decision to commit to each other, not in any of the hoopla that follows. Perhaps it is time to separate the legal procedure from the carnival that follows, to consciously uncouple the act of union from this crippling cost.Yet the nub of the problem identied by CSJ is not marriage itself, but hardship. Those living on the bread line do not have the resources, and possibly donrsquot have the inclination, to get officially tied. Given the serious disadvantages suffered when they separate, the answer, surely, is not to coax iniduals into wedlock, asit were the panacea for all their ails, but to digny cohabiting couples and their offspring with the same legal safeguards and tax breaks as those who marry. Protecting the rights of children and parents ndash especially mothers, who commonly look after the kids once a relationship ends ndash would give them a financial safety-net. Many of the outcomes for youngsters described in this report ndash gang membership, criminality, mental and physical health issues ndash are as much the result of penury as the lack of a piece of paper supposedly binding their parents forever.If it is to retain its meaning, marriage has to be a personal choice, not a virtuous act that deserves a reward. It can be done cheaply and quietly, as I can testy, or with terric fanfare, or it can be avoided altogether. Either way, in an enlightened world those in long-term relationships, and couples with children, should be treated by government in exactly the same way as the married. Until that day ndash far off, I fear ndash the gulf between the haves and the have nots will steadily deepen, eroded by a judgemental, moralising and, as wersquove too often seen, hypocritical state.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

Tory commentators and many MPs are deeply dischuffed with Mr Johnson, and not just because his Government made an even worse cock-up of the exams than the Scottish Government. Negotiations resumed this week over the withdrawal agreement with the European Union, and it is safe to say that expectations among the Conservative faithful are not high.Indeed, Brexiter Tory MPs, like Iain Duncan Smith, fully expect a sell-out. They think Mr Johnson is preparing to accept a whole range of EU regulations even after we have left. This means no trade deals with free market America, no state aid to key industries, no low tax havens and a ldquobetrayal of fishing.Tory MPs hoped that Boris would be tough on immigration, would cut taxes and rein back bureaucracy, while tackling political correctness and the nanny state. What they got was a bicycling PM who seems to be tough on motorists, not illegals. He has adopted what the Spectator columnist Christopher Snowden, calls ldquopurse-lipped, micro-managing, finger-wagging, lemon-sucking, censorious, anti-business, killjoy policies like the campaigns on obesity and sugar.Not in their wildest dreams did true blue Tories expect their chosen one to increase public spending by more than any Labour government since . Yet, this Government is currently paying the wages of half the working population through furlough, benefits and public sector employment. UK debt is now pound trillion. Thank God Margaret Thatcher is not alive to see it.Mr Johnson hasnrsquot even delivered on scrapping HS, the fast rail line that most Tory MPs think is a white elephant. Instead, he is fantasising about building bridges between Scotland and Northern Ireland. Yet that is not going to keep the Union together. His Brexit deal, it is now clear, has created a gulf between the UK and Northern Ireland.The province has remained in regulatory alignment with the European Unionrsquos single market, which means that there must be the very border checks the PM promised would never happen. Worse, it has handed the SNP a genuine grievance: being denied access to markets with which Northern Ireland can trade seamlessly.Tories are appalled by Mr Johnsonrsquos lack of urgency on Scotland as support for independence grows. The former Tory leader, William Hague, said this week thatthe PM doesnrsquot get his act together the UK will be finished within five years. Tories like Mr Hague think he allowed Nicola Sturgeon to play politics with the coronavirus.What they didnrsquot anticipate was the cack-handed and contradictory approach taken by the UK Government. At first, the lockdown seemed to appeal to the British wartime spirit, which always goes down well on the Right. But far from winning a victory over this viral enemy, Britain has recorded the worst excess death rate in Europe and now the deepest recession.Most Conservatives loath the imposition of masks, which the Daily Mail commentator, Peter Hitchens, calls ldquomuzzles, and which libertarians think are pointless impediments. Many Tory voters spend their holidays in France and the letters columns are full of people complaining about being forced back to Blighty even from regions of France where Covid is almost non-existent.Yet this Conservative Government kept Britainrsquos airports open during the worst phase of the pandemic, allowing  million travellers to come to Britain largely unchecked, including a number from Covid hot spots like Italy and China. And donrsquot even mention track and trace.The exams debacle was the final straw. Tory MPs want the head of the Education Secretary, Gavin Williamson, on a plate for his chaotic U-turn, but the real criticism is of the Prime Minister. He should surely have seen this coming after the chaos in Scotland. It seems to many asMr Johnson isnrsquot really in charge.His presentation has been lamentable, and even is greatest fans are disappointed with his bumbling delivery and lack of grip. He was never a detail man, and everyone knew he flew by the seat of his pants ndash thatrsquos when he managed to keep them on.Conservatives are pretty forgiving to politicians who think like they do, have the same instincts on nation and values. What is especially damaging is a growing sense that Mr Johnson is just not really a Conservative at all. They expected him to take a tough line with the statue topplers and culture warriors of Black Lives Matters. But instead of banging heads, he avoided confrontation and made only a routine condemnation of vandalism. He allowed Winston Churchill himself to be boxed up in Parliament Square. How could it come to this Part of the problem, I think, is that many Conservatives believed what Labour said about Mr Johnson ndash that he was a bit of a racist, misogynist, homophobic right winger. The most ldquoright-wing prime minister in British history as Labourrsquos John Mc Donnell called him. This he never was.Colourful phrases about Burqa-wearers looking like letter boxes does not a white supremacist make. When he was London mayor, he was careful to keep the black and ethnic community onside and he used to lead LGBT marches wearing a pink stetson. When he became PM he installed more BAME ministers than all previous UK governments combined. You wont hear Mr Johnson using Daily Mail rhetoric about immigrants, he genuinely believes in state intervention and he is quietly a bit of a Europhile. Far from being a free market ideologue, Boris Johnson is a liberal, patrician Tory ndash more like Michael Heseltine, Brexit aside, than Margaret Thatcher.The final insult was this Tory Prime Minister ennobling Claire Fox, a former Revolutionary Communist who used to support the objectives of the IRA. That was the final straw. As the Tory commentator Brian Monteith put it, many Conservatives now feel that they ldquovoted Boris and got Corbyn.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

It was not plain sailing for me, either. Stilettos were not ideally suited for my afternoon duties as centre-half for Blantyre Celtic.This recollection of me as Bambi on horse anaesthetic is highly analogous to my faltering steps into Fidelmarsquos fiefdom. This bailiwick is guarded by an imperious Afghan hound, seems to have a lingering scent of jasmine and the soft echo of the pop of something sparkling.There is a straightforward choice when invading this space. Does one mumble something inane  Or does one acknowledge the absence of Fidelma and confront it head-on with the stark but sincere crudity of a Glasgow kiss  I have only reluctantly discarded the inanities option since it is, after all, my superpower. It has, though, been overwhelmed by the realisation there is something important to be said about absence, particularly in the case of one, specic columnist.There was a moment last week when I read the words of Fidelmarsquos son and was hit by an epiphany with the force of that aforementioned Glasgow kiss. His account of a draining trip to visit his mother in hospital contained what is called a vignette. .It was this: the weary traveller confronts ailing mum. He asks a question. There is no immediate answer. Has he not been recognised \"Was it my face mask  Was she so sick that she did not recognise mehellip  It felt like minutes had passed before she mumbled weakly through her mask, lsquoYou could have at least worn a shirt and maybe some white shorts. Itrsquos such a waste to see you dress badly like the French.rsquo\"Regressing to my superpower of uttering banalities, I told myself that many of her readers would similarly be unacquainted with Fidelma in the narrow terms of physical meetings, private conversations.This points to the brilliance of a certain kind of newspaper column. There are many columnists who make extraordinary claims about their work. They can be the Voice of Anything From Reason To Football to Interpretation of Sanskrit Scrolls.One famous financial columnist was once told by a sub-editor that his latest offering was unintelligible. \"I am writing for three people in England,\" the columnist replied. \"And you are not one of them.\" The three comprised the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the governor of the Bank of England and the permanent under-secretary to the Treasury, apparently. This story sounds so authentic to an old hack that it might almost be true.It is certainly irrefutable that many columns totter uneasily on the twin pillars of certainty and unbridled preaching, both based on a solid foundation of ego.Now, Fidelma may be read by the Chancellor of the Exchequer or, I suspect, by the First Minister. But she is not writing for him or her. She is writing for herself. She takes her le with its routine humiliations, its senseless pain and its occasional, and overwhelming joy and presents it to us with an eloquence that is only superseded by her bravery. She tells us every Saturday how she is feeling as a dog sulks, bones complain and her house gently falls down around her.There is anger, contentment, bitterness, resignation, humour, sadness, happiness and even consolation in all of this. The dog finally comes in. The pain usually subsides. And the house  Well, who cares  Itrsquos a house, it has a fridge, it hosts a glass and there is a tincture of something pleasantly numbing in its deepest interior.We ndash or certainly I ndash read all this with a sense of bright satisfaction that sometimes belies the darkness of some of the content. This is because I have been privileged to have been invited into a le. We can share an unflinching gaze at the reality of ageing. As that great Scottish philosopher, Billy Connolly, once intoned: lsquoOld age is not for softies.rsquoThis toughness in Fidelma is enhanced at both her realisation of this truth and her defiance in the face of it. Her superpower, though, is somewhat miraculous. Think of this. A woman lies across the water, fighting against illness. Thousands of people who have never met her, from Bargeddie to Bearsden, from Callander to Cumnock and Carrbridge, wish her well.This offers welcome proof of the capacity for compassion, of the boundless ability we have to reach out to others. We care about a person we have never met. This is a tribute to Fidelmarsquos writing. But it is more than that. Most wondrously, it is a recognition of the trials and triumphs of a shared humanity articulated by a single voice.Thatrsquos some trick, Fidelma.

Politicians need to be honest and accept that Covid is a fact of le like cancer, heart disease, stroke and the many other illnesses that kill hundreds of Scots each week ndash for these we take proportionate measures to tackle them, but not measures that cause far more long-term harm than good.The continued refusal of Ms Sturgeon to have a truly adult,not dficult, conversation about our future shows she is not fit to lead us forward ndash that she is by design consigning tens of thousands of people to the unemployment scrap heap  her partys call to extend furlough is a thinly veiled acceptance of that.

Steps need to be taken to prevent people without good and veriable cause for not wearing a mask from entering shops and malls.I accept that this may be harder for small shops to apply, but at least supermarkets and shopping malls with security staff need to implement a no mask, no entry rule.

Public donations have now reached pound,, including a crowdfunding campaign that has so far raised about pound, from more than , donors.An online Hen Harrier Day hosted by television presenters Chris Packham and step-daughter Megan McCubbin raised pound,, and the John Muir Trust has also donated pound, ndash but new major funders are now essential to the schemersquos success.Margaret Pool, chairwoman of the Langholm Initiative, said: ldquoThe Carman Family Foundationrsquos tremendous pound, support for the Langholm Moor Community Buyout is a major boost, and couldnrsquot have come at a better time.

Langholm, once dubbed the ldquoMuckle Toon for its growing population and bustling mills, has seen decades of economic decline through the loss of textile manufacturing.The Langholm Initiative says the prospective buyout offers the community the chance ldquoto decide its own future for the first time.It has asked the Scottish Land Fund to extend its October deadline, while Benny Higgins, executive chairman of Buccleuch, has also written to the Fund to express its support for an extension.The buyout project is also supported by leading charities including Borders Forest Trust, Rewilding Britain, RSPB Scotland, Trees for Le, and the Woodland Trust.The Carman Family Foundation was set up to assist with projects that both enhance bioersity and encourage people to gain knowledge and enjoyment from the newly enhanced land."},{"url":null,"title":"issue-day-ub40-reunion-no-way","story":"UB The reggae pop band, which formed in Birmingham in , were one of the biggest acts of the s and s, finding global success with hit songs such as rsquos Red, Red Wine and rsquos duet with Chrissie Hynde, I Got You Babe, as well as rsquos I Canrsquot Help Falling in Love With You.

This is not a normal year: the UK was faced with tackling coronavirus and saving lives and it meant effectively shutting down large parts of the economy and paying almost  million people not to go to work, at a cost of poundbillion so far. But from August, employers have had to start contributing towards the cost of furlough and the scheme is expected to end in October. The question is: what then The Chancellor Rishi Sunak says there is no possibility of an extension because of the economic cost and he points out that most other countries are making similar moves to phase out their schemes. But one country that isnrsquot is Germany. The government there is expected to announce next week that it will extend Kurzarbeit, which was the model for furlough, from  months to two years and the reason the finance minister Olaf Scholz gave was clear. ldquoThe corona crisis wonrsquot suddenly disappear in the next few weeks, he said.The German finance ministerrsquos logic is hard to refute. The economic damage done by coronavirus will not stop suddenly in October just because the Chancellor has stopped the furlough scheme ndash indeed, the end of furlough will deepen the trouble for many employers and itrsquos likely the real nature and scale of the economic crisis will only become obvious then. There are some businesses that would be perfectly viable in normal circumstances that may go underfurlough is abruptly ended.The picture also looks grim for particular sectors that continue to be badly hit. Some remain completely shut down ndash the countryrsquos theatres and concert venues for example. Others, such as pubs and restaurants, are being forced to operate way below their normal capacity, thereby hitting profits. For these sectors, the furlough scheme will continue to be essential way beyond October and the UK Government should think again about an extension.Naturally, the cost of such an extension is a concern, but it must be weighed against the possible costs of not extending, the biggest of which could be mass unemployment the cost of borrowing has also never been so low ndashever there was a time to borrow for the sake of the economy, this is it. It might also be possible to limit the cost of extending the furlough scheme by targeting it at the areas that need it most.The uncertain effect of withdrawing furlough, and the fact that it will not apply equally across the economy or dferent parts of the UK, also points to a particular dficulty for the Scottish Government. Since the beginning of the pandemic, the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish governments have taken slightly dferent decisions at dferent times and yet the devolution settlement means the Scottish Government could not extend furlough in Scotland because it does not have the borrowing powers to fund it. The First Minister has repeatedly complained about this and it is time the UK Government listened.There are other ideas the UK Government should consider as we hopefully move from crisis into containment into recovery. Scrapping or freezing employersrsquo national insurance payments for example. A holiday on business rates would also help the countryrsquos town centres to begin the fight-back. All of it will cost ndash and all of it will have to be paid back in some way in due course ndash but the alternative is a clf-edge in October that will deepen the economic crisis rather than ease it. The scale of the mountain we have to climb is clear and the Scottish and UK governments will have to take unprecedented action for a long time to come yet to ensure we get over it."},{"url":null,"title":"workers-sec-lose-jobs-furlough-scheme-winds","story":"In an e-mail sent to staff and shared with the The Herald, Levy Restaurants - the company which employs hospitality staff at the venue- toldworkers their last furlough payment would be made on September .Valentina Severa Clavell, a worker at Finnieston-basedvenuesaid they had received \"barely any communication and support\".:Scottish Government told to stop savage job cuts at Donald Trumps Turnberry resortWorkers were told that due to the fact live events were not able to continue because ofongoing restrictions, the company would not continue their employment.A Unite hospitality spokesman confirmed the news: \"The way in which Levy Restaurants have treated their staff at Scottish Events Campus is nothing short of disgraceful.There is an alternative to mass redundancy available till at least October  in the Job Retention Scheme.

The Prince of Darkness is not renowned for making concessions. Irsquom sure both Mr Gove and Mr Galloway will forgive meI suggest that, for some, the identity of Auld Nick in this esoteric coupling may be subject to perpetual speculation.The Twitter alliance of these seemingly irreconcilable political foes has been born of mounting Unionist fears over the break up of the United Kingdom. Two more opinion polls this week continued an extended recent trend in favour of independence with one indicating an all-time high of % for Yes.Mr Gove, unofficial minister for the Union Jack in Boris Johnsonrsquos hard-right cabinet, has thus been seeking cross-party allies for what is likely to be Britainrsquos last imperial battle. According to the London Times, he has already held discussions with Lord McConnell of Glenscorrodaleand Danny Alexander, the former Liberal-Democrat chief secretary to the Treasury.When Mr Galloway, leader of the Workers Party of Great Britain, suggested this week that the ldquo, Scots living where in the UK must have a vote in the second referendum on independence Mr Gove replied ldquointeresting question. Mr Galloway at least possesses that rare commodity in British politics: principles.He might well have enjoyed a stellar career near the top of British politics were it not for his habit of reminding assorted Labour leaders how to spell S-O-C-I-A-L-I-S-T. Presumably, hersquoll defend his present dalliance with Mr Gove, a man who once apologised for participating in a strike, on the grounds that nationalism in whatever form is the enemy of international socialism. Butyour beliefs drive you into a camp led by one who has built his career abjuring everything you hold to be dear then perhaps you might ask yourself what it was you thought you were fighting for all this time.Mr Goversquos fireside chats with the laird of Glencorrosdaleare much easier to understand. Lord McConnell and his brother Labour barons were chiefly responsible for reducing Labour in Scotland to its current status of Holder of the Jaikets. In this wretched period the party has come to be defined not by its commitment to the communities that once nurtured it but by its alliance with the Conservative and Unionist Party.Irsquom also intrigued by Mr Gallowayrsquos late attempt to gerrymander the boundaries for a future referendum. In the six years since the last independence referendum Unionists have cited the ldquopeople of Scotland in their claims of a once-in-a-generation event. Irsquom interested to know by what geographical contortion an address in Dorset can now be considered to be ldquoof Scotland.Letrsquos leave aside for the moment concerns about being over-optimistic at the shiny Yes numbers. As Irsquove suggested previously, we are living in abnormal times when the usual scrutiny of a partyrsquos domestic policy record has been suspended. And be in no doubt, when the second independence referendum does begin the British state will deploy every artice and lever at its disposal to maintain Westminster rule.Itrsquos now apparent, though, that the Yes cause is building momentum over a prolonged period of time. It would be tempting to ascribe this merely to Nicola Sturgeonrsquos lsquopresentationalrsquo skills and Boris Johnsonrsquos lack of them. Certainly, it would be foolish not to acknowledge that the First Ministerrsquos leadership has been a factor in the recent numbers for independence. If you can trust the nationrsquos leader when a pandemic threatens your existence then trusting her when she makes the economic and cultural cause for independence would not seem to be the massive leap it was in .There is something  at play here. Itrsquos become clear that from the lived experience of coronavirus has sprung a desire for profound and lasting societal change at many levels. One of the strongest suits of Better Together in  was the perception of stability. Many who had seriously considered voting for independence ultimately recoiled from taking a step into the unknown and a future uncertain. But when our immediate andlong-term future is wreathed in uncertainty the perceived risks of self-determination recede a little.During the five months of lockdown many have found that those institutions they once looked to for security and stability have let them down or revealed to have been a mirage. They have seen officials at the top of the Westminster Government recklessly disregard lockdown restrictions with impunity and disregard for the safety of the nation. They have come to discover that being locked out of Britainrsquos affluence means you are three times likelier to die of Covid- than those you entrusted with your health and wellbeing.From the outset of this pandemic they have witnessed the worst excesses of the capitalist system that gives oxygen to the forces now telling them to preserve the Union at any cost. They now know that those who always tell them ldquowe are all in it together wasted no time in saying ldquoyoursquore on your own when super-rich shareholders demanded redundancies to protect their idends. At the first hint of trouble after years of massive profits the lowest-paid workers were first to be thrown overboard. And they know too that lsquoemergency fundingrsquo means large quantities of cash being handed to the families and friends of UK ministers for sub-standard protective equipment and no questions asked.Britain during coronavirus has been exposed as a vicious little gangster state and this is what George Galloway and Lord McConnell are being duped into defending.

Viridorrsquos energy recovery facilities are the sophisticated combined heat and power plants which use non-recyclable waste as the fuel to generate low carbon electricity and heat.The event, From Vision to Reality ndash converting Scotlandrsquos Circular Economy Leadership into concrete action to ensure we Build Back Better, attracted stakeholders across the Scottish government, SEPA, Scottish Enterprise, Zero Waste Scotland, local government, business and academia.Viridor CEO Phil Piddington said that Viridor, with its history of recycling infrastructure investment in Scotland, was working to be a key partner in ensuring Scotland achieves its goals.The company is also preparing a planning application to East Lothian Council for a plastics recycling and reprocessing plant at Dunbar which would draw heat and power from the energy recovery facility ndash essentially putting waste to work to power the recycling of more plastic within the circular economy.Mr Piddington added: ldquoWe recognise that these goals cannot be achieved by any one organisation. Success lies in partnering across business, government, academia and inventors to ensure Scottish resources are used and reprocessed in Scotland before being ed to local businesses creating a more circular economy. These partnerships move us from ambition to the practical reality delivering real results for the country.Viridorrsquos Innovation and Regulation Director Tim Rotheray said the event created the opportunity for Scotlandrsquos key stakeholders to come together and debate what is needed to move the Scottish circular economy beyond ambition.Dr Rotheray said: ldquoWe welcome the opportunity to continue these discussions and examine issues, such as how regulation and policy can drive both an improved economy and better environment.ldquoOur vision to support Scotlandrsquos circular economy would also feature a dedicated Circular Economy Innovation Centre. This could be a testbed for universities, start-ups and Scottish business to develop solutions to eliminate waste, by tackling the hardest to recycle products and putting partnership at heart of the vision.He said Viridorrsquos vision for the Scottish Circular Economy and Innovation Park had been designed to deliver both resource and energy efficiency.In a recorded message to the event delegates, Her Royal Highness, The Princess Royal said she was delighted to help launch the Scottish Circular Economy and Innovation Park ndash ldquoan important and practical demonstration of what should be happening.She added that the discussions, bringing together all sectors of society to ensure recycling was seen for what it is ldquoa valuable resource and not just rubbish were to be applauded.ldquoI am encouraged to hear that, in these challenging times, this vision matches innovation and investment with job creation, giving our young people the opportunity to play a major role in the world they will inherit.Dr Rotheray said that key workers in recycling and waste management had performed an essential service during the COVID- pandemic and now, the sector that is so vital to driving a better environment, also had the ability to answer the demand to drive a greener recovery."},{"url":null,"title":"complacency-not-option-running-time-says-clare-foster-shepherd-wedderburn","story":"The Covid- pandemic has received   media coverage across the globe, and with good reason. Coronavirus has had a catastrophic impact, claiming the lives of hundreds of thousands of people, devastating our economies, and materially changing the lives of millions as we try to adapt to the profound societal changes it has inflicted.Many will vividly rememberwatching Boris Johnston tell the nation on March : ldquoCoronavirus is the biggest threat this country has faced for decades.While there is no doubt that the particular challenge posed by Covid- is unheard of in recent history, and should not be diminished, I would take issue with the Prime Ministerrsquos statement. There is another threat that has been looming for decades, which is exponentially greater than coronavirus and poses an existential threat to humanity.Yet the climate change threat is failing to attract the attention ndash and action ndash it deserves.To put it into context, as Sir David Attenborough said last year: ldquoThe scientic evidence is thatwe have not taken dramatic action within the next decade, we could face irreversible damage to the natural world and the collapse of our societies.This is a remarkable statement on a number of levels, but even more remarkable is the dference a year makes. The headlines about Greta Thunberg and Extinction Rebellionthat reverberated around the globe less than a year ago in the wake of the Australian bushfires and flooding in Venice feel like a distant memory, and governments and society have not reacted to climate change in the same way that they have to the Covid emergency.The coronavirus crisis has highlighted the ability of central banks, governments and agencies in multiple jurisdictions to move quickly, demonstrating that their inherent bureaucracy need not be a barrier to dynamic action when faced with an emergency of this scale.So why are we not treating climate change like the pandemic There are a number of reasons:From a UK business perspective, things need to change quickly to get the economy back on track, a point that is not lost on Chancellor Rishi Sunak. However, the UK simply cannotto le and business as usual.A green recovery is our best hope of rebuilding an economy ravaged by the Covid- pandemic and addressing the climate emergency. It should be a recovery focused on cutting emissions, investing in more sustainable, greener projects, creating jobs, and building a fairer and more resilient society.Why  Becausewe revert to the same bad habits that crept back in after the last financial crisis in then we will fulfil Attenboroughrsquos prophecy. The debate should not be whether the recovery should be green but rather how a green recovery is best achieved.It is important to remember it is not all doom and gloom, however. In the clean energy sector, eyes are firmly on a green recovery. There is huge appetiteto achieve the targets for offshore and onshore wind, as well as the other renewables technologies that will play a major part in helping us achieve the  and  net-zero targets set by the Scottish and UK governments respectively. The potential for job creation is enormous.In the financial sector, there is recognition that the funding requirements to achieve net zero are gigantic and that there needs to be a greater focus on investments that help tackle climate change. Recently, the Net Zero Investment Frameworkwas released for consultation.It provides the first practical blueprint for investors to maximise the contribution they make in tackling climate change and achieving net-zero emissions globally by . The framework focuses on the twin targets of decarbonising investment portfolios and increasing investment in climate solutions.The increasing importance of environmental, social and governancefactors and disclosure requirements means that sustainable investments are the way forward.Meanwhile, the oil and gas sector is playing its part too. At the beginning of August, BP announced its new strategy to transition to an integrated energy company and set out its net-zero ambition.

Reasons for objection included:After a y discussion, councillors chose to reject the application. This decision was led by Kirkwall East councillor, David Dawson, who was seconded by West Mainland councillor, Owen Tierney. The reasoning given for this was that the application proposed an extension which extended beyond the quarry#s defined mineral safeguard area, which Councillor Dawson and his colleagues felt was not justied. It was also felt that this extension would result in cumulative adverse impacts to residents living in nearby properties.Though this rejection was unanimously agreed by the planning committee, Kirkwall East councillor, John Ross Scott, formally lodged his objection to the decision taken by members after it had been made.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

HIAL’s previous engagement on the ATMS programme has been on a face-to-face basis.

I believe that OLA representing the cattle industry in Orkney can have a strong association with Moredun in the future.#Beth Wells, from Moredun, said “Through meetings we have been fortunate to meet many of Orkney’s livestock farmers, who are well known for their high quality beef production and we are delighted to be developing a closer working collaboration with OLA, which will be of huge benefit to both of our organisations.”OLA is a sub-group of HiHealth Herdcare which is a national cattle health scheme.

Unlike student nurses and midwives, however, those training to be a paramedic are not eligible for a bursary, despite being unable to take up part time work.  To add insult to injury, their counterparts in England do receive bursaries.“This lack of a level playing field risks putting off those we need to see coming into our health service.  The current arrangements do little to encourage young people to pursue a career as a paramedic and store up problems for the future.“When I wrote to the Health Secretary recently on behalf of a constituent, I was told the government has no plans to review the funding options for trainee paramedics. Today, Nicola Sturgeon said she would look into the matter, having also been approached by a young constituent, angry at the unequal treatment.“The First Minister needs to recognise that introducing a bursary scheme would make a real dference, not least in widening access to the profession.  It’s time the Scottish Government properly recognised the dedication of our trainee paramedics by putting them on the same footing as trainee nurses and midwives.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

On the Pentland Firth, people are still being forced to pay over the odds.“COVID has inevitably created challenges, but even prior to the pandemic there seemed to be little urgency from the Scottish Government to deliver on its promise. Assurances that Ministers will now ‘pick up the ball again’ are likely to ring hollow with islanders who just want a date for cheaper fares to be introduced.“Meantime, Ministers could help soften the blow from the delayed introduction of RET by using the underspend to cut fares on Orkney’s internal ferry services.

have trusted the","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineNow there is much within the machinations that occupy the precious time of our Comhairle officers that could well be regarded as relatively ‘trivial’, although I will fully concede that even the most improbable deliberations might well form the centre of somebody’s entire universe.But when we, as a community, or section of that community, continue to press for answers and resolutions to a subject that has already been explained fully to us, then we should ask ourselves one important question: “Are we doing this for the greater good, or because we are trying to promote our own agenda ”. about some of the material that was included in the Scottish Government’s RSHPguidelines and how I felt that some of it was completely over the top for inclusion in any classroom.Several concerned parents had written to me, asking what on earth was going on.I enquired of both the Director and Chair of Education and Children’s Services as to the validity of these concerns.I was happy to note that the ‘plot’ wasn’t as sinister as had been portrayed by some ‘concerned’ groups both within the counciland on anti-social media.Some alleged that the Comhairle were somehow, through the back-door and under the cover of the Covid- crisis , trying to sneak through an agenda which went against the “moral values of this community”.An inflammatory accusation, one that was sure to ignite passions and ring yet another Pavlovian bell.Except that, far from being subject matter that was about to get rammed down our children’s throats, not just ‘promoted’ it was simply an extreme example of what was included for reference, should anyone wish to avail themselves of it.Yes, some of it was fairly graphic stuff and, as I’ve said before, I was hugely alarmed that it was even considered for anything to be found in our classrooms.But, as is the case with material which has been taught in our schools for at least a couple of centuries the devil is in the detail .Luckily we have seen teachers, historically, opt to use the message of love, forgiveness, compassion and mutual understanding from this particular tome ignoring the more sinister aspects where death, retribution, punishment and all kinds of nastiness are very much front and centre.Choosing your testaments wisely is what this is primarily about.We are lucky to have an educational framework where common sense prevails, otherwise there could be very many distractions in the subjects of Biology, Geology and quite possibly Physics.I attempted to be amusing about a topic which has very legitimate, obvious, and serious, implications for our most impressionableyoung people.I hoped I was taking a cue from people who think that a banana dipped into a jar of Nutella is a suitable metaphor for something.Possibly the obesity crisis I think a jar of Bovril might have been funnier.If people wish to identy as a Unicorn and have sex with the pavement, then that’s fine too, but not surely for inclusion in ‘guidance’ material.Yes, I have to admit that I also jumped onto the bandwagon, until I had the situation clearly explained to me and was told to trust the teacher’.They will be given the ultimate discretion and they know best what’s appropriate for their young audience.We do ‘much ado’ well here.When ‘Ironside’ and ‘Bob the Budget Builder’ steered the Comhairle and helped many local businesses through the worst of the effects of the ongoing pandemic, we turned inward and focused on upholstery.With Bernie, Angus and the Education Department, all under immense pressure to get a hugely problematic school year underway on time, we are more focused on what won’tbe getting taught, rather than what will, and how.Andour kids come home from school with a penchant for strange combinations of fruit and nut sandwiches, then it will have been discussed with the Head Teacher and Parent Council first.A lot of the contentious issues which occupy us here in the Western Islesare perceived to exist somewhere between a conservative, culturally protective, radically Christian, ‘right’, and a somewhat more progressive, more liberal, secular, bunch of left-wing snowflakes.Most of us are somewhere, far more certainly and squarely, in the middle trying to make sense of it all.If we cannot empower and trust our teachers to do what’s best for the most vulnerable amongst us, then we will have failed both.The man of the week, last week, certainly in the northern half of this county, was the irrepressible David Black.Three rounds crammed into  hours saw him claim the Thompson Bruce Trophy at Stornoway and take an early lead in Scarista’s  ‘Blue-Riband’ event.Rounds of +  around Lady Lever Park on Friday and Saturday saw him edge out Eddie Rogers,  +  by just a single shot over  holes.A further shot adrt saw Murdo ‘Griddy’ MacLeod,  +  in third slot.Iain ‘Juke Box’ MacKay won the handicap trophy with two excellent rounds of nett  for a  total.In between his Thompson Bruce exploits, Davie also posted the leading score in the, two-round, Harris G.C. Club Championship.His  was  shots ahead of nearest challengers, Billy Fraser and Cal Robertson, both on .Starting with six straight pars, he succumbed to bogies at the ‘amen’ of corners, the deadly-deceiving brace of par-s at   .Naturally he bounced straight back birdies at the new th, and the th brought him back to level.He swapped a birdie for a bogey at  and  to see him home safely.Only a sht in plate tectonics will see him throw away this lead.Midweek at Stornoway saw the Glennie Trophy claimed by Iain Moir on  Stableford Points. Starting his opening four holes, five-over par, couldn’t have been good for his confidence.He was just one-over for the next .In the Junior section, Calum Gbounced back from his recent humblings at the hands of brother, Geordie H in the Par Bogey competition.Six ahead of the course, he demolished the rest of the field by  clear shots.In the Scarista midweek competition, Billy Fraser kept up his, season-long, decent form, partnering Chris Sutton to a fine win in the Pairs Greensomes.Their  was two ahead of Russell Tennant and Alan Gunn’s, .Benbecula’s finest continue to battle it out for their season-long Order of Merit, Dami Steele ing a semblance of normality, bouncing back from a week out of the top spots to consolidate his lead at the top.His round wasn’t, however, good enough to claim the full points last Tuesday evening, Domhnall MacKay storming to a -pointer and the maximum Point haul.Apparently Donald has been keeping his powderdry and intends, after a decent sabbatical, to make a strong charge over the coming weeks."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TOURISM-2-copy.jpg","title":"litir do luchd ionnsachaidh","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine.’.

But what of other aspects What of community resilience, something I suspect will barely register as a priority for most us when deciding on our weekly shop It may be the case that more people will try and grow more of their own food and local produce will, hopefully, be in greater demand.All very welcome. But what’s really needed is a completely fresh approach to our behaviour as consumers.As the pound in our pocket becomes ever more stretched we need to value it in terms of what benefit it can bring to the wider collective # who can it support, what should it support and how can that can bring about greater resilience within our own communities.It’s not radical or revolutionary. It’s just about taking a bit more time and effort to think about where best to spend our cash, especially when it comes to our most basic of needs.It can’t possibly make sense to get your Sunday roast from the supermarketthe same cut of meat is available at your local butcher at a comparable price . And especiallythat butcher has sourced his meat from the crofter down the road.It takes a bit of extra effort to call in at the butcher, for sure, but add in important elements like food miles and provenance and there really is no excuse, except for our own inherent laziness.It has always amazed me how there is any fish at all on the shelves of supermarkets in this part of the world when the local fishmongers offer far higher quality at a lower price.And, in any case, it’s now perfectly possible to buy direct from the fisherman, with many of them now offering sales to the public.That may have come about through the closure of their overseas markets during lockdown, but what better example of necessity being the mother of invention.If west-coast prawns were coveted by sophisticated palates on the Mediterranean, then they should be more than adequate for consumption a bit closer to home.It’s not that long ago that our communities were completely self-reliant in food.We do demand a more discerning choice these days # no-one would want toto a diet made up entirely of fish, mutton and potatoes.But, with an abundance of quality produce on our own doorstep, surely it makes sense to take more advantage of that and in the process create greater community resilience through sourcing from independent, local retailers.If there’s a downside to that approach, I fail to see it.ONE aspect that looks certain to change, certainly for the foreseeable, is that there will be less air travel.Through the lockdown it is estimated that carbon emissions have been reduced by over  per cent by planes being grounded alone.That’s not even taking account of reductions in car journeys and it is a staggering figure from just one simple change.There are certain elements in the environmental lobby who would have you believe that methane emissions from cattle make a signicant contribution to climate change.Never mind that bovineshave roamed the land for thousands of years without causing much harm.Never mind that it’s only the last  or  years, as our economy became ever reliant on fossil fuels, that the damage to our planet has been made.The reduction in air travel will be for economic, more than environmental, reasons.But the staggering statistics of these last few months should at least mean that when it comes to a real determination in tackling environmental damage the finger of blame will be pointed in the right direction.Then again, maybe cows are a much easier target."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3301349.jpg--.jpg?1597840898000\n","title":"cullybckey volunteers praised","story":"Volunteers from Cullybackey Community Partnershipwere presented with a certicate from Mayor Councillor Peter Johnston recently to recognise their efforts during this Covid- pandemic.CCP volunteers stepped up to the mark through a number of dferent initiatives to help those most vulnerable in the area in recent months.One of those was the delivery of food parcels to those both in the village and those in outlying rural areas.

In response, we have already put additional measures in place. “Last week, we moved to the next phase of our agreed, comprehensive Hygiene Commitment plan which includes increased random testing of team members, who continue to operate within team bubbles.“In addition, we are also the first company in Northern Ireland to introduce a Mistpal Cleansing Tunnel for team members and guests entering the Resort for further safety reassurance. “This is in addition to already established measures including a nightly, full deep-clean of all areas with hospital-grade sanitiser protectant and decontamination equipment, thermal temperature monitoring, provision of hand sanitisers in all areas and adherence to recommended social distancing guidelines.“The health and safety of our team and guests remains paramount and we are grateful for their continued support and also to those guests who have rescheduled their stay as a result of the robust pre-entry testing measures we have in place.”Galgorm Spa  Golf Resort has already carried out tests with almost  team members and will continue to conduct random testing and adopt the same stringent protocols already in place in the event that any further positive cases are identied.Since reopening Galgorm Spa  Golf Resort has been focused on safety as a priority and was among the first hotels in the UK to receive the AA COVID Confident Mark for its industry leading health and safety standards. It continues to work with local, regional and UK government bodies to uphold its stringent hygiene standards.

With another  cases confirmed yesterday, that is  in just four days.On Saturday the Republic#s health authorities announced  cases there.The UK and Irish Republic have already begun to impose localised lockdowns in areas with high cases of the virus. Yesterday Stormont#s chief scientic adviser said the same approach could be taken here.Suddenly the outlook is a lot less optimistic than it had appeared.In May the Executive introduced its five-stage plan for exiting the lockdown. While many restrictions have been lted, some - including the reopening of wet pubs - have still to be acted on, amid lingering concerns of a second wave.The road map:On May  the Executive published its five-stage recovery strategy.Included in the first step of the plan were proposals for groups of four to six people to meet outside, churches to be permitted to open for private prayer, outdoor sports including golf and tennis to resume and more people encouraged toto work. Garden centres and large outdoor retailers were also permitted to reopen.In step two, up to  people could meet outdoors, while two to four people could meet indoors for short periods. Sports training would be allowed to resume and non-food retailers would be allowed to reopen.Step three would enable up to  people to meet outdoors along with the reopening of museums and galleries, with theatre rehearsals allowed to resume. Large indoor gatherings would be authorised, while the phasedof office working would be encouraged. Children were also set toto school on a part-time basis.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseBishop of Down and Connor, Noel Treanor celebrates Mass under strict social distancing in St Peter’s Cathedral, west Belfast this morning.

Restaurants, cafes, pubs and nightclubs would be permitted to reopen on a limited basis with restricted concerts also taking place. Younger pupils were set toto school full-time, while public transport wouldto a full schedule.Where are we now:Following the unveiling of the five step plan, Mrs Foster said she hoped that the final stage could be reached before December.However she later claried her comments and said she hoped Northern Ireland would be long past step five before December.I would be very much hopeful of that, unless there has been a second peak or a second wave of this, she said.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseA shopper and a member of staff at Hillmount Garden Centre in Belfast yesterdayPhoto by Kelvin Boyes  Press E FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappA shopper and a member of staff at Hillmount Garden Centre in Belfast yesterdayThe first restrictions lted were the reopening of garden and recycling centres from May .

Masks are also mandatory on public transport - although again enforcement is largely non-existent - and will be strongly encouraged for activities involving large numbers of staff or pupils in an enclosed space.Expert#s views:Queen#s University Belfastvirologist Dr Connor Bamford said that he believed Northern Ireland#s coronavirus lockdown had been successful.He said that the virus had been slowed down with cases being reported in single and double digits most days.However, while lockdown had worked well, he believes the virus was always present in Northern Ireland.We were always detecting cases and we were always seeing small clusters that would pop up in dferent parts of the country, he said.Dr Bamford said it was anticipated that, as restrictions were relaxed, cases would rise because the virus was present and most people remained susceptible. He said contact tracing had played a key role in identying new cases and clusters in Northern Ireland.The virologist, who emerged as one of Northern Ireland#s experts on the virus, said a dynamic approach was needed to deal with the virus going forward.We#re not out of the woods yet, certainly we would like to be able to reduce restrictions safely, but then we might have to bring in more restrictions as has been seen in other parts of the UK, Dr Bamford said.I would imagine nothing is off the table, we could be looking at lockdowns by city, or county or even given the size of Northern Ireland they may just decide to lockdown the entire country, it will depend purely on the circumstances surrounding the outbreak.Dr Bamford said the virus seemed to now be affecting more younger people as they were taking more risks as lockdown eased.We just can#t go back completely to normal until we have a very good vaccine, he said.We have to think of it as the #new normal#, it isn#t going to be forever, there will be a time when we won#t worry about Covid, but until then this is what the new normal has to be.However the virologist said he didn#t believe we were seeing the beginning of a second wave of the virus.I wouldn#t say that at this stage, but you#ll see with things like schools going back or large changes to lockdown, they all might sort of come together and you might see something that looks like the beginning of a second wave or a large outbreak, he said.Read More New lockdown restrictions comingCovid- cases continue to rise in Northern Ireland - Swann NI close to needing localised Covid restrictions, warns Prof Ian YoungDr Bamford praised the Executive#s fluid approach to managing the pandemic. However, he believes a policy of eradicating the virus should be pursued.I think more could be done to get rid of the virus in Northern Ireland and then it might be safer to reopen schools, he said.At the minute we#re all sort of responding to outbreaks, what happenswe really went after the virus and eradicated the virus from the country I think there#s a lot to be said about that because then you might not have to make the choice between opening schools or pubs.You need to find where that virus is and really go after it with more testing, community testing, but we#re not really doing that and we#re more managing the outbreaks. That could be a risky strategy.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseDr Connor Bamford FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappDr Connor BamfordUlster Bank economist Richard Ramsey said that even before the lockdown was introduced businesses, particularly in the hospitality sector, saw a downturn in custom and demand.He said when businesses were told to close, those who didn#t have cash reserves found themselves left exposed.However, Mr Ramsey said the scale of the support provided to businesses during lockdown was huge.If you thought beforehand that they would introduce things like a furlough scheme or eat out to help out, it wouldn#t have been thought possible, the economist said.While he accepted that some people may think not enough support has been provided, Mr Ramsey said that he believed further measures would be forthcoming.The chancellor isn#t done providing stimulus yet, we expect to see more in the autumn, it will be more targeted and dferent from what we#ve seen, it#s not the end of it, he said.Mr Ramsey said he believed businesses had come through the worst of the pandemic.We#ve seen huge falls in lockdown, it stopped dead, but you#ve then seen recovery, the corner had been turned in terms of activity, he said.He cautioned that the jobs market was one area that was set to get worse in the months to come.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseUlster Bank economist Richard Ramsey FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappUlster Bank economist Richard RamseyMy view:If the number of coronavirus cases continues to rise, then the Executive will have some very dficult decisions to make.Despite spending much of the past few years engaging in petty public squabbles, the parties came together when the outbreak began, just months after Stormont#s institutions were restored.Now as cases look to be on the rise once again, our politicians will have to decide what steps are necessary to halt the spread of the virus.Rolling back on any lockdown easements could be met with widespread public resistance.One only has to look at the debate created by the mandatory wearing - and, in some cases defiance - of masks to see the public has become weary of widespread government intervention in their lives.However, the Executive must do what it deems necessary to protect public health.If we continue to see Covid clusters developing in certain areas then we are more likely to see localised lockdowns, but the question remains how effective would this be in a country the size of Northern Ireland.Just a few short weeks ago cases were in the single figures, businesses and public facilities were reopening, people were ing to work and beginning to foresee ato some normality.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk ab .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_ebd---af-acbdc_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk ab .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_ebd---af-acbdc_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk ab .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_ebd---af-acbdc_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk ab .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_ebd---af-acbdc_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk ab .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_ebd---af-acbdc_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClose\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk ab .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_ebd---af-acbdc_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk ab .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_ebd---af-acbdc_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk ab .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_ebd---af-acbdc_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk ab .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_ebd---af-acbdc_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk ab .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_ebd---af-acbdc_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Doses of the Oxford vaccine PA FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappDoses of the Oxford vaccine Now it feels like we are beginning to go backwards rather than forward.It is still unknown what effect reopening schools could have on the spread of the virus.If cases continues to rise then it is likely an increased number of deaths will follow.Should we see ato daily reports of multiple Covid- deaths, the Executive will be forced to take action, no matter how unpopular it may be.The virus remains unpredictable and until we have a widely available vaccine, any hopes of ato pre-Covid times seem distant.

However, Galgorm Spa  Golf Resort would like to reassure everyone that the health and safety of our team and guests remains paramount and that as a result of our own robust testing measures we identied two positive asymptomatic Covid- cases within our team.Both workers were said to be back-of-house and had no contact with guests, are continuing to self-isolate at home in line with company policy, and will be retested prior to their .Testing has been carried out to date on almost  staff, with random testing to continue as part of a full suite of safety measures already established.The statement added: We remain in contact with local government bodies and the Public Health Agency, who have been fully briefed on all our stringent hygiene procedures and who remain confident in the measures we have in place.The Contact Tracing Service , which we fully support, advises that we should not contact customers directly, this will be carried out by trained contact tracersnecessary.Our industry-leading safety measures continue to put the health and safety of all our guests and team members first and we have recently adopted additional, enhanced measures throughout the resort for further reassurance.The Northern Ireland Open is also to be played at Galgorm Spa  Golf Resort between September -, two weeks before the Irish Open.The Dubai Duty Free Irish Open was originally planned for the Mount Juliet course in Kilkenny in May. But it was postponed due to the pandemic.Restrictions from the Irish Government would have required US visitors to self-isolate for  days.Last week it was announced the tournament would instead take place behind closed doors at Galgorm Castle near Ballymena.This allows players to head directly to a UK airport, including those who will have competed in the US Open, which ends on September .Despite the new arrangements local golfing star Rory McIlroy has already ruled himself out, saying he had no plans to travel internationally in the coming months.The -year-old added: It might be dferentthere could be fans there and stuff, but it#s behind closed doors and it#s not an Irish Open like we#re used to it being the last few years, with obviously big prize funds and everything.

An employee at Danske Bank was even disinfecting a cash machine. People had a mixed reaction to the tightened guidelines, and whether the PSNI can or will enforce them.Judith Dickson from the town said she was worried about the rise in Covid- cases in the area but said it#s all our own fault.I think the guidelines will be enforcedthey can andthe police have the manpower, but I don#t think they do, she said. It#s up to people to report it but I don#t think they will.Gavin McCandless, who lives on the outskirts of the town, felt the temporary measures were necessary to keep everyone safe.Meanwhile, Sam Cree, who said he had the virus as far back as January, was in no doubt that a second wave was on its way.After developing a dry cough and losing his sense of taste and smell, Mr Cree was convinced he contracted Covid- but said he has fully recovered.He added that Mr Swann was correct in bringing down the gathering restrictions but was not impressed with the number of people visiting pubs.I just think there will be a second wave and people will have to learn to wear their masks going into shops, he said.Charlotte Weir and her friend Beverley Connor were much more critical of Stormont#s politicians and the PSNI in how they have handled the virus. Are there even enough police to stretch themselves that far and land at people#s doors  Charlotte asked. I just don#t think the politicians have a clue what they#re doing anymore to be honest.Beverley said: I don#t think there#s a chance the police will come in and enforce everything. There#s not enough of them.Bridget Mullen criticised the new lockdown measures and felt that allowing six people into your home is nowhere near as bad as staging a wedding with  to  people.I think the younger people are more lackadaisical because they don#t think it will affect them, she added.

The ruling came in legal challenges by two victims - including Jenner McNern,- to the continued impasse around introducing the scheme with an estimated cost of £mAugust   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailThey lost legs, arms or their eyesight, but the victims who gathered outside Belfast High Court never lost heart.Yesterday, their long and exhausting years of struggle finally paid off as a judge declared that The Executive Office had unlawfully refused to advance their pension scheme.Justice McAlinden delivered a scathing ruling that surely made Sinn Fein squirm.Every legal argument advanced on behalf of Deputy First Minister Michelle O#Neill was demolished.Arrant nonsense, a truly shocking proposition, wilful disregard for the rule of law, or abject ignorance of whatmeans in a democratic society were just some of the terms used.How on earth did the party get it legally, politically and morally so wrong  Why fight a battle that you#re destined to lose in both a court of law and the court of public opinion  There was never going to be any other outcome.O#Neill has now agreed to nominate a department and progress the scheme. This embarrassing climbdown forced by the courts could have been avoided.Why did the Deputy First Minister not just do what she was legally obliged to do months ago  She could have saved victims so much additional trauma.You#d expect Sinn Fein to at least be PR savvy. The very powerful images of men and women in wheelchairs, or with white sticks, going into court at the start of the case, should have caused a serious rethink in the party.It argues that the pension scheme discriminates against former republican prisoners. It could have pursued that issue while allowing those who have suffered the most to apply for and receive the pension they#re entitled to.The Shinners were completely isolated on this one at Stormont and beyond. A section of their own base was certainly put out by the scheme#s criteria, but it was by no means a matter which incensed or roused the entire republican community. This wasn#t a nationalist versus unionist issue. The victims behind this legal action were from all sections of the community.There were plenty of people who support justice for the Bloody Sunday families, who believe the state committed many great wrongs over the years, who still wanted the pension paid.As well as Jenner McNern#s legal challenge, a case was also brought by Brian Turley, one of the #Hooded Men# subjected to inhuman and degrading treatment by the British Army in .As a survivor of torture, I was left with long-term injuries as a result of the actions of the state, he said yesterday.The delay in having to wait on my right to a pension can only be described as another form of torture. Turley said O#Neill had no right to stop the pension scheme and described her action as very unprofessional.Words like that wound Sinn Fein. When the party finds itself on the opposite side to a victim of state violence like him it should know that it#s on shaky ground. Negotiations will continue between Stormont and Downing Street over who foots the pensions# bill. Naomi Long#s Justice Department will now be designated to progress the scheme. Victims hope that it will be open for applications before Christmas. I feel elated, said Margaret Yeaman who was blinded in an IRA no-warning bomb in Banbridge in  and who has never seen the faces of her grandchildren.The ruling has brought immense relief, said Mark Kelly, who lost his legs in a  no-warning UVF bomb.It#s like a weight lted off my shoulders, said Philip Gault, left with le-changing injuries as a schoolboy when he was injured in on Bloody Friday in .I should never have had to take this case, said Jenner McNern, who lost her legs in the IRA#s Abercorn bomb that year.As they celebrated their win, the surviving victims remembered those who didn#t live to see it, like Paddy Cassidy and Raymond Trimble who died so recently.It was simultaneously a victory to savour, and to shame so many in society for not delivering for these courageous men and women years ago.

It comes after this week’s A-level results changes that mean many students will be awarded higher teacher assessed grades. As a result universities will have to offer additional places with Queens University Belfastsaying it may need up to , extra. That will necessitate the lting of the maximum student numberscap. However, at yesterdays Economy Committee meeting at Stormont, Derry MLAs Gary Middleton and Sinead McLaughlin raised concerns thatthe correct decisions arent made it could lead to further regional imbalance with more students enrolling in Belfast courses. googletag.cmd.push DUP MLA Gary Middleton said there are several hundred unfilled places at Magee. While, SDLP MLA Sinead McLaughlin said thatUlster University wants to see growth at Magee it has to be engineered through the relocation of courses and the university has to invest in the marketing of the campus. The Department for the Economycontrols the number of undergraduate places available at QUB and Ulster Universityfor students from NI and those from outside the UK. Both institutions are allowed to accept between ,-, new undergraduates from Northern Ireland every year The cap exists in Northern Ireland in order to keep tuition fee costs down but results in huge competition for places. googletag.cmd.push It also means that on some courses NI students are expected to get higher grades than their counterparts applying from Great Britain. Derry politicians have called for the MaSN cap to be lted to allow universities to accommodate more students. They’ve insisted that the Magee campus should be prioritised, citing long-promised expansion to , students. However, it is courses that will determine demand and in turn additional places. A UU spokesperson said that it envisages increased demand for Magee courses such as Computer Sciences, Articial Intelligence and Personalised Medicine. She commented: “At Ulster University, students are our absolute priority and we will be as flexible as possible in order to accommodate the maximum number of students possible within our existing funding and the additional flexibility already provided by Department for the Economy. “We are actively preparing for the anticipated additional demand by building in additional places for some of our most popular courses including Computer Sciences, Articial Intelligence, Engineering, Law, Accounting, and Personalised Medicine. “To avail of these additional places, we urge students to contact us as soon as possible on    to discuss your options with an advisor.” The DfE pointed out that responsibility for MaSN allocation lies with Higher Education institutions. A spokesperson for the DfE said: “Until the local universities have received access to the full range of revised grades for all applicant students, they will not be able to confirm places for students or otherwise. “As such, until this process has been completed, there is no way of assessing the number of any additional HE places there may be, nor what the impact might be for each HE institution with regards to their respective MaSNs.” She added: “With regards to the MaSN cap, it is allocated on an institutional-level basis and relates to all full-time undergraduate NI and EU domiciled students it is for each institution to decide how to allocate its MaSN across both subject areas and campuses. “The Economy Minister has stated thatshe will be working with Executive colleagues to ensure that additional places and extra resources are put in place to support universities as soon as possible. “Enrolments for previous years are available athttps:www.economy-ni.gov.uk articles higher-education-enrolments”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

There were plenty of smiles, but despite the blistering sunshine, the atmosphere was slightly muted. In any normal year there would have been giddy excitement, pupils slapping congratulations into each others backs. But this is education in a pandemic. The Class of  have already missed out on so much. Their final year was abruptly cut short in March, with the footballers of St Patricks on the brink of a MacRory Cup Final. From March until June in your final year of school may be peak time for exam cramming, but its also a coming-of-age period for young students. googletag.cmd.push Relationships with staff gradually takes on a more collegial feel. There is almost a feeling of being in the trenches together as they prepare together for the exams. Amid our A-Levels, myself and a friend were, not particularly diligently, preparing for a History exam that was set to take place the following day. We had nipped into the shop on the way up from Coleraine town centre and bought a sticky toffee pudding on a whim. The product required heating. Mr Bob Murphy was the most likely to do the needful for us, but when he took a look at the pair of us outside the staff room, he was exasperated. googletag.cmd.push “Boys, this is Mrs McGoldricks exam..” he began. We explained that we were grand for the exam, but would he mind heating up our dessert for us  He came back with a smile and a shake of the head, but with a freshly warmed pudding in hand. Trivial, farcical moments like that are recalled much more easily than any time spent in the exam hall, but s pupils have been denied both academic and pastoral build-up to these milestone exams. They have been disenfranchised, denied ownership of what, in many cases, is a le-changing four months. You cant cram for an exam that isnt happening. Every teacher and school leader Ive spoken to over the last week has highlighted the March to June period as a key moment in exam preparation. Pupils look at how things are going, andthe picture doesnt look great, they know its time to up the ante. Its the sprint at the end of the marathon. Principal Mrs Brenda Mussen addresses the St Patricks College, Maghera, Class of . Weirs decision yesterday afternoon to revert back to teacher predictions on AS and A results is a welcome move, but one that should have come without a four-day delay. The algorithm that would have decided the immediate future of our young people was particularly harsh on comprehensive schools. To use just the previous two years as a benchmark was unfair, particularly given the huge range in results a mixed ability cohort can throw up in any given year. Given the nature of academic selection, the risk of having a below-par set of results in a grammar school is greatly reduced, meaning the system used is already subject to in-built injustice. Results are now back in the hands of teachers and schools, rather than at the mercy of a mathematical equation. Back in the hands of the people who know the pupils. The people best-placed to assess their abilities. The people who spent weeks meticulously preparing their centre-assessed grades. “It was a kick in the teeth when you see students who have been downgraded that should not have been ,” said St Patricks Principal, Mrs Brenda Mussen, last week. This years students had been been kicked in the teeth and handed the bill for the dental work. With all exam boards across the UK now awarding on the basis of teacher judgement, the bill has been belatedly waived. The pupils of County Derry, and the whole of the country, would have been at a competitive disadvantage through no fault of their own. Reverting to teacher predictions for A-Level results at least creates a more level playing field for this years university intake.The writing has been on the wall since last Thursday. It took until yesterday for the Minister to bother to read it.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Fty-seven cottages were erected on a .-acre patch of land in the Shantallow area, which had been purchased from Sir John McFarland of Aberfoyle on the Strand Road. The land was bought for £,-- - £, in today’s money - and featured a mixture of semi-detached cottages, blocks of four cottages and one detached cottage. A memorial plaque erected by Derry City Council in . Nigel Henderson, a researcher with History Hub Ulster, has been documenting the locations of the , ex-servicemen’s cottages built in Northern Ireland. “The largest colony or collection of cottages in County Londonderry are the ones at Messines Park,” he told the County Derry Post. “I’ve been going through the records trying to get details of the styles of the houses, how many rooms they had, whether they had toilets and bathrooms and things like that. “Once a family was installed in them, they tended to stay there for le, but there were some issues with evictions due to non-payment of rent. “A lot of the guys coming back from the war weren’t able to keep up employment so they may not have been able to pay the rents. “The rents weren’t exorbitant for their time or the standard of the houses, but the ISSLT , were strict at taking people to court for non-payment of rent. “You had guys who were evicted in the early s and then another ex-serviceman might have moved in again. In Belfast, there were guys on the waiting list as far on as the s.” Early plans show the layout of the ex-servicemens three-bedroom cottages at Messines Park. Initial rent for the houses, designed by Roland Ingolby Smith, chief architect for the NI Ministry of Finance from  to , was nine shillings per week, around £ per week today. On the night the Luftwaffe bombed the city, all  fatalities occurred in a row of houses facing onto the Buncrana Road. Nigel Henderson said the attack on Messines Park was unlikely to have been in the Germans’ plan. Instead, it is thought the nearby docks were their intended target. “What I understand is that they were aiming for the docks. During the Second World War in Derry, there was a naval base there,” he said. “It was a base for the Royal Navy going out on patrols in the North Atlantic, but they overshot and Shantallow was not that far from where the docks would have been. Ten members from the Richmond and Murray families died in the attack, along with -year-old James Collins, his -year-old daughter Ellen and William Alexander McFarland. The youngest victim was -month-old Sheila Murray. Their loss was keenly felt within Messines Park, where a strong community spirit had grown since the houses were erected in June .

A colony of ex-servicemen being settled in Derry has the potential to be controversial when looked at through a contemporary eye, but an atmosphere of co-operation prevailed in the aftermath of the First World War. “I don’t think there was any sectarian sentiment against the houses, because for the guys who had moved in, religious affiliation was not a factor,” explained Nigel. “What was taken into account was how big a family they had, whether they had employment, whether they were wounded or gassed in the war, or the standard of housing they had. “Some of those who died were Protestants and some were Roman Catholics and because it was on the edge of the city, they formed almost a small community of their own. “The attitude was that it didn’t matteryou were a Catholic or a Protestant, a unionist or a nationalist, the guys served together. Both communities had been up for participating. “When those guys came home, the religious affiliation of their ex-servicemen neighbours would not have been a major factor or a cause for concern. “They had served together through a nightmare and living close to other ex-servicemen provided an opportunity for them to talk about their shared experiences. “This was something the veterans seldom did inside their homes or with their families.” While not their intended target, the German bombers would no doubt have felt a sense of schadenfreude at how things panned out. Nigel Henderson is struck by the tragic irony of the ex-servicemen’s demise. “It’s the only part of Derry that was hit in the German air raids, but it just happened to be men who had fought in the First World War who were the principal victims,” he said. “That is the irony of it. They survived the Germans in the trenches of the First World War to then die during the Second World War from aerial bombing.” The victims James and Ellen Collins Father and daughter, James and Ellen Collins, lived at  Messines Park. Sixty-year old James was the oldest victim of the bombing and was originally from Eglinton.

It was the first time Ballinascreen were levelin a game they trailed by nine points coming up to half time. With a superior score dference, a draw wouldve been enough for Lavey, but points for Cleary and Aaron Kelly put them ahead. Fintan Bradley had a late free, but his low effort was saved by goalkeeper Marty Mulgrew and it was Screen that held on for a victory that seemed unlikely for long periods. googletag.cmd.push Their reward is a semi-final rematch with Kevin Lynchs, with Slaughtneil facing parish rivals Swatragh on the other side of the draw. Lavey will now play in the junior semi-final against Coleraine, with Banagher and Na Magha in the other semi-final. The @ScreenGAA hurlers show their respect for Hugh McWilliams before tonight’s #DerrySHC game #GAABelong pic ZxMmiuIe — Michael McMullan August ,     Both teams stood for a minute silence in memory of Ballinascreen sponsor Hugh McWilliams before the game. Lavey had the breeze at their back and with greater urgency in their play went four points ahead before Screen got to grips with the game. The Erins Own men were awarded a penalty but referee Niall Clford adjudged Fintan Bradley to have broken the line when he shot and the penalty was overturned. googletag.cmd.push Bradley was putting over some sweet scores, but missed a simple free before the break. Noel Raffertyand Paul Cleary scored early second half points for Screen, as they came back into the game. The concern at Davitt Park was the falling light and as the game developed, visibility was becoming more of a problem. Midway through the second half, Colm Murphy can feel hard done by to pick up a second yellow card and Lavey were down to  men. Seconds earlier, Noel Rafferty looked to have a certain penalty shout waved on. Without Murphy, Lavey were not able to match Screens hunger around the breaking ball and the game was already slipping away from them. Two Fintan Bradley frees looked to have weathered the storm until McSorleys winning goal.

Lissan conceded their first game to Drumsurn and last week surrendered from a position of strength against Doire Trasna. Shea McKernan had the ball in the net within minutes of the start, getting on the end of a slick passing movement to slot home. Rather than building it, eight first half wides was the story of Kieran OKanes young sides exploits. For all their shortcomings, they were well in contention and led by two points, with eight minutes to go. googletag.cmd.push Disaster struck when Stephen Conway, who made a fine first half save from Ciaran McGowan, shanked a kick-out to Eoghan Quigg who passed for Micheaacutel McNaught to strike a hammer blow to the net they never recovered from. At midfield for Lissan is the towering Conor Loane, an All-Ireland winning goalkeeper with Holy Trinity Cookstown, and MacRory Cup medallist Mattie Loughran, who kicked four points last week. The pair dovetailed well together and in Iarlaith Donaghy, they have one of the most exciting players in the county playing at number six. Defender Oran Donnelly wears , but sits back as a sweeper, with the nimble Joey Quinn playing up front with Tiarnach Donaghy. googletag.cmd.push Coming Lissans way this weekend is a Faughanvale side who have posted two wins from as many games and had a tough battle to overcome a Drumsurn side who arguably deserved a draw. Manager Joe Gray has had to come to terms with long-term injuries to Oisin Quinn and Jordan Curran. Michael McLaughlin spent last summer in America, but he is back and forms an inside forward duo with Kevin Martin. Paddy OKane is one of their key players and Lissan may face a kick-back after his quiet outing in the last round. He played off the front two, but their running game almost bypassed their middle sector. Gordon Fahey and Michael Sweeney are a formidable defensive spine, with skipper Conor McGuinness nestled between them as a sweeper - a formation that will mirror the Lissan setup,both managers adopt the same approach this time around. The Vale will also have questions to answer. When Drumsurn went down to  men, Grays side couldnt get their hands on the ball and had to rely on a strong finish. On the flip side, apart from the one they scored, the Vale carved out the best two goal chances over the course of the game. A tough ask for Lissan who cant finish above the bottom. Kieran OKane will have his side well-prepared, but Faughanvale will be fancied to come through. VERDICT: Faughanvale RELATEDJoe Grays reaction to the Vales win over Drumsurn.

Dan McGrellis passed away peacefully at home, surrounded by his family and friends. He was a well-known and much-loved member of the community, parish and local GAA club. At his funeral, Fr McGavigan paid tribute to a ‘good father, grandfather and great grandfather’. “Dan was a remarkable man. He knew from a young age the importance of a father, losing his own father to cancer when he was only twelve,” he told mourners at St Joseph’s Church, Fincarn. googletag.cmd.push “He was the second of nine children, and took on a father’s role, moving to Scotland to work so money could be sent home for his mother and siblings. “Such instinctive sacrice and generosity, learned at a young age, was to be the mark of the man. Dan was to have very soon celebrated  years as a pioneer, the pin proudly worn on his lapel. “He was far from a shrinking violet, though, and was a regular in the pub in his youth, enjoying a game of darts with friends. The soberest, but perhaps the most sociable of all his friends. googletag.cmd.push “The parish of Banagher has lost a faithful friend who was a companion to many people work colleagues, extended family, GAA, pioneers and the community association to name but a few. “He had a huge heart and had room for everyone, so of course we are sad, even though he lived a long and incredibly full le.” Dan and the rest of the St Marys committee pictured at the opening of the new pitch in . The McGrellis family are steeped in the tradition of the club, and Dan’s seven sons wore maroon ties at his funeral in a nod to their father’s deep affection for St Mary’s. Dan was chairperson of St Mary’s GAC, Banagher from  to , having been vice chairperson in  and . As well as his involvement with the GAA, Fr McGavigan told the congregation that Dan contributed greatly to parish and community le in Banagher. “Parish and community were central to his le,” he said. “He lobbied the council for a footpath from Feeny village to the chapel, ensuring access for the local primary school, and was an early member of Feeny Community Association. “Helping to establish the parish bingo, he was involved in the renovation of the parish hall and ably served for many years as a sacristan in this church.”  Dan’s most loyal commitment, though, was to his family and his we Anne. Fr McGavigan told mourners how the couple encountered each other long before they were married. “The story is told of how he, as a young boy, watched a christening pass his mother’s shop on the way to the chapel,” he said. “The baby was a certain Anne Conway, who was brought here to be christened. “He recalled how he wasn’t much interested in a baby at eight years old, but recounted how a neighbour remarked, ‘this could be the girl you marry’. “Years later, they met again at a dance in Aghabrack and they soon married and settled down to begin a family. So began the McGrellis dynasty. “Dan and Anne patiently, generously and faithfully raised their twelve children, instilling in them their own virtues of hard work, kindness, generosity, respect and good humour.” Fr McGavigan concluded by encouraging Dan’s many children, grandchildren and great grandchildren to be inspired by his le. “Dan was a powerhouse of prayer and work and an inspiration for all of the McGrellis family,” he said “To his children, grandchildren and great grandchildren be inspired today by the holy le and death of a good man, and see in his le the virtues you would like to see in your own. “If you do this, Dan will live on in you and future generations. Woven into your sadness, there is a deep gratitude to God for all that this man has been to us. “We are happy, because we know deep down that his le was complete and that he, in the end, was ready for God.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Aoibhine McFlynn, from Ballyronan, was chosen for the role of ‘Cassie’ in the film, which was produced in East Susseux, England and released in cinemas on July . The plot follows a reclusive writer who forms a relationship with a young London evacuee named Frank after adopting him during World War Two. Her mum, Edele, says rubbing shoulders with stars like Gemma Arterton and Sir Tom Courtenay, has left Aoibhine keen for more acting experience. “She enjoyed it. She says she wants to do more and that’s what she wants to get into. Hopefully, on the back of this, something  might pop up,” she told the County Derry Post. googletag.cmd.push “I don’t think people thought it was going to be such a big movie. Aoibhine got into it through Alison Campbell models, who put her in for it. Aoibhine with Sir Tom Courtenay. “They flew us over and set us up for four or five nights. The crew and all had been filming for about six weeks, so we were over on the second last week for her scene. “Her role is ‘Cassie’, an evacuee child. It’s a small role, but she features three or four times, so we’ll have to go to the cinema and see her.” Despite her new-found fame, mum Edele says the -year-old has remained grounded after initially filming the scenes almost two years ago. googletag.cmd.push “She’s actually a shy wee thing, a very modest wee girl. She wouldn’t tell anybody that she’s in anything,” she said. “We obviously had to get confirmation from school to let her go, so before she left, Mr Scullion at the Loup called her up in front of everyone and I think she nearly died! “She’s just taken it in her stride. She was a bit younger when we went and did it and it was amazing to see the whole set up and how it was all done.” Pictured with the films lead, Gemma Arterton. Aoibhine’s family are hoping to get together over the next few weeks to watch her on screen, but in the meantime, cinema goers may unknowingly find themselves sharing a room with a film star. “I’ll make them all aware, I’ll roar at the screen,” said Edele, who was planning on visiting the cinema at the weekend with Aoibhine and her husband, Shane. “We might be able to get it here streaming with the family next weekend,we don’t get to the cinema.” Edele says Aoibhine, who also features on a current Phoenix Gas television advertisement, didn’t have to abandon her Loughshore tone for the role. “They wanted the Northern Irish accent, so she didn’t have to change it or anything.” Summerland is in cinemas now and can also be streamed on Amazon Prime Video.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In family, business and community. Devastation and disbelief reached into every corner of County Derry last Friday afternoon, as the news of his sudden death filtered through. Everyone I spoke with over the weekend was just in shock. My thoughts are with his we Anne and the entire family, as they unite in grief. Rarely would you see Hugh without Anne. They went everywhere together. His family were never far behind. My sympathy also goes out to his daughter Maureen, son Carlus, son-in-law Benny, daughter-in-law Maria, his grandchildren Ollie, Leo, Fiadh and Lily Anna. Its not often you go to Owenbeg that you dont see them all there to take in a game, no matter who is playing. googletag.cmd.push Hugh Peter was well-known far from his own townland of Cloane. He was Managing Director of HA Mechanical Services, a company he started in  with his we Anne. Together, they grew the firm from six employees to over . When you think of a local community, the provision of local jobs is unquantiable. The parish of Ballinascreen and the surrounding areas have benefited greatly. In terms of an amateur sport, like GAA, one of the factors rarely mentioned is the importance of clubs not losing players forced to emigrate in search of work. This cant be done without stable employers, without people like Hugh McWilliams. googletag.cmd.push Then there is the sponsorship element. Hugh and Anne have been the Derry GAAs main sponsor since taking over at the end of the  season. They also sponsor the camogie and ladies football teams, while also backing the senior football and hurling leagues. Derrys statement last week was very apt, labelling Hugh as a giant of generosity and all at a time when the HA logo wasnt splashed across the national media like the big hitters of Dublin, Kerry and Kilkenny. Closer to home, HA are also in their fth year as Ballinascreens main sponsor, also across all four codes. Other examples of Hughs generosity went unnoticed, away from having a company brand associated with it. All the local schools benefited from his support, local mental health charity STEPS and St Vincent de Paul. The list could go on. Two years ago, to celebrate  years of HA, he held a family fun day at the local An Raacuteth Dubh Community Centre. From the moment you walked through the gate, everything was on Hughs tab...from the bouncy castles to the refreshments. They also organised a charity golf day and coffee morning, with all three events raising pound,. He bumped the total up himself, so both charities – Cancer Fund for Children and South Derry Downs Syndrome - were presented with cheques for poundk. For such a successful business man, he never forgot where he came from. He wasnt shy about putting something back. And all with modesty, far from any fanfare. One of the most enjoyable years of my le was the summer of , training the Derry minor team. A swing of Damien Reddingtons left boot may have snatched the All-Ireland minor title from our grasp, but I feel much richer for being involved with that group. We had some craic along the way - sailing up and down the M in the big yellow bus, with the tunes belting and the summer opening up in front of us. There was also a special bond with the supporters and parents. It was the first time I met Hugh Peter. He left Carlus to the bus one Saturday morning when we were Ballyshannon bound to play Roscommon in a challenge game. The Rossies had won the All-Ireland the previous year and Hugh was asking how long I thought the Derry minors summer would last. We hadnt a clue. It was one eventful step at a time. Fast forward to September and as I got off the bus and trudged through the lobby of Dublins Crown Plaza after the All-Ireland final heartbreak, Hugh came forward to shake my hand. Defeat was gurgling in the pit of both our stomachs. I cant remember exactly what he said, but, he was thanking us, while relaying how much his son had enjoyed the journey. Years later when John Francis Bradley, who also played on the same minor team, was seriously injured in a car crash and fighting for his le. Ballinascreen club, with Hugh McWilliams at the forefront, arranged a Night for JF. Screen club was packed. You couldnt have turned a sweet in your mouth. In hospital that night, John Francis spoke for the first time since his accident. The next morning Hugh delivered the many items from the auction to the Bradley family and gave him a pathway back into work. The club later handed over the money donated on the night. Another example of giving. You could write a book. A few months after that All-Ireland minor final, Hugh arranged for a gathering of the squad at the Hogan Stand Bar in Moneyneena. There was music, a buffet, craic and Hugh was in his element. It was like closure on the season. I always enjoy calling into the Hogan Stand and the owner, Tempo man Charlie McNally, claims his porter is the best around. If Hugh was there, he would always send a pint down my direction, like he did for many others. He would never accept one back, but would merely invite you into a football debate with him and Pele, his close friend John Scullion. Hugh would love it. The topic was usually - Screen, Slaughtneil, the Derry championship, the county scene and back to Screen again. Often there would be agreement, sometimes there wasnt and the slagging would begin before theydto chatting with their wives Anne and Mary G. The four of them were so close. Tuesday was no doubt tough day for everyone in the McWilliams family circle, in Ballinascreen and beyond as they said their final goodbye. Hugh often coined the phrase its not about being here for a long time, its about being here for a good time. He always had time for a smile, time for a chat and enjoyed le to the full. He will be sadly missed by his family and friends. I count myself lucky to have known him.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In family, business and community. Devastation and disbelief reached into every corner of County Derry last Friday afternoon, as the news of his sudden death filtered through. Everyone I spoke with over the weekend was just in shock. My thoughts are with his we Anne and the entire family, as they unite in grief. Rarely would you see Hugh without Anne. They went everywhere together. His family were never far behind. My sympathy also goes out to his daughter Maureen, son Carlus, son-in-law Benny, daughter-in-law Maria, his grandchildren Ollie, Leo, Fiadh and Lily Anna. Its not often you go to Owenbeg that you dont see them all there to take in a game, no matter who is playing. googletag.cmd.push Hugh Peter was well-known far from his own townland of Cloane. He was Managing Director of HA Mechanical Services, a company he started in  with his we Anne. Together, they grew the firm from six employees to over . When you think of a local community, the provision of local jobs is unquantiable. The parish of Ballinascreen and the surrounding areas have benefited greatly. In terms of an amateur sport, like GAA, one of the factors rarely mentioned is the importance of clubs not losing players forced to emigrate in search of work. This cant be done without stable employers, without people like Hugh McWilliams. googletag.cmd.push Then there is the sponsorship element. Hugh and Anne have been the Derry GAAs main sponsor since taking over at the end of the  season. They also sponsor the camogie and ladies football teams, while also backing the senior football and hurling leagues. Derrys statement last week was very apt, labelling Hugh as a giant of generosity and all at a time when the HA logo wasnt splashed across the national media like the big hitters of Dublin, Kerry and Kilkenny. Closer to home, HA are also in their fth year as Ballinascreens main sponsor, also across all four codes. Other examples of Hughs generosity went unnoticed, away from having a company brand associated with it. All the local schools benefited from his support, local mental health charity STEPS and St Vincent de Paul. The list could go on. Two years ago, to celebrate  years of HA, he held a family fun day at the local An Raacuteth Dubh Community Centre. From the moment you walked through the gate, everything was on Hughs tab...from the bouncy castles to the refreshments. They also organised a charity golf day and coffee morning, with all three events raising pound,. He bumped the total up himself, so both charities – Cancer Fund for Children and South Derry Downs Syndrome - were presented with cheques for poundk. For such a successful business man, he never forgot where he came from. He wasnt shy about putting something back. And all with modesty, far from any fanfare. One of the most enjoyable years of my le was the summer of , training the Derry minor team. A swing of Damien Reddingtons left boot may have snatched the All-Ireland minor title from our grasp, but I feel much richer for being involved with that group. We had some craic along the way - sailing up and down the M in the big yellow bus, with the tunes belting and the summer opening up in front of us. There was also a special bond with the supporters and parents. It was the first time I met Hugh Peter. He left Carlus to the bus one Saturday morning when we were Ballyshannon bound to play Roscommon in a challenge game. The Rossies had won the All-Ireland the previous year and Hugh was asking how long I thought the Derry minors summer would last. We hadnt a clue. It was one eventful step at a time.

An accident in stage six of last weekends Rally Liepāja in Latvia, saw him forced out of the race. Devine, the current Motorsport Ireland International Driver of the Year, was out to make amends following an early retirement on the opening round in Italy late last month. Callum missed the pre event shakedown and qualying due to an issue with his Hyundai i R, but the mechanics had ready for the start of the event. He was beginning to grow in confidence on his first loose surface event at this level. Steady driving saw Callum and co-driver Brian Hoy work their way into the top  early on day two and up to fourth place among the ERC Junior crews. googletag.cmd.push It all came to an end on stage six , as Devine recalls. “We were actually just starting to get into it and growing in confidence. As I mentioned before the event, it’s not a place you want to get things wrong as the speeds are so high. Unfortunately, that’s exactly what happened. We carried a bit too much speed into a fast right hander and caught the undergrowth on the outside of the corner, sending us into a roll and out of the event. Myself and Brian are okay, just a little sore and thankfully all the safety equipment stood up to the accident, the Hyundai is a strong car. googletag.cmd.push I’m just so disappointed for all the team who worked so hard over the last month. To have taken just one point from the opening pair of rallies is sickening and doesn’t reflect all the work we’ve put in, hopefully we can put it right before the end of the season.” Devine’s accident casts some doubt over his participation in the next round of the championship, Rallye Azores in mid-September. The PCRS team will assess the damage to the car in the coming days but evenit can be sorted in time to make the boat to travel to the Azores, presently Portugal and its associated territories aren’t on the Irish green list for travel. “If the car can be sorted for Azores, travel restrictions could be an issue. As it stands, not only myself and Brian, but also all the mechanics would have to isolate for two weeks after ing to Ireland after the rally. I work between events so to isolate for two weeks uponwould be a big problem. Obviously government guidelines are changing all the time so we’ll just have to wait and see. It’s worth pointing out this isn’t just a problem for us, it’s a problem for all competitors and teams in the championship.” While Rallye Azores may be in doubt, one thing that isn’t in doubt in Devine’s commitment to the Motorsport Ireland Rally Academy. “I realise how lucky I am to have this opportunity and I’m ready to knuckle down and refocus in preparation for our next ERC event,” Devine continued. Following Rallye Azores, the remaining rounds of the  ERC will take place in Cyprus, Hungary and the Canary Islands.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Trailing to Joseph Olowu’s early goal, the Candystripes were in trouble again, but hit back strongly in the second half with goals from Walter Figueira and Adam Hamill before James Akintunde sealed the win late on. The game started disastrously for Derry who conceded with the first attack on their goal just three minutes in, Kevin O’Connor’s high ball into a packed penalty area spilled by Peter Cherrie, allowing Joseph Olowu to capitalise, volleying the ball into the empty net to make it - to the visitors. googletag.cmd.push City were straight onto the offensive at the start of the second half two goals in three minutes turned the game on its head. City’s persistence finally paid off on  minutes as they got their equaliser and it was another goalkeeper error which led to the goal. Mark McNulty was unable to hold onto a high cross from Ciaran Coll and Jack Malone did superbly to keep the opportunity alive, pulling it back for Walter Figueira to fire home, much to the relief and delight of the home side. That relief turned to joy within two minutes as City turned the game on its head with a second goal. Again Meite was heavily involved, showing great strength and skill to hold off two Cork defenders on his way to goal. Meite seemed certain to score, but his effort was brilliantly parried by McNulty, only for the ball to roll across goal where Hammill was on hand to roll in his first goal for the club. googletag.cmd.push It took an extraordinary save from Cherrie to keep his team ahead in the last five minutes as the City goalkeeper somehow got his hand to Connor Simpson’s cross, clawing it off the goal line to save his team. The win was sealed with the very last kick of the game as James Akintunde collected the ball off Stephen Mallon and hooked the ball into the bottom corner to give the Candystripes a very valuable win. Teams DERRY CITY: Cherrie, Coll, Toal, Cole, Horgan, McCormack, Malone, Thomson , Hammill , Figueira , Meite . CORK CITY: McNulty, Olowu , Bennett, O’Connor, Fleming, Ochieng , Coleman, Slevin , Dalling, Simpson, Fenwick .

I am very proud that our incoming head boy, Cormac Savage, was at the forefront of this campaign and believe his contribution was pivotal in ensuring that the sense of injustice and unfairness felt by his peers was articulated in a forceful and timely manner.Mr McCann also welcomed confirmation that GCSE grades will be awarded as calculated by schools.ldquoTeachers were asked to exercise professional judgment and engaged in a robust process to ensure that pupil effort and attainment in the period from September  to the unexpected and unprecedented closing of schools in March was rewarded, he said. ldquoA great deal of time and energy was devoted to this task by the staff of St. Patrickrsquos Grammar to ensure that grades were awarded fairly and consistently.Down High principal Maud Perry, said after the initial publication of results last Thursday the school was celebrating its best ever A-Level achievements.ldquoThis was unsurprising, as this particular year group achieved the schoolrsquos best ever AS results last year, she said.ldquoThis was a very dferent year in so many ways, but Down High pupils continue to be among the best qualied of their generation and, beyond the curriculum, our pupils are enriched, socially confident and ready to take their place as leaders of the future in whatever fields they choose. Congratulations to all of the pupils on these fully deserved grades.Shimna Integrated College principal Kevin Lambe congratulated the schoolrsquos ldquowonderful A level students who weathered the storm of this unprecedented year.He said he was delighted that the vast majority of students had already been placed at their first choice of university before the restoration of the teacher assessed grades on Monday afternoon.Mr Lambe said that while there had been considerable controversy about the process of awarding grades this year, he paid tribute to the excellent guidance document CCEA provided and to the commitment and energy his staff brought to the grading process.ldquoI am quite sure that the moderation process was undertaken in good faith, but it caused dreadful damage and heartache across the country, he said. ldquoThe CCEA guidance was sound, the work of teachers was thoroughgoing, the teacher awarded grades were the right ones and I am absolutely delighted that they have been restored.Ballynahinchrsquos Assumption Grammar School said it was delighted with the government U-turn in awarding grades as the original process ldquocaused signicant emotional upheaval which affected students, parents and our staff.ldquoWe are fortunate in that over % of our A students had already accessed their chosen university or workplace and hope that now almost every girl has achieved their true potential and will be able to access a iety of career pathways. Assumption Girls set the highest of standards year on year and we are proud of our Year  Girls who excelled in every subject at every level, said a school statement.ldquoOur AS students now have a solid foundation of grades which will give them the confidence to believe in their own potential to achieve at the highest of levels as they enter A level. We wish our GCSE girls the best of luck for tomorrowrsquos results.Castlewellanrsquos St Malachyrsquos High School said it was pleased with Education Minister Peter Weirrsquos announcement that AS and A level students will receive their centre assessment grades or the grade awarded by the examining body, whichever is higher.ldquoWe continue to work hard in St Malachyrsquos in the best interests of all our young people, said a statement issued on Monday evening. We are all here in St Malachyrsquos to help and support our students in the best way we can.
