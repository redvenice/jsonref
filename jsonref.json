Another Tory sell out of fishing on the cards. \u0027And if wider trade negotiation not agreed by July 2020, nor will fishing agreement (‘best endeavours’ not a guarantee) - and possibility of 2 year transition kicks in. \u0027So not guaranteed to be out of CFP by end 2020.\u0027But while Scots were screaming betrayal, Scottish Secretary David Mundell fiercely defended the deal.He said: \u0027The PM has fiercely resisted the efforts of EU States to make an explicit link between access to our waters and access to markets. \u0027We will negotiate and decide, as an independent coastal state, on access and quota on an annual basis just like Norway and Iceland do now.\u0027   And sources at Michael Gove\u0027s Environment Department were insisting they had won some hard-fought concessions and delivered on promises to reclaim Britain\u0027s sovereign rights overs its waters.Sources said the UK\u0027s \u0027red lines\u0027 on fishing had been protected, and that a push by the EU to keeps its current access to UK waters had been defeated. The furious row erupted after Mrs May today dramatically sealed her Brexit deal with Brussels after talks ran late into the night.          The Prime Minister (pictured outside No10 today) has repeatedly vowed to take the UK out of the hated Commons Fisheries Policy and reclaim its rights as an independent coastal stateThe PM addressed the country on the steps of Downing Street- hailing her deal as the best one for Britain.She said: \u0027This is the right deal for the UK.

She banked a £265million salary, including idendsFew major televised sporting events are complete without the glowering apparition of Cockney actor Ray Winstone enticing viewers – in menacingly geezerish tones – to take a punt on the action during commercial breaks.The company he plugs, bet365, have never revealed how much this self-styled working-class hero pockets for persuading people to fritter away their hard-earned money (only in a ‘responsible’ manner, of course).Yesterday, however, in their annual report, the Stoke-based firm was obliged to reveal the eye-watering amount paid last year to its founder and majority shareholder, Denise Coates CBE.Astonishingly, this little-known woman – who more resembles a maths teacher than a gambling mogul, with her studious manner, staid outfits and soft Potteries brogue – banked £265million in salary and idends, making her surely the best-paid female executive in Britain, and possibly the world.          Ms Coates, pictured with her father Peter, who is also a director of her betting companyTo put this sum – paid from bet365’s £682.4m annual profit – into perspective, it is 1,300 times more than the amount earned by Theresa May, 9,500 times the average UK salary, and four times more than the FTSE 100’s top earner, housebuilding boss Jeff Fairburn, received. It is also £47m more than Miss Coates pocketed in the previous financial year.Had this 51-year-old mother of four adopted children been so spectacularly rewarded for her achievements in many other fields of industry, her success would be a cause for celebration.After all, having taken over the running of a handful of provincial bookmaker’s shops belonging to her father, soon after leaving university, she has transformed the business into ‘the world’s favourite online sports gambling company’ – to quote Winstone’s oft-repeated boast: a remarkable entrepreneurial feat.We ought to admire the fact that Miss Coates conquered a traditionally male-dominated business by spotting the potential fortune to be made from internet gambling before far bigger players, such as Ladbroke and William Hill.However, beyond the Stoke industrial park where bet365’s steel-and-glass HQ is located – the preponderance of sleek cars indicates the handsome rewards received by its other senior staff - there were few congratulatory words for Miss Coates yesterday.  \u0027Millions for one and misery for many\u0027: Fury mounts over...Rapacious gambling giants drove our son to suicide - how...Share this articleI could understand her sentiments. The previous evening I had attended the weekly meeting of a group of Stoke gambling addicts, and listened to their heart-rending stories. Men such as George, a 38-year-old father-of-two who gravitated to online sites such as bet365 after playing fruit machines in his teens. He reckoned he had lost £750,000 in the past 20 years.Though bet365 and other companies make much of their responsible gambling policy – which advises clients to gamble only what they can afford, resist ‘chasing their losses’, monitor the amount of time they spend playing, and suspend accounts if they fear they are developing a habit – this was not George’s experience.          Critics of the salary rise took to Twitter to day to express their anger. One called Coates\u0027 payout \u0027grotesquely obscene\u0027            Results earlier this month show privately-held bet365 took an overall revenue of £2.72billion in the 12 months ending March 2018But one can’t help but wonder whether Miss Coates stops to think about young men such as this when she is banking her astronomical pay-cheque. Being a caring family woman, we must assume that she does.Of course, when she took over her father’s ‘small chain of pretty rubbish betting shops’, as she puts it, and began running them from a Portakabin, she cannot have foreseen that she would one day sit astride the world’s most lucrative online betting enterprise. Nor can she have envisaged that a sizeable number of her company’s 22 million clients would become so hopelessly hooked on the product she developed that they would lose everything – their homes, jobs, marriages, and even their lives.Yet given the mesmerising array of wagers offered by bet365 and its competitors, and the irresistible appeal of their adverts and inducements, there is an inevitability about the pernicious gambling addiction epidemic that now grips Britain. And for that, Miss Coates must surely bear her share of responsibility.When building her empire, she says the defining moment came at the start of the millennium when she mortgaged the chain of betting shops to raise £15m, and used it to create a slick, sophisticated online business.‘We were the ultimate gamblers, if you like,’ she recalled, several years ago in a rare interview.For this unlikely tycoon, that gamble has paid off rather handsomely. Regrettably, for all too many of the punters who line her coffers, it has led only to the depths of despair."},{"url":null,"title":"Model David Gandy People getting knickers twist M S display","story":"    Male model David Gandy mocked the criticism of the Marks and Spencer Christmas window           He posted this image of him modelling underwear as part of the Tweet in response to the row          \u0027Fancy little knickers\u0027 row: Women were offended over the Marks and Spencer display which one member of the Feminist Friends Nottingham claimed was \u0027vomit-inducing\u0027He added a link to the underwear on the site.When a person said he had missed the point, Gandy said: \u0027Not missing the point at all.\u0027Just making fun of it, as many people are getting their knickers in a twist about it … \u0027He then added another picture of himself in washing up gloves.\u0027I\u0027m outraged that M\u0026ampS had me wearing \u0027must have fancy little washing up gloves\u0027 to do the washing up!\u0027 he said.\u0027Have we not learnt anything over the last 35 years.\u0027We all have dishwashers!\u0027The feminists in the Nottingham group called the display \u0027grossly offensive\u0027.

At speeds below 11mph the engine shuts off while the driver applies the brakes. When the driver pulls away, the stored energy is redeployed to boost the engine under acceleration and thus reduce fuel consumption.Land Rover said:’The result is a refined, quiet and efficient drive in built-up traffic heavy areas, in addition to efficiency savings.’The new Evoque is available in four trim levels: S, SE, HSE and personalised ‘R-Dynamic’, though a fully stocked ‘First Edition’ costing around £55,000 will be available in the first year only.The Evoque P300 all-wheel drive model costing £40,350 is powered by a 300 horse-power (HP) 2.0 litre 4-cylinder petrol engine linked to ‘mild hybrid’ electric motor and battery and a 9-speed automatic gear-box.It accelerates from rest to 60mph in 6.3 seconds up to a top speed of 150mph, with fuel economy of 28.7mpg and CO2 emissions of 186gkm.The entry-level new Evoque costing from £31,600 is the 2-wheel-drive D150 with a 2.0 litre 150 horse-power four-cylinder diesel engine linked to a six-speed manual gear-box which accelerates from 0-60mph in 9.9 seconds up to a top speed of 125mph with fuel economy of 42mpg and CO2 emissions of 143gkm.Thanks to a longer wheel-base, the new Evoque has more interior space and promises more knee-room for passengers, more luggage space sufficient for a set of golf clubs, and extra storage for small items.The larger glove-box and centre cubby-hole can now fit computer tablets, hand-bags and bottles. There is a 10 per cent increase in luggage space to 591 litres, increasing 1,383 litres with flexible second-row seats folded down.New 21 inch wheels are available and the new Evoque can now wade through 600mm of water – up by 100mm on the previous model. The 4X4 also features super-slim Matrix LED headlights.To help cope with conditions on and off the road, second generation ‘Terrain Response 2’ is available as standard for Evoques with All-Wheel Drive and automatic transmission. This comprises four modes - Comfort, Sand, Grass-Gravel-Snow, and Mud \u0026amp Ruts. But a new ‘Auto mode makes life even easier by automatically selecting the most appropriate setting for the conditions and adjusting the vehicle’s performance to suit the terrain.There is also Hill Descent and Gradient Release Control and All-Terrain Progress Control.The first generation Evoque was launched eight years ago (2010) at Kensington palace with the help of former Spice Girl Victoria Beckham - ‘Posh Spice’ -who later went on to help style a blinged up £200,000 ‘VB’ limited edition version bearing her name. Since launch more than 772,00 Evoques been sold, one in 5 in the UK.Jaguar Land Rover’s director of electronics and software Alex Heslop said: ‘To own a Range Rover is to be at the forefront of vehicle technology, for capability and driver convenience. The new Evoque is one of the most technologically advanced vehicles available and with the smart rear view mirror it literally has eyes in the back of its head.’Land Rover chief design officer Gerry McGovern said: ‘When the Range Rover Evoque made its debut back in 2010 it transformed the world of compact SUVs and the new model is set to continue that remarkable journey.’The new Evoque is being built at jaguar Land Rover’s factory at Halewood on Merseyside following £1billion of investment, including £110million at the plant.

Sometimes they can only operate after sundown. They have had to cover their faces when they go out in public. \u0027They have had to remove the rosary that hangs from their car rear-view mirror for fear of attack.\u0027   What is next: Ms Bibi freed from prison, but the family has said it is  too dangerous for them to stay in Pakistan and they are being hunted door-to-door by hardliners The Pakistani government has struck a deal with a fundamentalist Islamic party, under which the party would call off violent protests at her acquittal while a review of the court\u0027s decision is taking place.The deal has led to accusations of appeasement and capitulation being levelled at  Pakistan\u0027s prime minister, Imran Khan. Tory vice-chairman QUITS over government\u0027s failure to offer...‘We are in your emails and computer, watching and recording...Share this article\u0027There will be a war if they send Asia out of country,\u0027 hardline Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) leader Cleric Khadim Hussain Rizvi said after the deal was reached.Pontifex told the Guardian that Bibi\u0027s family were relying on their faith to get them through each day, and that they hope they might have a future one day outside Pakistan.              A Pakistani supporter of the Ahle Sunnat Wal Jamaat (ASWJ), a hardline religious party, holds an image of Christian woman Asia Bibi during a protest rally following the Supreme Court\u0027s decision to acquit herA total of 19 MPs and Peers, including former foreign secretary Boris Johnson, have written to Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt urging him to allow her to Britain, but the government has refused to answer questions on whether it will consider asylum. Some reports suggest ministers are worried about a possible backlash from British Pakistani Muslims, though the The Muslim Council of Britain has strongly denied this.Labour MP Mary Creagh, one of the signatories to the letter, said: \u0027I think the world has been shocked by the awful treatment of Asia Bibi and her unjust imprisonment.           Ms Bibi\u0027s husband Ashiq Masih, pictured with their daughter Eisham, has asked Donald Trump and Theresa May to grant the family asylum. They are constantly on the move as they are being hunted down by religious hardliners \u0027Several countries have offered her asylum and it is a mark of shame that Britain has failed to do so given our large Pakistani community here and our historic ties.\u0027 John Woodcock, an Independent MP on the home affairs select committee, said: \u0027The UK should be proud to be a sanctuary for those being persecuted because of their religion so it would be appalling if Asia Bibi is genuinely being denied asylum because of fears she could be targeted by Islamist hardliners over here.\u0027 The Muslim Council of Britain wrote on Twitter: \u0027There are unfounded media reports that Pakistani national Asia Bibi is being denied asylum into the UK because of concerns from British Muslims.           The protests only subsided after Khan\u0027s government made a deal with hardline Islamist that they could appeal her release, and that Ms Bibi would have to stay in the country  A supporter of a radical Islamic group stands guard as protesters block a main road to condemn a Supreme Court decision that acquitted Asia Bibi\u0027We find such insinuations to be as nonsensical as they are isive. We see no reason why Asia Bibi should be denied asylum into the UK.\u0027The allegations against Ms Bibi date back to 2009, when she was working in a field near her home village in Sheikhupura, Punjab and was asked to fetch water.The Muslim women she was labouring with objected, saying that as a non-Muslim Ms Bibi was unfit to drink from the same water bowl as them.Ms Bibi would later say that the women insulted her religion, to which she responded: \u0027I believe in my religion and in Jesus Christ, who died on the cross for the sins of mankind. What did your Prophet Mohammed ever do to save mankind?\u0027  Asia Bibi, 53, was sentenced to death in 2010, after being accused of insulting Islam during an argument over a water bowl with a group of Muslim women in PunjabThis prompted the Muslim women to go to a local imam and accuse Ms Bibi of blasphemy against the Prophet Mohammed.   Before Ms Bibi could be arrested on any official charges, a violent mob descended on their family home, and beat Ms Bibi up in front of her children.The abuse was so violent, police were called to the scene, but after rescuing the mother-of-five, they arrested her and threw her in jail - and a year later she was convicted of blasphemy.Blasphemy is a charge so sensitive in Pakistan that anyone even accused of insulting Islam risks a violent and bloody death at the hands of vigilantes.The charge is punishable by a maximum penalty of death under legislation that rights groups say is routinely abused by religious extremists as well as ordinary Pakistanis to settle personal scores.The law does not define what blasphemy constitutes, and evidence is often not reproduced in court for fear of committing a fresh offence.Despite this, calls for reform of the blasphemy law have regularly been met with violence and rejected.Asia Bibi family being hunted \u0027house to house\u0027 in Pakistan | World news | The Guardian"},{"url":null,"title":"Childrens bucket list inspired new Education Secretary","story":"    Bucket list goals for children in each year are hoped to make young people more resilient (stock)5.

The tower was closed to tourists in 1990 (pictured) for fear it might topple over as it leans on its south sideIn 1987 the Tower of Pisa was declared a World Heritage Site by the United Nation\u0027s cultural organisation Unesco, but as fears grew that it would topple over it was closed to the public in 1990 and engineers worked to stabilise it for the next 11 years.   The 12th-century tower was reopened to the public in 2001 and remained open throughout a restoration costing almost £6million - partly to keep tourists happy, but partly because the revenue from ticket sales helped pay for the upkeep. The tower attracts over one million visitors a year.By using hundreds of tons of lead counterweights at the base and extracting soil from under the foundations, engineers initially shaved 17 inches off the lean.The tower\u0027s famous lean appeared about five years after construction began in 1173, and before the structure was finished. The clay and sand below the tower is far softer on the south side than the north, and had already started to shift when the builders were working on the third of the tower\u0027s eight stories.     Just seven miles from the Mediterranean Sea on the west coast of Italy, the tower, weighs some 14,500 metric tonnes and is visited by more than one million tourists every yearThis resulted in the now-iconic defection in the tower, but initially it meant  construction was paused with only the first three stories completed.After a 90-year hiatus, engineers restarted work on the tower and built the additional floors diagonally in an attempt offset the tilt.Further disruptions meant the completion of the structure - a symbol of the maritime might of the republic of Pisa - was delayed until 1372, a full 199 years after it began. Unconventional family who sold ALL of their possessions to...Pictured: New multi-billion dollar \u0027Riviera of the Middle...Share this article    The iconic eight-storey tower took 200 years to complete Because of the battles between Pisa and nearby Genoa, Lucca and Florence, the construction of the tower was put on hold for almost a century.Thankfully this allowed enough time for the soil to settle - had there not been that length of break, many believe the tower would have toppled over centuries ago.When tools were picked up once more, under architect Giovanni di Simone (who had built the Camposanto Monumentale, the fourth and last building to be erected in Cathedral Square) in 1272, the engineers built upper floors with one side taller than the other, in an effort to compensate for the tilt.Because of this, the tower is actually curved. Construction was halted again in 1284, when the Pisans were defeated by the Genoans in the Battle of Meloria, and the seventh floor was not completed until 1319. Its stewardship at that point had passed to Tommaso di Andrea Pisano. Finally, the bell-chamber was finally added in 1372. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/11/22/15/3CAB047000000578-6418267-image-a-41_1542899315635.jpg","title":"Noel Edmonds calls Lloyds boss cockroach enters Im Celebrity jungle","story":"    Noel Edmonds, the new I\u0027m a Celebrity emperor, says if he eats cockroaches he\u0027ll be thinking of the Lloyds Bank boss he is pursuing for £60m  Mr Edmonds is starting legal actions and will use his TV appearance turn on Lloyds boss Antonio Horta Osorio (right) Vicky Pattison EXCLUSIVE: TV star and fiancé John Noble...Amy Childs debuts glamorous blonde makeover as she steps out...Holly Hagan and Sophie Kasaei work up a sweat in Marrakech...I\u0027m A Celeb: Joel Dommett returns to Extra Camp following...Ashley Roberts wows in animal print dress as she joins...Share this articleHe added: \u0027It\u0027s not going to do any harm to be in the jungle on ITV at peak time every single day for a few weeks\u0027.Mr Edmonds is seeking financial redress from the banking giant after falling victim to fraud by former staff at the Reading branch of HBOS, which Lloyds rescued at the height of the financial crisis.

but within hours he went off sick with \u0027work-related stress\u0027 and never returned.HBOS suspended Scourfield for gross misconduct and he resigned in April 2007.The former banking giant carried out two further investigations but neither one uncovered the \u0027true nature\u0027 of Scourfield\u0027s corrupt relationship with Mills.Prosecutor Brian O\u0027Neill QC said: \u0027Some other employees of the Bank do not emerge well from the investigation, most particularly Paul Burnett, who was Scourfield\u0027s immediate line manager.\u0027There is little doubt that his apparent lack of oversight was partly responsible for Scourfield\u0027s ability to act in the way that he did and for as long as he did.\u0027He continued: \u0027Had Burnett and others paid closer attention to the crib sheet figures, Scourfield\u0027s activities may have been identified sooner..\u0027Burnett lost his position at the Bank as a result of his failures as a manager.\u0027Jurors were told \u0027systems and processes undoubtedly contributed to Scourfield\u0027s ability to behave dishonestly\u0027 as he began \u0027exploiting systemic and personnel weaknesses which he knew to exist\u0027.But Mr O\u0027Neill insisted there is \u0027no evidence\u0027 Mr Burnett or any other HBOS employees were complicit in the conspiracy, and said the bank wasn\u0027t \u0027knowingly turning a blind eye\u0027 to the con.THE FINANCIAL CRASHHBOS, once the UK\u0027s biggest mortgage lender, suffered a devastating collapse during the credit crunch - and taxpayers were left to foot the £20.5billion bill.The banking giant was formed by the 2001 merger of Halifax and The Bank of Scotland and loaned £435billion within seven years as it pursued an aggressive expansion plan.But it lost £10.8billion in 2008 as profits plunged by 70 per cent when the credit crunch hit.Gordon Brown\u0027s Labour government quickly issued a £20.5billion bailout package to fix HBOS\u0027s massive funding gap and avoid a \u0027banking meltdown\u0027.The Banking Standards Commission later slammed HBOS bosses for \u0027catastrophic failings\u0027 and a \u0027colossal failure of management\u0027.Former CEO James Crosby, the \u0027architect\u0027 of HBOS\u0027s failed strategy, forfeited the knighthood he was granted for \u0027services to the finance industry\u0027 after leaving the bank for a senior FSA role in 2006.Mr Crosby, thought to draw more than £400,000 a year from his HBOS pension, said he was \u0027deeply sorry\u0027 for the disaster.In 2012 HBOS senior executive Peter Cummings was fined £500,000 and banned from banking for life by the FSA for his part in the bank\u0027s near-collapse.Mr Cummings retired in 2009 with a £352,000 a year pension after making his name by lending to high-profile clients including Top Shop founder Philip Green.Lloyds Bank acquired HBOS in January 2009 as part of the rescue package.Amid the chaos, Lloyds instructed Deloitte to investigate Scourfield\u0027s activity after the Financial Services Authority (now the Financial Conduct Authority) issued a requirement notice.The criminal investigation didn\u0027t begin until after the report, dubbed Project Windsor, was completed in 2010.THE VICTIMSThe 2010 report revealed that of the £250million written off by HBOS\u0027s IA ision, £245million related to customers under Scourfield\u0027s management.Nearly all of them had engaged QCS\u0027s \u0027consultancy services\u0027.Businesses that fell prey to the criminal plot include golf equipment firm Seoul Nassau, fishing tackle company Sharpe\u0027s Holdings, aviation group Corporate Jet Services (who owned Club 328 and Euromanx), textile business Magenta, restaurant and nightclub operator the Mezzanine Group, and Remnant Media, a company setup to buy porn mags including Asian Babes.HBOS began legal action against some of the clients, including couple Paul and Nikki Turner, who ran Cambridge-based music publisher Zenith before it was destroyed by Scourfield\u0027s scam.The bank took the Turners to court more than 15 times in an unsuccessful attempt to evict them after Scourfield devastated their business.Oxfordshire farmer Justin Riggs, 57, said his livelihood was \u0027annihilated\u0027 when Scourfield authorised a £375,000 loan and advised him to sell land and chicken coops in 2004.The farmer was forced to remortgage his house when his loan rose by £7,000 after he had paid £231,000 in interest and fees.Mr Riggs\u0027 plight was discussed in parliament in 2009 as MP Ed Vaizey noted: \u0027There is a pattern in the way that Mr Scourfield engaged numerous people.\u0027He has taken businesses and loaded them with loans, charges and consultancy fees. It\u0027s now up to HBOS to come to the table.\u0027THE INVESTIGATIONThe six-year investigation, dubbed Operation Hornet, was \u0027the most complex and far-reaching\u0027 fraud case in Thames Valley Police\u0027s history, involving 120 officers.

She banked a £265million salary, including idendsFew major televised sporting events are complete without the glowering apparition of Cockney actor Ray Winstone enticing viewers – in menacingly geezerish tones – to take a punt on the action during commercial breaks.The company he plugs, bet365, have never revealed how much this self-styled working-class hero pockets for persuading people to fritter away their hard-earned money (only in a ‘responsible’ manner, of course).Yesterday, however, in their annual report, the Stoke-based firm was obliged to reveal the eye-watering amount paid last year to its founder and majority shareholder, Denise Coates CBE.Astonishingly, this little-known woman – who more resembles a maths teacher than a gambling mogul, with her studious manner, staid outfits and soft Potteries brogue – banked £265million in salary and idends, making her surely the best-paid female executive in Britain, and possibly the world.          Ms Coates, pictured with her father Peter, who is also a director of her betting companyTo put this sum – paid from bet365’s £682.4m annual profit – into perspective, it is 1,300 times more than the amount earned by Theresa May, 9,500 times the average UK salary, and four times more than the FTSE 100’s top earner, housebuilding boss Jeff Fairburn, received. It is also £47m more than Miss Coates pocketed in the previous financial year.Had this 51-year-old mother of four adopted children been so spectacularly rewarded for her achievements in many other fields of industry, her success would be a cause for celebration.After all, having taken over the running of a handful of provincial bookmaker’s shops belonging to her father, soon after leaving university, she has transformed the business into ‘the world’s favourite online sports gambling company’ – to quote Winstone’s oft-repeated boast: a remarkable entrepreneurial feat.We ought to admire the fact that Miss Coates conquered a traditionally male-dominated business by spotting the potential fortune to be made from internet gambling before far bigger players, such as Ladbroke and William Hill.However, beyond the Stoke industrial park where bet365’s steel-and-glass HQ is located – the preponderance of sleek cars indicates the handsome rewards received by its other senior staff - there were few congratulatory words for Miss Coates yesterday.  \u0027Millions for one and misery for many\u0027: Fury mounts over...Rapacious gambling giants drove our son to suicide - how...Share this articleI could understand her sentiments. The previous evening I had attended the weekly meeting of a group of Stoke gambling addicts, and listened to their heart-rending stories. Men such as George, a 38-year-old father-of-two who gravitated to online sites such as bet365 after playing fruit machines in his teens. He reckoned he had lost £750,000 in the past 20 years.Though bet365 and other companies make much of their responsible gambling policy – which advises clients to gamble only what they can afford, resist ‘chasing their losses’, monitor the amount of time they spend playing, and suspend accounts if they fear they are developing a habit – this was not George’s experience.          Critics of the salary rise took to Twitter to day to express their anger. One called Coates\u0027 payout \u0027grotesquely obscene\u0027            Results earlier this month show privately-held bet365 took an overall revenue of £2.72billion in the 12 months ending March 2018But one can’t help but wonder whether Miss Coates stops to think about young men such as this when she is banking her astronomical pay-cheque. Being a caring family woman, we must assume that she does.Of course, when she took over her father’s ‘small chain of pretty rubbish betting shops’, as she puts it, and began running them from a Portakabin, she cannot have foreseen that she would one day sit astride the world’s most lucrative online betting enterprise. Nor can she have envisaged that a sizeable number of her company’s 22 million clients would become so hopelessly hooked on the product she developed that they would lose everything – their homes, jobs, marriages, and even their lives.Yet given the mesmerising array of wagers offered by bet365 and its competitors, and the irresistible appeal of their adverts and inducements, there is an inevitability about the pernicious gambling addiction epidemic that now grips Britain. And for that, Miss Coates must surely bear her share of responsibility.When building her empire, she says the defining moment came at the start of the millennium when she mortgaged the chain of betting shops to raise £15m, and used it to create a slick, sophisticated online business.‘We were the ultimate gamblers, if you like,’ she recalled, several years ago in a rare interview.For this unlikely tycoon, that gamble has paid off rather handsomely. Regrettably, for all too many of the punters who line her coffers, it has led only to the depths of despair."},{"url":null,"title":"Britains roads not safer 20mph zones","story":"    Researchers have found that newly installed 20mph zones in residential areas have not improved road safety           Town halls have spent millions reducing speed limits to improve both road safety and air quality as well as encouraging people to use bicyclesAlmost half (47 per cent) of drivers are routinely breaking the 20mph limit, with 35 per cent ignoring it in city centres.

Parts of Walsall, Winchester, Liverpool, Brighton, Middlesbrough, Portsmouth and Chichester were among those included in the study. With the exception of Brighton, there has been ‘no significant change in the short term in collisions and casualties’, the report concluded.Lack of enforcement by police was a key reason so many motorists ignored 20mph limits, according to drivers.The study found there was a ‘widespread view among the public’ that the ‘likelihood of being caught exceeding the limit is very small’.The report also found that almost all residents had not walked or cycled any more since 20mph zones were introduced. They have cost anywhere between £10,000 and £1.7million each, according to the DfT. Edmund King, president of the AA, said the report has vindicated the reservations of motorists about 20mph zones.He said: ‘Speed limits need to reflect the nature of the road so that drivers can easily understand why the limit is set.‘We believe that targeted 20mph limits work best on roads where there is an obvious need: outside schools, hospitals or where older and other vulnerable road users are likely to be encountered. Limits are more effective when accompanied by road engineering features.’A DfT spokesman said: ‘The study found 20mph limits have a role to play in improving road safety and, while decisions on speed limits are a matter for councils, it is good to see they are supported by the majority of residents and drivers.’ "},{"url":null,"title":"Ashley Tisdale tweets love woman overshadowed appearance Thanksgiving Parade","story":"    At one point the woman in the audience started making box gestures around her face      Bundled up in a heavy coat, long scarf, woolly hat and gloves, her clothing didn\u0027t restrict her from channeling her inner backing dancing as she swooped and twirled her arms around in front of her face while Tisdale performed.It was the Milly Rock dance – made famous by Brooklyn rapper 2Milly in 2014.The dance may have been appropriate set to the sounds of lyrics such as \u0027I Milly Rock on any block\u0027 but Tisdale was performing her tune about depression.Tisdale\u0027s unexpected backing dancer also demonstrated some some box moves around her head as the performance continued.

He was a former member of the military.\u0027He walked with a limp which he said had been caused by an injury he picked up in the Army. He also said that he had a wife and kids but I never saw them.\u0027Residents said the house raided by police overnight had recently been converted into flats.Angela Brownridge, a concert pianist, said: \u0027I\u0027d been playing at St James\u0027 Piccadilly last night and came home about 11.30pm.          The tenant was moved from the property in Harlesden five miles away to Hendon (pictured)\u0027Within 30 minutes or so the whole street was full of police, there were at least three vans and several unmarked cars.\u0027There were 15 to 20 officers in full riot gear with helmets and shields and others who had tasers trained on the front door.\u0027Officers battered down the front door and later took out a tall man, who had very dark hair and what looked like a beard and moustache.\u0027There was an officer who remained on standby outside the property all night.\u0027That house has had a lot of building work done to it recently, the tenants have only been there over the last few months.\u0027Police discovered the bombs in a flat just a quarter of a mile away from Harlesden Primary School.          A police car and a tent outside the flat in Harlesden last night after police were called thereResidents were evacuated yesterday and kept outside for nine hours while specialist officers worked to deactivate the bombs.Other neighbours reacted to the discovery of the devices. John Hamilton, 59, said: \u0027The whole road was shut off yesterday with police everywhere.\u0027I was told to stay inside because police had found a dangerous package there in the flats. Police kept telling us, it is dangerous don\u0027t go out there, it is dangerous.\u0027The flat upstairs at the front has been unoccupied for two years, you could see into it. Over the past several months workmen have been coming to and from the flat.\u0027They were Bulgarian and Romanian men, they parked their vans outside.\u0027Noor Ali, 29, said: \u0027I was really worried yesterday when police knocked on my door. They came in to tell everyone to stay inside because a \u0027package\u0027 had been found. \u0027Later on police reassured everyone here in my own flat. I\u0027ve seen Eastern European builders coming to and from that flat for months.\u0027          Police were called to reports of two suspicious devices found in the unoccupied flatAnother resident said: \u0027All different people are living in the flats, it don\u0027t surprise me. Police found a pipe bomb there - that\u0027s what they said yesterday.\u0027A mother and daughter were arrested in the last year for terror offences around the corner. They lived on Harlesden Road - they were from the Middle East area.\u0027While Ethel Amoah, 44, said: \u0027There is all sorts of trouble around here - shootings, stabbings and drugs.\u0027This is unusual though, I can\u0027t see why they would operate in that flat with the police station around the corner.\u0027Counter terrorism detectives are \u0027keeping an open mind\u0027 in the investigation following the arrest.A Scotland Yard spokesman said: \u0027The 48-year-old man was arrested at a residential address in North London on Thursday on suspicion of an offence contrary to section 4 Explosives Substances Act 1883.  Police outside the flat where suspicious devices were found in Harlesden yesterday morning\u0027He was taken to a south London police station where he remains in custody.\u0027At this early stage of the investigation, detectives do not believe that the arrested man has links to any terrorist organisations, or that there are any ongoing public safety issues.\u0027Chief Superintendent Simon Rose, North West Command Unit said: \u0027I\u0027d like to thank local residents in the area for their patience and understanding whilst we dealt with this incident today.\u0027The public\u0027s safety is our top priority, and I would like to pay tribute to the specialist officers who attended and were able to safely recover the devices.\u0027I also want to reassure the local community that we have carried out precautionary searches in the surrounding area to make sure there was nothing else of a similar nature nearby, which I\u0027m pleased to confirm is the case.\u0027The next stage is to investigate how and why the two devices came to be in this flat and detectives from the Counter Terrorism Command will be leading this.\u0027 Harlesden latest: Terror probe after two suspected bombs found at empty flat in northwest London | London Evening StandardA handyman finds two live pipe bombs while renovating a flat in North West London and warns he \u0027could have been a goner\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Minister unveils help armed forces veterans homes","story":"Relatives of German First World War soldier who returned...A true band of brothers: Epic bravery of five First World...Share this articleHe also focused on suicide prevention, unveiling a working group to investigate the problem. The minister warned against military service being blamed as the sole cause of suicide, saying there were usually complex underlying issues.He said: ‘Suicide is the most tragic symptom usually of many other issues such as mental health or family breakdown, debt, unemployment or a myriad of other problems.

Extremist material online may also have been a factor in radicalising the attackers at London Bridge and Westminster.The report acknowledged that - since the problem was first raised four years ago - web giants have started to ‘engage more with this issue’.But it said that efforts have led to ‘little tangible progress.’MI5 and counter-terror police are unable to tackle the problem alone, and web giants must take the lead in identifying and removing material from their platforms, it said.While giving evidence to the committee, the security services said this would enable them to concentrate on investigations rather than ‘spending all of our time effectively being an editor for someone else’s publishing house.’The report said that more businesses should follow the example of consumer goods giant Unilever.          Salman Abedi (picured) reportedly learned how to make explosive devices after watching online tutorialsIn February this year, the firm threatened to boycott Facebook and Google unless they more efficiently policed extremist and illegal content.In January this year Theresa May told the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos that technology companies still needed to do more to deal with harmful and illegal online activity.In response, Google, YouTube and Facebook said they would hire more moderators to review material that has been flagged by users as inappropriate.They are also developing algorithms to detect harmful content automatically.The report said that the internet and social media boom had dramatically changed how terror content was consumed and distributed.‘In the past, extremist material was predominantly distributed via leaflets, tape recordings or at meetings,’ the report said.‘This made it harder for iniduals to access or disseminate extremist material without detection whilst the physical element also limited the scale of this activity.‘Today, the internet allows terrorist and extremist groups to create, post, copy and distribute extremist material, which can be made accessible to over a billion people in a matter of seconds.‘Crucially, the speed at which material can be created and distributed, and the interactive nature of certain web services and social media platforms, means that the authors are able to interact with their audiences, and discuss current events or recent attacks, for example, in a manner that was not possible previously.’It was stated that according to 2013 research, searching the internet for ‘how to make a bomb’ returned almost two million results, while ‘beheading video’ brought up 250,000.The committee agreed that in the past five years, those numbers will have inevitably grown.           Extremist material online may also have been a factor in radicalising the attackers at London Bridge and Westminster.

Your mindless doodles can actually reveal a lot about your personalityIf you’ve ever been unwillingly stuck in a classroom, lecture hall or company meeting with a notepad and pen, there’s a good chance your mind went wandering and you absentmindedly drew some shapes. While these days one might be more likely to scroll through emails or social media, “there’s a lot to be said for putting down your electronic device and grabbing a pen or pencil and just doodling”, says Martin Hastings, consultant graphologist and member of the British Academy of Graphology.“Despite the apparent decline in handwriting, more people seem to be taking up activities such as calligraphy, letter-writing, colouring-in and writing journals,” says Hastings, who believes it’s because we increasingly long for creative downtime. “People enjoy expressing themselves artistically and letting their imagination run free, which is what doodling is all about.”There’s great variation in what people draw, but often doodles represent recurrent thoughts. “Men who like football draw balls and goals, people whose obsession is sex often draw genitals,” says John Beck, former chairman of the British Institute of Graphologists. “Often they express unconscious longings – such as the sun for those who want a warm holiday or arrows of aggression for people harbouring lots of anger.”Another study, presented in 2011, found that posting sketches on social media enabled people to convey complex emotions that they wouldn’t have been able to through words alone. “Neuroscience is uncovering some fascinating things about what parts of the brain are activated by both doodling and writing by hand,” Hastings explains. “One area of interest to researchers is the frontoparietal network, which seems to regulate temperament and emotion – the building blocks of personality. Another is the parietal lobe, which is linked to creativity and visual imagery. These areas ‘light up’ when someone writes by hand or draws.”Hastings describes doodling as “an expressive gesture” that’s good for the soul and that, “like handwriting, stimulates brain synapses and synchronises the left and right hemispheres, something that typing or keyboarding do not”.The benefits of doodling also extend to mental health, particularly in the context of therapy. “Doodling has a calming effect on people. We do it at all sorts of different times, for fun, to release tension or relieve boredom,” says art psychotherapist Cate Smail. “It’s easy to talk and draw at the same time, as it uses different parts of the brain. Focusing on the drawing helps to take away some of the stress or anxieties around what you may be talking about, so it can be very helpful during art therapy. It can enable people to speak more openly about difficult or painful memories.”It can be just as beneficial for our mental health in everyday life, adds chartered psychologist Carie Schuster. “It’s a wonderful way to be mindful and is quite meditative. It focuses the mind, shuts out noise or distress and helps you to be present in the now. The anxious, depressed or traumatised brain loves this kind of activity, so it’s very good for us.”There’s also a lot to be said for putting down your phone or tablet and doodling on a device that mimics the sensation of a paper and pen. “Everyone should be encouraged to use their devices less and write by hand, such as keeping a journal or diary, writing a letter or card to a loved one, or just drawing something for the fun of it,” says Hastings.Some devices, such as reMarkable’s paper-like tablet, enable you to write and draw fluidly and precisely on documents that you can sync to the cloud. Having your old etchings in one easily accessible place is hugely beneficial, as Schuster explains. “Doodles become really valuable to a person and can hold nostalgic importance. When one sees old doodles or comments in books from years ago, it’s enjoyable and brings you back to that moment.”Find out more at remarkable"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/982a3935a6cfb48680d152f8aa61f9742a59bb05/0_442_1631_979/master/1631.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9a800b28508e553721efadf00e1a6288","title":"agatha christie webchat with sophie hannah post a question now","story":"After our reading of Endless Night and The Murder of Roger Ackroyd, the author of Hercule Poirot’s authorised new adventures is joining us at 1pm GMT on Friday 23 NovemberSophie Hannah will be joining us for an Agatha Christie-themed webchat on Friday 23 November at 1pm GMT.Hannah is uniquely positioned to discuss the subject of this month’s reading group because she has inhabited “the little grey cells” of that world-famous detective, Hercule Poirot. She is the first author to have been authorised by the Christie estate to write new stories for the inimitable Belgian. Her novels The Monogram Murders, Closed Casket and most recently, the bestselling The Mystery of Three Quarters have had considerable success and acclaim. The Sunday Times has even declared her “the new Agatha”.She wrote last year about the responsibility and challenge of bringing Poirot back to life, explaining: “My task – should I choose to accept it, which I soon did, because concocting a baffling mystery for the brilliant Belgian sleuth to solve was the most exciting creative challenge I had ever faced – was to bring the Poirot we all know and love a new case that would frustrate and puzzle him right up until he worked out the solution.” Hannah has also written eloquently about the genius of Christie and is a mine of information on the writer.Brilliant as Christie may be, it would be a shame to restrict ourselves entirely to the great dame, as Hannah is also a talented author in her own right. She has published several volumes of poetry with Carcarnet Press, and many novels, including the bestselling crime series featuring the detectives Simon Waterhouse and Charlie Zailer.Her latest book is How to Hold a Grudge, out now in the UK and in the US January 2019. It asks: “What if grudges are great – not a cause for guilt, but exactly what we need to lead a happier, safer, more fulfilled life?” If you find that intriguing, you can find a podcast on the subject here – but make sure to come back and ask a question here, too! Hannah will be with us from 1pm on Friday – but feel free to start posting in the comments below now.By way of encouragement, and thanks to Harper, we have another five copies of Endless Night to give to the first five people from the UK to post “I want a copy please”, along with a nice, constructive question in the comments section below.

Look, British Gas customers are fleeing at a rate of only 93,000 a month this year, as opposed to the 100,000-plus that were deserting on average every month during 2017.As corporate boasts go, this is pretty desperate stuff. Indeed, if you cut the numbers a different way, the rush for the exit is intensifying: there have already been more escapees in the second half of 2018 than in the first.All big six energy suppliers are losing customers because switching to smaller independents is suddenly fashionable. But the really bad news for the old guard is that the process is happening even before the government-imposed price cap arrives to take a bite out of profits next year.On the plus side, Centrica can claim genuine success in signing up punters to its “connected home” services. But a shrinking pool of retail customers represents a serious long-term headache that cost-cutting can only partially fix. The consumer market looks unstable. That’s a problem if, like Centrica’s chief executive, Iain Conn, your strategy is to “reposition the portfolio towards the customer.”Still, at least the gas exploration and energy-generation isions offer greater stability, right? Not on current form.At a push, one can see why management thinks the idend arithmetic still works. Add up capital expenditure (£1.1bn), the idend (£600m), interest costs (£300m) and pension fund repair (£100m) and you still have £100m of spare change if operating cash flow arrives, as still predicted, at £2.2bn-ish.Nicolas Simpkin’s departure from the housebuilder Berkeley Group in September 2014 was surprising since finance directors don’t often get fired from FTSE 100 companies “with immediate effect” with no other details given. What followed was also interesting.As Berkeley’s annual report in August this year explained, an out-of-court settlement was eventually agreed in which the company paid Simpkin £9.5m and proceedings brought by the former finance chief in the high court and employment tribunal were withdrawn. As this newspaper then revealed on Wednesday, the withdrawn allegations, as shown in court papers, included claims that Berkeley engaged in years of bribery with a partner at a large estate agent.Simpkin claimed that the Berkeley chairman, Tony Pidgley, made “expensive gifts” to the partner. He also alleged that Pidgley had benefitted from about £660,000 of company money that had, he claimed, been “intended to be used on fitting out” one of the chairman’s luxury London flats “on the pretence the flat was to be used as a show home”.The company denied Simpkin’s allegations at the time and continues to do so. It then offered this helpful detail: “There was a thorough and extensive investigation by a QC and a senior lawyer from a major law firm which concluded these allegations were unfounded.”Are Berkeley’s shareholders allowed to see this thorough independent report that cleared the board? Since Simpkin’s allegations were not tested in court, it would surely be reassuring for them to hear more than just the unidentified QC’s headline conclusion.Berkeley declined to comment on whether there are plans to publish. For a company that announces in its annual report that the first of its five “values” is to “build trust by being open, clear and credible”, that is also surprising."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d5c64fa6578472796b370435cf8ef2f108546731/240_0_7200_4320/master/7200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=856ed8081ac5f142a84e6443b8dc3d27","title":"houston we have a spaceport can the city stay ahead in space travel","story":"Famously the home of Nasa’s Mission Control, Houston is struggling how to stay relevant to modern spaceflight. Is a new spaceport the answer?Houston has a long and proud connection with space exploration. It is home to the Johnson Space Center, the Nasa hub best known for hosting Mission Control. But as the US government squeezes Nasa’s budget and cedes much of its work to private industry, high-profile tycoons such as Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and Sir Richard Branson are generating most of the buzz around the future of American spaceflight. And they are elsewhere.In an attempt to stay relevant, Houston is transforming its 101-year-old Ellington airport into a major spaceport. “It keeps the city at the cutting edge of space and maintains it as Space City USA,” said Mario Diaz, director of aviation for the Houston Airport System, which manages Ellington and the city’s two major passenger airports, George Bush Intercontinental and Hobby.“In 2010 there was a decision made by the US government to get out of the financing of low Earth orbit, the missions to put up satellites and things like that. What we’ve been doing over the last eight years is transitioning from a government-led space programme to a commercially driven space programme.”Musk and Bezos have set up shop in other parts of Texas. Musk’s SpaceX is building a launch site by the border with Mexico, while Bezos’s Blue Origin has a launch facility in the remote west of the state. In a sign of the competition between cities and the importance of political lobbying and financial incentives, Houston lost out to Huntsville, Alabama, last year when Blue Origin was deciding where to place a new manufacturing plant.Houston’s spaceport has struggled for lift-off, but last month the city council approved spending almost $19m on infrastructure development such as roads and utilities. That is a fraction of the public money lavished on Spaceport America, the country’s best known commercial spaceport, which has been subsidised by New Mexico taxpayers to the tune of more than $200m. Branson’s Virgin Galactic is based there, near the vast White Sands Missile Range military testing ground. It will charge space tourists $250,000 for a few minutes of weightlessness 62 miles above terra firma. Last month Branson said the company’s long-awaited first voyage beyond Earth’s atmosphere was imminent.It’s hardly the first risky futuristic endeavour in the flat and empty desert of southern New Mexico – where, after all, the first atomic bomb was tested. But it is not a convenient location for visitors. The nearest city to Spaceport America of any note, Las Cruces – population a shade over 100,000 – is more than 50 miles away.By contrast, with about 7 million people, Houston is the fifth biggest metropolitan area in the US, and Ellington is only 17 miles south-east of the city centre. The suburban location makes big, booming, smoke-billowing, vertical heavy rocket launches out of the question. But lower-risk horizontal launches are feasible: an aircraft can be over the Gulf of Mexico in seconds.If Houston’s spaceport thrives, it is likely to resemble a technology campus with a runway attached. It would be an aerospace incubator where companies and academic institutions can develop products and skills a research and development community rather than a host for headline-grabbing launches for big tech companies.As a concept this lacks the drama, daring and wonder associated with space exploration in the popular imagination. But it might be the most viable and valuable way forward for the fledgling American commercial spaceflight industry. And a similar formula may be on the horizon in Colorado. The US’s 11th federal spaceport licence was granted in August to Front Range airport, only a couple of miles from Denver international airport.Currently there’s not much to see out on Ellington’s eastern fringes, just a couple of office-style buildings, grassy fields and Nasa’s Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory, where astronauts train in a giant pool to prepare for the weightlessness of space. But this is the area officials are hoping to transform into a major spaceport, and next door to Nasa’s lab is the Houston spaceport’s first tenant: a 60-person firm called Intuitive Machines developing drones and metallic additives in an airy former Boeing building.Underlining the opportunity to unite private enterprise with government expertise is the fact that Steve Altemus, the president and CEO of Intuitive Machines, is a former deputy director of the Johnson Space Center. “I think maybe sometimes the term ‘spaceport’ gets in the way of understanding what the full potential of this collection of people in this city can produce,” he said, speaking at a symposium organised by the not-for profit group Aerial Futures.“So a spaceport says: ‘Hey, I’m going to launch vehicles from this place.’ Well, that isn’t going to happen in an urban environment. But what can a spaceport be?“Maybe this is a portal for engineers and scientists and technicians and technologists to come together to invent and create new ideas that advance commercial space, that advance the industrial growth of the city of Houston, that actually push forward the boundaries for airborne systems and airport systems.”But spaceflight is just one area in which work at the spaceport could have an impact. Developments in passenger air travel such as hypersonic flight might also be brought closer to reality through work at facilities such as Ellington.“Some of these technologies and products and services will migrate, once proven, from Ellington airport up to Intercontinental or to Hobby airport,” Diaz said. At stake industry-wide, he added, are “hundreds of billions of dollars … very quickly, as soon as we get the first commercially operational spacecraft, we establish the engines, and then we’ll be able to break the bounds of gravity and really propulse into space – it could be trillions of dollars easily.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/df920bbf14fd40970c42a0511ebcd380b513f434/0_124_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c4837a97567e21fa5288207b8cc702f8","title":"john mcdonnell leftwing conservatives tory labour","story":"John McDonnell sees only the suffering the Tory party has inflicted.

Fair enough: it’s an honourable choice, I suppose, to be so virtuous as not to want to go near the contaminating aura that anyone who voted for Tory policies emanates.Except lots of people who vote Tory just aren’t driven in this way. The big ides are really between those who are politically engaged and those who are not, and currently Brexit is in any case reshaping the two main parties in Britain.I presume when McDonnell wants to negotiate his wonderful people’s Brexit with added jobs on, he will have to talk to Tories and maybe some people in the EU, many of whom are basically ex-bankers.

They flaunt their socialist heritage, which I find peculiar as I don’t think ideology is genetic.I grew up in a working-class Tory family. Was I, as soon as I became politically conscious at about 14, to simply stop speaking to my mother? I did try that for a while, it must be said.Was I, in all the various crap jobs I did, not to get along with people because they were not socialist enough? When I went to live in the US, even the mildest proclamation of what would now be called centrist views was regarded as madly communist. But did I make friends? Yes, of course I did. Can I find shared values with people who once every few years tick a different box – or who don’t even bother? Obviously. Do all my friends have to think the same things as me? No. I can’t imagine anything more spectacularly boring.Anyway, on the left everyone hates everyone else more than they hate the Tories. The biggest insult is “Blairite” for the new generation of unsullied cadres who worship the current Labour leadership. There are clear lines, there are right and wrong things to think. I totally understand this if you are actually 14, but in anyone who has had a life or possesses any political nous, it makes me despair.Do I actually need to say here that the likes of Iain Duncan Smith make me nauseous (not theoretically: I have had the experience of listening to him over dinner – and he made me feel sick). And George Osborne is indeed a gloating architect of misery. I don’t think anyone should ever be their friends. But normal people? The ones who give blood and do a bit of charity work, and believe in small business and “getting on” I know them and I don’t find them all evil. They are wrong, possibly, but not bad people.In fact, the working class from which I come remains a huge disappointment to the hard left in its refusal to rise up and overthrow the system. I am all for that, but how is this to happen? And maybe they need to be persuaded. Is politics not ultimately about getting people on side? Right now we have this politics of purity clearly going haywire in front of us: many Labour supporters think the party can win an election without getting people who voted Tory on board.Remainers think they can win a second referendum without persuading leave voters to change their minds. They’re depending on the fact that many leave voters may have died since 2016. Hey, way to go progressives! There is a certain buzz to be had from pretending to be in a war of position in which various people are denounced in a tweet. But this is bonkers. Encouraging a campus culture that protects young people from encountering difference scares me, because actual difference – the rise of the far right – is not something that one be can be shielded from. Strategically and politically this is not an option.I don’t really care who people have as friends. It’s human nature to cluster around people like ourselves. There are far too many “vote Labour, live Tory” types to lecture me anyway, in big houses with kids in private schools, and a cocoon of correctness does not appeal. There is more than one moral high horse to mount here.Martin Luther King said: “Love is the only force capable of transforming an enemy into a friend.” Isn’t political transformation the goal?

It was inevitable, therefore, that this week’s agreement on, and publication of, the 26-page political declaration on the future EU-UK partnership should have been widely treated as another step in her uphill battle to assemble an elusive majority to get her Brexit deal through parliament.That was certainly the way that No 10 handled the announcement that the declaration had been agreed after the prime minister’s trip to Brussels on Wednesday. Mrs May used all the weapons available to her to make a sale to MPs on her return: a social media buildup in the morning a televised appearance in Downing Street in time for the lunchtime bulletins and, in the afternoon, another marathon question-and-answer session at the Commons dispatch box. Mrs May had used these tactics to her advantage last week – her ratings had risen sharply. Now, with a political wind behind her, and exploiting an abject few days for her “Dad’s Army” nationalist critics, she was clearly determined to turn the screws on longtime hard Brexiters in the Conservative party.The Commons session was therefore notable for two things. First, Labour and the other opposition parties were largely onlookers. Second, by corollary, the focus was blue on blue, Tory on Tory, and occasionally between Mrs May and the DUP. At times, the session felt like a private negotiating session between Tory backbenchers and the prime minister. It was clear that Mrs May has softened bits of wording on Northern Ireland in an effort to swing influential Brexiters like Iain Duncan Smith and Owen Paterson to accept her deal. She also made an explicit offer of further talks to the DUP.All this is still work in progress, but the strategy is clear and unlikely to alter. It is to use each day to chip away at the resolve and support for hardline Brexiter alternatives to Mrs May’s deal. She will try to tighten that pressure this weekend, with overheated confrontations over fishing with France and over Gibraltar with Spain on Saturday, before Sunday’s Brussels summit signs off on the deal, perhaps with some further drafting changes. Mrs May will then return to the Commons next week to announce once again that she has delivered on Brexit and that the public now wants to move on.This is deadly serious politics for Mrs May and her party. But it is not enough – and it isn’t the main issue either. It is not enough because Mrs May needs opposition MPs’ votes too. Until now, though, she has not done enough to woo either Labour or the SNP. True, some work has taken place behind the scenes to try to detach some opposition MPs. But Mrs May has not created the political mood that would be necessary if she really wanted to give Labour waverers the permission to defy their whips and risk deselection challenges by daring to vote for her deal. On the contrary, right from the start of her premiership she has handled Brexit in a manner that has made this impossible. That is why she is still short of the majority she needs.Her challenge is made tougher by the reality that the political declaration is not a tightly drawn programme but a collection of aspirational generalities. It defers the resolution of crucial issues like single market access, customs union alignment, and the ability to make separate trade deals to the 21-month transition period after the UK departs from the EU next spring. It keeps uncertainty alive on issues like the Northern Ireland border. That makes it a document that cannot be trusted by those who fear a harder Brexit. So, even if Mrs May wins her Commons vote, which is far from certain, her wish for Britain to move on remains aspirational too.That is why the most important Brexit event on Thursday may have been the Speaker’s explicit backing for a properly amendable “meaningful vote” next month. John Bercow seems set on making sure that MPs can vote on alternatives to Mrs May’s deal, including a second referendum. Mrs May is certainly mounting a big push. But, as long as she is short of support, the way still lies open to a new referendum which could, even now, reverse Brexit altogether."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2a686286d681da73a0a85245d30689457329de36/33_57_3414_2049/master/3414.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6f1f1b0e24ecf8e25a1be808d0043009","title":"tory remainers brexit austerity owen jones","story":"At least one in 200 people in Britain – one of the wealthiest nations that has ever existed – is homeless. Last year there was the biggest rise in child poverty for three decades. Benefit claimants have had their state support stopped – “sanctioned” – for attending a funeral, for missing a jobcentre appointment after being hit by a car, and – in the case of one 60-year-old army veteran – for selling poppies for the Royal Legion, thus allegedly showing he wasn’t trying hard enough to look for work. One woman I met had to pay the bedroom tax after her daughter died: she now had a spare room, you see. These are random examples of the institutionalised cruelty of austerity Britain. You cannot understand the political turmoil now afflicting Britain without understanding these injustices. That’s not to claim that all of those battered by austerity voted for Brexit - they certainly did not – but as one academic study found this year, its impact was decisive in winning the vote for leave.Which brings me to the Tory remainers now cheered at anti-Brexit rallies and championed by “centrist” commentators. All of this – all of it – is on them. Take Jo Johnson, who last made headline news when he attempted to appoint serial troll (and personal friend of his elder brother) Toby Young to a new government quango. Johnson was the architect of the 2015 Tory manifesto that committed to a referendum, which he still defends on crude partisan lines, as “essential for party management” and neutralising Ukip’s electoral threat. We can “provide a brighter and better future for all of us and all of our children”, he declared to adulation at an anti-Brexit rally. Yet here is a politician who has championed and voted for George Osborne’s austerity programme, which has caused the worst squeeze in wages since the Napoleonic wars, and left children facing a worse lot in life than their parents. A brighter and better future has been stolen away precisely because of his own political decisions.There’s Ken Clarke, frequently venerated as a no-nonsense, progressive, pro-EU Tory. It is somewhat amusing that this affable chap – who introduced the NHS internal market and has extensively profited from big tobacco – is held up as an anti-Brexit warrior, but has now committed to backing Theresa May’s worst‑of‑all‑worlds deal.Then there’s Anna Soubry, perhaps the most revered Tory amongst the “centrist” faction of the anti-Brexit movement. I’ve met and interviewed her: she was likeable, charming even, as we chatted, a portrait of Margaret Thatcher hanging over us. This week Soubry tweeted about the case of a young woman born brain-damaged, who with her grandmother risks losing their home because of benefit cuts: “No ifs no buts no excuses this is a disgrace \u0026amp NOT what I voted for when supporting much needed benefit reforms.” Except this is exactly what Soubry voted for, over and over and over again. Soubry has voted for every single attack on the welfare state over the past few years: the bedroom tax, universal credit, the benefits freeze and cuts to disability benefits. She shares direct responsibility for forcing some of the most vulnerable people in society into misery, the cost of forcing them to pay for a crisis caused by the financial vested interests who fund her party. And in her own leave-voting seat, many of her constituents driven into hardship and insecurity – some of whom were voting for the first time – marched to the polling stations in the 2016 referendum, cast their eyes over a ballot paper they interpreted as asking them to reject or accept the status quo, and voted accordingly.This year, she launched a passionate and much-lauded attack on the Tory Brexiteers, jabbing her finger in the Commons as she issued her j’accuse: “Nobody voted to be poorer, and nobody voted leave on the basis that somebody with a gold-plated pension and inherited wealth would take their jobs away from them.” Here was a Tory accusing her own of class war. And yet does the same not apply to Soubry? Is she not an MP living in immense comfort, with a gold-plated pension, who has used her power to drive her own constituents into poverty and hardship?When John McDonnell declared this week that he could not be friends with a Conservative minister because of the suffering he had seen in his constituency, including people who had attempted suicide, he provoked predictable outrage. The physicist Brian Cox even suggested it showed a belief in creating “a one-party state”. It is striking how alleged violations of personal etiquette – in this case, choosing who you spend precious time socialising with – is regarded as more heinous than using your power to impose suffering on strangers. You can be a good sport in polite circles if you do the latter, but not the former.And that is why the anti-Brexit movement has to make a decision. There are those, such as the campaign Another Europe Is Possible, who see stopping Brexit as intertwined with removing the injustices that drove the referendum result. There are others who see pre‑2016 Britain as a relative nirvana, disrupted by an abhorrent administrative error which simply needs to be corrected. But it was Tory MPs who collectively plunged Britain into calamity. To hold up Tory politicians who remain unapologetically committed to socially ruinous policies as progressive heroes just because they opposed Brexit shows a failure to understand why Britain is in crisis in the first place. Toryism has already waged the sort of class war Soubry describes, with catastrophic consequences. And they have to be defeated – whether they voted remain or leave – if Britain is to have any hope at all."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/099dbabefb72d17beb23665c89bb05598d6d2ea3/0_0_941_577/master/941.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=a3a94e5badf849653ea118cdbce93e7d 1400w","title":"conflict resolution programme improves wellbeing of pupils","story":"Learning Together system of restorative practice trialled in English schoolsSchools can significantly reduce the impact of bullying and improve pupils’ wellbeing by using a specialised system of conflict resolution and training, according to a ground-breaking study published in the Lancet.The research, led by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), was conducted over three years in state schools in the south of England, and is the first of its type to study the use of “restorative practice” within schools, bringing together victims and perpetrators of damaging behaviour.The academics who wrote the Lancet study, including Prof Russell Viner, the president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, concluded that the £58 cost per pupil to run the programme was likely to achieve “significant impacts” in improving child health and mental wellbeing.“The message from this is that how we organise our schools to promote students’ welfare should be a key part of any response to concerns about children’s mental health,” said Viner. “None of this was meant to be just about bullying – it was about informing and involving pupils in their school’s behaviour policies, and the use of restorative practices to resolve difficult behaviour.”The programme, Learning Together, saw staff in 20 secondary schools trained in techniques of restorative practice, such as using respectful language to promote good behaviour. It also used student surveys and meetings to inform school policies, as well up to 10 hours a year of specialised classroom lessons on social and emotional skills.The trial followed nearly 6,000 pupils from the age of 11, and found that children in those schools reported less smoking, drinking and use of illegal drugs than their peers in the control group of schools, which did not benefit from the programme.By the third year, the researchers found small but significant reductions in incidents of bullying, as well as improved mental health. While the programme did not affect levels of aggression, it did have a greater impact on boys, and on students who had been victims of bullying.The study was given a guarded welcome by Tom Bennett, a teacher and the Department for Education’s independent adviser on behaviour in schools. “It’s certainly true that schools with effective policies for behaviour frequently insist that students have opportunities to realise the impact of their actions, and to formally discuss what good behaviour would look like and how they can improve. And this study does seem to offer some small glimmer that the tested strategies might be useful,” Bennett said.“But with the very small impact on bullying, and the fact that the impact on bullying was self-reported, it’s hard to say if actual bullying went down, or if surveyed students felt like it had. That might conceal more than it reveals, and that could be very significant.”Prof Chris Bonell of LSHTM, the lead author of the Lancet article, said the next step was to refine the programme and make it available to more schools. “This study suggests that restorative practice is an effective way to reduce bullying. It also suggests that the government could save the NHS money by helping ensure schools are inclusive and supportive places,” Bonell said.The randomised controlled trial was funded by the NHS’s National Institute for Health Research and the Education Endowment Foundation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc102608e1b66502941fafb9243d53a818ef8aa7/0_93_5416_3250/master/5416.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ae4ee751b603a5fa5aa037c59bf4098c","title":"its like tobacco funding health research should universities take money from fossil fuel","story":"Fossil fuel companies have infiltrated universities for years. Are students and academics increasingly turning against them?At a recent green innovation event at Imperial College, London, PhD candidate Naomi Pratt and several other students handed out flyers. They were holding elephants on sticks, or “oilophants”, to represent the elephant in the room at the discussion: Imperial’s links with the fossil fuel industry. “Within two minutes we had security guards coming round saying ‘you can’t hand out flyers here, you can’t have this sign. Move along, you’ve made your point,’” Pratt says.Pratt is the leader of Divest Imperial, a group set up to pressure the university to eliminate financial investments in fossil fuel companies from its endowment fund, and reduce its reliance on research funding from the fossil fuel industry. Although their protests are not always shut down, the recent event wasn’t her only experience of being asked to stop flyering in a public part of campus. “It’s a stark example of how Imperial is run as a business, and how it’s trying to control its image,” she says.In addition to questioning Imperial’s relationships with the industry, Pratt is troubled by their access to students and the campus. Fossil fuel companies make regular appearances at careers fairs, and some courses have mandatory field trips sponsored by the oil and gas sector. “They have an almost ubiquitous presence on campus,” she says. “You hear students repeating industry lines back to you: ‘we’re going to need fossil fuels for x amount of years, it’s important to have an energy mix.’”Can universities justify these relationships? Imperial says it works with industrial partners to find “solutions to the world’s need for energy”, alongside research aimed at reducing the environmental impact of fossil fuels – through carbon capture and storage, for example, or battery technology and solar cells. It defends its investments as enabling its endowment to better invest in research and education.Chris Saltmarsh, a co-director at People \u0026amp Planet, says that although fossil fuel estment has been the most successful student environmental campaign, there is growing concern about universities’ wider links with the fossil fuel industry. “Students are saying these companies need to be challenged – do they deserve any space on our campuses at all?” he says. “We don’t think it’s right for universities to be profiting from or investing in companies driving the climate crisis.”Part of the reason the movement hasn’t gained the same traction as estment, in Saltmarsh’s view, is that fossil fuel relationships can be hard to map, and are in some cases “deliberately opaque”. “It would take a policy shift on a governmental or supra-governmental level to outlaw fossil fuel companies from research partnerships,” he says. “We would argue that all public research institutions and any other companies investing in research for the public good shouldn’t be associating themselves with fossil fuel. Any relationship is either profiting them directly or bulking up their reputation so that they can continue to extract.”The picture is similar in the US, where Ben Franta, a PhD student at Stanford University, is working on a study mapping how much research is funded by the oil and gas industry. He believes there has been an “invisible colonisation of academia” by fossil fuel companies. “I think that most people are still largely unaware of the pervasiveness of oil industry funding in academia, especially for climate and energy research,” he says. “The full picture of the ubiquity of this funding is not really known yet.”Like Pratt, Franta cut his teeth in the estment movement. It was only when he observed that professors who were vocal against estment often received funding from the oil and gas industry that he realised how insidious these relationships can be. He sees it as only a matter of time before campaigns start to target research funding and the visibility of oil and gas companies on campus.“One of the amazing things about this whole story is that all this has happened without anyone really knowing about it,” Franta says. “When most people hear about this situation they’re pretty shocked by it. They think: ‘this doesn’t make sense – it’s like tobacco funding health research, there’s a clear conflict of interest here.’”Among academics, attitudes are conflicted. James Dyke, a visiting environmental sciences academic at Southampton University, is a staunch advocate of the need for radical action to slow down climate change. Yet he acknowledges the defences of fossil fuel relationships that some colleagues offer. These companies are aware of the significance of climate change, but the global economy would collapse if they stopped producing overnight. Equally, they plug serious gaps in research funding, without which some departments would be forced to close.“Universities should ideally be places to work with those companies to allow them to transform,” Dyke says. “Walking away and taking the moral high ground – ‘we won’t take your money’ - means cutting off what could be a critical player in the required transition.”The problem is that fossil fuel companies aren’t working towards the transition to a lower carbon economy in any meaningful way. According to Mat Hope, editor of environmental investigative journalism website DeSmog, much of the money from the oil and gas industry goes towards funding research that will help companies continue to operate in the North Sea region for many more years – by drilling in deeper and more treacherous waters, for example. “This is despite climate scientists explicitly stating that the industry will have to be rapidly shut down,” he says.Hope sees the support for universities from fossil fuel companies as part of a deliberate strategy to soften their image. “They are trying to become an integral part of the economics of higher education as a means to encourage a favourable tax environment, and ensure ongoing local and national government support for the industry,” he says. “All despite the UK’s climate commitments.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f12c22361776f685e8224632e01992395fb2de2/49_524_4928_2958/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=532af567334a8c8e85360b5adadb63f6","title":"good to earth the lavazza 2019 calendar in pictures","story":"Photographer Ami Vitale’s images of six nature art installations around the world aim to spread good news about efforts to protect the environment.

It is a justified reward for the 26-year-old, who has scored 40 goals from 89 appearances and was voted as the club’s player of the year in his debut season.“I am very happy, very happy to extend my time at Liverpool,” Mané told Liverpoolfc. “It is a great day for me and now I am looking forward to everything – to helping the team, to helping the club achieve our dreams and, especially, to win trophies.“I’ve always said, when I knew I had a chance to come here I didn’t have to think twice. The right club in the right moment and with the right coach as well. I came here and was very happy. For me, I have made the best decision in my career.”Mané has been a mainstay of Liverpool’s attack this season, scoring six goals in the Premier League as Klopp’s side attempt to sustain a title challenge to Manchester City. He joins Mohamed Salah and Roberto Firmino in signing new five-year contracts in the last 12 months.“This is a big boost for everyone and another demonstration of how the players we have at this club are committed, not just to our present but our future also,” said Klopp.“I can’t think of a single club anywhere in Europe that wouldn’t want a player like Sadio available to them, so the fact he wants to remain with us says something about where we are currently.“He is a such an important member of our team and squad. He radiates joy and I think this is reflected in his performances and impact on the pitch. The only criticism I could ever have of Sadio is that maybe at times he is the only one not to see just how good he is but as an attacking player he is the complete package.“He made a big impact when he first arrived, but if anything he’s got better and better each season. His trajectory has only been upwards in terms of his level and his contribution.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/648aabab0e8722142c22e02b7aa271788ccc8a10/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0ff927da149d72202f6ec9b5f59e4b05","title":"premier league 10 things to look out for this weekend","story":"Virgil van Dijk will be needed at Watford, Chelsea face a test of their title credentials and Andy Carroll could make his return• Watford v Liverpool, Saturday 3pm GMT• Mané signs new five-year contract to commit future to LiverpoolAs if trying to beat Manchester City home and away isn’t a tall enough order, any Premier League sides harbouring serious title aspirations also need to avoid dropping points to each other. Manchester United finished best of the rest last season, 19 points off the pace after dropping 11 of them to other top-six sides. Of last season’s top five also-rans, Arsenal, Spurs and Manchester United have already lost to City this time around, while Liverpool managed a commendable draw. Chelsea don’t face the champions until early December, but come up against Spurs at Wembley in this weekend’s glamour game. The season is still relatively young and a trip to Wembley is obviously daunting, but with the champions in such imperious form this match already has the whiff of “must-win” about it, if Maurizio Sarri’s team are to prove capable of halting another serene title procession by City. BG• Tottenham v Chelsea, Saturday 5.30pm GMT• Jonathan Wilson: Spurs must answer tough questions• Pochettino excited by stadium but hints at delay to FebruaryMany of Manchester United’s best performances in the last year or so under José Mourinho have come when they have played as if not managed by him, which is to say when they have had to chase games with a degree of abandon. Recent come-from-behind victories are good examples, as was the 3-2 win when they last met Crystal Palace. Their display on Saturday needs to be more like that, and certainly nothing like the meek demonstration they put on for the Manchester derby. Ander Herrera and Nemanja Matic played so poorly in that match that dropping them this weekend is practically mandatory, so Saturday could be the right time to give Fred another opportunity to recapture the form that made United buy him for £52m, and show he has adapted to the physical demands of the Premier League. PD• Manchester United v Crystal Palace, Saturday 3pm GMT• United scouts tracking Fiorentina defender MilenkovicCardiff City go to Everton high on the hog after a victory over Brighton that featured a goal scored from the kind of sublime 16-pass move you really don’t expect to see from a team managed by Neil Warnock. More readily associated with the kind of route one football that served them so well in winning promotion, Cardiff have slowly evolved this season, with goalkeeper Neil Etheridge and his defenders given more licence to play the ball out from the back and get between the lines when it suits them. Warnock’s trust in his players to spray the ball across the deck while maintaining possession is increasingly evident and paid off in scintillating style against Brighton. While Cardiff are unlikely to score too many more goals like that, their quiet progress suggests they may not be the relegation certainties most thought. BG• Everton v Cardiff City, Saturday 3pm GMT• When do Premier League teams score their goals?For Bournemouth to sit sixth at this stage of the season is impressive but their rise has been assisted by a forgiving fixture list. So far they have played only one of the five teams above them and three of the top eight, while facing seven of the league’s bottom eight sides. They have taken 14 points from games against teams they played last season, the same number they took from the equivalent fixtures in 2017-18. But the fixture gods are about to turn on them: their next four matches include Arsenal, Manchester City and Liverpool – although they will also complete the bottom-eight set against Huddersfield. Before the end of the year they will also play Chelsea (in the Carabao Cupquarter-finals), Tottenham and Manchester United. While they are very likely to remain in the top half, failing to match the home win over Arsenal in January will see them drop below the level that saw them finish 12th last term. SB• Bournemouth v Arsenal, Sunday 1.30pm GMT• Emery says Arsenal lost their way under Wenger• Arshavin: farewell to a talented but frustrating enigmaWest Ham supporters could be treated to a rare sighting of Andy Carroll when their side entertain Manchester City. The injury-prone striker was last seen muddying his spats against Manchester United in May before undergoing ankle surgery in the summer, but is expected to be among the substitutes on Saturday. Recurring ankle problems restricted Carroll to 18 appearances last season, in which he scored just three goals. With his contract due to expire in the summer, the 29-year-old needs a break from the physio room to have any hope of earning a new one. The omens don’t look great – in a little over six years at West Ham, the Geordie Jesus has been sidelined for 27 different spells and has made only 114 Premier League appearances with a return of 33 goals. As Plan Bs go, he is effective but as unlucky as he is expensive. The patience of his employers must be wearing thin. BG• West Ham v Manchester City, Saturday 3pm GMT• Pellegrini puts faith in finding ‘real’ Nasri at West Ham• Guardiola avoids FA charge over derby referee commentsIf things go according to plan for the hosts at Craven Cottage, then Claudio Ranieri’s first match as Fulham manager might just be Mark Hughes’ last in charge of Southampton. Ranieri’s mission is clear: to haul Fulham to safety by making them more solid. They are likely to play very differently to Slavisa Jokanovic’s freewheeling losers. Southampton have failed to score in five of their last eight league matches and if Fulham succeed in shutting them out after just a few drills from Ranieri, then criticism of Hughes, who has won three of 20 league matches since his appointment in March, is sure to intensify. PD• Fulham v Southampton, Saturday 3pm GMT• Premier League on loan, part one: Arsenal to Huddersfield• Premier League players on loan, part two: Leicester to WolvesLast season, Zanka played every Premier League minute for Huddersfield. He was booked six times in total, and only twice before Christmas. This year, he missed the 6-1 thrashing at Manchester City with a minor injury, and has been taking bookings like a Michelin-starred restaurant. From the start of September there was a run of four in five games, and another against West Ham means he is suspended for this match. Chris Löwe, who like Zanka has started 11 of the team’s 12 league games so far, is injured, and the Terriers will be forced to bring an unfamiliar defence to Molineux. With David Wagner flitting between four- and five-man back-lines, their defensive shape is scarcely more predictable than the personnel. Wolves might consider Huddersfield’s rearguard ripe for pillaging. SB• Wolves v Huddersfield, Sunday 4pm GMT• Eni Aluko: Sancho should play for U-21s not England seniors next summerDefeats at Everton and Cardiff mean Brighton, who had the worst away record in the league last season, find themselves in the familiar position of hoping their home form will offset bad results on the road. Their chances of victory on Saturday will increase significantly if Pascal Gross is fit enough to return. His absence with an ankle injury has deprived Chris Hughton’s team of creativity so far this season, with Solly March unable to fill the gap. There is also the possibility of the fit-again Florin Andone making his long-awaited home debut off the bench. The Romanian striker could reduce the dependency on Glenn Murray for goals, though Murray will be particularly eager to score given that his penalty miss spurred Leicester on to victory at the Amex last season. PD• Brighton v Leicester, Saturday 3pm GMT• PFA independent review: a guide to the key questionsThe Monday night fixture is a feat of scheduling that transforms Newcastle’s shortest away trip into far more of a nuisance than it needs to be for travelling fans. Back-to-back victories have moved Newcastle out of the drop zone and they face a reasonably kind run of fixtures, with five games against bottom-half teams between now and their Boxing Day visit to Anfield. “I think the international break is bad for us, but at the same time it gives us time to recover and spend time with our families,” said Rafael Benítez. “We can come back with more energy and if we can get another couple of good results, I’ve always said November and December will be so important for us.” A lot done, more to do for Benítez, whose team now face a Burnley side that has also got just two league wins to its name. It is unlikely to be a game for the purists, but its importance cannot be overstated for either side.

Now, with the finals taking place next summer shortly before the European Under-21 Championship, Gareth Southgate faces an interesting dilemma about how to use some of his emerging stars such as Jadon Sancho and Trent Alexander-Arnold.The tournaments are a week apart and although it may be possible to play in both, is that a healthy approach to a summer when the calendar is already so busy? Assuming it’s a case of picking the young players for one or the other, you have to look at the bigger picture. Is Sancho realistically going to start every game at the Nations League finals? Probably not. So it’s probably better for him to go and get that experience with the under-21s and be a key player, rather than sit on the bench and come on for 15 minutes at the end of a match for the senior side. I don’t think it is a case of players such as Sancho not being able to handle senior international football at next year’s finals – it’s more about game time and how much of an impact they can have for the respective teams.Aidy Boothroyd’s under-21s made it 22 games unbeaten this week – other than on penalties – after defeating Italy and Denmark and that is some achievement. They will discover who they face in the group stages on Friday and, if they were to win it next summer, that would really carry on the success of some of the young teams over the past few years. The under-17s and under-20s did so well to win their respective World Cups in 2017 and something has clicked in English football, because we are starting to compete at every level and age group across men’s, youth and women’s football. Now the expectation is for the under-21s to go to Italy and win it next summer, because success breeds expectation for more success.There has been a shift in mindset among all the England squads and the seniors will go to Portugal next summer knowing they have every chance of winning the Nations League. I was a little disappointed during the World Cup in Russia with what I felt was too much celebration of being on the weaker side of the draw from some of the press. They seemed to indirectly suggest England would not be able to beat the more established nations if it came to it. I’m not sure teams such as Belgium, Brazil and France cared too much about who they faced in the knockout stage because they have a mentality to beat any team.After the World Cup I hoped England would be a team who could go into tournaments thinking and believing they can beat anyone, primarily because they reached the semi-finals. After beating Spain and Croatia during the Nations League it is really pleasing to see a continuation from the World Cup and perhaps a mentality shift too in terms of going toe to toe with leading international teams rather than feeling inferior.You could see from the celebrations after the Croatia game how much it meant to the players to finish top of the group. Beating Croatia so soon after the defeat at the World Cup was an important step to continue the momentum they built up in the summer.Southgate should take a lot of credit because he has been very open in bringing in new faces, including Bournemouth’s Callum Wilson. Once upon a time, those kind of players at clubs such as Bournemouth just didn’t get picked for England because they weren’t big enough names or didn’t play for sexy enough clubs.Now every player can see it is possible to get into the England squad if they perform consistently. It must have been an absolute dream come true for Wilson to score on his debut. I’m sure all the Bournemouth fans were delighted to see him continue his club form in international football.A special mention to Jordan Nobbs after she ruptured the anterior cruciate ligament in her left knee. It was cruel to see her suffer this injury when she is playing so well for Arsenal. At the moment she is probably one of the best midfielders in Europe.Jordan has really stamped her mark on Arsenal this season and has been a key reason for their success, with some fantastic goals. I watched the game against Chelsea and she was the best player on the park, so it’s really sad to see she is going to be out for a long time, especially with the World Cup around the corner. I extend my best wishes to her – stay strong and focused. In this moment your mind is your biggest enemy but also your biggest strength. Injuries do happen but it’s been great to see the football community show their support.There has been lots of talk and criticism about the Professional Footballers’ Association and whether it is time for change. Often the reality of the work the PFA does can get lost in all the flak. From a personal perspective, as a member of the PFA I can only speak with the utmost gratitude and respect for the deputy chief executive, Nick Cusack, and the chief executive, Gordon Taylor, who made every resource available to help me during the most difficult period in my professional career. Nick was always on the end of the phone for more than a year, leading my case and guiding me through a very stormy period with sound advice and dedication. It is important for professional players to appreciate the level of help that is and can be available to them as PFA members."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9660c6b6344bcc94e2865a709e07f28c75a1aa64/0_55_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=720\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=79710366f6bb1805516d7f768915232c 1440w","title":"victorias secret show angels lingerie","story":"The brand’s annual show is a worldwide TV event, but former Angels are starting to reveal the uncomfortable truth about the lingerie giant A woman stands on stage and cries. In the auditorium, another woman’s partner gives a standing ovation, his hand on his heart. One mother gushes that she is “so proud” of her daughter. Another goes further: “So much admiration for all your hard work and dedication to being the best version of yourself and making your dreams come true.”We are told that these women are “athletes”, that they are in “peak condition”, that they are “aggressively fit”. But this is not the Olympics or the Paralympics. There are no medals to be won. This is a lingerie show.Launched in 1995, the Victoria’s Secret runway show has been broadcast on US network television every December since 2001, an extraordinary feat for a high-street underwear brand. Almost from the beginning, it has been under fire. In 2002, the US’s National Organization of Women (NOW) protested at the event, calling it a “softcore porn infomercial”. One fashion editor told me that the year she covered the show was the “worst job I’d ever done. All the models look the same. The underwear is so skimpy, you can literally see everything. One of them bent over in a thong and I saw it all.”That is why it is so pernicious. Earlier this month, Ed Razek, chief marketing officer of Victoria’s Secret’s parent company, L Brands, was forced to apologise after telling Vogue that he didn’t want transgender models in the show because it would spoil the “fantasy”. In the same interview, he said there was no interest in portraying a wider range of sizes and shapes.“I’m always asking myself: if we do that, what is the reason we did it?” he said. “Did we include them because it was the right thing to do or because it was the politically correct thing to do? Do they take the place of somebody who worked for a year for the opportunity and cried when they found that they got it?”“Hard work” is a term you hear a lot around Victoria’s Secret models, or “Angels”, as those who have signed an exclusive deal with the brand are called. It means exercise: training, toning, boxing, skipping, using the hashtag “#trainlikeanangel” and working out in invite-only classes with names such as the Skinny Bitch Collective.It is no wonder that many of the models exercise obsessively. The show’s strict weight and body fat requirements, endlessly speculated on in the media, would be far beyond the reach of most adult women. Indeed, they are far beyond the reach of most models, which is why the 50 or so who are picked for the VS “family” each year must endure months of dieting and exercise.Model Robyn Lawley has appeared in Sports Illustrated and on the covers of Vogue Italia and Australia, as well as modelling Ralph Lauren, H\u0026ampM and Chantelle lingerie. She went to a Victoria’s Secret casting six years ago – but was not hired. “It’s a running joke that they see curvier girls every year and never cast them,” she says. “This whole starvation-camp situation before you have to walk that catwalk is ridiculous. Some of them are my friends on that stage I’m not pulling them apart. But they have to put their bodies to such extremes once they cast the show, they couldn’t maintain that kind of lifestyle or they’d die.”Yet this lifestyle is pored over by the world’s media. The Independent, Grazia, Vogue, Elle and the Daily Mail, among others, have all published guidance to looking like a Victoria’s Secret model. Occasionally, they get journalists to try it themselves, and they end up exhausted and hungry, unable to eat out with friends or concentrate. One diet, suggested by trainer Stephen Pasterino, is so restrictive that, by the end, even cauliflower and broccoli are out. Model Barbara Palvin’s boyfriend bought her a bag of cheeseburgers to eat after this year’s show, as if to prove how little she had eaten beforehand. Adriana Lima, the brand’s longest-serving model, told the  in 2011 that she cuts out all solid food nine days before an appearance. Many models do not drink fluids, either. “Dehydration is a massive problem,” one fashion editor told me. Yet every year, this event – this circus of competitive anorexia – is broadcast, streamed, applauded.Publishing details of these regimes, with no warning from medical professionals about their long-term effects, allows a culture to flourish where women are rewarded for their ability to restrict, to deny themselves, to go without. It legitimises a worldview where foods are ided into good and bad, where spinach is clean and cake is dirty, where any moment not spent exercising is a moment wasted, and where being thin is a marker of togetherness and control and success.Lima is retiring from the brand this year, after 20 years. In June, a video on her Instagram account showed her struggling through a workout. “Seeing this video makes me emotional,” she wrote. “Sometimes people look at you from the outside and think: her job is so easy (remember I am not complaining), when they don’t know what you go through. Here I am, four weeks after giving birth to my beautiful daughter Valentina and after days of physical therapy because I had a fractured knee, putting all my focus to get ready for a fashion show (60lb heavier, lol). I learned something during that time. Once you love something, absolutely nothing in this world will have the power to stop you, not even your mind or body!”It is hard to imagine how a brand that claims to have the best interests of its models at heart could allow a woman who has been integral to its identity to ignore all physical and psychological warning signs in her struggle to lose enough weight to be worthy of one more show.The message is this: you are not good enough as you are. If you want to be an Angel, you must diet and train like one – and if you do not, you are out.“It’s pitting girls against girls, which I think is a revolting technique,” says Lawley. “Razek is trying to make it out as though he’s got nothing to do with it, which is complete bullshit. It wouldn’t happen like that normally those girls don’t have to starve themselves like that when they’re not working for that runway.“They all have body dysmorphia. That’s the thing: all these girls, they all have beautiful bodies, none of them need to do any of it. That’s the irony of the whole thing.”“We would never dictate any sort of diet regimen for our models,” says a Victoria’s Secret spokesperson. “We promote a healthy lifestyle.”Earlier this year, Bridget Malcolm, who modelled in the 2015 and 2016 shows, apologised for publicising her “damaging eating habits” and exercise regime. It was an enormously brave thing to do. “Body dysmorphia is a terrifying thing,” she wrote. “I have had countless conversations with fellow models, all of whom are tiny, where they call themselves fat. It is such a hard thing to understand if you are removed from this … but when it becomes a mental game like this, it grows wings of its own.”In 2016, another former Angel, Erin Heatherton, said she had been pressured to lose weight by the company. Despite exercising twice a day, and following a strict meal plan, she was unable to meet the targets set for her. “I got to a point where one night I got home from a workout and I remember staring at my food and thinking maybe I should just not eat,” she said. “I realised I couldn’t go out into the world – parading my body and myself in front of all these women who look up to me – and tell them that this is easy and simple and everyone can do this.”And that is where the brand unravels. Cutting out food groups, foregoing seeing friends to exercise, being unable to eat socially, obsessing about diet, size and shape: anyone who has suffered from an eating disorder will be familiar with all of the above. I spent a full year in hospital at the age of 32 trying to overcome an eating disorder that had gripped me since childhood. It is a long battle, fought every day, sometimes every second, but I know that continuing on that path does not open a door on to happiness or love or safety it is one of torture, punishment, toxic voices, broken relationships and denial. To package these behaviours as a “fantasy” shows nothing but contempt for these women.Through it all, the models are expected to be grateful for the opportunity. The casting for the Victoria’s Secret shows is a humiliating ritual, one in which models must essentially beg for the job. The video for Gigi Hadid’s casting shows one of the most successful models virtually prostrating herself. The brand then publishes this as a marketing tool. “I used to think about what this moment would feel like, and it’s indescribable,” model Maia Cotton says in a quote on the brand’s Instagram.“This has been my dream since I was a little girl,” says Willow Hand. “I’ve never worked so hard or wanted something in my life so badly.”“It’s almost like they’ve turned the Victoria’s Secret show into the American Dream,” says Jerrold Blackwell, who handles new faces and scouting at Next Model Management in Los Angeles. “Once you’ve gotten to this point as a model, this is the pinnacle. You’ve made it. It’s your identity, worth and status.”The company has not always rewarded the models with the same loyalty. In 2012, the show’s creative director, Sophia Neophitou-Apostolou, was asked by the New York Times whether she would cast “plus-size” model Kate Upton, who had already appeared in the brand’s catalogues. Upton would “never” get cast, said Neophitou-Apostolou. “She’s like a footballer’s wife, with the too-blond hair and that kind of face that anyone with enough money can go out and buy.”Michelle Cordeiro Grant is a former senior merchant director at Victoria’s Secret. She left in 2012 because she “started to take issue with the fact that I was working on these marketing campaigns, and I wasn’t feeling good about myself. It hit home when I got married and I had children. I said to my husband: ‘This isn’t a message I want to share with my daughter.’” In 2016, she started her own lingerie company, Lively, which uses a wide range of models and stories from real women in its marketing campaigns. It has been a huge success.“Victoria’s Secret has never changed,” says Cordeiro Grant, “but the world around them has. I was walking through the subway station the other day in Manhattan and I looked at the ad for the Angels’ ‘fantasy’ runway show and I said to myself: ‘That could be today, or 30 years ago.’”Over the summer, I was coming out of Oxford Street tube station in London when something stopped me in my tracks. Women’s bodies. All different colours and ethnicities, all shapes. They had thighs and breasts and stomachs, and flesh. Soft, everyday flesh. The posters were enormous, twice the size of me. It was a celebration of women’s bodies like I had never seen in mainstream advertising. The woman behind this was Rihanna, the pop star-cum-lingerie designer, whose Savage x Fenty range has radicalised the industry. Her show at New York Fashion Week was a parade of ersity. It could not have been further removed from the sheen and pomp of Victoria’s Secret’s. The message was one of iniduality and emancipation: “Women should be wearing lingerie for their damn selves,” she has said.To be fair to Victoria’s Secret, its claim that the shows have been “culturally erse for a long time” is accurate. The show has featured models of colour since its inception, and Blackwell says the company has been asking for more of them in recent years – “particularly Asian girls, girls you don’t often see on the runway”. One model he has worked with, Aiden Curtiss, has walked for Victoria’s Secret and “does it in a really healthy and happy way”, he says. “She loves being a black woman who is able to represent on that runway.” However, it has also been accused of cultural appropriation, in particular for using Native American headdresses on the runway.All the same, the brand is falling out of sync with the young women whose spending power it relies on. Its beloved plunge bras have been mocked for not even fitting the models who wear them. Rivals such as Savage x Fenty and American Eagles’ Aerie brand (which prides itself on avoiding airbrushing and using erse models) are gaining more market share as women and girls look for comfort, positive reinforcement and bras that are actually comfortable. Third Love even took out a full-page advert in the New York Times this week to denounce Razek’s comments, describing itself as the “antithesis” to Victoria’s Secret.Some models are starting to distance themselves from the show. “Feeling so much better about not doing BS … sorry, I mean VS, now that Rihanna isn’t doing it also,” Jourdan Dunn tweeted (and then deleted) after the pop star pulled out of performing in 2016.Most fashion insiders will tell you that the Victoria’s Secret show is outdated, a relic, a product of a bygone era. But they will add that it still matters. “Doing that show could fast-track your whole career,” one model told me. Blackwell describes it as “absolutely life-changing” in terms of the opportunities it opens and the financial rewards.Personally, I would like to see the show go the same way as plastic straws and carrier bags: shunned and boycotted. I would like to see those pop stars who preach body positivity refusing to play until the brand catches up with the times. Then I would like to see the lingerie industry reborn, using its power and influence to encourage ersity and a world where food is nourishment and exercise is for wellbeing, not punishment. A place where women can give themselves a break for once and enjoy being good enough, exactly as they are."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/560c2bf4b6bc16c1f7804c296521c96fc072c31a/0_0_4096_2730/master/4096.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=57408572cbed8238b9d93b7e7ec3210e 700w","title":"quiz what kind of a sharer are you","story":"From crisps to feelings, sharing feels good.

As a result, those who can afford to work for free are more likely to access opportunities which can lead to careers in areas such as journalism, fashion and politics.Sir Peter Lampl, the founder of the Sutton Trust and the chair of the Education Endowment Foundation, said: “Unpaid internships prevent young people from low and moderate-income backgrounds from accessing careers in some of the most desirable sectors such as journalism, fashion, the arts and law.“This is a huge social mobility issue. It prevents these young people from getting a foot on the ladder. In order to help tackle this situation internships should be advertised, not offered through informal networks. This locks out the many young people who don’t have connections.”The Sutton Trust is backing a private member’s bill from the Conservative peer Lord Holmes of Richmond, calling for a ban on unpaid internships over four weeks."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d967c2bac65282225dfcf717b80eb87535114f7/0_1004_5792_3475/master/5792.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e6668e752f3bbd98db58832b6b1cbb4a","title":"cliff richard rise up review comeback","story":"The light entertainer’s first album of new material for 14 years is a bet-hedging hotch-potch of styles and ideas, featuring – brace yourself – another Christmas songTimes change, tastes shift, stuff that was once thought irredeemably naff is re-evaluated, but somehow Cliff Richard remains perennially unhip. Sixty years and 250m sales into his career, there’s been no Rick Rubin v Johnny Cash-style back-to-basics reinvention, no reappraisal in the heritage rock mags, no suggestion of a young artist claiming him an influence. He was one of a handful of British rock’n’rollers whose early releases were raw enough to bear comparison with the records coming out of the US, but his work is still seen as strictly the province of blue-rinsed  readers. Mid-70s soft rock gets belatedly welcomed into the canon, but no one mentions Richard’s 1976 album I’m Nearly Famous, home to the flatly brilliant Devil Woman and Miss You Nights, the latter pillow-soft and emotionally racked. The odd adventurous DJ might play something from an arcane corner of his catalogue (the revered DJ Harvey has been known to drop his 1980 hit Carrie), but Richard’s name as an artist remains beyond the pale.He hasn’t helped himself. He was a rock’n’roll star from an age when rock’n’roll was held to be a passing fad and you were advised to get into panto and cabaret sharpish if you still wanted a career when the novelty wore off. He sang as though he didn’t believe a word of it. (“They say it’s gonna die but please, let’s face it,” snapped his debut single, Move It. “They just don’t know what’s gonna replace it.”) His music quickly softened, and an overwhelming suggestion of the family entertainer has beset him ever since. Already pretty square by the time the 60s started swinging, he probably sealed his fate by joining Mary Whitehouse in the Nationwide Festival of Light, campaigning against “moral pollution” and the permissive society of the counterculture. Still, it seems a bit unfair: you’d struggle to describe the quality of his oeuvre as anything other than variable, but the best bits deserve better than their current reputation.So it would be lovely to report that his first album of new material in 14 years is built to win over the doubters and spark a reconsideration. Alas, it isn’t. There are certainly good things here, not least the title track, which obliquely references Richard’s travails with the South Yorkshire constabulary and the BBC. Tellingly, it’s the work of old hands Graham Lyle and Terry Britten – the latter the co-author of both Devil Woman and Carrie – rather than the Scandinavian writers-for-hire employed elsewhere on the album. But the highlights are marooned amid a bet-hedging hotch-potch of styles and ideas.There are a couple of songs in the vein of his 1982 “gospel in disguise” album Now You See Me, Now You Don’t. Reborn is pretty good, while Wide Deep and High is rather a ripe old cheese. There are runny MOR ballads, aimed directly at Richard’s core fanbase, and there are four old tracks reworked to hop on board the current vogue for whacking the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra over the top of vintage hits, whether it suits them or not. None of them are improved by the addition of sawing strings, although there’s something mind-boggling about the fact that The Minute You’re Gone reached No 1 in 1965. As if to demonstrate how far from pop’s frontline Richard had slipped by the mid-60s, it sounds as if it’s something from the pre-rock’n’roll era. And there is – adopt the brace position – yet another Christmas song, The Miracle of Love. The best thing you can say about it is that it’s more Mistletoe and Wine than Millennium Prayer.The rest chugs along pleasantly enough without ever threatening to set the world on fire. His voice sounds good – there are audible signs of ageing, but falsetto remains within reach. Arrangements tend towards post-Amy Winehouse retro-soul, heavy on the brass. Like the electronic effects on the vocals and the presence of writers used to working with Demi Lovato and Sam Smith, this is clearly intended as a bid for relevance, although if contemporaneity was what Richard was after, he could have sounded hipper still by examining his own back catalogue. Precisely the kind of taut, glossy, synth-y new wave pop sound that powered his superb run of singles in the late 70s and early 80s has become a modern musical touchstone virtually no pop album is currently complete without a whiz-kid production team knocking together something that sounds almost exactly like his 1980 hit Dreamin’.Richard is clearly desperate for a hit, something he hasn’t had in a decade there’s an air of by-any-means-necessary about the Christmas song and the orchestrated oldies. Perhaps if he were less concerned with proving wrong the radio stations who proclaimed him too old, he might make a more consistent album. As it is, Rise Up is not unlike Richard’s back catalogue in general: something to pick through rather than embrace unreservedly.Amor – Glimpses Across ThunderFrom the forthcoming album by the Glasgow disco-not-disco quartet behind last year’s superb single Paradise comes a yearning song over a deliciously understated, vaguely acid-ish groove."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4526809d4cd204c1409d72763f3afff4cd8cd64f/0_126_1928_1157/master/1928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4b38aa6d30a44020369273533eeeb82d","title":"why is steve bannon in europe today in focus podcast","story":"Donald Trump’s former strategist has been touring the continent and attempting to sign parties up to his pan-European populist project.

What’s resolved and what’s in the long grass?Across the 26 pages of the political declaration, outlining a plan for the post-Brexit EU-UK relationship, the word “consider” is used 19 times. You can almost hear the thwack as the major issues are booted, one by one, into the long grass of the Belgian countryside.From customs to security, fisheries and a future trade in goods, there is a commitment for the EU and the UK to consider a whole host of options.The political declaration, which is not legally binding, has long been seen in Brussels as a sweetener for some of the less palatable elements of the withdrawal treaty, on citizens’ rights, the £39bn orce bill and the Irish border.The European commission has been disciplined in its language to avoid any weakening of their position that a country outside the EU cannot enjoy a status as good as one inside the bloc. They have also looked to pin down, where they can, the direction of the talks to come.But EU diplomats, echoing the phrase used by the former Brexit secretary David Davis to describe his own negotiating style, admit the document’s 8,192 words offer a great deal of “constructive ambiguity”.Trade in goodsLong grass rating: ••••When the long-awaited UK-EU trade deal becomes a reality, the two sides will be “separate markets and distinct legal orders”. With this starchy legal phrase, the EU demolished Theresa May’s ambition for frictionless trade and the common rulebook, the centrepiece of the Chequers plan. British access to European markets will depend on the UK respecting EU standards on competition, tax, environment, as well as social and employment protection, but it is not clear whether that involves non-regression or dynamic alignment. Negotiators have agreed to ensure no tariffs and avoid “unnecessary barriers”. In a section likely to infuriate Brexiters, the UK “will consider aligning” with relevant EU rules on goods to “ease” trade. Quite how that will work is not explained.Northern Ireland and customsLong grass rating: •••••A chief task for the prime minister has been to insert what was once described by a senior EU official as “magical thinking” into the political declaration. The withdrawal agreement has laid out the terms of an open-ended EU-UK customs union to ensure that there is no need either for a hard border on the island of Ireland or a customs border in the Irish Sea between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Theresa May sought to offer Brexiters, who hate the idea of being locked into a customs union, the hope that another technological solution could be found in time that would supersede such an arrangement. She has managed to do this with the inclusion of paragraph 27: “Facilitative arrangements and technologies will also be considered in developing any alternative arrangements for ensuring the absence of a hard border on the island of Ireland on a permanent footing.”The City of London will be disappointed but not surprised by the stark picture emerging in the joint declaration on financial services. Instead of “passports” that make it easy to do business in the EU, bankers and traders will have to rely on “equivalence”, a stricter regime used by the US and Switzerland, allowing market access to be withdrawn at 30 days’ notice. There is a commitment to complete equivalence assessments by the middle of June 2020. The two sides have also agreed to “appropriate consultations” on granting and withdrawing equivalence, although that may be little consolation to the 5,500 UK-based firms that will be losing the more-valued passports.If any issue is going to poison the future trade talks, it is the trade-off between access to British waters for European fishing fleets and the right of UK exporters to sell their products into the European market. The political declaration is carefully worded to avoid this issue exploding now. Access to waters is linked to “quota shares”. The political declaration also commits both sides to have a new fisheries agreement in place by 1 July 2020, six months before the end of the transition period. The more dynamite demands of the nine EU member states who have skin in this game are likely to be set out in a side-declaration by the 27 EU member states at the leaders’ summit on Sunday. The European commission has admitted that this is one of the issues still open for the leaders to nail down when they gather in Brussels.If the Conservative party thought Brexit would bring an end to the debilitating debate about the UK’s relationship with the EU, the political declaration will disappoint. The document paints a picture of a deep relationship in the form of an association agreement, with a host of joint ministerial and parliamentary forums. There will be a main joint committee responsible for managing the future trade and security relationship. Where there are disputes, it will go to an independent arbitration panel which will refer any question to the European court of justice if an interpretation of EU law is required. And if the UK should fail to comply with the arbitration panel, the EU “would be entitled to request financial compensation or take proportionate and temporary measures, including the suspension of its obligations within the scope of the future relationship”. The EU and UK will also hold biannual summits. British prime ministers will be trotting over to Brussels for decades to come.The EU’s member states have privately voiced their concerns about Theresa May’s inflammatory rhetoric about stopping their citizens “jumping the queue” to live and work in the UK after Brexit. The best Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator, has been able to do is to include a commitment in the political declaration that the UK will not be able to treat Romanians differently to the French, for example. Migration policies will also be reciprocal between the UK and the EU but Brussels is waiting on Downing Street to spell out what they will be. Both sides are also going to consider “conditions for entry and stay for purposes such as research, study, training and youth exchanges”. The paragraph suggests European citizens could in fact jump the queue over non-EU citizens in some circumstances.Foreign and security policyLong grass rating: •••The two sides have pledged to create a security partnership to tackle international crime, terrorism, cyber-attacks and “the erosion of the rules-based international order”. But in a blow to the UK, the EU is only offering co-operation, rather than membership, of the EU police agency Europol and the judicial cooperation agency Eurojust. “Close and lasting” cooperation is also foreseen for foreign policy, including co-ordination on international sanctions, but the UK would no longer be a member of the EU foreign ministers’ council. The UK has also pledged to worth work with the EU to combat illegal migration and toughen up controls on the EU’s external frontier.The Spanish government has said it will not support the Brexit deal unless it is clear that Gibraltar will not covered by a future trade deal without Madrid’s consent. The Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, has even suggested that such consent would depend on discussions over the sovereignty of the Rock, a disputed territory. The political declaration as it stands does not offer Madrid any such assurance and a European commission spokesman has said work is continuing to resolve the issue. The British prime minister spoke to Sánchez on Wednesday night and appeared to suggest in a statement on Thursday that a way forward had been found. There may be an annexe added to refer to the need for future UK-Spain talks."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/38c9dbc9d02c437fffffb87516283da4e2b6b470/22_88_892_535/master/892.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=507a6702b0e2a81ed84ed376b34c2208","title":"first ever plane with no moving parts takes flight","story":"Flight represents breakthrough that could lead eventually to carbon-neutral air travelThe first ever “solid state” plane, with no moving parts in its propulsion system, has successfully flown for a distance of 60 metres, proving that heavier-than-air flight is possible without jets or propellers.The flight represents a breakthrough in “ionic wind” technology, which uses a powerful electric field to generate charged nitrogen ions, which are then expelled from the back of the aircraft, generating thrust.Steven Barrett, an aeronautics professor at MIT and the lead author of the study published in the journal Nature, said the inspiration for the project came straight from the science fiction of his childhood. “I was a big fan of Star Trek, and at that point I thought that the future looked like it should be planes that fly silently, with no moving parts – and maybe have a blue glow. But certainly no propellers or turbines or anything like that. So I started looking into what physics might make flight with no moving parts possible, and came across a concept known as the ionic wind, with was first investigated in the 1920s.“This didn’t make much progress in that time. It was looked at again in the 1950s, and researchers concluded that it couldn’t work for aeroplanes. But I started looking into this and went through a period of about five years, working with a series of graduate students to improve fundamental understanding of how you could produce ionic winds efficiently, and how that could be optimised.”In the prototype plane, wires at the leading edge of the wing have 600 watts of electrical power pumped through them at 40,000 volts. This is enough to induce “electron cascades”, ultimately charging air molecules near the wire. Those charged molecules then flow along the electrical field towards a second wire at the back of the wing, bumping into neutral air molecules on the way, and imparting energy to them. Those neutral air molecules then stream out of the back of the plane, providing thrust.The end result is a propulsion system that is entirely electrically powered, almost silent, and with a thrust-to-power ratio comparable to that achieved by conventional systems such as jet engines.Prof Guy Gratton, an aerospace engineer and visiting professor at Cranfield University, said: “It’s clearly very early days: but the team at MIT have done something we never previously knew was possible in using accelerated ionised gas to propel an aircraft. Aeronautical engineers around the world are already trying hard to find ways to use electric propulsion, and this technology will offer something else that in the future may allow manned and unmanned aircraft to be more efficient, and non-polluting. In particular, the fact that they have already got this out of the laboratory, and flown a battery driven model aircraft – albeit so far on a very small and controlled scale – is very exciting.”The successful flight of the plane – which has no name beyond the uninspiring “Version Two” – owes as much to the engineering prowess required to make it as thin and light as possible as it does to the propulsion method itself. The plane weighs just 2.45kg, but manages to fit in a five-metre wing, battery stack, and a high-voltage power converter.In the immediate future, the MIT team hope to increase the range and speed of the plane, primarily by scaling up the size of the overall machine. Potential applications in the short term include unmanned drones, where silent flight may be beneficial, and high-altitude solar-powered flight, where the lack of moving parts could allow such a plane to soar for years on end, acting as a pseudo-satellite.In the longer term, the ability to power flight purely through electricity opens up the possibility of carbon-neutral flight, which could lower the emissions of the aviation industry globally.Barrett also noted that solid state propulsion tends to miniaturise well, and suggested that smaller drones than those currently possible with rotor-based flight could take-off using an ionic wind drive in the future. “Solid state things lend themselves to scaling down quite well,” he said, “creating extremely small flight vehicles that serve uses we can’t imagine.”• This article was amended on 22 November 2018.

Campaigners have criticised the term affordable rent for “turning the English language on its head”, saying they are still unaffordable to many people.The number of affordable rent properties has soared since they were introduced by the Conservative-Liberal Democrat government in 2011, as the number of social rent properties has declined. Almost 27,200 were built last year, up from about 24,300 in 2016-17.In England, about 1.25 million families were registered on the waiting list for social housing between 2016-17. About two-thirds have been waiting for more than a year. On average, an English local authority has more than 3,500 families on its books.Polly Neate, chief executive of the charity Shelter, said the gap between the number of social homes needed and those being built was vast. “This just isn’t acceptable when nearly 280,000 people are homeless in England today,” she said.In her Conservative party conference speech last month, Theresa May said a cap on local authority borrowing for the construction of new homes would be scrapped, a step designed to increase the number of new homes built across Britain.Increasing the number of affordable homes has become a top priority amid a national housing shortage exacerbated by high house prices. High rental costs have added to the pressures facing households across the country.Mark Robinson, the chief executive of Scape Group, a public sector construction outsourcer, said: “Councils must be empowered to build social housing themselves, as they were in the 1970s.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ecda40d3a620c168ba622b3b5dd79cdee3b5e0e/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3f343c7cfad53a86c3318ffd4b243248","title":"study shows 60 of britons believe in conspiracy theories","story":"Leavers more likely to doubt immigration figures and think there is a plot to make Muslims the majority in UKSixty per cent of British people believe at least one conspiracy theory about how the country is run or the veracity of information they have been given, a major new study has found, part of a pattern of deep distrust of authority that has become widespread across Europe and the US.The figures were the result of a large-scale international project conducted over six years and in nine countries by researchers at the University of Cambridge and YouGov, funded by the Leverhulme Trust. The study was the most comprehensive examination of conspiracy theories ever conducted, and marks the first time academics have explored questions of conspiracy beliefs, social trust and news consumption habits across different countries.The researchers also found:Prof John Naughton, the director of the press fellowship programme at Wolfson College and one of three University of Cambridge professors who led the research, said the study, which began in 2012, had been born out of an attempt to look at the “natural history” of conspiracy theories.The researchers had tried to be as broad as possible in their definition of the term as “a theory that some actors have conspired to do something covertly, usually something dysfunctional or evil”. As part of the study, they polled respondents about 10 theories, all of which had emerged from their research, in order to test how widely they were held.That dismissive attitude changed after the Brexit vote and the election of Trump in 2016, he said. “Whatever else you think of Trump, he is a born conspiracy theorist. Trump was a kind of catalyst, in that somehow his election had the effect of mainstreaming conspiracy theories.”In fact, the prevalence of conspiracy beliefs in human societies suggests they may have a function, said Naughton. “It’s a way of trying to make sense of a complex and confusing world for an ordinary citizen.”Dr Hugo Leal, one of the project’s researchers, said he and the other academics had been startled by the proportion of Trump and Brexit supporters who said they believed the grand replacement theory.He said: “This is intertwined with a broader conspiratorial outlook, which seems to link the Trump and Brexit camps. Indeed, both sides share attitudes and sentiments that transcend the mere conservative ideological affiliation. Our study shows that conspiracy theories are a central element to understanding a common political culture, which most scholars find hard to fathom.” Leal described the shared attitudes as a “transatlantic conspiratorial axis”.More than 11,500 people were surveyed online by YouGov across nine countries: France, Germany, the UK, Hungary, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Sweden and the US.

There are not expected to be any drastic changes to what was witnessed during the men’s and women’s trial games at the end of last season, when each innings compromised 10 blocks of 10 balls.Bowlers will send down either five or 10 balls of each block – and no more than 20 in total – with the powerplay likely to be set at the first 25 balls of each innings. An idea to have wides followed by a free-hit has been scrapped, while a decision remains over whether incoming batsmen must always face the next delivery, regardless of whether batsmen crossed for a high catch or the wicket fell off the final delivery of a 10-ball block.If the desired 150 minute format appears close to completion then the composition of each team’s coaching staff continues to be the subject of much discussion.With the costs of The Hundred having ballooned from £13m to £40m, a number of the host venues are said to have suggested their county’s first XI staff simply transfer across. This is likely to rejected by the ECB and the PCA, because conflicts of interest could arise regarding player recruitment.The thinking is that each team will employ a “high-performance manager” to oversee the running of the men’s and women’s squads, as well as assemble coaching teams. Permanent coaches will be appointed, while assistants are likely to be seconded from the counties for short-term guest roles.There is a strong desire to ensure English coaches are at the front of the queue for the eight coach roles – well-paid positions, if the rumours of £80,000 for five weeks’ work are correct – and counties are expected to release staff who get the nod it will not only be 96 players missing from the county 50-over tournament that runs concurrently.Another element that needs settling is when the first player draft takes place, with county directors of cricket (or their equivalents) pushing for it to be as early as possible to aid planning for 2020. October next year has been suggested, although the tournament’s marketing department ideally want it closer to the main event. Teams in the men’s competition are expected to have a £1m squad budget, with the women’s salary pot not yet decided.The ECB board meeting is also due to ratify the domestic structure from 2020 onwards, with Division One of the County Championship expanding to 10 teams. It was hoped the governing body and the PCA would also have agreed the County Partnership Agreement by this point – chiefly the distribution of funds from the £1.1bn broadcast deal and the salary cap – although this is likely to rumble on into 2019."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d470dee6e0730e678ac7a2d523ea3ff13da27fad/298_59_3596_2157/master/3596.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5b54ade70201f468d0c2548d7bc921a2","title":"manu tuilagi likely return england laced dread","story":"As and when Manu Tuilagi comes off the England bench on Saturday you can be sure of two things: first, that his arrival is greeted by the loudest cheer of the match second, that the first time he gets his hands on the ball there will be 80,000 people holding their collective breath.For all the goodwill that comes his way, it is hard – and it has been for some time – to watch the Leicester centre without a mild sense of dread, to avoid looking through your fingers as he gallops towards defenders.Undoubtedly there have been signs of a certain robustness this season – the try he scored from the halfway line against Newcastle springs to mind, as do a couple of bruising bursts against the Scarlets – but the will-he-won’t-he narrative that has continued all autumn only adds to the apprehension that comes with the anticipation.Eddie Jones cannot afford to admit as much, for it is his job to instil a bulletproof confidence in his heavyweight centre but the England coach will be as relieved as anyone for Tuilagi to get a few more minutes under his belt in the Test arena against Australia without any adverse reaction to his latest groin problems.“I am so pleased for Manu because he has really stuck at it,” said Jones, and to put his patience over Tuilagi into perspective, he has had him on the field for only 16 minutes of his 33 matches in charge. “It’s disheartening when you get little injuries that just stop you from playing. All we’re wanting is for him to do the basics well – good straight, hard running, good hard, low tackling and work off the ball.”For all of his injury setbacks, Tuilagi seems to handle them remarkably well. It is easy to imagine each one driving the 27-year-old further into despair but that is not in keeping with his persona around the England camp this month. Their Bagshot base is the kind of place where time can often stand still but Tuilagi has been keeping his teammates entertained at the pool table – “He plays rubbish in the morning then takes everyone’s money at night!” Owen Farrell said – and running a coffee shop from his bedroom.“He’s mixed really well socially, he’s got a coffee shop, he’s the king of the pool table, he’s trained really hard and kept a smile on his face,” Jones said. “He’s been a real joy to have around the team.”If he has been a hit off the field, however, Jones’s eyes light up at the idea of a backline featuring Tuilagi, Ben Te’o and Joe Cokanasiga, who wins his second cap. “We have never had that before. So it’s exciting.”It hardly needs saying Tuilagi is a different player to the wrecking ball that ransacked the All Blacks in 2012 but that match remains at the forefront of Jones’s mind and it was illuminating to watch the highlights recently – inescapable as they were before kick-off when New Zealand were back in town this month. What struck most was just how young Tuilagi looked: the boyish grin when facing the haka, the rat tail, the line-break, the intercept and the exhausted run to the corner (not the posts, much to Mike Brown’s annoyance).Six years on and the same grin returned this week. “He just smiled,” said Jones, recalling Tuilagi’s reaction to being part of Saturday’s squad, while his Leicester teammate Ben Youngs added: “Manu’s like an excited kid at the best of times, so this is no different. He’s certainly very excited. He’s had to be really patient. He’s trained really well. I’m just so pleased to see him out there. He’s got a big grin on his face, like a Cheshire cat.”It is in hope rather than expectation it remains on his face at the final whistle."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3a967042be6796f87ff7499eccad1f5bcfb3afb8/0_32_2074_1245/master/2074.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dba280ffa8901996f00302b3f16e75de","title":"world chess championship game 10 carlsen caruana","story":"Magnus Carlsen confessed to nerves after holding on for a high-wire draw with Fabiano Caruana on Thursday in the marathon 10th game of their world championship showdown, which left the best-of-12-games match in a 5-all deadlock with two contests remaining.The 27-year-old champion from Norway, playing with the black pieces, weathered Caruana’s novel deviation from the Sveshnikov Sicilian (12. b4) and responded with a bold attacking surprise (21. … b5!) to go for broke on the kingside and briefly take advantages in position and time over the American challenger.Carlsen, 27, has been ranked No 1 for eight straight years and was considered the world’s best player even before he defeated Viswanathan Anand for the title in 2013. Caruana, 26, is ranked No 2, having earned his place at the table by winning the candidates tournament in March. No American-born player has won or even competed for the world title since Bobby Fischer in 1972.\u0026nbspIt marks the first title match between the world\u0027s top two players since 1990, when Garry Kasparov and Anatoly Karpov faced off for a fifth and final time.\u0026nbspThe match will consist of 12 classical games with each player awarded one point for a win and a half-point for a draw. Whoever reaches six and a half points first will be declared the champion.The time control for each game is 100 minutes for the first 40 moves, 50 minutes for the next 20 moves and then 15 minutes for the rest of the game plus an additional 30 seconds per move starting from move 1.

Kd4) while trying to squeeze victory from a seemingly drawish position left the champion on the back foot, where he admitted he was “fortunate” to salvage a half-point after five hours and 19 minutes.“I felt that it was very close to mate,” Carlsen, the world No 1, said of his kingside attack. “The problem is if I don’t mate I’m losing. So I was trying to find some middle ground and my time was running out. I don’t know. I was just so nervous, I couldn’t make it happen. It ended up just being nothing.”Caruana and Carlsen played into another Sicilian, same as Game 8, and the parallel lines extended for their first 11 moves (6. Ndb5 d6 7. Nd5 Nxd5 8. exd5 Nb8 9. a4 Be7 10. Be2 O-O 11. O-O Nd7). It was the American who broke first with a novelty (12. b4) that sent Carlsen into the first long think of the day.“It was a new move,” Carlsen said. “I thought I’d checked everything there after from previous games but apparently not. But I was not so unhappy to see it since I felt I that would just get a complicated game. And then at some point I was very happy with my position and I probably overestimated it and then I decided to just go crazy.”Carlsen had the clear upper hand after equal trades of pawns and bishops (27. Bf1 Bxf1 28. Qxf1 Qxd5 29. Rxb4 Qe6) and the players, facing clock pressure, scrambled toward the time control as the game entered the fifth hour.The position appeared bound for a draw after (41. ... Rc6 42. Ra6 Ke5 43. Kg3 h6 44. h5) but Carlsen was keen on pressing his winning chances. That’s when he overextended himself with 44. ... Kd4, exposing his d-pawn and allowing Caruana to hit back with 45. Rb5. Suddenly the American was pressing and Carlsen would need to sacrifice a pawn and be incredibly accurate in defense to hold a draw.“I was playing for a win and then immediately after (44. ... Kd4), I saw (45. Rb5) and I realized I was going to have to grovel for a draw,” Carlsen said. “Fortunately, I managed to do that, but I think he could have put a stronger test to me.”Carlsen cowered back to the center in a flurry of moves (46. Ra4+ Ke5 47. Rab4 Ke6) before accepting a pawn exchange Caruana (48. c4 dxc4 49. Rxc4). Shortly after a trade of rooks the players shook hands.When asked if nerves came into play, Carlsen was forthright: “I’ve been nervous for many days.”The 10 straight draws represent the longest streak of games to open a match without a decisive result in the recognized 132-year history of world championship matches.Carlsen will be a warm favorite to retain the title if the next two games end in draws, forcing a tie-breaker on Wednesday consisting of a series of games under tighter time controls. The Norwegian, who in addition to his No 1 ranking is the world’s top rated rapid player and top rated blitz player (compared to Caruana’s respective ratings of No 8 and No 16), is unbeaten in tie-breakers over the last 13 years.Said Russian grandmaster Alexander Grischuk on Wednesday of the prospect: “Of course Magnus is the favorite. You can beat Magnus, but you can never be a favorite against him.”For now both players will look forward to Friday’s rest day before the €1m ($1.14m) match resumes on Saturday at the College in Holborn with Carlsen playing as white in Game 11.“It was just a case of too complicated and too much at stake,” said Carlsen, who extended a career-high streak of 15 straight draws stretching back to last month’s European Club Cup in Porto Carras, Greece. “That was the main thing. I could have played better many times. Both of us made many mistakes.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/76c5ec84c56af94463982e38d52950074f25395b/0_3_3898_2340/master/3898.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b65541b3a7fd6187db5f0980f21d75e3","title":"england india womens world twenty20 semi final match report","story":"India made their biggest call of the semi-final before a ball was even bowled: dropping veteran Mithali Raj. Criticised for her conservative approach to T20 batting, it was a bold, brave decision that fitted with the new, exciting approach to the format which they have touted during this tournament.Unfortunately, when it came to semi-final crunch time, the reality did not quite match up to the rhetoric. In a collapse that was reminiscent of their poor showing in the 2017 World Cup final, India crumbled from 88-2 to 112 all out with three balls of their innings unused: of the key top four, only Smriti Mandhana could muster a strike rate above 100.England then eased their way to their first 20-over global final since 2014, winning by eight wickets with 17 balls remaining as both Amy Jones and Nat Sciver accumulated unbeaten half-centuries.England had initially experienced some nerves in their chase, both openers holing out in the powerplay to leave England 24-2. But Jones and Sciver’s 92-run partnership put them in firm control of the situation. This was keeper Jones’ coming-of-age moment: her 45-ball fifty was her first in T20 internationals, and it was she – fittingly – who stroked the winning runs through midwicket. Along the way she hit her first six in the format, as England showed the aggressive intent that India had so lacked.After winning the toss India should have been in pole position, England’s Heather Knight admitting that she, too, would have preferred to have avoided chasing on a tricky slow pitch. But a painful innings from opener Taniya Bhatia immediately started the rot: 11 off 19 balls, batting in a style that was scarcely different from Mithali’s old approach.At the other end, Smriti Mandhana diced with death in the opening overs, with some uppish drives falling just clear of the infield. The diciest was a catch put down by a ing Sophie Ecclestone at cover when Smriti was on just 13. Ecclestone atoned for her mistake 18 balls later as she clung onto a caught-and-bowled chance off her own bowling, but in the meantime it had cost England 21 runs.Three overs later Knight removed Bhatia from contention, and the crowd awaited the Harmanpreet Kaur show. But there was an air of anti-climax, as the India captain struggled for several overs to get the ball off the square. She showed some semblance of her old self, taking on Kirstie Gordon with a huge six over long off, but could only muster 16 off 20 balls, eventually top-edging Gordon to Sciver at cover in a slog-gone-wrong.By that time India were 94-5, with Jemimah Rodrigues – who shared a 36-run partnership with Harmanpreet – also back in the hutch thanks to a brilliant run out from Tammy Beaumont at backward point, one of three such dismissals across the India innings. From there it was easy pickings for Knight, who – having not bowled a single over in England’s previous two matches – finished with figures of 3-9, ripping through the late middle order. Should she bowl herself in the final against Australia, she will start on a hat-trick.On the evidence of today’s semis, that match is a mouth-watering prospect: Australia may be tournament favourites but the calm way in which Jones and Sciver approached the run chase puts England in firm contention. They will be looking to avenge their 2016 semi-final defeat to Australia when they take to the field on Saturday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1a801ee0a3d60cca7ccb617cec099d39b038738/0_357_3300_1979/master/3300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4f411c7f6bbdba10795614ecc47626dc","title":"england v india womens world twenty20 semi final live","story":"And here’s Raf Nicholson’s match report from Antigua:That’ll do us. Thanks for your company on the OBO throughout semi-final day here in Antigua. We have the blockbuster final on Saturday, Australia v England. We’ll catch you back here then. Bye for now! And now for Heather Knight, England skipper (excuse typos, bashed out as she spoke)“The way the spinners bowled in the middle overs was outstanding. We knew it was tricky fot batters coming in whenever we took a wicket. Kirstie (Gordon) has been outstanding on her first tour with the way she has bowled and spun it past the bat. And Sophie (Ecclestone) as a young spinner as well, the quality she has bowled with over the last year.”On the batting: “That compusure, the way they played the spinners. The way we practiced with our coaches, we knew what they were going to throw at us and we dealt with it really well.”On why she didn’t bowl an extra over when on a hat-trick: “I think Anya might have killed me. My role is to bowl a couple of overs when we need it and let the main bowlers bare the most of the bowling.”Worried about Beaumont and Wyatt? “Not at all, I think the conditions have been very tricky in St Lucia and here it has been hard work batting. They are going to ge low scores some of the time I want them to be positive. The big stage of the final they will be desperate to do well.”Playing Australia: “It is going to be a great occasion so hopefully the crowd will comg out and support both teams.”Harmanpreet Kaur, Indian captain, is up. “Whatever we decided we decided for the team,” she said of the decision to omit Mithali Raj. “Sometimes it works sometimes it doesn’t. We played really well in the tournament so one game doesn’t decide if we are a good team or a bad team. This is a learning experience for us a we have a very young team. At upcoming tournaments we will play good cricket. have learend a lot through this tourament.”She went on to say she was happy they dragged it to the 18th over, which is a bit odd given they were right on top at the power play, but there we have it. Charlotte Edwards on radio is scathing of that assessment from the Indian skipper. “They bottled it,” she says, more bluntly. “We have a young team and we have to work on our mental strength because in the future we are going to play in these sorts of games,” Kaur concluded.Amy Jones, who made 53* in 47 balls, is receiving her award. “It was just fantastic to get the win and Nat came in an took the pressure off straight away,” she says. “We just tried to stay relaed. Nat is always trying to get me to rin hard. We just wanted to b there at the end.”And on their wonderful preparation: “Playing at 8pm gies you a lot of thinking time so we have been thinking about it and we planned we knew their attack was high quality spinners but the plan paid off so we’re very happy.”Well played. We’ll hear from Heather Knight and Harmanpreet Kaur shortly.Amy Jones does get her 50, pulling another four of her own to reach the milestone and complete the match. An unbeaten partnership of 92 runs has gone the trick for England, who will meet Australia in the decider on Saturday. 17th over: England 112-2 (Jones 49, Sciver 52) Target 113. Sciver gets to 50 with another smashing pull shot. So many pull shots, so much power. She raises her bat to the fans, which include her family. Jones keeps the strike with single so she will get the chance to do the same with one run to win. 16th over: England 103-2 (Jones 46, Sciver 46) Target 113. I’ve realised, belatedly, that there is a difference of opinion between the card I’m using and the scoreboard here. Let’s go with the latter, Sciver slightly ahead. And more runs to add when Amy Jones leans back and crunches Sharma over midwicket for a boundary that brings up the England 100. Ten off it, leaving ten runs to win. What a partnership this has been. 15th over: England 93-2 (Jones 41, Sciver 41) Target 113. Rogrigues makes it six bowlers tried by Kaur, searching for anything to break this stand and give her side some slight hope. But it doesn’t come, six runs added instead, including some rapid running by the set pair. Both are 41 from 36 balls this stand 69 from 61. Nice. 14th over: England 87-2 (Jones 36, Sciver 40) Target 113. That’s the shot Sciver played so well when she made the decision in 2016 to start trying to hit sixes on the reg, shuffling across her off-stump before hoicking over square leg. This doesn’t go the full journey but the four she gets for it takes the pressure straight off at the start of Patil’s new spell. Four singles to follow, making another eight to go good for England and leaving just 26 from 36 balls for England to progress to the final.13th over: England 79-2 (Jones 34, Sciver 34) Target 113. Kaur persists with the Poonam Plan. Five singles? They’ll take that. It’s cruisy right now for England as they near in on the magic number. 12th over: England 74-2 (Jones 31, Sciver 32) Target 113. A better over from Radha, who doesn’t give up the boundary ball. “England would already have had an extra over if they hadn’t been chasing all those off-side wides,” emails Adam Hirst. “Just leave them alone!” Yes and no. England needed to break them well outside and it worked by moving around in the crease to reach those wider deliveries. It definitely threw their opposition. 11th over: England 70-2 (Jones 29, Sciver 30) Target 113. Hemalatha replaces Patil, so India have scrapped Plan A. It matters little, Sciver is every bit the player tonight that she was in last year’s World Cup, pulling with authority through midwicket to the boundary once more. India cannot build up the necessary pressure to create a mistake. Ten from the over. 10th over: England 60-2 (Jones 27, Sciver 22) Target 113. More of the same from Sciver, who this time decides to get back and pull rather than cut, the result the same, splitting the sweepers to get a third boundary in as many overs. With 30 runs in the last four overs, whisper it, England have cracked this chase open. They needed 53 from the final ten overs to book a place in the final. 9th over: England 52-2 (Jones 26, Sciver 15) Target 113. Excellent batting, especially from Sciver, who is the designated aggressor. After three singles are milked from Patil, she elects to lean back and carve a powerful cut shot, picking the gap and finding the boundary. “England have done their homework here,” says Charlotte Edwards, noting that Sciver is willing to get back in the crease and hit hard. 8th over: England 44-2 (Jones 24, Sciver 9) Target 113. Here comes Poonam Yadav, such a tough bowler for England to play in the past given her pint-sized height and sloooow legspinners. The unorthodox field, with three on the circle either side of point, remains in place. But much as it was in Patil’s first over, they find a way to find seven runs anyway. Good batting. Sciver is very close to splitting the two deep midwickets with a powerful pull shot but Mandhana does very well in the deep to save a couple. Dare I say it, both of these players look comfortable in the early stages of this vital stanza. 7th over: England 37-2 (Jones 21, Sciver 5) Target 113. The game moves into a new and important period with Patil bowling the first of what will be eight overs of very slow, very tough spin. And Sciver is dropped first ball of it! That would have been huge. Miscued square leg, not a tough chance, Poonam puts it down! With THREE fielders on the circle between backward point and cover point - the plan to bore England out with deliveries waaaay outside the off-stump - the pair are nimble enough to work around the crease and find five singles elsewhere. Charlotte Edwards is very critical of such a defensive strategy from India given that they are only defending 112. 6th over: England 30-2 (Jones 18, Sciver 3) Target 113. The final over of the power play, Radha to send it down with her left-arm finger spin. Four singles and a wide is their lot, the field now set to go out. Will Sciver try and muscle a few over the rope? Watching her range hit in practice a fair bit over the last fortnight, she can get it over without getting a lot on it. We’ll see. So many overs to come from Patil and Poonam, she won’t have much choice if she wants to findclear the boundary.Just at the moment Amy Jones had England looking positive, Wyatt has holed out. There isn’t anything wrong with what she was trying to do - hit Sharma back over her head - but the ball, once again, held in the pitch so the shot ended up at deep midwicket. Rodrigues made tough work of it, slipping as the ball was on its way, but she kept her cool and got it done.4th over: England 22-1 (Wyatt 7, Jones 14) Target 113. Amy Jones goes BANG over long-on, nailing a legitimate lofted drive well over the advertising boards. SIX RUNS! That’s a very attractive shot. For so many years she has craved the chance to be a legitimate matchwinner with the bat and she is getting that opportunity right now on this huge stage. 3rd over: England 14-1 (Wyatt 6, Jones 7) Target 113. It was always going to be hard work batting fourth on this track today so England are going to have to do plenty right here. But fair play to Amy Jones, who makes room for herself to play a forehand smash over the bowler Sharma to record her first boundary - make that, England’s first boundary. I don’t mind that at all this is not a pitch for playing conventionally. After surviving a direct hit, Beaumont hits a catch straight to midwicket where Reddy is there to take it safely. It was a premeditated shot, shuffling across her stumps to try and find a gap, but it hasn’t worked. 2nd over: England 6-1 (Wyatt 4, Jones 1) Target 113. Jones off the mark with her most productive shot, the cover drive, for one. Wyatt finds a single out there too, keeping the strike. With Beaumont gone, so much now rides on how Wyatt goes over the next handful of overs. India in a tight huddle. They’ve been together for a good 90 seconds on the boundary rope. England’s opening pair of Wyatt and Beaumont then follow them onto the field. Talking to the Wyatt during the week, she told me that in the minutes before they go to bat the rule is that they must talk about anything but cricket and the task ahead of them. How difficult must that discipline have been tonight, knowing they are a half-decent start away from breaking the back of this chase in the power play? So, can England hold their nerve and get the job done? Stick with me. PLAY!Deepti Sharma running to the danger end to keep the board ticking over in the final over but Hazell’s throw made it to Jones in time. India are dismissed with three balls remaining in their innings. Considering where they were when Mandhana was cracking along early, that’s a long way short of satisfactory. In saying that, close to run a ball will be no stroll in the park given the way this track is playing and India’s group of capable spinners. England require 113 to make the World T20 Final. Beautifully called by Charlotte Edwards on TMS who predicted a stumping and a stumping it was, Ecclestone spinning past the edge of Reddy who wasn’t in the same postcode when Jones whipped off the bails. Five balls to go. 19th over: India 111-8 (Sharma 6, Reddy 6) Sharma nearly runs herself out! They had to take on Wyatt (again) who just misses, in near-identical fashion to the previous wicket. Reddy, new to the crease, capitalises from a rare poor delivery from Shrubsole on leg stump, whipping it around the corner for a valuable boundary. Knight to bowl the final over?Tip and run to cover from the first ball of Shrubsole’s new over, but Wyatt is brilliant in close with her collect and throw, nailing the non-strikers’ stumps direct to run out Radha by a few inches. 18th over: India 104-7 (Sharma 5, Radha 4) Hazell’s turn to keep the pressure on and she does it well: no boundary balls on offer here. But as Charlotte Edwards notes, being such a tough pitch, any chase will be hard work when England walk out to bat. First ball! Knight will be on a hat-trick if she gives herself another over, and let’s hope she does as she has 39 from two so far. Patil shovelled her towards long-on and Winfield made fantastic ground before taking the low chance tidily. Knight backed her own off-spin and it has worked a treat, picking up a second wicket with Hemalatha picking out Beaumont at cover. This game is moving very quickly.She’s gone! Sensational bowling from Kirstie Gordon, giving it a a rip and winning an edge from Kaur. It flies hiiiigh into the Antiguan night sky and Nat Sciver takes it cleanly. This is a MASSIVE moment in this game and they celebrate accordingly. Gordon finishes with 220. Superb effort.Another top edge, taken safely by Jones. Gordon, who has bowled nicely, gets a reward. The more important job for the spinner now becomes keeping Kaur off strike for as long as possible with five balls left in the over.15th over: India 93-3 (Kaur 16, Krishnamurthy 2) Shrubsole now, Knight backing in her vice-captain to find a way through the Indian leader. But suggesting that Kaur fancies her chances against spin, she plays the England attack leader conservatively and respectfully. A direct hit from Beaumont as the Indian pair came back for a risky second run, the number three’s run-a-ball 26 is complete. In an over where so much has already happened as Harmanpreet danced and flayed Gordon over extra cover, inside-out, for six. There’s one player in the entire women’s game who can play that shot with so much power when not getting to the pitch of the delivery and it is Kaur. From the one ball Krishnamurthy had to see off, she was nearly stumped. It is not overstating matters to say that England’s entire campaign will be dictated by how they handle Kaur now that she’s flicked the switch.13th over: India 77-2 (Rodrigues 21, Kaur 7) Nat Sciver to break up the spin, bowling her second over. “Something is going to happen here,” predicts Charlotte Edwards. Unfortunately for England, it’s back to back boundaries to finish the set, Rodrigues learning back and cutting one four then steering another behind point next ball. Harmanpreet’s turn.12th over: India 67-2 (Rodrigues 12, Kaur 6) England’s trio of spinners are putting in a shift here. It’s Ecclestone’s turn, who goes for three runs in an over that nearly brought a run out early then finished with Rodrigues top-edging to where a short third man might have been a chance for a catch if in position. Just 17 runs from the last five overs for India. Batting is getting harder by the minute. 11th over: India 64-2 (Rodrigues 11, Kaur 5) Hazell getting so much spin that a ball pitching well outside the off stump ends up a legside wide. Charlotte Edwards, who played for England about 400 times from memory, says this movement is more like day five of a men’s Test Match in India than a women’s T20 international. Four other singles, with both players happy to pick out the sweepers. It can’t be long at all before Kaur shifts gears, or dies trying.10th over: India 59-2 (Rodrigues 9, Kaur 3) Gordon, who has been Knight’s most dependable spinner in this tournament, gets the first proper crack at Kaur. It’s another good over from the left-arm ortho, offering only singles from her bowling so far. 120? 130? 9th over: India 55-2 (Rodrigues 7, Kaur 1) The captain Kaur off the mark first ball, keeping the strike with the cut. Just five runs and the wicket from the Knight over. It’s all about what happens now, while Kaur is new to the crease. A miscue from the bottom of the bat ends up in the hands of Sciver, running back at midwicket - reminiscent of the catch she took late in the World Cup Final. It might be advantage India, though, as Bhatia’s dismissal brings Harmanpreet to the middle. 8th over: India 50-1 (Bhatia 11, Rodrigues 3) Kirstie Gordon’s turn, the left-arm spinner who made her debut at the start of this England World T20 campaign and has immediately looked at home. That might have something to do with the 22 internationals she played for Scotland before qualifying. Anyway, she’s right on the money from the get-go here, spinning the ball as hard as she can to take advantage of the surface. The one that doesn’t rip, however, nearly finds Rodrigues short, just getting her foot back after Jones took the bails. Just two from the set. Nicely done. 7th over: India 48-1 (Bhatia 10, Rodrigues 2) Five singles taken from the Hazell over. As Charlotte Edwards notes on TMS, delaying Harmanpreet Kaur’s entry by having this pair knocking it around for a while isn’t the worst result at all. Mandhana returns a catch to Ecclestone! It’s not a good ball, pitching half way down the track. But the Indian megastar, given so long to work out where she was going to clobber it, hit the softest catch back to Ecclestone - even softer than the one she grassed off Shrubsole from the same batter. She made no mistake this time around, though. It took the entire power play to get going but England are at last heading in the right direction.Knight turns to the experience of Danielle Hazell, keeping two overs up the sleeve for Shrubsole. She spins the first hard, past Bhatia and Amy Jones, adding two byes to the cause. A single behind square gives Mandhana a couple of opportunities to let the good times role and she does just that, dancing inside-out over extra cover for another boundary. She’s 28 from 19. (Also, sorry for the confusion of having England batting in my earlier posts. It’s been a long dayweekdecade. All fixed now)4th over: India 28-0 (Bhatia 4, Mandhana 24) Can the young Lancastrian keep her cool with the ball after dropping that catch? Straight after the error it is Ecclestone from the Andy Roberts End. But Mandhana is in remarkable touch here, hitting the two best shots of the day in the space of four balls: a sweep shot to die for followed by a superb lofted drive over long-on for SIX! If England don’t get rid of her soon this could get ugly and fast. “The most talented batter in the world,” concludes Ebony Rainford-Brent on TMS.  3rd over: India 18-0 (Bhatia 4, Mandhana 14) Top edge! But doesn’t go to hand. It’s already an absorbing contest between Shrubsole and Mandhana, two of the best in the world at what they do. Next ball, she steers a boundary behind point, using what pace there is - superb batting. But then, to end the over, DROPPED CATCH! Oh my, that’s a simple catch at cover, Mandhana pushing it to Ecclestone (that pitch again), who puts it down moving slightly to her left. That hurts and every England fan know it.2nd over: India 9-0 (Bhatia 4, Mandhana 5) Shooooooooooooot. Smriti Mandhana, who put a month-long clinic during the KSL this English summer, is off the mark with a glorious square drive off Sciver - on a track that’s been close to impossible to drive on. Class. A couple of singles in there too. I wonder how Knight will manage the overs here? 1st over: India 3-0 (Bhatia 3, Mandhana 0) Anya is swinging it around corners to begin, each of her six deliveries hooping big. It is well handled by Bhatia, who got off the mark with a squeeze behind square. The left-handed Mandhana, with one ball to negotiate, is beaten outside the off-stump. Superb bowling from England’s numero uno.Anthems: done. The best bit was when about half a dozen of the England players were arm in arm during the Indian anthem as well. But they belted out GSTQ, as did their very healthy crew of friends and family, totalling 50 odd. Anya Shrubsole has the ball in her hand, running away from us at the Curtly Ambrose End. Taniya Bhatia is on strike. PLAY! Talking my own theory up here, but I hope Anya Shrubsole makes runs again later on. Reasons to be cheerful (if you’re English). ICYMI. Here is the report from the first semi, where Australia - led wonderfully by Meg Lanning, Rachael Haynes and Ellyse Perry - smashed the West Indies by 71 runs. The teams as selected. To be honest, I’m still coming to terms with the Mithali Raj news.Blimey, Mithali Raj isn’t playing. That’s remarkable. They’ve left out Mithali Raj and stuck with the same side that won last Saturday. I cannot believe this. Heather Knight confirms that England would have batted as well. They are also unchanged from their loss on Sunday night, so Danielle Hazell keeps her place ahead of Linsey Smith. We know that Australia will be playing in the decider on Saturday night after their emphatic 71-run victory over the West Indies, but who will join them: India or England? This blockbuster awaits here at Antigua.If you didn’t watch the first semi, the pitch is as slow as slow can be. It makes the task that much trickier for England’s top order against an Indian attack that thrives on taking pace off the ball as a starting point. There has to be at least some chance that Mark Robinson and Heather Knight play all four spinners as a consequence. If they stick with three, the decision looks to be between left-arm orthodox newcomer Linsey Smith or veteran off-spinner Danielle Hazell. We’ll find out at the toss. As for India, they have been by some margin the best batting team in this tournament, making it out of the group stage without losing a game, or without a side coming close for that matter. More good news for the Indian side is that veteran champion Mithali Raj is back in the side tonight having missed their win over Australia due to ilness or injury - we never really got to the bottom of it once and for all. But she’s in tonight.Stick with the OBO over the next few hours. I suspect, one way or another, this will be a fascinating struggle. And I use that word intentionally. It’s going to be a scrap. As ever, hit me up on the email or on twitter. I’ll be back with the toss and teams shortly."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/982e76aec65af11bf67f4acaab38e806e684fe20/74_0_2237_1342/master/2237.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=574ef70bb0281be726c1f5f8657e49d6","title":"mike bartlett does brexit britain need a new christmas carol","story":"We must open our shut-up hearts and embrace Dickens’ classic tale of festive spirit overcoming social and generational ideMost writers I know aspire to be – and to be perceived as – masters of their craft. We like to imagine ourselves following a precise vision, expertly choosing the ideal words, subjects and themes. But the real writing “process” for most of us is more unplanned, instinctive and, at times, random: often you intend to create one piece of work only to accidentally produce something entirely different. What you want to write, and what other people think you might have written, can be at odds.A few weeks ago, I was sent an email concerning publicity for my new play Snowflake, which is about to open in Oxford. At some point, a subtitle had been added: “A Christmas Carol for Brexit Britain”. That didn’t sound like the play I’d written. But clearly someone had found that in it. What did it even mean? What did Dickens know about Brexit?I had intended to write a family drama about a desperate father waiting for his estranged daughter to come home on Christmas Eve. It was a tight two-hander (suiting the budgetary constraints of a small studio venue), set in the shadow of that potent subject of contemporary familial conflict: Brexit. But as I wrote, the characters began to misbehave. I’ve learned from experience that, although it can be a little worrying at first, this deviation is something to be cultivated. It’s the moment the characters reject your artificial manipulation and come to life.Into my carefully constructed two-hander walked an unexpected third character. Suddenly my domestic miniature was more about wider isions in our society, the contrasts of class, race and generation. It was depicting how memories of the past can haunt our visions for the future. It became about whether we’re living in the best or worst of times (as Dickens almost wrote in a different book). About whether we’re able to change, to reach out and bridge the gaps between us. And about how Christmas offers a strange, kitsch, magical moment when those things might be possible.I did some research (the official writer’s term for procrastination) and discovered that Dickens’ story also began life as something very different. A Christmas Carol was originally intended to be a political pamphlet titled “An Appeal to the People of England, on behalf of the Poor Man’s Child”. Seeing inequality and ision all around him, Dickens wanted desperately to convince the establishment to reflect and reach out to the have-nots. In the end, he abandoned the pamphlet and decided on a work of fiction, writing to a contemporary: “You will certainly feel that a sledge hammer has come down with twenty times the force – twenty thousand times the force – I could exert by following out my first idea”.That realisation – that people often respond to stories and emotion far more strongly than facts and analysis – feels even more valid today. The drama of A Christmas Carol is in the collision of a ided society: on one side, an ageing, wealthy capitalist on the other, a young, working-class family. The emotion is in the idea that, with a lot of soul-searching (and some supernatural intervention), those two sides could end up sharing a Christmas meal. To quote Scrooge’s nephew Fred, Christmas is “a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant time the only time I know of, in the long calendar of the year, when men and women seem by one consent to open their shut-up hearts”.If Snowflake has shades of A Christmas Carol, they’re accidental. But in whatever world we find ourselves on 30 March, both the leavers and remainers may well need that Dickensian lesson: reach out, be prepared to change, open our shut-up hearts."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b54857c8419e1655dc6fb6e2ef8e7c9aa8476749/138_139_4202_2522/master/4202.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8c3fc41036224b7e2549df3641776f9e","title":"the knot a wedding dance like no other in pictures","story":"In her new touring show, the Dutch choreographer Didy Veldman invites the audience to a wedding.

Will a new laptop costing £200 or an old MacBook do the job?My eight-year-old daughter uses a computer at school, and she has asked for one for Christmas so she can do her projects at home. I am a single parent on a real tight budget so I’d prefer something for £150 or maybe £200 at a push. I was looking at a Lenovo but was told there was not a lot of space on it, and it would soon fill up, especially if she played a few games as well.Is there something you could recommend?I have been given a really old Apple MacBook – I think it’s from 2013. Is that worth wiping clean for her? SueThe key question is: what software does your daughter need in order to do projects at home? Can you get a copy? Some educational software only runs on one platform, and there is not much point in buying a laptop that doesn’t run it.In general, I expect most children create projects in Microsoft Office – which is free for educational use – or Google’s free online equivalent Google Docs, Sheets and Slides. Microsoft’s OneNote is particularly popular in schools.If that’s the case, your child should be able to do everything online. In other words, she can log on with a Microsoft account and then create and save all her files in the online OneDrive, or log on with a Google account and create and save files in the online Google Drive. (Remember to back them up to a USB thumb-drive or SD card.)And if she can do everything in a browser, it doesn’t much matter which type of system she uses. It can be a Windows or Linux laptop or desktop, a MacBook or a Chromebook.There is some advantage to using a familiar system, so you could find out what your daughter uses in school, and buy the same type of device. Most British schools use Windows laptops, and some use Chromebooks. Windows laptops are more capable and more versatile, but they require much more management, in terms of installing updates and cleaning up storage space.Chromebooks can do most of the things young children – and some adults – need, but there are drawbacks. For example, some eight-year-olds are getting into Minecraft. There are versions that run on a wide variety of systems, but modern Chromebooks are limited to running the Android version of Minecraft from the Play Store.Most new Chromebooks are capable of running Android apps, but older machines may not be.If you have a 2013 MacBook Air or MacBook Pro, then it should still be capable of doing the things young children – and most adults – need. Apple fitted machines with fourth- and fifth-generation Core i5 chips in 2013. If your MacBook has an Intel Core i5-4258U or similar processor, it will be faster than most of the cheap Windows laptops sold today. It will also have a better keyboard and screen.To find out what kind of MacBook you have, go to the Apple menu and select About this Mac. Select the serial number in the popup box, copy it (Cmd+C), and paste it (Cmd+V) into Apple’s “Check Coverage” page. EveryMac is also an invaluable source of details about all types of Mac.If your free MacBook has an Intel Core i5 or i7 processor, it’s well worth using. If it has Intel’s older Core 2 Duo chip, you could sell it on eBay or a similar site. It could make a significant difference to your budget. Of course, you should remove any personal data first, if whoever gave it you didn’t do this already. (They should have.)You were probably warned against buying a Windows laptop with only 2GB of memory and 32GB of storage. If so, I echo that advice. These cheap, minimum-spec devices work quite well for casual use as netbooks where you do everything online. However, sooner or later you will run out of storage space and need to plug in an external hard drive to do Windows updates.In my view, 4GB of memory is the minimum sensible specification for both Windows laptops and Chromebooks, and 64GB of storage is the minimum for Windows laptops. (If I’m buying, I go for 8GB and at least 128GB.)Screen size is more a matter of personal choice. Mainstream laptops usually have 15.6in screens and are fine for use around the house. More portable laptops tend to have screens between 10in and 14in, with 11.6in and 14in being popular compromises.With Black Friday coming up, you may be able to pick up a bargain. I have not done an exhaustive search, but some models I would have mentioned are already out of stock, or have now increased in price.The best budget laptop I can find at the moment is the 14in Lenovo Ideapad 120S, which costs £149.98 at eBuyer. This has 4GB of memory, 64GB of storage, and the previously mentioned Pentium N4200 processor. A search for 81A5007KUK finds that Lenovo is selling this machine for £279.99.Prices vary, of course, but you should be able to find the right sort of spec on your budget. And if you miss Black Friday, prices are often cheaper in the DecemberJanuary sales.Whichever system you buy, you should be the administrator while your daughter should have a limited Child account. This enables you to control what she does, and in Windows, makes her more secure.Microsoft provides instructions on setting up a Child account, though Windows Central’s version has screen shots that make it easier to follow.Apple has instructions on how to set up an Apple ID for your child, while Macworld does it with screenshots and safety tips.There are also third-party parental control programs for Windows and MacOS, including free ones. You can use these with standard (not administrator) accounts instead of child accounts.For Chromebooks, see Google’s Sign your child in on their Chromebook, using an account created with Family Link.Google says the information it collects “won’t be used to personalise ads for children under 13 (or the applicable age in your country)”. In most European countries, children have to be 16+ to have their own Google account, but the UK defaults to the US age, which is 13+.This may be more complicated if you comply with data protection regulations, which weren’t around when I last set up child accounts. Back then, I didn’t use real names or ages either.Have you got a question?

Others who took part in auditions for the job included Victoria Derbyshire, Samira Ahmed and Nick Robinson.If Bruce, who has occasionally hosted the BBC News at Six and BBC News at Ten bulletins, takes the job she could be forced to give up some of her other presenting roles, such as the art programme Fake or Fortune. The 54-year-old has spent her entire journalistic career at the BBC and previously hosted shows such as Crimewatch.She currently earns between £180,000 and £189,999 a year from the BBC and if she takes the job the corporation would be under pressure to ensure she received the same as Dimbleby.His current salary is unknown because the programme is made by the independent production company Mentorn Media, which means it was exempt from rules forcing the BBC to disclose the income of its leading presenters.Dimbleby has hosted Question Time, which is never far from the headlines, since 1994. The programme, filmed in a different UK city every week, has become a focal point for debates over the BBC’s coverage of politics and the key issues of national debate.In 2009 there was controversy after the far-right BNP’s leader, Nick Griffin, was invited to appear on the panel, while regular appearances by Ukip’s Nigel Farage prompted scrutiny of its guests’ political backgrounds from those who were convinced the show’s bookers showed political bias.The BBC has been regularly forced to defend even minor aspects of the programme and it was an early pioneer of political debate on Twitter, with clips of audience questions and politicians’ answers regularly going viral. This was not always for complimentary reasons – the complexion of some of those asking questions gave birth to the insult “gammon” to describe an angry ruddy-faced, white middle-aged man.Question Time is pre-recorded in the early evening to enable audiences to make their way home. Guests are then invited to stay on afterwards in the host town, with the programme often followed by a boozy dinner for all panel members.Dimbleby, who has only missed one programme in 24 years after being kicked by a bullock on his East Sussex farm, was due to present his final show on 13 December.The 80-year-old also hosted the BBC’s coverage of the last 10 general elections, although he was expected to hand over to Huw Edwards for the next national vote. However, this week a BBC spokesperson would not confirm whether Edwards would present the coverage in the event of a snap general election."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d9f8651d18769aa98bc4cfbe1d7d4ba89e728a4d/0_533_7952_4771/master/7952.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b289af27539a69a870b17bf3c8d43ede","title":"blog i now appreciate something i have masculine strengths that i should be proud of","story":"Alexi Duggins has spent seven weeks trying to become a better man (and writing about it along the way). As he hangs up his blogging boots, what has he learned?I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about men over the past few weeks. I’ve fixated on men with peachy soft faces, dreamt about charismatic men, and let my mind linger over men who have chiselled their rock-hard bodies into muscular perfection. With the amount of time I’ve devoted to my idea of the perfect man, my recent marriage to a woman is looking like a waste of a potentially killer Grindr profile.For seven weeks, I’ve been trying to figure out what being a man means to me. The way that I’ve done that is by immersing myself in the accumulated learnings of the experts on male identity who contributed to Philips’ What Makes a Man campaign. I’ve tried stepping away from ideas of toxic masculinity and embraced being kind to myself. I’ve wrestled with the idea of what other people think of me. And so rigorously did I research appropriate techniques for working out that I ended up chafing my bum bone with poorly executed sit-ups. I know: I’m a pro.In the past, I haven’t felt comfortable thinking of myself as a man. I often didn’t think that I fitted into society’s idea of masculinity, what with my penchant for board games and immersive theatre not exactly putting me into the same category of maleness as Jason Statham (I know, hard to believe from those rugged photos of me). Frankly, I wasn’t even sure that I was mature enough to count as a man.I’ve learned something over the past few weeks, though: I’m actually fairly far down the road to being a man. The main reason I say that? I’ve had an important realisation: I’m totally comfortable with myself. Obviously, to an extent, I’ve always known this. I mean, I wouldn’t stealthily unfollow myself on Facebook, cross the road to avoid me or invent an excuse to avoid chatting to myself at a party. I think I’m an OK kind of guy.But as I spent a week practising the art of kindfulness – ie trying to be kind to yourself in a soothingly mindful manner – I started to think more about the way I treat myself. And I began to realise that I actually already did quite a lot of the recommendations of kindfulness: ie to not be hard on yourself and to accept yourself as you are.A few weeks later, it was time for me to try out exercise routines to see what suited me. And, frankly, I just didn’t want to do anything that approached most people’s idea of exercise: no thrusting, squatting or practising getting out of bed (or sit-ups or whatever they’re called). No matter what the benefits for giving me a rock hard tum-tum, I didn’t want to do them, and I realised that I was totally comfortable with just saying: “Nope. That’s not me. Not gonna do that.”And, frankly, that made me appreciate something: I do actually have some masculine strengths that I should be proud of. Even though more stereotypically manly types might know their way around a monkey wrench, that doesn’t make them good at the bits that involve pouring your feelings out of your mouth-hole. Which puts them on roughly the same footing as me, who has to chant, “Lefty loosey, righty tighty” whenever I’m within a five-foot radius of a screwdriver, but who feels totally comfortable expressing himself.I’m totally cool with being me. And you know what?

Earl Forlales, 23, a graduate in material science engineering, took inspiration from the bamboo hut his grandparents lived in outside Manilla.Forlales was awarded first prize by the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) for his house, known as Cubo, for its use of low-cost, sustainable material, and the speed at which it could be constructed.John Hughes, the competition head judge and Rics president, said: “The world’s cities are growing all the time and there is a real need to make sure they are safe, clean and comfortable places to live for future generations.“There were many exciting, original designs among the submissions. However, Earl’s idea stood out for its simple yet well thought through solution to the world’s growing slum problem.“As we look at our entrants, who are our next generation of leaders, I believe that real progress will be made in tackling the world’s biggest issues.”News doesn\u0027t always have to be bad – indeed, the relentless focus on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame risks convincing the public that the world is hopeless and there is nothing we can do.This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@theForlales has already identified a suitable area of land to start building his Cubo houses. He plans to begin work next year with experts from the Rics in an attempt to help relieve the huge pressures on housing in Manila, where a third of the 12 million population live in slums.He said: “This is a huge step forward to helping the people of Manila. The state of housing in the city is at crisis point, and will undoubtedly get worse with this new influx of workers.“Cubo started as nothing more than an idea, conceived while spending time at my grandparent’s house – it is incredible to think that it now will become a reality.“I would like to thank Rics for the opportunity to develop the idea, and look forward to working with them to put this money to good use in Manila, and then hopefully elsewhere around the world.”The Cities for our Future competition launched in January 2018 aiming to find practical solutions to problems that the world’s cities face. There were more than 1,200 entries, which were narrowed down to 12 finalists, who were given a mentor from the Rics to help them develop their idea over several months. The final judging took place this month.Dr Beth Taylor, a competition judge and the chair of the UK National Commission for Unesco, said: “One of the reasons Earl’s entry stood out from the other finalists was through its use of traditional, sustainable technologies and materials, to solve an issue facing modern cities across the world.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3707217.1542904949!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"conor pope black friday deals","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBlack Friday  was brought to this part of the world by the Walmart-owned Asda in 2013 and by everyone else a year later. Photograph: Rob StothardGetty ImagesBlack Friday did not exist here five years ago but it has been embraced with so much gusto by so many shoppers and retailers since 2014 that well in excess of €50m will be spent in the days ahead by Irish consumers with a keen eye on price.The notion was born in the United States where it makes some sense as it falls on the day after Thanksgiving Day when most Americans have a day off. It is called Black Friday for one of two reasons – either because it was the day retailers moved from trading in the red to trading in the black or because the streets were black with people seeking out bargains. Take your pick.It was brought to this part of the world by the Walmart-owned Asda in 2013 and by everyone else a year later. You might buy into the idea or it might repulse you but either way avoiding Black Friday is almost impossible.Some Black Friday sales started in Ireland last week and everyone from Argos to ...\u0026nbsp – because Zara doesn’t appear to have any class of sale we can’t go all the way to Z – promising discounts of anywhere between 20 and 70 per cent.All Saints: The super-hip clothes retailer has a pleasingly simple offering and is offering “30 per cent off everything”. Its website is also promising free delivery on orders of over €150.Amazon:  Technically, this online retailer should be focussing on its Cyber Monday sale but it has not been found wanting in the Black Friday stakes and has been releasing deals tagged with those two words for days now. The Kindles and Echoes are selling with discounts of up to 40 per cent while the deals of the day are worth checking out as some products appear to have enormous discounts.Ancestry.ie: Getting someone the means to trace who they are and where they come from might make for a novel gift. Using a simple saliva test you can do at home, you can find out more about your identity and possible relatives, some of whom you may not have even known existed. The test surveys your entire genome at over 700,000 locations and the results provide a prediction of the locations of your ancestors from 26 separate worldwide populations. From now until next Monday, Ancestry DNA kits are down to €55 from €95.Argos: Argos has been running Black Friday deals for days now and they are still coming thick and fast. There is a sim free Samsung Galaxy S8 which did cost €780 that is now selling for €480 which is not too shabby. A rose gold Fitbit Charges which had a retail price of €190 can now be bought in the shop for €130. It is, however worth pointing out that – as with many other retailers – questions should always be asked about the pricing. While the Galaxy may have cost €780, it can also be found selling for around €500 in multiple locations outside of sale periods, suggesting that the discounting is not quite as profound as it might appear.Arnotts:  is not having a Black Friday sale. It is however having a Christmas Mega Event which sees 20 per cent knocked off most of its stock. There are a whole lot of impressive deals to be found on the shop floor and if you find you can’t wait until the Winter Sales which start in four or five weeks, now might be the time to shop there.Boots: If you are in the market for knockdown fragrances, then Boots is definitely worth a look with many recognisable brands selling with as much as 50 per cent off. We are not entirely sure why Boots - the Chemist - is selling Soda Streams but the Black Friday price of €49.99 is a lot less than the full price of €125.99 they list. The Fitbit Charge €105 - a saving of €30 - it is also €30 cheaper than the Argos sale price although it is the regular black rubber version.Brown Thomas: Just like Arnotts, BT has turned its nose up at Black Friday and is instead having a pre-Christmas sale which lasts until midnight on Monday. There is a dizzying array of high end bags, glad rags and all manner of other stuff on offer and if you are in the market for a swish Christmas present than now might be as good a time as any to buy it there.Copeland, Louis: The most famous tailor in Ireland is offering discounts from Friday to Sunday and customers in the market for a suit or some class of smart casual wear can look forward to 20 per cent discounts.CurriesPC World:  Not so much a Black Friday “event”, but a Black Tag one. There are some great deals on offer here. There’s €250 of a 50” LG TV. Laptops, fitness trackers, speakers and a whole lot more have also been substantially discounted.Debenhams:  This retailer is running a Black Friday Spectacular with “12 days of amazing deals” – last year there were only seven days of amazing deals if memory serves us correctly. Offers will come and go each day until Monday. When we checked on Wednesday the best deals – up to 50 per cent – were to be found in women’s clothes and children’s toys. There were also big savings to be made in the Craghopper outdoor wear brand.DID: This retailer is promising discounts of as much as 70 per cent – and if you are in need of a big ticket item and can cut the price by that amount then now will definitely be the time to buy.Eurocamp.ie: You will struggle to find a better value family holiday than a camping one. Eurocamp is promising people some early summer sun for as little as €20 per party, per night in dozens of campsites across Europe. The cheapest deals are to be found from the start of May next year to the May 24th with the prices rising in the selected sites to €40 per party, per night between 25th May and 30th June, 2019.Elverys: The sports shop is running a buy one, get one half price set of deals until the close of business on Monday.Gutter Bookshop: No Black Friday deals but – arguably – a more important message which the bookshop posted on Twitter yesterday. “Ok, as #BlackFriday frenzy starts, please remember that local independent shops can’t afford to half-price their stock right before Christmas. Try to keep a bit of money back to support local too - they pay taxes, employ staff \u0026amp they make our towns nicer places to be! #ShopLocal.”Harvey Norman: Harvey Norman is rarely found wanting when it comes to the sales stakes so it is hardly a surprise that it is taking Black Friday very seriously. It is offering up to 30 per cent off TVs, as much as €400 off laptops, up to 50 per cent off tables and chairs and mattresses and up to 60 per cent off bedroom furniture. It is also promising to price-match its competitors.Lidl:  We like the look of the Lidl Black Friday sale which – weirdly – actually starts on Friday. The Nutribullets for €50 are very good value for money and are, Lidl say, half price. We have seen them selling for less than €100 elsewhere although never as cheap as €50. The weird looking heated shoulder pads are also half price down from €20 to €10. We also like the look of the 50” Philips smart tellies for €400 - down from €549.Littlewood’s Ireland: Maybe this retailer should change its name to Hugewoods because it is promising “huge deals” on large amounts of stock. There are pages and pages of deals to scroll through so if you’re in the market for bargains you should probably have a look here.Mothercare: Babies are many things but cheap is not one of them so anything that can be done to take the sting out of the costs it to be welcomed. Mothercare’s Black Friday sale started earlier this week and runs until Monday. The Quinny Moodd 3 Piece Bundle is now €705, a saving of €359, the Comb AxissFix Plus Car Seat is €329, down from €499.99 and the Tommee Tippee Complete Feeding set is now €69.99, a discount of €130. There are also big discounts on toys and clothes for babies and their mammies.O’Brien’s Wine: Chances are there will be some wine drunk across Ireland over the weeks ahead which is why the O’Briens Wine Black Friday sale is so timely There are offers on over 200 Christmas wines, bubbles and spirits.Peter Mark:  This is an area which leaves us mystified, to be honest. But €30 off the Original Mark IV ghd stylers, €25 off select ghd stylers and €25 off the incredible L’Oréal Steampod and DAFNI heated hairbrushes in salons nationwide and online might be enough to pique your interest.Ryanair:  The airline is celebrating Cyber Week with new deals being rolled out each day. When we checked on Wednesday we could have got to either Rotterdam or Manchester for €7.99.Smyths Toys: Although Irish parents are fortunate that Santa Claus takes care of many of the gifts which will be found under Christmas trees across the land this year, this retailer will probably still be quite busy in the run up to the big day. A Barbie Dream House which once cost €300 now costs €240 and there are also a lot of discounted Lego products and FIFA 19 style game available. There is a tenner off Hatchamils – which if memory serves us correctly – was the must have present a year or two ago.South William Clinic and Spa: This Dublin city spa has range of offers across treatments and gift sets but what struck us as a real bargain were the gift cards. You can buy a €100 gift card for €59 or a €500 gift card for €269.Tayto Park:  Season tickets to Tayto Park are being sold with a €50 discount on Friday.TUI: The tour operator is promising discounts of €50 per booking on short and mid-haul package holidays or an extra €100 discount per booking on holidays to Mexico.Virgin Mobile: RED is apparently the new black at Virgin Media as it continues with 12 days’ offers up to November 26th. Virgin Media TV and broadband customers can get four months free unlimited 4G data, calls and texts on a 30-day SIM only contract, a saving of €100. Non Virgin Media customers who sign up to Broadband, TV and Phone bundles from €59 for 12 months can get a free 32” LG smart TV."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Varadkar \u0026lsquogoing around the place like Santa Claus at the moment\u0026rsquo, claims FFPostmortems awaited but carbon monoxide regarded as likely cause of deathsThe organisation has been contacted by over a dozen victims since abuse revelationsS\u0026eacuteamus Woulfe addresses Lawyers Against Homelessness event in DublinTorrid time: Stormont\u0026rsquos collapse, Brexit, RHI scandal \u0026ndash and Foster\u0026rsquos leadership in questionUS concept is here to stay, but consumers warned not to assume prices are rock bottom\u0026lsquoI remember the bones in my face cracking and the blood rushing, I was in agony and could hardly move,\u0026rsquo victim tells courtDUP says \u0026lsquoaspirational\u0026rsquo document drafted to mitigate the damage of withdrawal deal21-year-old was from Co Longford and played for local GAA clubHigh court told they worked an average of 116 hours per week but are only paid an average of \u0026euro2.83 per hourPSNI are investigating the death at a home in Devenagh Court in Ballymena, Co AntrimHousing committee is told students will not end up pursuing their first choice if it is in Dublin, Cork or GalwayRugby coach Patrick Young had told court allegation of headbutting \u0026lsquoa total fabrication\u0026rsquoPaschal Donohoe unable to give exact time when all affected will receive compensationOfficials have recouped \u0026euro42.1m out of \u0026euro110m that was paid out in error or after fraudThe incident occurred this morning at Lismanny, Laurencetown, Ballinasloe\u0026lsquoJohnny taxpayer\u0026rsquo is being forced to pay for unnecessary inductions, conference hearsPolicing Authority says more proof needed to show all homicides investigated properlyBord Plean\u0026aacutela says development requires planning permission, overturning council decisionMedevac flights in Athlone area may be at risk of collision due to amateur enthusiasts"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3706749.1542882733!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"national broadband plan everything you need to know","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDenis Naughten: An independent audit found the National Broadband Plan has not been fatally undermined by private meetings the former minister for communications  had with the sole remaining bidder. Photograph: Cyril ByrneWhat is happening with the National Broadband Plan (NBP)?  It hasn’t been abandoned, that’s what. An independent audit of the process has found that it has not been fatally undermined by private meetings the former minister for communications Denis Naughten had with David McCourt, the Irish-American businessman who is leading the sole remaining bidder for the contract. That report has not been published yet, but reports say it has given the process the go-ahead. It’s expected the full report will be published later this week or early next week.So what happens now? The tender for the project, submitted by the group led by McCourt, is being assessed by officials in the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment. It is reportedly 20,000 pages long and the assessment process involves examination by legal and technical experts. The Government expects to be in a position to make a decision on the awarding of the contract within a few weeks.Who are the other bidders? There aren’t any.Really? Other bidders, including telecoms company Eir and a consortium involving the ESB, all dropped out, leaving McCourt’s bid as the only one.If there’s only one bidder, isn’t that likely to push up the price? This is one of the fears – though there are others – in Government. The original estimates for the cost to the exchequer of the programme were in the region of €500 million. However, Government sources have told The  that the estimated costs for the project have ballooned – with some fearing the final cost could be as high as €3 billion. This has caused alarm in the Department of Finance, whose job it is to be alarmed about these things. These estimates have been disputed by industry figures, but they are the sort of sums that have featured in discussions on the broadband plan in Government.Is that for the entire country? No. Most of the country is covered – or will be covered – by commercial operators. The National Broadband Plan is just for remote and rural areas that the commercial telcos won’t touch because they can’t make them pay. So the State has promised to step in and provide high-speed fibre-optic broadband for the remainder of the homes and premises in the country. There are about 540,000 homes and premises covered by the NBP.What are the other concerns? There are two principal ones. The first is that the take-up of broadband services when the network is built is highly uncertain. Many of the 540,000 houses desperately want broadband. But some of the houses are holiday homes. Some of them are unoccupied. Some of them are home to people who aren’t that interested in having broadband. Government sources point to the example of Eir, which has offered, it says, broadband to 200,000 rural homes so far. The take-up is about 14 per cent. Broadband campaigners say that the Eir service isn’t actually available for everyone, but even still, the take-up is pretty low. Some people in Government are worried that they are going to build this network at great expense and only a minority of people will use it. The second issue is the ownership of the network once it is built. Although the State will have paid for it, the actual network – the pipes and wires, etc – will be owned by the company that builds it.Will the Government swallow its reservations? It will have to decide in the coming weeks, once the legal and technical evaluation of the bid is completed by the Department of Communications. It is not obliged to accept the bid, but refusing it would mean the entire project goes back to square one. That would be a huge embarrassment to the Government, and a political hit in rural areas. The choice is between making a decision that many in Government to be financially unwise, and one that is politically unwise."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3706983.1542903059!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"another brexit document agreed what does this one mean","story":"British Prime Minister Theresa May said on Thursday (November 22) that a draft declaration on post-Brexit ties with the European Union had been agreed with the European Commission and that she would seal the deal on Sunday.\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritish Prime Minister Theresa May  outside  Downing Street, London on Thursday. Photograph: Andy RainEPAAnother Brexit document agreed ? What’s this one? The EU and UK have agreed a draft text on how their future relationship will look after Brexit. This follows the finalisation of the draft withdrawal agreement last week. Both documents will go to a summit of EU leaders on Sunday next, November 25th, for political approval. The withdrawal agreement, 580 pages of dense legal text, deals broadly with the terms on which the UK will part from the EU next March. The 26-page political declaration on the future relationship is the first step to sketching out how the two sides will relate in future, in trade, security and other areas. However the actual negotiation of this future relationship will only take place after the UK leaves the EU.But this all still depends on it getting through the House of Commons? Yes, it does. If Theresa May loses the House of Commons vote expected next month, then nobody is quite sure what happens next.The point is that neither the withdrawal agreement nor the declaration are agreed yet. As well as the UK vote, the European Parliament also needs to approve the deal and final sign-off by the EU council would not happen until close to departure date.What are the key points in the new political declaration? It aims for an ambitious future relationship, which could develop over time though points out that the UK cannot expect to retain the right of membership. The future trading relationship between the two sides will be as “close as possible” , it says and involve a “free-trade area” and “ deep regulatory and customs co-operation”. This is good news for Ireland, as the UK accounts for 13 per cent of our exports – and close to 40 per cent in the food sector – and more than 25 per cent of our imports and the less damage to these, the less the impact of Brexit on our economy.However t he UK will leave the EU trading bloc – and so whatever new arrangements are put in place are likely to lead to some level of cost for us. Trade will not be “frictionless” as it is now, in the jargon. However the promises to align the two trading blocs could limit border checks . And a commitment to have no tariffs would be good news for the food sector, as well as promise to maintain the same animal health regimes in the UK and EU. The document says the goal will be to minimise border bureaucracy.There will be years negotiating all this, assuming it is all agreed, which is far from certain given the state of UK politics. And in many areas the UK will face the same decision as it has faced all along – does it stay close to the EU in certain areas, but then accept the price of abiding by more and more rules and regulations set in Brussels.If the deal goes through, then a transition period kicks in next March when the UK leaves, meaning not much will change until the end of December 2020, except for the UK having no say around the EU table. This is to give time for talks on the details of the future relationship. We also learned on Wednesday that this transition can be extended “ for up to one or two years.” This means the transition could last until the end of 2022, though the Brexiteer lobby will see this as the UK being tied in to Europe for way too long.What about the Irish Border? While the withdrawal agreement largely dealt with the “orce” terms, it also included the much-discussed Irish Border backstop – the guarantee that no matter how the trade talks play out, there will be no hard Border on the island of Ireland.Ireland has said it is happy that this gives a solid guarantee, though the concept has proved hugely controversial as it would still probably involve some new checks on goods crossing from Britain into the North and leave the North more closely tied to EU rules.Previously the UK side had raised the prospect of technology and new processes such as special licences for big trading companies being used to avoid border checks. This was shot down in this discussions as not being a practical way to avoid a hard Border.The political declaration says that both sides agree that they will try to replace the backstop with alternative, permanent arrangements to avoid a hard Border, most likely via future trading arrangements. However the technology issue also resurfaces, with a commitment that “facilitative arrangements and technologies will also be considered in developing any alternative arrangements for ensuring the absence of a hard border on the island of Ireland on a permanent footing”.This could be presented to Brexiteers and the DUP as a way out of the backstop by Theresa May. However Ireland will point out that the original legal guarantee remains in the withdrawal agreement and that nobody has yet applied such technology anywhere else. With a joint EUUK committee overseeing the withdrawal agreement and various appeal mechanisms, the whole Border and backstop issue could be with us for many years to come, if this deal gets through.Anything else? The future relationship is not all about trade and so the declaration also includes sections on areas like foreign policy, security and defence co-operation, data protection, confronting illegal immigration and law enforcement . It deals with restrictions on freedom-of-movement between the EU and UK - pledging to try to protect holiday travel, but making clear new controls will be in place for longer-term stays. However for Ireland and the UK the common travel area will remain in place, meaning that Irish residents can continue to live and work in the UK and visa versa.So, in summary? There is a lot of aspiration in this document and a huge amount still to be negotiated after the UK leaves the EU, if this deal holds. However if it is voted down in the UK parliament then we will enter a new period of uncertainty about what happens next. All sides say they are intent on avoiding a “no deal” Brexit, but if the UK cannot accept this agreement, then fears will grow of this happening.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

File photgraph:  Ben Stansall GettyBritain and the European Union have agreed in principle on a text setting out their future relationship. The deal is pending endorsement by the bloc’s leaders at a summit on Sunday.Here are some key elements of the 26-page draft text. It is part of a package alongside the 500-page legal treaty, known as the withdrawal agreement, on Britain’s withdrawal from the EU.The EU and UK aim for “ambitious, broad, deep and flexible partnership across trade and economic cooperation, law enforcement and criminal justice, foreign policy, security... based on a balance of rights and obligations.”The EU and UK envisage “a trading relationship on goods that is as close as possible” and “comprehensive arrangements that will create a free trade area, combining deep regulatory and customs cooperation, underpinned by provisions ensuring a level playing field.”The EU and UK expect “no tariffs, fees, charges or quantitative restrictions across all sectors, with ambitious customs arrangements that ... build and improve on the single customs territory provided for in the Withdrawal Agreement, which obviates the need for checks on rules of origin.”The EU and UK want an “ambitious customs arrangements” “envisage making use of all available facilitative arrangements and technologies” and are ready to consider “mutual recognition of trusted traders’ programmes, administrative cooperation in customs matters and mutual assistance, including for the recovery of claims related to taxes and duties.”EU, UK want to safeguard financial stability and will try to conclude their equivalence assessments “before the end of June 2020.”New EU-UK agreement on fisheries would form part of the overall new relationship between the two. The sides aim to “conclude and ratify their new fisheries agreement by 1 July 2020.”“Provisions to ensure this should cover state aid, competition, social and employment standards, environmental standards, climate change, and relevant tax matters.”Separately, EU and UK would agree that the post-Brexit transition period could be extended once “for up to one or two years” and Britain would have to go on contributing to the bloc’s budget accordingly.The sides want to ensure “passenger and cargo air connectivity” and provisions to mutually protect intellectual property rights. They want to grant visa-free travel rights on mutual basis for short trips. - ReutersDeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches. See more here.

We will continue working to ensure that our economy is fully protected after Brexit”Now the deal has to be approved by the remaining 27 EU member states so that the separate withdrawal agreement, which outlines how Britain leaves the EU, can be ratified.The political declaration on the future relationship between the UK and EU was “agreed at negotiators’ level and agreed in principle at political level”, European Council president Donald Tusk said earlier today. “I have just sent to EU27 a draft political declaration on the future relationship between EU and UK. The commission president has informed me that it has been agreed at negotiators’ level and agreed in principle at political level, subject to the endorsement of the Leaders,” said Mr Tusk. British prime minister Theresa May said the agreement with the commission on the draft political framework represented the “right deal” for the UK. Speaking outside 10 Downing Street early on Thursday afternoon, she said: “This is the right deal for the UK. It delivers on the vote of the referendum, it brings back control of our borders, our money and our laws and it does so while protecting jobs, protecting our security and protecting the integrity of the United Kingdom.”Britain and the EU are to develop an “ambitious, broad, deep and flexible partnership”, according to a leaked version of the 26-page declaration on future relations that is due to be approved at a summit on Sunday.While Thursday’s developments are being hailed as a breakthrough, Mrs May is still struggling to get a separate 500-page withdrawal agreement through the House of Commons as she also fights to maintain her position following a string of cabinet resignations by hardline Conservative Brexiteers last week. Mrs May and European Commission president Jean-Claude Junckeron Wednesday evening provisionally agreed the bulk of a 26-page text that will form the final part of Britain’s exit package from the bloc. The draft covers everything from extensive trade liberalisation to “operational co-operation” between police forces.Sterling jumped more than 1 per cent to trade above €1.12 and $1.29 on the news, its biggest rise for three weeks.The draft falls short of Mrs May’s aspirations for “frictionless” trade in goods with the EU after Brexit. But its ambitious tone offers the PM significant help in Westminster as she prepares to sell the deal.“While it cannot amount to the rights or obligations of membership, the Parties are agreed that the future relationship should be approached with high ambition with regard to its scope and depth, and recognise that this might evolve over time”, states the draft. “Above all, it should be a relationship that will work in the interests of citizens of the Union and the United Kingdom, now and in the future.”On the contentious issue of the Border, the draft political declaration reportedly states that new “facilitative arrangements and technologies” will also be considered in developing any alternative arrangements for ensuring the absence of a permanent hard border. Earlier in the talks, the UK side had raised the issue of using technology and customs arrangements as a way of avoiding a hard border, with the necessary checks carried out without border checks. While the EU side dismissed this – noting the lack of working examples anywhere else in the world – the idea has been revived in recent days, as Mrs May seeks to bring the Brexiteer lobby on board. However, Ireland will rely on the the draft withdrawal agreement, finalised last week, which includes a legally-operable backstop arrangement – an insurance of no hard border – involving the whole of the UK staying in the customs union for a period, if this is needed to avoid a hard border. Irish sources have said that this guarantee remains in place, under the withdrawal agreement, unless and until a new way of avoiding a hard border emerges, most likely via new trading arrangements negotiated between the EU and UK after Brexit. Some parts of the Brexit package are still under negotiation, but EU diplomats say only a few manageable issues remain outstanding. Mrs May will now meet Mr Juncker again on Saturday to seek to finalise work on the declaration and so bring two years of sometimes fraught Brexit talks to a close.The publication of the draft follows two hours of talks in Brussels on Wednesday between Mrs May and Mr Jean-Claude Juncker aimed at paving the way for EU leaders to sign off the Brexit deal on Sunday.London’s FTSE 100 took a hit from the currency’s resurgence, which make UK exports less competitive and increase the cost of repatriating revenue earned abroad into sterling.

Photograph: PA WireTheresa May faced a hostile reception in the House of Commons on Thursday following the publication of the political declaration on the relationship between Britain and the European Union after Brexit. Brexiteer Conservatives and the DUP demanded that the Northern Ireland backstop should be dropped while pro-Europeans called for a second referendum.The prime minister said the withdrawal agreement and the political declaration represented a good deal for Britain, holding out the prospect of a unique relationship with the EU.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn described the political declaration as “26 pages of waffle” that could have been written two years ago. He said the only certainty contained within it was that the post-Brexit transition period would have to be extended or Britain would end up with a backstop and no exit.\u0026nbsp“It represents the worst of all worlds: no say over the rules that will continue to apply and no certainty for the future. There is no change to the withdrawal agreement, no unilateral pull-out mechanism, no concessions on the backstop, which would create a new regulatory border down the Irish Sea,” he said.Mrs May pointed to the document’s commitment to consider “facilitative arrangements and technologies” to keep the Irish Border open. She had hoped to win over eurosceptics such as former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith with the prospect of an alternative to the backstop. But Mr Duncan Smith said he was still unable to support the deal.“The reality is that this is not the withdrawal agreement, and the withdrawal agreement will make it very clear that should we, even under these terms, struggle with a negotiation for a free trade arrangement and not complete that process, we will fall into the Northern Ireland backstop as it exists at the moment. That means that we will be bound by those restrictions that force Northern Ireland into a separate arrangement and us into the customs union,” he said.DUP chief whip Jeffrey Donaldson said the backstop would be bad for the British economy as well as for the union and he called on the prime minister to press the EU to abandon it if she wanted his party’s support for the deal.“It is now clear that the EU is beginning to accept that there are alternative arrangements that can be put in place without the need for the backstop. I say to the prime minister that if she wants to have the support of my party for the withdrawal agreement, we need to see an end of the backstop and those alternative arrangements put in place,” he said.Former foreign secretary Boris Johnson and former Brexit secretary Dominic Raab spoke against the deal, but it also came under fire from pro-Europeans such as former education secretary Justine Greening. “I do not believe that this is a good deal for Britain and I do not think that many young people in our country think that this is a good deal for Britain at all. Does the prime minister accept that, if the meaningful vote is lost, and if this House votes also against exiting the EU with no deal, the only right option then is to go back to the people and allow them to have a final say?” she said.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

urged pull adverts tech giants hosting extremism","story":"Police and emergency services respond to Manchester Arena terror attackBusinesses have been urged to pull their advertising from tech firms that fail to take down extremist content following an investigation into five terror attacks that claimed 36 lives.The Intelligence and Security Committee (ISC) said social media firms’ and messaging apps’ continued refusal to remove extremist material meant it was time to hit their “bottom line” by persuading businesses to boycott them.It said the Government should take a lead role in persuading companies to follow the example of Unilever which has announced it is considering withdrawing its advertising from firms like Facebook and Google for failing to act responsibly.Last night, however, Sajid Javid, the home secretary refused to immediately endorse a boycott, saying he would respond to the committee “in due course.”Instead, he pointed to proposed new laws that would allow terror threats to be disrupted earlier and to curb online extremism through new offences of viewing or streaming extremist material.2005 - 2017 | Terror attacks in the UK“We are also ensuring technology companies play their part by stopping terrorists from exploiting their platforms,” he said.In its report yesterday on the terrorist attacks, the ISC revealed an MI5 assessment showed “almost all attack planners downloaded, shared or consumed radical and extremist media of some kind.”Salman Abedi, the Manchester Arena bomber who killed 22 people including children, had also been able to manufacture his improvised explosive devices from online videos.“Action that affects their profits hits home harder than any sense of ‘doing the right thing’, and it is this that the Government should focus its efforts on.The committee highlighted cases where tech firms had refused to remove extremist content or co-operate despite Government requests, often citing the right of their customers to privacy as “trumping other considerations.”In one, an unnamed tech firm claimed the “violent and disturbing images” linked back to an academic site and to remove it “would compromise the quality of analysis the site owner provides.” Another refused to take down the website of a banned terrorist group.WhatsApp cited its “end to end encryption” for not revealing to police the final messages of  Westminster attacker Khalid Masood who stabbed PC Keith Palmer to death.The committee said it had been among the first to castigate the social media firms for failing to be more proactive in hunting down and removing extremist material rather than relying on users, organisations or police to alert them to it.But that was, four years ago after the terrorist murder of Fusilier Lee Rigby.Although the firms have hired more moderators to assess material, the committee was frustrated that they continued in many cases to be used as a “safe haven” for extremists and terrorists.Searching the internet for “how to make a bomb” returned almost 2m results and a search for “beheading video” returned 250,000 hits in a study five years ago - and it was likely to have increased since.Although the tech firms were developing algorithms to track down terrorist material and alert police to it, the MPs said: “It is disappointing that - despite a great deal of engagement - little tangible progress has been made in the four years...and the scale of the challenge remains significant.”The criticism was backed last night by Yvette Cooper, chair of the home affairs select committee, who this week wrote to Twitter, demanding to know why extremist material from a proscribed far right group was still available on its site.“It is frankly outrageous that these internet giants continue to profit off dangerous content, which we know can have fatal consequences,” she told The Daily .“These companies have been asked repeatedly to develop better systems to remove illegal material and have failed to do so. It is not good enough.”“Given the vast scale of this content, law enforcement and intelligence agencies are simply not equipped to tackle this issue alone. Social media companies must immediately take responsibility for dealing with extremist and illegal materials on their sites.”Senior counter terror officers said they had struggled to get quality data out of the tech giants for years. “They simply don’t get it, so to take action that affects their advertising revenues would be the best thing to do,” said one ex-counter terror chief.Tom Winsor, HM Inspector of ConstabularySir Tom Winsor, HM chief inspector of constabulary, told the : “I agree with our law enforcement agencies when they say it’s indefensible for internet companies to invest so much money in protecting data from law enforcement.  There is a handful of very large companies with a highly dominant influence over how the internet is used. In too many respects, their record is poor and their reputation tarnished.“If a burglar was arrested with a book in his or her back pocket with all the names of all their contacts on it, the police would have access to that book. What is the difference with a phone? There is no difference in principle.  And yet, these companies are resistant to allowing the police access to the data criminals put on their devices.“The steps these companies take to make sure their services cannot be abused by terrorists, paedophiles and organised criminals are inadequate the commitment they show and their willingness to be held to account are questionable.”Body found in search for missing journalistUK donates £50m to African-led programmes fighting FGMWomen heart attack patients twice as likely to die in hospital as condition is seen as a \u0026#39male disease\u0026#39Smart meter roll out could cost households an extra £100 and means homeowners won\u0026#39t feel the benefit for five years, NAO report warns Hit squads sent into over 100 jails to seize drugs, phones and dronesComment: Emiratis must free student quickly as UK and UAE can ill afford a riftJeremy Hunt blamed over student jailed in the UAE as sources say he was warned against Saudi tripComment: Cabinet Brexiteers are gambling on a managed No Deal – and there\u0026#39s a good chance their bet will pay offBrussels warns fish and chips at risk unless Britain caves to EU fishing demandsTheresa May told to \u0026#39junk\u0026#39 the backstop as Brexit deal opposed by half of Tory backbenchersMan who \u0026#39groomed\u0026#39 British couple into supplying parts for Iran\u0026#39s nuclear programme jailed Prince William kicks down a wall of ision at the Football for Peace graduation ceremony Prince Charles says Britain must \u0026#39eliminate throwaway society\u0026#39 as Black Friday boycott is urged Scottish Tory MP who ousted Angus Robertson warns he will find it \u0026#39very difficult\u0026#39 to back Brexit deal MoD lifts axe on three Royal Navy patrol ships to boost UK fisherman in scallop wars Animal rights activists demand Wool village change its nameHonouring the military animals ‘who also serve’ Donald Trump says US troops on border could use \u0026#39lethal force\u0026#39 against migrants if necessaryHillary Clinton says Europe must limit immigration to stop rise of Right-wing populismBritish university staff boycott Dubai campus as MPs say military should no longer train UAE forces The Brexit Political Declaration: what it says, what it meansWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/11/22/TELEMMGLPICT000180851819_1_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=4","title":"emiratis must free student quickly countries can afford rift","story":"Abu Dhabi\u0026#39s Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan with Foreign Minister Jeremy HuntBased on the evidence so far collected by British officials, it appears that Matthew Hedges, the British student who has been jailed for life on spying charges in the United Arab Emirates, is guilty of little more than being extremely naive.A PhD student at Durham University, Mr Hedges, 31, was apparently conducting research into the Emirati military, intelligence and security services when he was detained and accused of spying.His arrest was prompted after he had interviewed a senior Emirati official who became concerned at his line of questioning, and tipped off the authorities.

He brought in the Attwaters to try and hide the smuggling operation further and they shipped dual-use parts, including those that they knew were restricted under Weapons of Mass Destruction controls, through their company.Simon York, Director, Fraud Investigation Service, HMRC, said: “These three sold banned items that ended up in Iran. They didn’t care what these parts might be used for, as long as they got paid.“This was a calculated and cynical attempt to undermine strict trade embargoes and internationally agreed controls.”HMRC estimates that George made profits of more than £5 million and action to recover the money, under the Proceeds of Crime Act, will now follow.Body found in search for missing journalistUK donates £50m to African-led programmes fighting FGMWomen heart attack patients twice as likely to die in hospital as condition is seen as a \u0026#39male disease\u0026#39Smart meter roll out could cost households an extra £100 and means homeowners won\u0026#39t feel the benefit for five years, NAO report warns Hit squads sent into over 100 jails to seize drugs, phones and dronesComment: Emiratis must free student quickly as UK and UAE can ill afford a riftJeremy Hunt blamed over student jailed in the UAE as sources say he was warned against Saudi tripComment: Cabinet Brexiteers are gambling on a managed No Deal – and there\u0026#39s a good chance their bet will pay offBrussels warns fish and chips at risk unless Britain caves to EU fishing demandsTheresa May told to \u0026#39junk\u0026#39 the backstop as Brexit deal opposed by half of Tory backbenchersBusinesses urged to pull adverts from tech giants hosting extremismPrince William kicks down a wall of ision at the Football for Peace graduation ceremony Prince Charles says Britain must \u0026#39eliminate throwaway society\u0026#39 as Black Friday boycott is urged Scottish Tory MP who ousted Angus Robertson warns he will find it \u0026#39very difficult\u0026#39 to back Brexit deal MoD lifts axe on three Royal Navy patrol ships to boost UK fisherman in scallop wars Animal rights activists demand Wool village change its nameHonouring the military animals ‘who also serve’ Donald Trump says US troops on border could use \u0026#39lethal force\u0026#39 against migrants if necessaryHillary Clinton says Europe must limit immigration to stop rise of Right-wing populismBritish university staff boycott Dubai campus as MPs say military should no longer train UAE forces The Brexit Political Declaration: what it says, what it meansWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/11/22/TELEMMGLPICT000169819968_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqek9vKm18v_rkIPH9w2GMNtm3NAjPW-2_OvjCiS6COCU.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"smart meter roll could cost households extra 100 means homeowners","story":"The report is the most critical assessment of the UK\u0026#39s smart meter program so farThe government\u0027s smart meter roll out is in chaos and could end up costing every British household £100 more than first expected, spending watchdogs have said.Multiple failings including delays and technical problems are threatening to add nearly £3bn, or around a quarter, to the cost of the project, according to a National Audit Office study published today. Originally Ministers had said the total cost would be £11bn, or £374 per household, paid for by consumers through higher energy bills.However an extra £3bn cost would mean an extra £93 charge on each household, effectively wiping out five years worth of savings generated by the devices, the report suggests. According to the NAO smart meters are predicted to save each household an average of £18 a year over the coming decades. The report is the most critical assessment of the UK\u0027s smart meter program so far, warning it is fraught with technical problems which have been ignored by the Government.   The UK will not meet the 2020 deadline by which every home should be offered a smart meter, it said, which could lead to energy firms being fined.  It also pointed out an unknown percentage of first generation meters may need replacing as they cannot be upgraded to stop them going dumb when people switch to a better deal.     Head of regulation at uSwitch, Richard Neudegg, said: “As many as 70 per cent of the 12.5 million smart meters installed so far will go ‘dumb’ if an energy customer switches supplier. That means there’s a risk that up to nine million may need to be ripped off the wall and replaced at considerable cost and inconvenience to households.  It also warned that the installation of second generation meters in the North of England and Scotland is lagging behind the rest of Great Britain due to problems integrating them with communications infrastructure. Experts last night called for the roll out to be delayed while technical problems are fixed, but writing in today\u0027s  energy Minister Claire Perry MP, said there were no plans to put it on ice.She said: Pushing back the rollout now – as some have suggested – would only delay millions of households from enjoying the substantial benefits of moving to a smarter energy system, and take the wind out of the sails of a rollout which is adding nearly half a million new meters a month.  As of the beginning of November, just 3,000 second generation meters had been installed in the North of England and Scotland, compared to 106,000 in the rest of Great Britain, it said.  Amyas Morse, head of the NAO, said:“Costs are rising, and timescales slipping, but smart meters can still succeed over time. BEIS has taken most of the decisions that matter on the programme so far. They now need to take responsibility for getting it back on track and protecting the interests of consumers who will ultimately meet the bills.”Body found in search for missing journalistUK donates £50m to African-led programmes fighting FGMWomen heart attack patients twice as likely to die in hospital as condition is seen as a \u0026#39male disease\u0026#39Hit squads sent into over 100 jails to seize drugs, phones and dronesComment: Emiratis must free student quickly as UK and UAE can ill afford a riftJeremy Hunt blamed over student jailed in the UAE as sources say he was warned against Saudi tripComment: Cabinet Brexiteers are gambling on a managed No Deal – and there\u0026#39s a good chance their bet will pay offBrussels warns fish and chips at risk unless Britain caves to EU fishing demandsTheresa May told to \u0026#39junk\u0026#39 the backstop as Brexit deal opposed by half of Tory backbenchersMan who \u0026#39groomed\u0026#39 British couple into supplying parts for Iran\u0026#39s nuclear programme jailed Businesses urged to pull adverts from tech giants hosting extremismPrince William kicks down a wall of ision at the Football for Peace graduation ceremony Prince Charles says Britain must \u0026#39eliminate throwaway society\u0026#39 as Black Friday boycott is urged Scottish Tory MP who ousted Angus Robertson warns he will find it \u0026#39very difficult\u0026#39 to back Brexit deal MoD lifts axe on three Royal Navy patrol ships to boost UK fisherman in scallop wars Animal rights activists demand Wool village change its nameHonouring the military animals ‘who also serve’ Donald Trump says US troops on border could use \u0026#39lethal force\u0026#39 against migrants if necessaryHillary Clinton says Europe must limit immigration to stop rise of Right-wing populismBritish university staff boycott Dubai campus as MPs say military should no longer train UAE forces The Brexit Political Declaration: what it says, what it meansWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/11/05/12/Amazon.jpg","title":"amazon black friday 2018 data breach","story":"Created with Sketch.Subscribe  registerSubscribeJoin us Subscribe  registerJoin us SubscribeLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentForgotten your password?Try Independent Minds free for 14 daysSee the optionsAmazon is the \u0027white whale\u0027 when it comes to hackers targeting online retailersClick to followThe Independent TechAmazon has suffered a customer data leak less than two days before Black Friday.Amazon customer service contacted people to warn them that their names and email addresses had been compromised, though it is not yet clear how\u0026nbspmany customers were affected or how it happened.\u0026nbspAn Amazon spokesperson told\u0026nbspThe Independent:\u0026nbsp“We have fixed the issue and informed customers who may have been impacted.”The customer message stated: We\u0027re contacting you to let you know that our website inadvertently disclosed your name and email address due to a technical error.The issue has been fixed. This is not a result of anything you have done, and there is no need for you to change your password or take any other action.The fact that only names and email addresses were affected makes\u0026nbspthe information leaked less significant than some other\u0026nbspdata breaches where credit card details have been exposed.Cyber security experts warn that despite the limited nature of the data leak, customers should still be weary about how it can be used.Cyber criminals can do a lot of damage with a large database of names and emails. The greatest risk is of brute force attacks - where criminals use a leaked email address and common password combinations to try and break into other personal accounts, Richard Walters, chief technology officer of\u0026nbspCensorNet, wrote in an email to\u0026nbspThe Independent.\u0026nbspA large majority of people still use predictable passwords, and thanks to previous high-profile breaches many people\u0027s passwords are also readily available on the dark web. For cyber criminals, it then just becomes a exercise in joining the dots. This risk is amplified by the fact that many people also use their work email addresses for personal accounts or services such as AmazonMr Walters described Amazon as the white whale when it comes to e-commerce companies, meaning it is a constant target for hackers.Advice for any Amazon customer affected, or anyone concerned\u0026nbspthey might have been, is to change their passwords as a matter of priority on all online services that they use, both work and private.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Apple has traditionally resisted Black Friday, instead running small offers but not slashing prices or offering deep discounts.In the last couple of years, for instance, the company has just offered gift cards when people bought specific products. Those gift cards have to be spent in the Apple Store and the products still sold at full price.Apple said almost nothing about this year\u0027s deals.

The Commission President has informed me that it has been agreed at negotiators’ level and agreed in principle at political level, subject to the endorsement of the leaders.”Sterling hit $1.2922, and rose 0.65 per cent against the euro to reach €1.1299. The leaked document shows that frictionless trade between the UK and the EU would come to an end after Brexit. The political declaration is the second element required to form the Brexit deal, along with the withdrawal agreement. It is understood that the draft has been approved by the European Commission, and now requires the EU member states, excluding the UK, to sign off on it. However, several countries, including France, Spain and Denmark, have raised concerns that earlier drafts of the plan gives too much away to the UK.Prime Minister Theresa May was \u0026nbspplunged into a leadership crisis last week after unveiled a draft Brexit agreement, with a number of Conservative MPs vowing to vote against it. Ms May is set to deliver a statement to Parliament on Thursday afternoon. Joshua Roberts, associate at consultancy JCRA, said sterling’s spike might not be a signal that the declaration will bring about great change. “Despite the positive language, it is difficult to find much in the text that we didn’t know already,” he said. “There is a reasonable chance that the market response is the result of trading algorithms activated by a positive headline, rather than the start of a bigger move.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The old ranch in Palo Alto needed a lot of work, but the couple were excited about the prospect of turning it into their dream family home - at least initially. What started with big plans turned into builders sketching on the back of napkins and ended in expensive mistakes.“It became miserable,” Tatarko says. “After a long process and a lot of time and money that we couldn’t afford, we ended up with plans that we didn’t like and we had to throw it away and start all over again.”How Silicon Valley start-up Theranos came crashing down to earthOnigo is the startup that crosses Pokémon GO with escape roomsSex-tech startup MysteryVibe introduces wearable vibrator for men When she talked to friends and neighbours, Tatarko realised they were not alone. There was a huge gap between homeowners, who felt it was impossible to realise their grand designs, and the professionals who felt customers had high expectations and unrealistic demands.Houzz now attracts 40 million unique users a month - more than your average homeware or DIY shop. Its success comes from the determination of Tatarko and Cohen to employ the latest technology. Houzz provides tools for people to visualise products in their homes and to buy them from vendors all over the world in one click. It has disrupted two massive markets - construction and home furnishings - with a value that Tatarko estimates at $2 trillion across the US, Canada and Europe.“These industries had no technology applied to it so our question is how do we make a difference to what is still largely an offline industry,” she says. “In the early days we wanted to help people to visualise what they liked. But the next stage is, ‘Well, I like it, but will it fit in my own space, with my other stuff?’ The ability to see if it fits in your own space - this is very powerful.”So powerful, that Houzz’s visualisation tool “View In My Room 3D” makes users 11 times more likely to purchase product and materials, according to research by Houzz economists of two million users.\u0026nbspThe marketplace tool, which was introduced in the US in 2014 and launched in the UK earlier this year, has become a second stream of revenue for Houzz. Its first was a freemium model whereby subscribing professionals, like builders and architects appear higher up in the search listings of users nearby, making it easier for them to attract work.The marketplace function was part of the original plans for the site, Tatarko says: “In the first iteration of the website, Houzz had tags on products showing data about where it was sold,” she says. “But as the site expanded we started getting phone calls to the office saying, ‘We see the tag, but we don’t understand how to add it to the cart,’ or ‘Can you ship this bathtub to us in Hawaii?’”It took years to connect with suppliers to make the vision a reality. The move turned Houzz into a retailer. It now has over 16 million product photos showing all the data. Tatarko herself has used the platform to buy a rug from Denmark. “I found it on Houzz Denmark, so I placed it in my room using the visualisation feature, saw that it worked and got it shipped to my house in California, from Denmark,” she says. “We hear of professionals using the visualisation tool to show clients instead of drawing diagrams on a napkin, like I got in the early days.”Tatarko comes from a entrepreneurial family. She grew up in Israel, where her mother worked in property and her grandmother had been a fashion designer. “Because of all this I thought, wow, I don’t know if I want to have this crazy life,” she says.She worked in a small tech company in Israel in her twenties and married Alon Cohen after meeting him on a bus while travelling through Thailand. When the couple were offered the opportunity to move to New York to work in startups, they grasped the chance. “We were young and restless, so we did,” she says. “Who wouldn’t?”Tatarko found the energy of New York addictive. She loved the buzz of the city. So it was with some reluctance that she agreed to move to Silicon Valley in 2001. “That was end of the tech bubble, everyone was getting out of Silicon Valley and only my dear husband wanted to move to there. How he convinced me I have no idea!” she says. She made Cohen a deal: she would move to New York - but only if she could get out of tech. \u0026nbspHe agreed. In California, while Cohen moved up the ranks at eBay, Tatarko started a new career in finance and became the chief financial officer for a boutique investment firm. Houzz happened in the evenings and on the weekends in between raising their first two sons:\u0026nbsp “At night, when we put the kids to bed, we would work on Houzz. Alon would programme and I would talk to people in the community. All of a sudden I had way more than a full time job going on, but I really loved it.”Tatarko convinced herself she wasn’t really back in the tech world. Not thinking about it too much helped her to keep going with Houzz. But the time came when the site was too big to run in their spare time. Cohen told Tatarko that he thought they should make the leap to doing it full time - and that she should become the chief executive.“I had to breathe for a second,” she remembers. “I said I wasn’t going to work in tech any more. I said I wasn’t going to work around the clock any more.”Not only that, but she had imbedded herself in the finance world and invested in education for her new career. Did she want to go back? “But I realised that this is what gets me excited. This is where the opportunity is. So here we are! Working around the clock.”The craziness continued when the couple had their third son six months before Houzz launched in international markets. She remembers flying all over the world with him to launch new offices. “I always thought that I would only have one or two kids and that with Houzz it would be too crazy, but you go and do what you truly love and you make things work.”The new app set to help make you money from your home renovationsTatarko is tight-lipped about whether Houzz is turning a profit amid such rapid expansion and refuses to say whether they are heading towards an IPO. But she says to look out for patents in the coming months and years as the visualisation software becomes more sophisticated.And the ranch in Palo Alto? Finally finished, thanks to a request from their eldest son to hold his bar mitzvah in the garden when it was in no state to host a party. “He said, ‘Now you have an excuse to finish the home!’ So we did the exterior of the house and the garden and it was finished just one day - a single day - before the party.

It would be better described as an exploitation cap.\u0026nbspThe people forced into using the sector to buy things most of us would consider essential –\u0026nbspcookers,\u0026nbsprefrigerators\u0026nbspand the like –\u0026nbspare some of the most vulnerable in society.\u0026nbspAccording to the watchdog, only a third are in work. Their incomes range from just £12,000 to £18,000 a year. They are likely to have missed at least one bill payment in the past six months.\u0026nbspThe developing universal credit debacle –\u0026nbspthe Work and\u0026nbspPensions Committee this morning warned of claimants being plunged into poverty and even left destitute if things go wrong –\u0026nbspand the benefits freeze\u0026nbspare\u0026nbsponly making things harder for them.\u0026nbspThe FCA\u0027s report into insurance pricing is deeply troubling Payday lenders must offer compensation for mis-sold credit, says FCAConsumer groups call for FCA to impose price cap on doorstep lendingRent-to-own companies provide a means for them to buy things they need. But the problem is they have made a habit of\u0026nbspfleecing\u0026nbsptheir customers, firstly through charging over the odds for the goods themselves, secondly through the cost of the credit they give to people to pay for the products.\u0026nbspIt speaks volumes that the cap, which is due to come into force on 1 April, subject to consultation, is expected to save vulnerable consumers nearly £23m a year. That’s in addition to the redress packages for around 340,000 customers of RTO firms BrightHouse, PerfectHome and Buy As You View, of nearly £16m that have already been paid out.\u0026nbspThe cap has two prongs. It will force RTO providers to benchmark their prices against what high street rivals charge, and limit the cost of credit to no more than the cost of the product being purchased. The consumer thus won’t pay more than twice the price. It’s broadly similar to the way payday lenders are limited in that respect.\u0026nbspIn addition, the point of sale addition of extended\u0026nbspwarranties will be banned through the introduction of a two-day “cooling off period”\u0026nbspand there will be a programme to promote alternatives to high cost credit generally.\u0026nbspThe cap\u0026nbspsounds tough, but what you have to remember is that the FCA tends to be a fairly cautious institution, so despite the squealing\u0026nbspyou may hear from the sector about these plans, it won’t come crashing down, just as the payday loans cap has not brought that sector crashing down (the industry still gets\u0026nbspadvertising slots on cable and satellite TV). \u0026nbspRTO firms will still be able to impose a fairly high markup, and turn a more than acceptable profit.Created with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Coca-Cola has paid £3.9bn for Costa Coffee.

The Commission President has informed me that it has been agreed at negotiators’ level and agreed in principle at political level, subject to the endorsement of the leaders.”Sterling hit $1.2922, and rose 0.65 per cent against the euro to reach €1.1299. The leaked document shows that frictionless trade between the UK and the EU would come to an end after Brexit. The political declaration is the second element required to form the Brexit deal, along with the withdrawal agreement. It is understood that the draft has been approved by the European Commission, and now requires the EU member states, excluding the UK, to sign off on it. However, several countries, including France, Spain and Denmark, have raised concerns that earlier drafts of the plan gives too much away to the UK.Prime Minister Theresa May was \u0026nbspplunged into a leadership crisis last week after unveiled a draft Brexit agreement, with a number of Conservative MPs vowing to vote against it. Ms May is set to deliver a statement to Parliament on Thursday afternoon. Joshua Roberts, associate at consultancy JCRA, said sterling’s spike might not be a signal that the declaration will bring about great change. “Despite the positive language, it is difficult to find much in the text that we didn’t know already,” he said. “There is a reasonable chance that the market response is the result of trading algorithms activated by a positive headline, rather than the start of a bigger move.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The Financial Conduct Authority said some customers are paying as much as four times the average retail price for essential household goods such as washing machines or cookers, due to extra charges such as add-on insurance and warranties.According to the FCA, only a third of customers who use these companies are\u0026nbspin work, most\u0026nbspare living on low incomes of between £12,000 and £18,000, and they are likely to have missed a bill payment in the last six months.BrightHouse agrees to pay £14.8m for mistreating consumersIs the Queen\u0027s cash helping BrightHouse exploit the poor?Queen invested in rent-to-own firm BrightHouseSimon Read: \u0027Stop the great rent-to-own rip-off\u0027Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the FCA, said: “Today’s measures are designed to bring down very high prices in the rent-to-own sector, which is used by some of the most financially vulnerable in our society. A cap will prevent firms charging over the odds for essential everyday items like cookers or washing machines. “We believe a cap is the only intervention that will effectively tackle the highest prices. If implemented it will save consumers up to £22.7m a year from excessive charges.”Mr Bailey added: “We want to stop consumers having to pay many multiples more than the price of a product on the high street. These changes build on the measures we have already taken across the high-cost credit sector.”The FCA is also introducing a two-day cooling off period for the sale of extended warranties.This will effectively ban firms from selling these warranties at the point of purchase.

Earlier this month\u0026nbspwe argued\u0026nbsphere in The Independent that the prime minister should be able to build momentum for her deal once agreed. And we are sticking to our guns. What’s more, we think her much-derided draft agreement, should it turn into an actual agreement, might yet defy the odds and be approved by parliament.We originally argued that a deal would change the context of the Brexit debate, that sterling would bounce and that businesses would come out in favour of the relative certainty that it provides. Some of this has already happened – although our point referred to after the European Council rather than the week leading up to it. The CBI’s President John Allan came out in support of the deal, saying it “avoids the wrecking ball that would be a no-deal departure”.If Theresa May gets her Brexit deal markets will go upMeanwhile, in Northern Ireland, the intransigent stance of the DUP is coming in for scrutiny. Our colleague Colin Harvey has pointed out that their Brexit stance is being questioned by “prominent figures from across the community in Northern Ireland”,\u0026nbspand that businesses and the wider community have cautiously welcomed the protocol on Northern Ireland.The hostile reaction it received in parliament, and the spate of resignations and rash of no confidence letters that followed its unveiling, underlined all too clearly that the parliamentary odds do not appear to favour the PM.Yet there is still time before the vote. We (along with Goldman Sachs) continue to expect a post-summit bounce, and, judging from the last week, we’d expect sections of the pro-Brexit media to come out in favour of the deal.Mrs May seems to have stabilised the cabinet by holding on to the Pizza Club of key pro-Brexit ministers and adding some waverers from both Brexit wings of her party to the government payroll. And she has in fact strengthened over the past week, with polling published in The Times revealing a 13-point increase in support for Theresa May among the public. MPs reluctant to support a prime minister on the verge last week are more likely to come on board as her position gradually improves.Moreover, the prime minister still has some wiggle room. Remember, the Withdrawal Agreement, is a document filled with obligations – to pay money, to provide rights for EU citizens and to avoid an Irish border. There is a slight chance that this might yet be revised to hold out the possibility that both sides can just about conceive of a technical fix that might obviate the need of the contentious backstop ever being needed. That might yet sway some pro-Brexit MPs who fear the chaos that rejection of the deal would unleash.And sugar for the rather bitter pill of the withdrawal agreement might also be provided by the political declaration. Henry Newman has gone through some of the ways in which this might be drafted to maximise political backing. As the clock ticks down, the options will crystallise into real choices. Not this deal versus a hypothetical ideal outcome, but between the deal, no deal or a general election or referendum.Once the package lands in parliament, process, sequencing and timing will matter enormously. Indeed, it might transpire that getting the barrage of criticism over and done with last week was a tactical masterstroke. Whilst opponents of the deal have worn themselves out, the prime minister can come back from Brussels on Sunday and start to build a more durable coalition.Those against Theresa May’s version of Brexit have pretty much had an open field up to now, but the prime minister has begun a highly orchestrated campaign defending her position properly, perhaps for the first time.Moreover, as Labour MP Lisa Nandy has pointed out, the order in which the Commons deals with amendments to the motion on the Withdrawal Agreement will be crucial. Anti-Brexit MPs are ided over whether to put up amendments calling for a referendum first, or to force a defeat of the deal and then put together a pro-referendum coalition.If a pro-referendum amendment is defeated, the ensuing meaningful vote comes to look like a choice between deal and no deal, which might cause more parliamentarians to opt for the former. And, as Raphael Hogarth argues, some Tory Remainers might then be persuaded to support the PM.Meanwhile, the prime minister will continue to try to pile pressure on her party from below. A Survation poll showed a slight plurality of Conservative councillors thought MPs should support the deal, with almost two-thirds saying they would back her personally in a confidence vote. It may be that ramping up constituency pressure on MPs will also help her shift some waverers, though polling by Conservative Home underlines what a mountain she has to climb to persuade her grassroots.After two years of this weak and wobbly prime minister, we’ve surely learned that its rash to write her off.Anand Menon is director and Matt Bevington a policy researcher at\u0026nbspThe UK in a Changing Europe\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

According to the report, there are around 100,000 interns working in Britain every year, with around 58,000 unpaid.\u0026nbspCommenting on the figures revealing that a quarter of Westminster employees secured their job through personal connections, Sir Peter Lampl, founder of the Sutton Trust, said: “This prevents young people without the same networks from accessing jobs and getting the experience they need.\u0026nbsp“This is a major social mobility issue. To address it, job selection in Westminster should be based solely on merit.”The charity is calling for all internships longer than one month to be paid at least the national minimum wage of £7.05 for 21 to 24-year-olds, and ideally the Living Wage of £9 per hour.Sir Peter added: “Outlawing the exclusionary practice of unpaid internships is a good place to start.\u0026nbsp We also need fair and transparent recruitment practices. Internship positions should be advertised publicly, rather than filled informally.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Prime Minister Theresa May joins a parent and baby group during a visit to the Kentish Town Health Centre in LondonA crashed car, with an object protruding through the windscreen, sits abandoned on the A628 in the Peak District, as a blast of snow hit the north of EnglandWaves crash over Seaham lighthouse near Durham as the cold and wet weather continuesPrime Minister Theresa May speaking at the CBI annual conference at InterContinental Hotel.

African heritage cannot be only in private collections and European museums – it must be showcased in Paris but also in Dakar, Lagos and Cotonou. This will be one of my priorities.”With many of the artworks being “acquired” by foreign entities\u0026nbspin the 19th century, there is not always clear documentation on the transfer, which many see as a simple case of looting.The report will be released on Friday and, according to The New York Times, estimates that 90 to 95 per cent of Africa’s cultural heritage resides outside of the continent.If France takes steps to return African artworks, there will be pressure on museums in other countries to do the same. On Tuesday, the governor of Easter Island was in tears as she begged the British Museum to return one of its main statues – the Hoa Hakananai’a – saying: “You have our soul.”\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

But as\u0026nbspSean O’Grady\u0026nbspexplains, she is following in a long Conservative tradition\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspClick to followThe IndependentBattles over the UK\u0027s relationship with the continent have blighted successive Tory premiershipsCould Europe be enough to wreck yet another Tory premiership?As Theresa May faces prospective votes of no confidence,\u0026nbspin her leadership from her own MPs, and in her government from internal dissidents and opposition parties, it may be scant comfort that she would hardly be the first Conservative leader to see their dreams and ambitions destroyed by a subject – Europe – that is seemingly incapable of resolution.Indeed, May, punningly enough, exists as a sort of political mayflower – her\u0026nbsplife in office, be it long or short, devoted to one purpose only: Brexit. All the stuff about “burning injustices”, the high-minded schemes to reinvigorate the British economy with an “industrial strategy” – her own mild brand of corporatism – or the plight of the “just about managing” families has been subsumed by the question of Britain’s EU withdrawal.To use a modern phrase, her administration has not the “bandwidth” to deal with everything else as well as sort out Brexit in truth it doesn’t really have the capacity or the intellectual clout to deal with Brexit itself.\u0026nbspBritain Before Brexit in photos: a portrait of the West MidlandsIn order to break the blackmailing hold of her band of Eurosceptic fundamentalists – and, to be fair, the truculent resistance of the Europhiles – she sought her own mandate at the general election of 2017. In an inexplicably long campaign the British electorate did what they usually do when asked a question by a prime mister – they chose to answer a different one. Called upon to back her with the kind of resounding support that would give her the oomph needed to carry out her Lancaster House hardish Brexit plan, the British electorate instead decided to blow a large raspberry and vote in unthinkable numbers for Jeremy Corbyn.“Nothing has changed,” she foolishly said during yet another campaign cock-up. In reality everything changed when she lost her majority, her moral authority and her political autonomy. Ironically, from that moment on she was the captive of every voluble faction or personality persuaded they could do a better job than she could – and there was no shortage of those. It was quietly said that she wouldn’t lead her party into another general election, even after she had jettisoned her closest aides and handed a veto over her cabinet-making to the 1922 Committee. She indicated that she had got her party and the country into his mess – and would get them out of it. It might have been better all round if they’d just ditched her then but, as usual, her enemies were willing to wound but not to kill. (My apologies if that language seems too violently intemperate for our times)Those who refuse to contemplate consulting the British people would in my view make more likely our eventual exitThe outcome of the British general election of 2017 was, then, not the triumph of May and the Leavers, but the revenge of the Remainers. It has left its mark. Now May is chained to the radiator of the Democratic Unionist Party, whose illogical and inconsistent demands could only be carried out by means of ine intervention.Sad, as they say, but true and hardly unpredictable. We remember\u0026nbspall too well\u0026nbsphow David Cameron almost casually tossed away his place in history – which might otherwise have been relatively distinguished – with a pledge to hold an inout EU referendum. On 23 January 2013 – a day that should live in infamy – at a speech at the Bloomberg HQ in London, Cameron explained his rationale. To be fair, he had some good points to make:“Those who refuse to contemplate consulting the British people would in my view make more likely our eventual exit.“Simply asking the British people to carry on accepting a European settlement over which they have had little choice is a path to ensuring that when the question is finally put – and at some stage it will have to be – it is much more likely that the British people will reject the EU.“That is why I am in favour of a referendum. I believe in confronting this issue – shaping it, leading the debate. Not simply hoping a difficult situation will go away.”“First, the problems in the eurozone are driving fundamental change in Europe.Second, there is a crisis of European competitiveness, as other nations across the world soar ahead. And third, there is a gap between the EU and its citizens which has grown dramatically in recent years, and which represents a lack of democratic accountability and consent that is – yes – felt particularly acutely in Britain.”By the way, and as if to prove the sure touch, if not genius, for politics possessed by Tony Blair, the reaction of the ex-prime minister at the time to Cameron’s move is chillingly and amusingly prophetic:Travel Question: Will Brexit affect holidays in Spain?In the early 2010s, as the coalition cut its way to dismal poll ratings Cameron was, in truth, spooked by the rise of Nigel Farage and Ukip, capitalising on a widespread but inchoate set of grievances in post-financial crisis, post-austerity, “left-behind” Britain.Cameron feared being outflanked by them on the right, splitting the traditional Conservative vote and losing seats to Ed Miliband’s Labour Party. In a way his strategy succeeded – but too well. At the 2015 election, with the collapse in the Liberal Democrat vote, Labour’s rout in Scotland at the hands of the SNP and some recession in Ukip’s charge, very possibly because of Cameron’s referendum pledge, Cameron and his campaign manager George Osborne succeeded so far as to win an overall majority – the first Tory one since 1992. Instead of another round of coalition, with an even stronger Tory domination, they could steer their own course. Instead of being able to plead that “Nick Clegg won’t let me hold the referendum”, Cameron was forced to do so.Or was he? Back in 2015 and 2016 no one was much bothered. Europe hardly featured in the voters’ list of concerns, although immigration often did. Cameron might have got away with forgetting his promise (as he had before on a “cast-iron” one to hold a plebiscite on the Lisbon Treaty of 2009).In any event, Cameron was complacent and, like many, too mesmerised by the precedent of the 1975 vote, when the people tended to “follow the faces they trusted”, as the arch-Europhile Roy Jenkins remarkeCameron failed to see how times had changed, and how folk were more sceptical about “the establishment”, whipped up by Ukip. Cameron also refused to countenance “blue-on-blue” debates, which allowed Boris Johnson and Michael Gove to parade unchallenged directly by their Tory peers the Treasury’s “Project Fear”, by contrast, seemed implausible to many of the public.You can think of ex-ministers who are going around causing all sorts of trouble. We don’t want another three more of the bastards out there...So Cameron lost. He lost his party and his premiership, and he is now routinely relegated to the bottom of the historical premier premiership table, along with Sir Anthony Eden (Suez) and Neville Chamberlain (Munich), in their own ways also guilty of serious delusions about foreign policy. Maybe the memoir\u0026nbspCameron is composing in his £25,000 “shepherd’s cottage” will succeed in rehabilitating him.Before Cameron there was John Major. Like May today, Major faced a huge series of battles to get a European agreement through parliament: the Maastricht Treaty strengthened European integration, but also contained a series of British “opt-outs”, the most valuable being the right to keep the pound and avoid joining the ill-starred euro.Like May today as well, he had no overall majority for much of his time in parliament and a well-organised group of Eurosceptics tormenting him. Some crucial votes he only won with the support of the 20 or so Liberal Democrats, then led by Paddy Ashdown, prepared to put country before party Labour was uniformly hostile to Major’s legislation, though agreeing with almost everything in it.Eurosceptics (AFPGetty)Major, like May, had a gang of leaky Eurosceptics in cabinet permanently causing trouble. In an unguarded moment in front of a live mic, he let slip his true feelings:“Just think it through from my perspective. You are the prime minister, with a majority of 18, a party that is still harking back to a golden age that never was, and is now invented. You have three right-wing members of the cabinet who actually resign. What happens in the parliamentary party?“I could bring in other people. But where do you think most of this poison is coming from? From the dispossessed and the never-possessed. You can think of ex-ministers who are going around causing all sorts of trouble.“We don’t want another three more of the bastards out there. What’s Lyndon Johnson’s maxim?...”May must feel the same way about today’s “gang of five”, the “pizza club” of Leadsom, Gove, Fox, Grayling and Mordaunt. And, indeed, about Michael Howard, Peter Lilley and John Redwood, still banging the same drum as they did in Major’s cabinet a quarter century ago. (At least Michael Portillo has gone off to play with trains and model garishly coloured blazers.)ITVRex)Major survived his own leadership crisis over Europe, one he felt he had to end himself by, shockingly, resigning his position as party leader (but not prime minister) and inviting his enemies to “put up or shut up”. John Redwood, the Welsh secretary, did so and scored respectably, but ultimately lost. So Major carried on, his authority scarcely enhanced before he was slaughtered by Blair in 1997. It was the Tories’ worst thrashing since 1832. As he himself said within weeks, it was time to “leave the stage”.When Major claimed that his foes were “still harking back to a golden age that never was, and is now invented”, it was plainly a reference to the Thatcher premiership – which remains to this day a golden age for the right of the Conservative Party and their fellow travellers in Ukip – the likes of Arron Banks and Farage explicitly declaring their devotion to her.\u0026nbspIn many ways the Leave campaign was a movement that sought to bring back Thatcherism, the EU being regarded as a pettifogging, bureaucratic,\u0026nbspeven socialist\u0026nbspbarrier to the return of free enterprise, low tax\u0026nbspand the small-state policies of the 1980s. It was, if you will, a campaign for Mrs Thatcher’s fourth term in office, the one she never got to deliver.Eurosceptics (KeystoneHulton ArchiveGetty)The allegiance to Thatcher was, however, of the late-vintage Thatcher – the one who, when she reached the Lords, was happy to vote against her own party on Maastricht the one who made the landmark Bruges speech in 1988, a sort of Old Testament for Eurosceptics. A brief extract gives its flavour:“We have not successfully rolled back the frontiers of the state in Britain\u0026nbsponly to see them reimposed at a European level with a European super-state exercising a new dominance from Brussels.“Certainly we want to see Europe more united and with a greater sense of common purpose.“But it must be in a way which preserves the different traditions, parliamentary powers and sense of national pride in one’s own country for these have been the source of Europe’s vitality through the centuries.”Pure prototype Ukip, you might say. Yet she also declared in that same address, less comfortably for the likes of Jacob Rees-Mogg and Farage:“The lesson of the economic history of Europe in the Seventies and Eighties is that central planning and detailed control\u0026nbspdo not\u0026nbspwork and that personal endeavour and initiative\u0026nbspdo that a state-controlled economy is a recipe for low growth and that free enterprise within a framework of law brings better results.“The aim of a Europe open to enterprise is the moving force behind the creation of the single European market in 1992. By getting rid of barriers, by making it possible for companies to operate on a European scale, we can best compete with the United States, Japan and other new economic powers emerging in Asia and elsewhere.”Margaret Thatcher, the longest serving peacetime premier of the 20th century, left office on 22 November\u0026nbsp1990. She did so for four manifest reasons. First, what was called “style” – an increasingly imperious manner. Second, a deepening economic recession. Third, the poll tax, which was incredibly unpopular and became a direct threat to Tory MPs’ chances of holding on to their seats. But there was also the question of Europe.Created with Sketch.Brexit: 10 of the most ridiculous headlines Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.This wholly false headline merited the first ruling by IPSO (the press regulator) under clause 1 of the revised Editor\u0027s Code of Practice.

At the time the Conservative Party had many more European true believers at its head than today and when the then-leader of the Commons, Sir Geoffrey Howe, resigned in protest at the prime minister’s dismissive approach to Europe, she was fatally damaged. Her words at prime minister’s questions were the final straw for Howe, Michael Heseltine and the other Europhiles, and they echo down the years:Biggest rise in UK poverty since Thatcher was in power, experts claimThree weeks later she had had to quit, but not until she had had time to refuse\u0026nbspa request from the Labour leader, Neil Kinnock, to hold a general election so the British people could make their own choice about her successor. Plus ça change.The trouble for the Tories over Europe goes further back still. Britain’s first, belated attempt to join the then European Economic Community (EEC) was rejected after a few years of negotiations in 1963 – because of a French veto. After President Charles\u0026nbspde Gaulle said “non” to the UK, the fortunes of the Conservative movement declined markedly.The prime minister responsible\u0026nbspfor the bid, Harold Macmillan, saw it as the great strategic purpose of his administration:\u0026nbspthe way to find a role in the world as the British empire was being dismantled, and a way to boost the UK’s sluggish growth by joining in with the fastest growing economic bloc (apart from Japan) at the time. Macmillan, in the end, failed and his government was defeated by\u0026nbspLabour in 1964.In fact the only Tory leader to remotely prosper from Europe was Ted Heath, who was Macmillan’s chief negotiator – the reverse of a Brexit secretary – and went on to be the Tory PM who took the UK in to the EEC in 1973.Even there, though, the effort left some bad feelings among the small band of Tory proto-Eurosepctics, led by Enoch Powell, a man in love with parliament and fixated by sovereignty. More concerned with immigration, his hatred of the EEC was visceral, and his advice to Tory voters in marginal seats in the West Midlands in the 1974 election to vote Labour – because they\u0026nbsp were offering a referendum on staying in the EEC – was pivotal in pushing Heath out of No 10. So, in his way, even Heath was a victim of his party’s troubled and ambiguous relationship to the European issue.So there they are then: Macmillan, Heath, Thatcher, Cameron, May. Europe has haunted the Tories for almost seven decades, ever since Winston Churchill, Anthony Eden and Harold Macmillan politely said “no” to an invitation to join attempts to create a European Community in the 1950s.Wrangling about Europe also badly distracted the Tories in opposition under William Hague and Iain Duncan Smith. The floor is littered with other political corpses and zombie policies (remember Hague’s “Save the Pound”?). Ken Clarke and Michael Heseltine never became leader of their party because they were too pro-European. Others, such as Johnson and Gove, have\u0026nbspfound their anti-European crusading not quite sufficient to carry them into No 10, mainly because most of the parliamentary party remained relatively relaxed about the EU – epitomised by, say, Amber Rudd and\u0026nbspPhilip Hammond, as well as Cameron and Osborne.Further back in the mists of history, all the way back to the mid-19th century, we find the Conservatives split about protectionism and “imperial preference” as against global free trade. The issue came back time and again to mither Tory statesmen from Robert Peel to Stanley Baldwin. Only the Second World War forced them to take their minds off trade policy.The last Tory leader to talk much sense about Europe was in fact the Mark I David Cameron, the one who in 2006 told his party simply to “stop banging on about Europe”.Whatever happened to that idea?Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

I may even enjoy eating that cockroach.“He added: “There are members of the board who are really worried about what is really going on and there are senior executives who don\u0027t want to have their collars felt.\u0026nbsp“They don\u0027t want to be implicated when the warrants start to arrive, and they will arrive.“\u0026nbspNoel Edmonds officially heading into I\u0027m a Celeb jungleNoel Edmonds increases Lloyds Bank compensation claim to £300mNoel Edmonds was \u0027pushed to brink of suicide\u0027 after financial fraudBanking scandals like Reading HBOS fraud are damaging UK social fabricWill HBOS mea culpa see FRC getting tough with auditors?Jonathan Coad, Mr Edmonds’ barrister, served Lloyds with a pre-case letter on Thursday with proceedings expected to begin as soon as next month.The letter was sent as\u0026nbspMr Edmonds entered the jungle for ITV’s hit show which drew 11.6 million viewers when the latest series began on Saturday.“It\u0027s not going to do any harm to be in the jungle on ITV at peak time every single day for a few weeks,” Mr Edmonds said.The presenter is claiming damages resulting from fraud perpetrated by former HBOS bankers, Lynden Scourfield, 54 and businessmen David Mills, 60 and Michael Bancroft, 73\u0026nbspMr Scourfield authorised millions of pounds of loans to struggling businesses, regardless of their ability to repay.He then referred firms to “consultants Mr Mills and Mr Bancroft who who claimed to be turnaround specialists. Instead of providing assistance to the companies they bullied them, squeezed them for large fees and stripped them of assets.\u0026nbspMr Mills arranged sex parties with prostitutes, holidays to Thailand and Barbados and other gifts for Mr Scourfield.A spokesperson for LLoyds said: \u0027We have received Mr Edmonds’ legal letter and we will review the contents before responding.\u0026nbsp“We fully understand the anguish he feels at the failure of his businesses, but on the information we have seen so far we simply cannot agree that this is the result of actions taken by the former HBOS business.\u0026nbsp“We have engaged with Mr Edmonds and we made determined efforts to reach a consensual solution through mediation in 2017, though this was not possible. We note that Mr Edmonds is now planning to formally file his legal claim next month. We are content for the matter to be considered by a court if he pursues his legal action. However we cannot allow ourselves to be pressed into paying out money without cause just because an inidual uses their celebrity status to attack us.“We continue to make good progress compensating the 72 customers impacted by the fraud at the HBOS Impaired Assets office based in Reading. We have now provided outcomes to 71 customers in the review and 64 of these offers have been accepted.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The Financial Conduct Authority said some customers are paying as much as four times the average retail price for essential household goods such as washing machines or cookers, due to extra charges such as add-on insurance and warranties.According to the FCA, only a third of customers who use these companies are\u0026nbspin work, most\u0026nbspare living on low incomes of between £12,000 and £18,000, and they are likely to have missed a bill payment in the last six months.BrightHouse agrees to pay £14.8m for mistreating consumersIs the Queen\u0027s cash helping BrightHouse exploit the poor?Queen invested in rent-to-own firm BrightHouseSimon Read: \u0027Stop the great rent-to-own rip-off\u0027Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the FCA, said: “Today’s measures are designed to bring down very high prices in the rent-to-own sector, which is used by some of the most financially vulnerable in our society. A cap will prevent firms charging over the odds for essential everyday items like cookers or washing machines. “We believe a cap is the only intervention that will effectively tackle the highest prices. If implemented it will save consumers up to £22.7m a year from excessive charges.”Mr Bailey added: “We want to stop consumers having to pay many multiples more than the price of a product on the high street. These changes build on the measures we have already taken across the high-cost credit sector.”The FCA is also introducing a two-day cooling off period for the sale of extended warranties.This will effectively ban firms from selling these warranties at the point of purchase. This will come into force on 22 February 2019.Firms such as\u0026nbspBrighthouse, PerfectHome and Buy as You View will be affected by the proposed price cap. The FCA said its previous work had resulted in redress packages totalling £16m for about\u0026nbsp340,000 consumers who used these companies. The bulk of that redress came from BrightHouse, which paid £14.8m to 249,000 customers\u0026nbsplast year after the regulator said it had not acted as a responsible lender. In 2017, the\u0026nbspQueen\u0026nbspwas revealed to be a small investor in the firm.On Thursday, a BrightHouse spokesperson said: “BrightHouse has been working closely and constructively with the FCA over a number of years. This comprehensive process has led to many changes in the way we operate as a business and serve our customers.“We’re going to carefully consider today’s announcement, while continuing to offer those excluded from mainstream credit ways to get the household goods they need.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Earlier this month\u0026nbspwe argued\u0026nbsphere in The Independent that the prime minister should be able to build momentum for her deal once agreed. And we are sticking to our guns. What’s more, we think her much-derided draft agreement, should it turn into an actual agreement, might yet defy the odds and be approved by parliament.We originally argued that a deal would change the context of the Brexit debate, that sterling would bounce and that businesses would come out in favour of the relative certainty that it provides. Some of this has already happened – although our point referred to after the European Council rather than the week leading up to it. The CBI’s President John Allan came out in support of the deal, saying it “avoids the wrecking ball that would be a no-deal departure”.If Theresa May gets her Brexit deal markets will go upMeanwhile, in Northern Ireland, the intransigent stance of the DUP is coming in for scrutiny. Our colleague Colin Harvey has pointed out that their Brexit stance is being questioned by “prominent figures from across the community in Northern Ireland”,\u0026nbspand that businesses and the wider community have cautiously welcomed the protocol on Northern Ireland.The hostile reaction it received in parliament, and the spate of resignations and rash of no confidence letters that followed its unveiling, underlined all too clearly that the parliamentary odds do not appear to favour the PM.Yet there is still time before the vote. We (along with Goldman Sachs) continue to expect a post-summit bounce, and, judging from the last week, we’d expect sections of the pro-Brexit media to come out in favour of the deal.Mrs May seems to have stabilised the cabinet by holding on to the Pizza Club of key pro-Brexit ministers and adding some waverers from both Brexit wings of her party to the government payroll. And she has in fact strengthened over the past week, with polling published in The Times revealing a 13-point increase in support for Theresa May among the public. MPs reluctant to support a prime minister on the verge last week are more likely to come on board as her position gradually improves.Moreover, the prime minister still has some wiggle room. Remember, the Withdrawal Agreement, is a document filled with obligations – to pay money, to provide rights for EU citizens and to avoid an Irish border. There is a slight chance that this might yet be revised to hold out the possibility that both sides can just about conceive of a technical fix that might obviate the need of the contentious backstop ever being needed. That might yet sway some pro-Brexit MPs who fear the chaos that rejection of the deal would unleash.And sugar for the rather bitter pill of the withdrawal agreement might also be provided by the political declaration. Henry Newman has gone through some of the ways in which this might be drafted to maximise political backing. As the clock ticks down, the options will crystallise into real choices. Not this deal versus a hypothetical ideal outcome, but between the deal, no deal or a general election or referendum.Once the package lands in parliament, process, sequencing and timing will matter enormously. Indeed, it might transpire that getting the barrage of criticism over and done with last week was a tactical masterstroke. Whilst opponents of the deal have worn themselves out, the prime minister can come back from Brussels on Sunday and start to build a more durable coalition.Those against Theresa May’s version of Brexit have pretty much had an open field up to now, but the prime minister has begun a highly orchestrated campaign defending her position properly, perhaps for the first time.Moreover, as Labour MP Lisa Nandy has pointed out, the order in which the Commons deals with amendments to the motion on the Withdrawal Agreement will be crucial. Anti-Brexit MPs are ided over whether to put up amendments calling for a referendum first, or to force a defeat of the deal and then put together a pro-referendum coalition.If a pro-referendum amendment is defeated, the ensuing meaningful vote comes to look like a choice between deal and no deal, which might cause more parliamentarians to opt for the former. And, as Raphael Hogarth argues, some Tory Remainers might then be persuaded to support the PM.Meanwhile, the prime minister will continue to try to pile pressure on her party from below. A Survation poll showed a slight plurality of Conservative councillors thought MPs should support the deal, with almost two-thirds saying they would back her personally in a confidence vote. It may be that ramping up constituency pressure on MPs will also help her shift some waverers, though polling by Conservative Home underlines what a mountain she has to climb to persuade her grassroots.After two years of this weak and wobbly prime minister, we’ve surely learned that its rash to write her off.Anand Menon is director and Matt Bevington a policy researcher at\u0026nbspThe UK in a Changing Europe\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Scientists have identified the remains as a type of dicynodont from the therapsid group\u0026nbspand have named the species Lisowicia bojani, after the Polish village of Lisowice close to where the fossils were found, and a German anatomist named Ludwig Heinrich Bojanus.Dicynodonts were herbivores and their sizes ranged from small burrowing species to large browsers. Most of them were also toothless. Despite their reptilian heritage, they are the predecessors of all modern mammals, including humans. Bones of new species of vegetarian dinosaur found in BrazilExtinction mystery deepens after discovery of dinosaur-era bird fossilBirds got their colourful eggs from dinosaur ancestors, study suggestsLargest dinosaur foot ever recorded came from brachiosaur, study findsThe new species was discovered by a team from Uppsala University in Sweden and the Polish Academy of Sciences, and their findings are published in the journal Science.“The discovery of Lisowicia changes our ideas about the latest history of dicynodonts, mammal Triassic relatives. It also raises far more questions about what really make them and dinosaurs so large, said Dr Tomasz Sulej, of the Polish Academy of Sciences.The size of the fossil means palaeontologists will have to reassess their understanding of therapsid lineage.dicynodont found in Poland (Grzegorz Niedzwiedzki)“Dicynodonts were amazingly successful animals in the Middle and Late Triassic. Lisowicia is the youngest dicynodont and the largest non-dinosaurian terrestrial tetrapod from the Triassic,” said Dr Grzegorz Niedzwiedzki of Uppsala University.“It\u0027s natural to want to know how dicynodonts became so large. Lisowicia is hugely exciting because it blows holes in many of our classic ideas of Triassic ‘mammal-like reptiles’.” The first findings of fossils from Lisowice in Poland were made in 2005 by Robert Borzecki and Piotr Menducki. Since then, more than 1,000 bones and bone fragments have been collected from the area, including fossils from Lisowicia. The area is thought to have been a river deposit during the Late Triassic period.Lisowicia bojani reveals dicynodonts - predecessors of modern mammals - grew to colossal sizes (Karolina Suchan-Okulska)The discovery of Lisowicia provides the first evidence that mammal-like elephant sized dicynodonts were present at the same time as the better-known long-necked sauropodomorph dinosaurs, contrary to previous belief. Sauropodomorphs include species like the Diplodocus or Brachiosaurus. The find fills a gap in the fossil record of dicynodonts and it shows that some anatomical features of limbs thought to characterise large mammals or dinosaurs also evolved in the non-mammalian synapsid.

For years, the US has been unable to launch its own astronauts to the space station or anywhere else – instead relying on Russia to do so for them – and has been waiting and hoping for private solutions to the problem.The historic launch will take place on 7 January, 2019, Nasa said.Nasa video says it is going back to the Moon –\u0026nbspand staying thereThis will be the first uncrewed test flight of the Commercial Crew Program and will provide data on the performance of the Falcon 9 rocket, Crew Dragon spacecraft, and ground systems, as well as on-orbit, docking and landing operations, it said in an announcement.The flight test also will provide valuable data toward NASA certifying SpaceX’s crew transportation system for carrying astronauts to and from the space station.No astronaut has been launched into space since 2011, when the Space Shuttle programme was retired.

The first half talks about the “inisibility of the four freedoms” – namely goods, services, capital and labour.\u0026nbspWhat the document says: It must also ensure the sovereignty of the United Kingdom and the protection of its internal market, while respecting the result of the 2016 referendum including with regard to the development of its independent trade policy and the ending of free movement of people between the Union and the United Kingdom.What it really means:\u0026nbspThe next sentence of the same paragraph puts up in lights that “free movement of people” will end. In the previous version, this was buried so deep some experts missed it. But if the freedoms are inisible, that means the UK cannot have free movement of goods, services and capital. That contradiction is not solved by the rest of the document.\u0026nbspWhat the document says:\u0026nbspThe economic partnership should ensure no tariffs, fees, charges or quantitative restrictions across all sectors, with ambitious customs arrangements that, in line with the parties’ objectives and principles above, build and improve on the single customs territory provided for in the withdrawal agreement which obviates the need for checks on rules of origin.What it really means:\u0026nbspThe sentence in the first draft that caused Dominic Raab to resign as Brexit secretary is still in there, about building on the single customs territory, only now it has “and improve” in as well, as if that makes it better from the point of view of someone who doesn’t want a single customs territory (fudgespeak for a customs union).\u0026nbspWhat the document says:\u0026nbspThe parties envisage that the extent of the United Kingdom’s commitments on customs and regulatory cooperation, including with regard to alignment of rules, would be taken into account in the application of related checks and controls, considering this as a factor in reducing risk.\u0026nbspWhat it really means:\u0026nbspThis paragraph referring to “checks and controls” cleverly leaves out “at the border” from last week’s version. This is an important win for Theresa May, in allowing future regulatory checks to be carried out at the point of despatch or arrival.\u0026nbspWhat the document says:\u0026nbspNoting that the United Kingdom has decided that the principle of free movement of persons between the Union and the United Kingdom will no longer apply, the parties should establish mobility arrangements, as set out below.What it really means:\u0026nbspThe section on mobility now starts by asserting that “free movement of persons” will come to an end. Someone has joked that “freedom of movement” is being replaced by “liberty of mobility”, but that is not (yet) fair.\u0026nbspWhat the document says:\u0026nbspThe parties agree to consider conditions for entry and stay for purposes such as research, study, training and youth exchanges.What it really means:\u0026nbspSpecifying the possible purposes for which EU citizens in the UK and UK citizens in the EU might “stay” is new.\u0026nbspWhat the document says:\u0026nbspWithin the context of the overall economic partnership the parties should establish a new fisheries agreement on, inter alia, access to waters and quota shares.What it really means:\u0026nbspScottish Conservative MPs warned the prime minister that they could not accept fishing quota shares being included in the future trade deal. But they have been. More trouble ahead.\u0026nbspWhat the document says:\u0026nbspBoth parties affirm that the achievements, benefits and commitments of the peace process in Northern Ireland will remain of paramount importance to peace, stability and reconciliation. They agree that the Good Friday or Belfast Agreement reached on 10 April 1998 by the United Kingdom government, the Irish government and the other participants in the multi-party negotiations must be protected in all its parts, and that this extends to the practical application of the 1998 agreement on the island of Ireland and to the totality of the relationships set out in the 1998 agreement.What it really means:\u0026nbspThe explicit reference to the Good FridayBelfast Agreement has been added, and the phrase “must be protected in all its parts”. But this won’t be enough to reassure the DUP or Conservatives worried about Northern Ireland being kept in parts of the EU single market when the rest of the UK is not.\u0026nbspWhat the document says:\u0026nbspIn setting out the framework of the future relationship between the Union and the United Kingdom, this declaration confirms, as set out in the withdrawal agreement, that it is the clear intent of both parties to develop in good faith agreements giving effect to this relationship and to begin the formal process of negotiations as soon as possible after the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the Union, such that they can come into force by the end of 2020.What it really means:\u0026nbspThe section on the timetable for negotiating the full trade treaty has been expanded, but with little actual substance. Instead of “using best endeavours to ensure” the treaty can take effect by the end of 2020, it now speaks of the “intent … to develop in good faith”. Which sounds a bit weaker to me, but I’m not an international trade negotiator.\u0026nbspAs\u0026nbspNick Macpherson, the former permanent secretary to the Treasury, commented: “With no legal status a political declaration can be all things to all people.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

She said it was her “intention to work towards frictionless trade”.* The backstop – MPs will vote, in June 2020, whether to trigger the safeguard to prevent the return of checks at the Irish border, by the UK staying in the EU’s\u0026nbspcustoms territory.* Ending the transition – which is due to run until December 2020, but could be extended until the end of 2022, past the June 2022 election, if MPs choose that option over triggering the backstop.Created with Sketch.

It falls far short of our – Labour’s – six tests.”Theresa May’s strategy for getting her Brexit deal through?

The plan stated: “We will improve the credit blacklist system, publicly disclose the records of enterprises and iniduals’ untrustworthiness on a regular basis, and form a pattern of distrust and punishment.”Car ploughs into crowd outside primary school in China, killing fiveTrump aide says China could be evicted from WTO as trade war ramps upGovernment spending foreign aid money to promote fracking in ChinaFor those deemed untrustworthy, “everywhere is limited, and it is difficult to move, so that those who violate the law and lose the trust will pay a heavy price”.The credit system is already being rolled out in some areas and in recent months the Chinese state has blocked millions of people from booking flights and high-speed trains.According to the state-run news outlet Global Times, as of May this year, the government had\u0026nbspblocked 11.14 million people from flights and 4.25 million from taking high-speed train trips.The state has also begun to clamp down on luxury options: 3\u0026nbspmillion people are barred from getting business class train tickets, according to Channel News Asia.China tell ambassadors not to ‘interfere’ on Muslim re-education campsThe aim, according to Hou Yunchun, former deputy director of the development research centre of the State Council, is to make “discredited people become bankrupt”, he said earlier this year. The eastern state of Hangzou, southwest of Shanghai, is one area where a social credit system is already in place. People are awarded credit points for activities such as undertaking volunteer work and giving blood donations while those who violate traffic laws and charge “under-the-table” fees are punished. Other infractions reportedly include\u0026nbspsmoking in non-smoking zones, buying too many video games and posting fake news online.Punishments are not clearly detailed in the government plan, but beyond making travel difficult, are also believed to include slowing internet speeds, reducing access to good schools for iniduals or their children, banning people from certain jobs, preventing booking at certain hotels and losing the right to own pets.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Lebanese army soldiers march during a parade to mark the 75th anniversary of Lebanon\u0027s Independence Day, in Beirut, commemorating the liberation from the French Mandate on 22 November 1943Indian Muslim devotees wave flags as they parade atop vehicles along a street during Eid-Milad-Un-Nabi celebrations in Varanasi in the Indian state of Uttar PradeshAt least 50 people were killed and dozens more injured when a suicide bomber targeted a group of Muslim religious scholars in Kabul, officials in Afghanistan say.A view of the Fuego volcano eruption at sunrise, seen from El Rodeo, Escuintla, Guatemala.

For years there has been concern that Prince Charles would attempt to influence political and public decision-making, unlike his mother Queen Elizabeth, 92, who is scrupulously non-political. In \u0026ldquoCharles, Prince of Wales, author Anthony Holden describes how Charles felt about democracy.The Prince professed himself to be \u0026ldquotroubled by the fact that the voters today tend to go for a particular party and not for the inidual candidate, because they vote for the politics of a party.He thought it \u0026ldquowrong that a below-par Conservative candidate should win votes simply because he toed the party line against nationalism or the abolition of the public school.Prince Charles made a risqu\u0026eacute joke to Parliament during his trip to Bermuda for the 350th anniversary of the island\u0026rsquos Parliament.Charles joked: \u0026ldquoBearing in mind I am the first Charles to have anything to do with Parliament for 350 years, I might have turned nasty and dissolved you.There are no formal rules on what royals can or cannot say in public (Image: Getty)Such interventions in matters of public debate have stoked concern for those who believe the royals should not get involved in such affairsThe Prince of Wales has created his own role as a royal activist and entrepreneur. His organisation, The Prince\u0026rsquos Charities, is the UK\u0026rsquos largest multi-cause charity, and he was an early promoter of corporate social responsibility.Unlike the Queen, Prince Charles has been outspoken on subjects from London\u0026rsquos architecture to nanotechnology. He has been a figurehead for rallying world leaders to tackle climate change, and a dogged opponent of GM crops.Although there are no formal rules on what royals can or cannot say in public, an unwritten assumption is that they cannot meddle with party politics.Prince Charles made a risqu\u0026eacute joke to Parliament during his trip to Bermuda (Image: Getty)Ministers in the last Labour government have said he tried to influence policy on issues such as grammar schools and homeopathic medicine.There is also the ongoing legal saga over the so-called \u0026lsquoblack spider\u0026rsquo memos, a collection of letters he wrote to government ministers.Many are sympathetic to Prince Charles\u0027s involvement in politics up to now.

The document reads: \u0026ldquoWithin the context of the overall economic partnership the parties should establish a new fisheries agreement on, inter alia, access to waters and quota shares. \u0026ldquoThe parties will use their best endeavours to conclude and ratify their new fisheries agreement by July 1 2020 in order for it to be in place n time to be used for determining fishing opportunities for the first year after the transition.                Tory minister reveals his SECRET Brexit chat with Michel Barnier                 Pound to euro exchange rate: Sterling \u0026lsquoon the back foot\u0026rsquoBrussels negotiator Michel Barnier was told during a series of crunch meetings before the document\u0027s leak that sections on potential access to UK fishing must be bulked up.France argued that EU fishing vessels should be allowed access to the UK\u0027s waters as part of any future trade deal that allows Britain access to the single market.Spain, Portugal, the Netherlands, Belgium and Denmark also put Mr Barnier\u0027s task force under pressure to ensure a deal would be pushed in the blue print for a future trade deal.The political declaration is the non-binding roadmap that UK and EU officials will use to negotiate the future trading and security relationship after Brexit.Brexit news: Political declaration shows UK will commit to striking fishing deal with EU (Image: )The 26-page blueprint has grown from seven pages after its initial publication alongside the Brexit withdrawal agreement last week.It charts future ideas, plans and promises on how the UK and EU can work together on trade and security.After late night talks between Theresa May and Jean-Claude Juncker in Brussels on Wednesday, the European Commission President told the European Council that an agreement had been reached between UK and EU officials.The document will now be circulated around member states to review ahead of Sunday\u0027s special Brexit summit, where EU leaders will rubber stamp the plans.Mr Tusk wrote on Twitter: I have just sent to EU27 a draft political declaration on the future relationship between EU and UK.The Commission President has informed me that it has been agreed at negotiators\u0027 level and agreed in principle at political level, subject to the endorsement of the leaders.                How Greece had 17 HOURS to avoid abyss - what May is facing...                 Merkel desperate for Spain to \u0027SHUT UP\u0027 \u0026ndash FEARS EU pushing UK too farBoth sides have agreed to build and improve on the single customs territory provided for in the Withdrawal Agreement, which has been drawn out in previous European Council negotiating guidelines.This partnership will be comprehensive, encompassing a free trade area as well as wider sectoral cooperation where it is in the mutual interest of both parties, the declaration adds.It will be underpinned by provisions ensuring a level playing field for open and fair competition.It should facilitate trade and investment between the Parties to the extent possible, while respecting the integrity of the Union\u0027s Single Market and the Customs Union as well as the United Kingdom\u0027s internal market, and recognising the development of an independent trade policy by the United Kingdom beyond this economic partnership.In an olive branch to Mrs May in her fight to keep rebel Tory MPs under control, Brussels have allowed their maximum facilitation to be considered as an option to avoid the Irish backstop, the insurance policy to avoid a hard border on Ireland.The declaration reads: The Parties recall their determination to replace the backstop solution on Northern Ireland by a subsequent agreement that establishes alternative arrangements for ensuring the absence of a hard border on the island of Ireland on a permanent footing.Such facilitative arrangements and technologies will also be considered in developing any alternative arrangements for ensuring the absence of a hard border on the island of Ireland on a permanent footing, it adds.Britain will also commit to developing a level playing field with Brussels after a number of member states tabled concerns about the UK securing an economic advantage by undercutting EU rules and standards.The future relationship must ensure open and fair competition, the document reads.Provisions to ensure this should cover state aid, competition, social and employment standards, environmental standards, climate change, and relevant tax matters, building on the level playing field arrangements provided for in the Withdrawal Agreement and commensurate with the overall economic relationship.This will likely change as French President Emmanual Macron, the driving force behind the demands, takes to the negotiating table on Sunday.Influential Conservative MEP David Campbell Bannerman said the UK\u0027s commitment was worrying.Mr Campbell Banner, who is championing a \u0027Super Canada deal\u0027 also suggested tax matters should be left as a sovereign decision by the UK Government.He said: While I broadly welcome on trade an agreement that definitely looks like Super Canada and not Chequers, this clause is worrying.One of the main benefits of Brexit is the ability to cut EU overregulation, this ties our hands.Tax matters are a clear sovereign area, the EU is worried about the UK becoming super competitive and trying to hold us back, he adds.

In any case, further negotiations would only be possible if other European countries were also prepared to continue.A late \u0026ldquono vote could also be followed by further negotiations, but only if the two-year window dictated by Article 50 is extended.That can only happen with the unanimous agreement of the other member states.

Preferably driving John Barrowman’s jeep.But definitely presenting I’m A Celebrity . . . Get Me Out Of Here! which kicked off, on Sunday night, with Dec hosting and Holly ­Willoughby hanging around like a competition winner.An arrangement that would be unsustainable in other years. I’m prepared to cut the  series some slack, though, for two reasons.First, it is purely a temporary pairing and, second, ITV has promised me Noel Edmonds, who shouldn’t just have been the first one in the camp, he should’ve been choppered in about eight years ago, when the contestants started all this “bonding” rubbish, which has ruined more series than I care to remember.Oh, what some of them could’ve done with a one-man feud generator like Noel, whose Wikipedia entry will give you a fair idea of his inner turmoil even before you get to the bit where he says: “When I die, my energy willto where it came from.” Ilford He’s also got a le-size mannequin doll called Candice, who accompanies him everywhere and would be a more than welcome replacement for a few of the camp mates, who’ve got a bit of a Rita Who and Knob Too feel about them this year.The knob part of that equation, fairly obviously, is all-singing, all-dancing John Barrowman “MBE” , who described himself as “fabulous”, “an icon” and “down-to-earth” within the space of one sentence, on Sunday, and was wrong on every count.He also hit on the yacht waiter, using one of his dance moves.“It’s a pas de bourrée. Kick ball, change and turn. Can you do that ”“I’m not allowed.”Not even the kick balls bit Shame. He needs someone to calm him down.Although, as horrendous as it must be to live with, I don’t mind Barrowman on I’m A Celeb, as the show does need a massive irritant to get under everyone’s skin.On similar grounds, I also welcome EastEnders’ Rita Simons, who looks like she might have a tantrum or two in her, Nick Knowles, who will be incapable of stling his Sir Galahad complex, and Harry Redknapp, just because he’s Harry Redknapp.Of the others The public jury’s probably still out on Emily Atack and The Chase Governess Anne Hegerty, who “used to be a Brownie”, as well as eating a lot of them.Mentally, though, I have already completely written off Coronation Street’s Sair Khan, some bloke off Hollyoaks, The Vamps’ James McVey and X Factor’s Fleur East, who arrived dressed as a dispatch rider for the first episode.Possibly for the very good reason she’s now working as one.This might sound like a hasty and fairly damning assessment, I realise, but compared to some series, four solidly promising bookings isn’t actually a bad .What it very clearly needs, though, is Edmonds, because, without him, Sunday’s opening episode, for all its high adrenaline thrills, became a bit of a drag.It usually does, of course, as the celebs haven’t yet let their guard drop.But, in this instance it meant the spotlight fell on Holly Willoughby, and you quickly realised Dec hasn’t had to work this hard since he tried bouncing jokes off Hogan the Koala.Just as Edmonds could turn out to be a massive disappointment, Holly Willoughby could get the hang of I’m A Celeb, obviously.At the moment, though, her one signicant contribution came after the parachuting challenge when she asked: “How come Shane had a helmet and Emily didn’t ”’Cos the bloke was doing all the hard work and she was just hanging around.Buckle up, Dec.Alastair Campbell’s far-too-frequent Good Morning Britain appearances always proving as welcome as a turd in a swimming pool.Strictly stars forever banging on about reaching Blackpool without ever mentioning it means they get paid more.Every wretched, product-placing second of the entertainment on Friday’s Children In Need.And particularly EastEnders’ big song-and-dance routine, which had the Disney Company’s Angela Affinita claiming: “We have Letitia Dean actually interacting with Mickey Mouse.”Good luck with that one, Mickey.IF you want to know just how brutally British republicans would mistreat the Royal Family,they ever came to power, just take a look at what those who claim to love them the most do to the Windsors now.Stuff like We Are Most Amused And Amazed, a th birthday tribute, hosted by Armstrong  Miller, on ITV, that probably left the future King Charles III thinking Charles I got off lightly.Two hours of canned laughter and pick-a-card-any-card magical tw*ttery with the likes of Sandi Toksvig, who took  seconds to remind us she’s gay, Omid Djalili, who took an entire  seconds to remind us he’s Iranian, and Rowan Atkinson, who rather set the evening’s tone by announcing: “As the more perceptive of you will have noticed, this is hell.”There was a family of German illusionists as well, which I thought was a bit insensitive, given the royal circumstances, plus Sooty  Sweep and a lot of grovelling from randoms, like Cheryl Tweedy and Kylie Minogue.Presumably because they could both be guaranteed to keep a straight face when describing the birthday boy as “a style icon” and “philanthropist”.Then, at the end of it all, dear old Charles shuffled on, waved and thanked everybody.And he may even have meant every syllable of it as well, given that Alexander Armstrong thrilled the Palladium crowd by deciding not to sing.Truly, the Royal Family is the most wondrous thing.Jenny Eclair: “The last thing any woman needs, during or after the menopause, is a bothersome vagina.”Tough, you’ve got one for another  minutes.MEANWHILE, desperate times call for desperate means at the rugby, as England trail Japan - and Sir Clive Woodward suggests: “We’ve got to start using our physicality, just outside the rucks, to suck these Japanese guys.”A WELCOME antidote to all of the lazy, repetitive, biased, hideously self-satisfied and right-on comedy broadcast by the BBC and Channel  finally reappeared, on Saturday night.Michael McIntyre’s Big Show, on BBC, which has to be the most perfectly judged hour of television, all year.A quota-free joy that’s warm, funny and has mainstream appeal, without ever being too cloying, safe, predictable or slick, as you will have noticed when Lionel Blair completely sabotaged the “Unexpected Star” reveal, in a pop-up Zimmer frame shop, with -year-old David Owen.“Say hello to David,” McIntyre whispered into his ear-piece.“Hello David!”Pause. “How does he know my name’s David ”Well, quite. Among his other gts, though, Michael McIntyre, above, has the ability to charm and ad-lib his way out of these situations, which gives his Big Show a seat-of-its-pants feel, despite being one of the most carefully structured formats on television.As anyone with a brain can see, in fact, it should be the blueprint for almost everything BBC comedy does.So I can pretty much guarantee, this time next year, Have I Got News, The Mash Report and Frankie Boyle’s New World Order will still be telling us how much they hate Brexit and Donald Trump and someone from the BBC, on £, a year, will be assuring licence-payers: “Sara Pascoe is the future of comedy.”Pointless Celebrities: “Hi, I’m Luisa Omielan and I’m a comedian.” Bless.And Good Morning Britain, Susanna Reid: “I don’t think the word ambition applies to me. I don’t have any ambition.”WHO said the following on live TV, last week “The colon has been mobilised and we’re very close to the moment the bowel’s coming out.”A Nicky Campbell on Channel ’s Removing The Tumour B Theresa May in Downing Street Joe Lycett: “Measuring the strength of earth-quakes, the Richter scale was invented by Charles who ”The Chase, Bradley Walsh: “Between Newcastle and Gateshead, the King Edward Bridge spans what river ”And Joe Lycett: “Nicola Sturgeon, a Scot or a fish ”Kristy: “A fish.”MICHAEL McIntyre’s Big Show.

After all, the notion that Merkel, Macron et al will bite off their own electorate’s noses to spite Britain’s volte face on EU membership is an absolute nonsense.In a letter to The Times yesterday, the chairman of pub chain JD Wetherspoon, Tim Martin, wrote: “The great urban myth, promoted by advocates of the deadly exchange rate mechanism, the euro and Remain, is that a ‘deal’ with the EU is a prerequisite of future prosperity.”The reality, he says, is that no deal would allow us to join successful countries such as Canada, Singapore, Israel and Australia in the free-trading world and “by slashing the EU’s , protectionist tarfs, shop prices will fall, with no loss to the Treasury, since tarf income is currently remitted to Brussels”.On top of that, we won’t have to pay the £billion orce bill, will regain control of our fishing waters, borders and laws and, ultimately, all have more money in our pockets.

Or, in John Sergeant and Ann Widdecombe’s case, common moths in freefall after a battering from a tea towel.But former Pussycat Doll Ashley is used to performing complicated dance routines in front of huge crowds and, therefore, oozed confidence and expertise from the get go.Little wonder since, according to her former dance teacher in the US, she was taught “all dferent styles of dance” from the age of eight to  and once had an introduction to ballroom training by an elite dance company at summer school.So yes, she’s undoubtedly the best, with former Steps trouper Faye Tozer not far behind. But the true Strictly stars are all the others who improve each week despite being way outside their comfort zone.FOLLOWING the shocking attack of a female PC being karate-kicked to the ground by a thug, the flippant commentary accompanying the footage is indeed sickening.But at least the film might help secure a prosecution and hopefully prove a turning point in how we take back control of our lawless streets.Because the real problem here is the fact that thugs clearly don’t fear the consequences of their actions.So may I humbly suggest that it’s high time the Home Office toughens up and shows, not tells, our hard-pressed police that they now have the power and support they need from on high to do their job effectively.CHECK out poo guru Gillian McKeith out on the town with her smiling -year-old daughter Skylar.Considering my daughters won’t be seen dead with meI wear anything more risqué than a baggy polo neck and tweed maxi skirt, she’s very fortunate indeed.THE £.

In , we expect our national broadcaster to reflect all our opinions even-handedly.We don’t want the BBC to tell us that one side is right and the other wrong, or what we should believe, or which opinions are “true” and which are “”.But that is what the BBC has started to do, at least on the subject of Brexit.The BBC tried to be reasonably balanced during the referendum campaign, but it was so upset by the outcome that it has abandoned any attempt at impartiality and become grotesquely one-sided.The views of Remainers are not just over-represented, they are rarely challenged. And scare stories about Brexit which are either exaggerated or completely imaginary are presented as fact.I decided to compile a list of myths about Brexit — particularly scare stories about what will happen when we leave the Customs Union orwe leave Europe without a deal.Then I compared them with the facts. Although the pamphlet did not mention the BBC, most of the myths were things we hear daily on its programmes.The BBC rose to the bait and invited me into the Today programme on Radio  yesterday to be grilled by John Humphrys, its star interviewer. It was a fair enough interview. He challenged my arguments but I was able to refute his claims point by point.However, they then brought on a chap called Chris Morris, described as the BBC “reality checker”, who was invited to rebut my document. But all he did was oppose my facts with the opinions of people with whom he agreed.He systematically argued the Remain case and defended their Project Fear scare stories. The one thing he did not do was bring in any new facts. My central claim was thatwe leave the EU Customs Union but have a free trade agreement with the European Union, our businesses have little to fear.The main dference will be that traders will have to send in a customs declaration detailing the goods they are buying from or selling to Europe.That is a nuisance which we should try to simply as much as possible.But allegations that “this will be hugely costly, cause y delays, disrupt supply chains and undermine economic growth” are imaginary or exaggerated.“Fact checker” Morris said the majority of trade experts and freight companies to whom he had spoken robustly disagreed with me. This is an opinion, not a fact.Surely,trading in a free trade area — like that which exists between Switzerland and the EU or between Canada and the US — is so intolerable, the people there would be calling for a customs union.But they aren’t. I prefer their practical experience to the speculation of Mr Morris’s contacts.I also quoted a report by the CLECAT organisation, which covers , companies handling  per cent of the freight and customs in Europe, who said: “All the ingredients to ensure a smooth exit process of the UK from the EU, and which allow almost frictionless trade after the exit, are already available.”Why should a BBC fact checker’s unnamed contacts count for more than their considered view He then claimed there are no checks at the border at present. I go across to my house in France frequently and see the checks — for drugs, illegal immigrants, alcohol, cigarettes.And companies have to report all their cross-border trade separately on their VAT s and provide statistical s to Brussels.Then Mr Morris claimed there would be more checks by our customs officers at Dover, resulting in delays and disruption. That is nonsense.The Head of Customs and Revenue has said it only stops and searches lorries at present where it has intelligence information about drugs, illegal immigrants, and goods such as tobacco and alcohol, upon which excise duty is paid.It does not expect any of these risks to become more frequent. So it will not need to search any more vehicles.As I was still in the studio, I was able to rebut his pathetic attempts to rebut my facts.

Enough was enough.Feeling West Midlands Police were doing little to help, he took to social media to encourage his community to police itself.Wayne says: “I wanted to set the group up because crime is getting out of hand, it’s running the area down.He was stunned when more than , members, all desperate to work together to keep each other safe, joined his online vigilante community - clearly the issue had struck a nerve.We Stand Together is one of a growing number of vigilante groups across the UK patrolling their own streets.Kingshurst residents Wayne, , and Tracy Quinn, , set up the group and now carry out twice-weekly patrols across the city - the Sun Online joined the pair on one this week.Were vigilantes with a twist, says Wayne.The group dont exact revenge or try and solve crimes. They patrol their area in high-vis jackets, knocking on residents and businesses doors proving reassurance.When Tracy and Wayne see a crime being committed, or the aftermath of a criminal activity, they alert the online community so anyone  local to that area can come out and assist.There is no law against the operation of vigilante groups - but police have warned that some techniques used, especially by paedophile hunting gangs, could cross into legally dangerous territory.They can tip off police to crimes being committed due to their network among the comunity, and could perform citizens arrests - but members of We Stand Determined say they would only do that in extreme circumstances.Due to a potential lack of legal training some evidence gathered by vigilante groups could actually damage any attempts at prosecution.In a judgement given at Newcastle Crown Court sparked by a paedophile hunter group, legal teams argued evidence gathered by them should be governed by the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act.However the judge in the case, Mr Justice Langstaff said there was no legal requirement for the group to be subject to controls, as they acted as private citizens.Police guidelines from the National Police Chief Council’s meeting in July of this year recommended police forces didn’t work with or endorse activities of vigilante groups.They then call the police and await their response – but admit in exceptional circumstances they will try to intervene and issue a citizen arrest.The areas they patrol include five crime hotspots – Smith’s Wood, Castle Bromwich, Kingshurst, Marston Green and Chelmsley Wood.In Smith’s Wood there is a rotation of seven officers and seven PCSOs on duty for the area, which at the last census in  had a population of ,.Between October  and September  a staggering . per cent of reported crime saw no further action taken. One person has been recorded as being sent to prison.In Chelmsley Wood, with a  population of , and patrolled by eight officers and four PCSOs, . per cent of crimes reported there have been shelved with no further action taken.Although the crime rate for Solihull is currently slightly lower than the average for other areas policed by West Midlands Police, data shows there has been a sharp rise in crime rates between September  and October .Last month a -year-old woman was set upon by three men after they broke into her house and stole her handbag.In recent weeks police have appealed for help with a suspected car burglary, an attempted break in, an attack on an Asda security guard and four arson attacks in these areas.Walking the streets of Birmingham, Wayne and Tracy seem unafraid of their surroundings, and are more concerned with knocking on doors to make sure residents felt safe.Ivan, who was checked in on by the pair, told us: “It’s a good thing to have people like this around. Usually we don’t open our door after tea time.“It’s nice to have good people out there.”One elderly man tells us the nights where he lives in Birmingham could be bad, but said his safety was increased with groups like We Stand Determined enforcing safety in that area.One worker for Norwich Express in Marston Green, who asked not to be named for fears over her safety, revealed just a week before men had come into the shop armed with guns demanding the till be emptied before they jetted away in a stolen car.And in a nearby Nisa Local shop, a member of staff claimed an unknown man who had been relentlessly shoplting over the last four weeks – with a lack of police action seemingly allowing him to walk away freely and pop back whenever he needed more.Kanlesh Patel says: “The police don’t want to know about anything under one hundred pounds worth of stuff.“They think it’s not worth pursuing. It’s getting worse because even the criminal knows these facts.“They’ll do it in front with you, with no shame.”Vigilante groups – once the staple of Wild West movies – are springing up as a response to the feral thugs causing widespread misery.“The police don’t do much, they pretend,” says one member of We Stand Determined.He adds ruefully: “The country has gone to heck in a hand basket.”Police guidelines from the National Police Chief Council’s meeting in July of this year recommended police forces didn’t work with or endorse activities of vigilante groups.We Stand Determined says it wants to work with police, but previously said the cops can only do what they can with the numbers they have – since  the West Midlands Police budget has been cut by £million and lost , officers.Documents from the council meeting stated “red lines” these groups could cross which would lessen their efforts, for example by making evidence unable to be used in court.But as officer numbers dwindle and cuts are made, members of We Stand Determined feel they have been forced to pitch in.Tracy and Wayne tell us due to Birmingham’s small, close-knit communities, victims often did not wish to reveal they had been affected by crime due to not wanting the attention, potentially leading to further ordeals.However Michael Bubb, a senior member of the group, reveals he joined after being the victim of a theft.He says: “A group of travellers jumped over my garden fence and stole items they could get too, I called the police and received a crime reference number but that’s all I received.”Now, with a huge influx in numbers, We Stand Determined hope to set up buddy systems for the elderly and self-defence classes for anyone who feels they need them.But Wayne and Tracy are not alone in their desperate quest for community-led justice.Residents of Hartlepool, County Durham, also carry out their own beats to deter burglaries and thefts after Cleveland Police suffered £million in cuts.There are now just  officers on duty overnight in the town, which has a population of ,, while their cars sit empty without enough officers to fill them.A BBC News investigation found that on a recent Saturday night, all  officers were dealing with incidents and there was no one left to handle emergency calls.Earlier this year we reported another group, dubbed the EssexAngels, set up a system to patrol their streets after police cuts left them feeling fearful of crime.And it was revealed all over the country desperate Brits have been paying as little as £-a-month for almost a quarter of a million private policemen to patrol the streets, tackling everything from race hate to stolen puppies.In September this year, officers had , crimes reported to them according to the latest statistics.The same statistic for September in  is ,.In , officers had , reports of crime in September.While in , they had , reported for the month.The crimes include anti-social behaviour, burglary, robbery, theft.West Midlands Police is the second largest police force in the UK, covering an area of  square miles.It serves a population of almost . million.Murder rates have soared by  per cent in the city this year, while the number of cases of possessing a kne jumped by almost  per cent to , last year.Its unemployment rates have risen to one of the highest in the UK, with some , people claiming benefits as of August .Councillor Mark Wilson, for Smith’s Wood, told Birmingham Live people were “losing confidence” in police presence.He said he was concerned “anything could happen” with groups taking on crime themselves, adding: “I think that is an issue … They could be the victims of assault or they could perpetrate an assault.”It comes after the city reeled after seeing recent footage of a seven-strong group armed with machetes attacking a victim in broad daylight and a clip of traffic warden beaten senseless by a gang of thugs horried global onlookers.Lancashire Chief Constable Andy Rhodes said this week during a debate on public involvement in crimes: “We are not saying to the public that we expect you to get involved in physical violence on the streets.“What we are saying is there are ways and means of helping us and some of the things that we are seeing are hindering us.“This isn’t a green light for have-a-go heroes.”During our time out and about on the streets, Wayne shares how his own criminal past led him to become so determined to transform his community.With a previous charge to his name for a theft in the year  and several other nights spent in custody, he is no longer a person of interest to police for any ongoing crime.Wayne says: “In my past, I have had good and bad times, in my youth I was in a bad place – which led be down paths better left unfollowed.“I know these instances in my past don’t look particularly good, but I want to reassure my group that in the past is where it stays.“I was in a dark space back then, but it has been nearly  years since I was charged with theft – In the now, I just want to help my community.”Affirming her support for both Wayne and the group, Tracy added: “Wayne has chosen to show and share his fallible side, but he’s changed his le for the good.“If all of us were held to every mistake we had made, none of would be anything.”West Midlands Police said they were aware of We Stand Determined and other vigilante groups in the area, but advised members to join police-approved Streetwatch programmes instead."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT000450007830.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"universal credit five week wait could be slashed amber rudd

promised to fix problems with the flagship benefits system and accepted there were areas in which it wasnt working.She told the BBC today that the biggest problem is getting cash into peoples hands as soon as they need it.Advance payments are available for Brits who cant wait five weeks for money, but that has to be paid back immediately out of their first UC sum.Ms Rudd said her department would make it clear to people they can get that upfront as soon as they apply and then pay it back over  months.On a damning report by a UN representative earlier this week, she promised to look at the concerns with women and single mums in particular.But she blasted the findings as being too political and implying the system was there to negatively impact Brits.The aim is to help people when they need it, and help them into work, she told Radio s Today programme.Our motives are to be efficient and compassionate.Ministers have already announced they will give an extra two weeks of several benefits to people on Universal Credit in future - but this wont come in until .At the moment people moving onto the new system get an extra two weeks of just housing benefit to help them cope with the switch.Ms Rudd insisted: The main message I want to give is that Universal Credit is a force for good and we will see how we can fix it.The new benefits system has been beset with issues since it first began being rolled out in .One chippy owner said yesterday the new system was pushing Brits AWAY from work as people couldnt figure out whether they would be better off or not.And earlier this week one desperate mum told how she was forced into sex work to get money for food after waiting for her first payment.One in six Brits still arent getting their first sum on time, the latest Universal Credit stats showed.MANY MPs can’t imagine being truly broke.We don’t mean a bit skint, having to max out the credit card or raid the savings account. We mean having literally no money and going hungry.So it is good to see Amber Rudd, in her first week as Work and Pensions Secretary, consider slashing the five-week wait many claimants endure before their Universal Credit comes through.We support the new benefits system.

I shouldnt have to be begging people for money or for food.He went on: Friends and family have had to give me money - but I will still have to give them their money back.If it wasnt for them, I would be getting into more and more debt.But there are people that dont have friends or family they can turn to.I was going to my sisters house because I knew that I would have a cooked meal then.I dont think I would be hereit wasnt for the help I have had - I think I would have killed myself, or I would definitely have thought about it.There were times that I felt there was no way out. It has been horrible.Eventually Alun was paid the money he was owed, only for the same mistake to happen again the next month.He claims his landlord has been understanding about his late rent payments, but  bill companies are already chasing him for money.He already owes £ for his water, gas and electricity bills, and cant afford to start thinking about Christmas or even run his car.I have had to prioritise and a roof over my head is my first priority - I cant pay for my utilities at the moment so I dont have any choice but to ignore it, he said.I cant budget for anything - I cant buy any Christmas presents at the moment, it is a case of day to day living.A spokesman for the DWP said: “We have paid Mr Krem-Szczesniak the benefits due to him and we are contacting him to discuss his claim as a matter of urgency.We apologise for any inconvenience caused.”Universal Credit, which replaces six benefits with one, is being rolled out across the country -

but some are calling for that vote to be delayed so theres enough time to fix vital issues.They said in a fresh report that there must be an additional two week payment for those on Universal Credit to help ease the pain. And they said there should be NO five-week wait for those who transfer over, and anyone who the DWP already have the information for should not have to apply again.At the moment Brits are entitled to two weeks of extra help with their housing payments, making the wait for their next sum effectively three weeks.Chancellor Philip Hammond revealed in the Budget that this will be extended to people on JSA and ESA -

The CBI had campaigned for Britain to stay in the EU’s single market and customs union permanently but reluctantly backed Mrs May’s deal on Monday. Brexiteers have long criticised the CBI for being too pro-EU and have branded the group the “voice of Brussels”. Their private criticism of the PM’s deal delighted Leave campaigners last night.On Monday CBI boss Carolyn Fairbairn said of the PM’s deal: “Its not perfect, its a compromise, but its progress. It takes us back from the clf edge, avoids no deal, charts potential path to future frictionless trade deal. That is progress, we should not go backwards.And her deputy Josh Hardie yesterday said Britain was “on the cusp on a much-needed agreement” after the Government published the -page Political Declaration, which outlines our future trading relationship with the EU.The document sets out a series of aspirations but lacks any legal grounding and is short on detail – in contrast with the  page Withdrawal Agreement, which is legally binding.He added: The progress made is a credit to both sets of negotiators. But hard work lies ahead“.But the private emails revealed the CBI was actually scathing of the PM and her negotiators and argued over whether they should be publicly praising them given it wasn’t a good deal.The CBI’s Head of EU Negotiations Nicole Sykes sent an internal email arguing that there was “no need to give credit to negotiators I think, because it’s not a good deal”.The quotation marks suggest serious doubts.It is also embarrassing for the Prime Minister, who sold her Brexit deal at the CBI annual conference on Monday – urging voters to “listen to what business is saying.”Former Tory MP and ex-Brexit advisor Stewart Jackson said: “Speaking with forked tongue for their own short term narrow interests  You could knock me down with a feather.”Labour MP Wes Streeting, who backs a second referendum, said: Despite the CBIs public support, it is clear that even the Government’s biggest business backers think this is a bad deal for Britain.There is no support in Parliament, among business or in the country for a deal which takes away control and makes people poorer.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith said: “The last thing we want is for Britain to be tied beyond .“The British people want us to get out. This is a sell-out.”Former Brexit Secretary David Davis said: “This is £billion for a pig in a poke.“The EU’s got nailed down everything it wants whilst leaving us on a half promise of what we want.”And Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn called it “ pages of waffle”.He said: “The only certainty contained within these pages is that the transition period will have to be extended or we will end up with backstop and no exit.“It represents the worst of all worlds, no say over the rules that will continue to apply and no certainty to the future.”He accused the PM of producing a “blindfold Brexit from a government that spent more time negotiating with itself than for the nation”.In yesterday’s document, the EU agreed the UK can end free movement, try to negotiate deals with the rest of the world and take back control of fisheries.But the EU refused to accept that a future EU-UK trade deal will allow Mrs May “frictionless trade” and insisted the UK will be bound by EU rules on everything from state aid to climate change.And it only accepted that technology would be “considered” as a way of preventing theof a hard border in Irelanda future trade deal is not agreed.The terms will almost certainly be formally agreed by Mrs May and  other EU leaders at a crunch summit in Brussels on Sunday. This will trigger the orce bill of up to £billion.In a fierce Commons exchange, the PM resorted to urging MPs to back the deal when it goes before the Commons because the public is bored.She insisted “Brexit is within our grasp” adding: “The British people want Brexit to be settled.“They want a good deal that sets us on course for a brighter future.“And they want us to come together as a country and to move on to focus on the big issues at home, like our NHS.”She once more ruled out the prospect of a second referendum.And Downing Street insisted it will never happen “while she is Prime Minister”.But Brexiteers lined up to slam the agreement — fuelling concerns it will never make it through the Commons in a critical “Meaningful Vote” in three weeks’ time.More than  Tories are thought to be ready to vote down the deal — alongside the DUP, SNP and most Labour MPs.Cabinet ministers spent much of a conference call with Mrs May ­yesterday morning debating how to sell the deal to the nation.Last night Chief Whip Julian Smith emailed Tory MPs urging them to “unite” and back the PM. He told backbenchers: “If we reject this deal we go back to square one.“This would mean damaging uncertainty which will threaten jobs, investment and the economy.”Home Secretary Sajid Javid insisted the deal “delivers on the referendum” — although he admitted the Government must do a “better job of selling” it.But Boris Johnson said the terms of the Brexit deal made a “complete nonsense of Brexit”.And Brexiteers warned they could not support a deal which still included the so-called Irish backstop plan for keeping the border open.But Mrs May insisted it would only kick ina new trade deal isn’t in place by January .But it is still just a woolly and even contradictory wishlist that barely binds Brussels to anything.The cost of these vague promises Some  thousand million pounds.This “political declaration” about the future is predicated on Brussels negotiating a trade deal in good faith, a ­quality they have never shown since the referendum result they are even now desperate to overthrow.Why would their puerile desire to “punish” Britain abate once we nominally leave next March  Especially when under the terms now agreed they can trap us in the Customs Union for ever The PM claims the EU wouldn’t want us there, benefiting from it for free, having ended free movement.

Britains EU departure was plunged into chaos again today - despite Mrs May a new -page declaration on future trade with Brussels. Mrs May had hoped the new pact, her rabbit out of a hat, would persuade Tory Brexit-backers to swing behind her deal. Even tonight No insisted there was strong support for the deal from the Cabinet and Mrs May would win a Commons vote. But just hours after she published it, key Tories - including Boris Johnson - lined up to say the package was unacceptable. Even Owen Paterson and Iain Duncan Smith, who Mrs May singled out for thanks for their ideas, said they could not back the deal. That means the entire deal could face a crushing defeat in the House of Commons before Christmas.  That would send Brexit back to square one, throw the UK into chaos, and could force the Prime Minister from office. It could lead to a general election or even a second EU referendum - which she has called no Brexit at all. Todays document, together with a -page withdrawal agreement, is set to be approved by  EU leaders at a summit this Sunday. Last weeks withdrawal text had angered Tories, Labour and the DUP by keeping the UK under EU customs rulesthere is no solution to the Northern Ireland border. It could also extend the Brexit transition period to December  - after the next election.  So Mrs May tried to soothe nerves by agreeing a -page declaration on future trade this morning with EU chiefs. The declaration promises a free trade area and a future deal on fishing. But it stops short of the frictionless trade Mrs May wanted, warns the UK would keep deep links to EU regulations, and keeps some ties to the European Court of Justice. The EU has agreed a two-part Brexit deal - and it has enraged Tories. Here are some of the reasons why:The transition period can be extended until December  - after next election Goods face being checked between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK We need the EUs permission to quit the backstop European courts will still have a big hold on the UK Wed need deep co-operation with EU rules We could have to allow access to our fishing waters And finally... the whole thing is very vagueFOR THE FULL GUIDE CLICK HERE And the Prime Ministers deal was today trashed by leading Brexiteers as she tried to defend it in the House of Commons. Boris Johnson said nothing in her new pact would change the backstop - backup plan - which could trap the UK in EU rules. He called on her to junk the backstop which makes a complete nonsense of Brexit. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Brexiteer ringleader who has sent a no confidence letter in the PM, warned her deal made EU law superior. Theresa May has a Brexit deal, but the danger is looming that it will be defeated in the House of Commons. Even getting it past her Cabinet forced Esther McVey and Dominic Raab to resign. Now she faces two more hurdles - an EU summit with  leaders on November , and then the vote in Parliament at some point before Christmas. MPs are grouped in several factions - their warring opinions are explained more fully here. But or more vote against the deal, they will defeat the deal. Against the deal TORY BREXITEERS: There are up to  , led by Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg. They will vote down a deal that keeps Britain trapped in vassalage with Brussels. TORY HARD REMAINERS: Only about a dozen, but many - including Justine Greening and Jo Johnson - will vote against, instead wanting a second referendum. DUP: Theresa Mays Northern Irish allies - who she handed pound.bn - are -strong. They will vote down the dealit allows customs checks between Ulster and Britain. LABOUR LOYALISTS: About  MPs are consistently loyal to Jeremy Corbyn on Brexit. The party has confirmed theyll be told to vote against the deal because it doesnt meet Labours six tests. LABOUR REMAINERS: There are about  hard Remainer Labour MPs. Theyre likely to oppose the deal to avoid enabling a Brexit.OTHERS: The SNP , Lib Dems , Plaid Cymruand Greensare all likely to vote against. For the deal TORY LOYALISTS: Well over  are likely to vote with Theresa May, for the deal. Many have paid government jobs - so would have to quitthey oppose her. NERVOUS LABOUR: Some Labour MPs could BACK a deal - fearing otherwise Britain will be plunged into an even worse No Deal. There could be  or more. Caroline Flint is among them. UnknownLABOUR BREXITEERS: There are only about half a dozen. It was generally thought theyd side with Theresa May, but Kate Hoey MP broke ranks and said she could vote against. And former Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab said the deal gives even more away to the EU. Earlier this week Brexiteers Iain Duncan Smith and Owen Paterson visited No with tech experts in a bid to find a solution for the Northern Ireland border. Mrs May thanked them for their ideas in her speech. But Owen Paterson ed her praise by warning her deal spelt the horror of Northern Ireland being split off.  And Iain Duncan Smith said: None of this is at all workable unless we get the Withdrawal Agreement now amended.  November : Emergency EU summit with  other leaders to sign off the deal. Early December  A vote in the House of Commons on the deal.  December: The last chance EU Council summit, where deal could come back for more negotiation.  December: Parliament rises for its Christmas break. Final or re-run vote by MPs must be held before now. If it fails there could be no deal, or a general election, or a second EU referendum.  March : Brexit Day. If theres a deal, this will be a total anticlimax because a transition will be in place. If theres No Deal, planes could be grounded, ports jammed up and customs checks thrown into chaos at pm.  December : If theres a deal, this is when the transition period - which continues pretty much all the EU rules we have now - is supposed to end. But it could be extended by two more years.  January : If theres still no deal, under current plans a backstop would kick in. This could keep the UK tied to EU customs rules, until a proper agreement is reached, in exchange for keeping the Northern Ireland border open. Read the full guide to the timetable here. Mrs May today told MPs a final deal is within our grasp and said the new text was a good deal for our country and our partners in the EU. She tried to take on Tory criticisms head-on, saying it ends the jurisdiction of EU courts in the UK, would not trade off access to UK fishing waters, and ends free movement once and for all. But Jeremy Corbyn dismissed it as waffle, telling MPs: She says nothing is agreed until everything is agreed. Its clear from this document that indeed, nothing is agreed. This is the blindfold Brexit we all feared - a leap into the dark. A Number  spokesman said the Prime Minister was “seeking to persuade all of our colleagues of the merits of this deal and requesting their support.” He added she was confident of winning the vote in the Commons.

But five days later the company told him he would not be receiving the money because there had been a software mal. The dad-of-two turned down a pound, settlement, which required a nondisclosure agreement, and is now fighting his case in the High Court. He said: They [Betfred] are quick to take peoples money but when it comes to paying out they offered money as a gagging agreement. They have buried their head in the sand. How many are there out there who have signed similar agreements  Ive been bullied. Im just a fish in a big sea and they are a great big shark but Im not going to be forced away just because they are worth billions and Im not. Eventhere was a glitch I did nothing wrong. I played that game and pressed a button. Andrew, of Washingborough, Lincolnshire, started playing Frankie Dettoris Magic Seven with a pound stake in January. He lost almost all of his money to the online game but worked his way up from pound to pound,. One final play then landed him the pound. million jackpot.   Andrew spent pound celebrating his new-found fortune. But Betfred later voided the win saying there was a glitch in the new game release. Peter Coyle, Andrews solicitor, claims the company has refused repeated requests to provide evidence of the computer problem. A preliminary High Court hearing was told this week that the company did not have the game data and could not force the game developer to hand it over. Andrew added: Because I won and for four days they congratulated me for being a millionaire, they should honour that bet.

Unfortunately, and as Mr Green is aware, a new game release suffered a software mal in January this year and no legitimate jackpot win occurred.

A report by Parliament’s Intelligence and Security Committee claims the Security Service MI missed four chances to stop the Manchester Arena attack which killed . ISC chair Dominic Grieve said it was “striking” how many issues which arose in relation to Abedi’s attack and other atrocities last year had previously been raised by the committee in its reports on the   attacks which killed  in  and the killing of Lee Rigby in .  The Conservative MP said: “We have previously made recommendations in all of these areas, yet the Government failed to act on them.” The four key failings concerning Abedi were: He was able to visit an extremist in prison without apparently being monitored. He travelled freely to and from Libya. His growing support for Islamist extremism – shown by him building close ties to other plotters – went undetected. And he was never referred to the Prevent anti-terror scheme, despite some red flags raised.  Mr Grieve added: “What we can say is that there were a number of failures in the handling of Salman Abedi’s case. “While it is impossible to say whether these would have prevented the devastating attack, we have concluded that, as a result of the failings, potential opportunities to prevent it were missed.” Relatives of victims of the Manchester Arena bomb, which left  dead including Abedi, after the concert in May  last night reacted with fury. Dan Hett, from Survivors Against Terror – who lost his brother Martyn, , in the attack – said the “litany of mistakes in  must urgently be learnt from”. Martin Hibbert, , who was left paralysed by the explosion, welcomed the report’s release. He was the closest person to Salman Abedi to survive. His daughter Eve was also wounded leaving the arena as the bomb went off. He said: “It doesn’t make things any easier but it means at last there is some compassion being shown and some accountability in terms of people saying ‘We didn’t do our job’.” “It’s a start. It’s just sad that it’s taken  months.”  Abedi, , first came to the attention of MI in  and was briefly investigated by the agency in . The ISC, which has access to top-level security officials and classied material, reviewed the five  attacks, which killed  people. Prior to his attack, Abedi had travelled to Libya to visit family and the ISC questioned the decision not to use travel monitoring and travel restriction capabilities against him. Mr Grieve said: “MI have since admitted that given the information they had on Abedi, they should have done so, and have now revisited their policies in this regard.”  Abedi had several times visited jailed -year-old extremist Abdal Raouf Abdallah at HMP Altcourse, and twice in the months leading up to his attack. Abdallah is serving a five-and-a-half year term for terror offences. All visits and phone calls linked to Abdallah have to be approved by agencies including local counter-terror units. They are likely to have faced heavy scrutiny too, with staff allowed the capability to listen to inmates’ calls and check their communications.

Holly Smith, , and her fiance Adam Taylor, , have spent upwards of pound, on their trio of reborn dolls and take them on walks every day. The dolls are so realistic Holly says a bus driver has stuck up for her before when another mum tried to get her out of the pram spot, believing her to have a genuine sleeping infant. Hollys fixation with the dolls began last year after she was left shattered by a miscarriage at  weeks in  and her and Adam have since struggled to conceive. The unemployed couple now save any spare money they can get to purchase delicate bundles of second-hand baby clothes for their growing family.   Holly, from Romford, Essex, said: I have three reborns - Christopher, a six-month-old baby, and Lola and Logan are twins. Theyre newborn babies. I take them out in the pram everywhere I go. I just feel normal and like a mother. I dress them, clean them and take them out everywhere. I get a lot of positive feedback when I take them out. People think theyre real babies and when I tell them the truth, theyre so shocked as they look so realistic. People have said they are so beautul and look so real. Ive had people hold them because they dont believe theyre not real babies. In the past, I have had a couple of negative comments but its more to do with taking up pram space on the bus than the actual doll. [People] have said Im crazy and weird to have a doll in a pram - they dont understand.   When Ive been on the bus, people have said move your pram, your baby is not real. Its just a doll. Once, the bus driver was even on my side because I was there first and they just think its a sleeping baby. Theyve said I need to be put in a crazy home. Holly suffered with the loss of her first child for almost a decade before her friend introduced her to the reborn dolls.   Known for their therapeutic qualities, the vinyl babies are often used to help dementia patients or those who lose children to cope with their loss. Holly said: Reborns fill the part in me that wants to be a mother. Me and my partner have been trying for a baby for a long time but it hasnt happened yet. They help me to be a mother like I dream of every day.   In , I lost a baby and I was heartbroken. I had the miscarriage and felt lost and alone. I was so depressed I didnt know what to do with myself and cried for months. Picking up the reborn babies helps a lot. It just melts your anxiety away. These dolls gave me something to look forward for another day. Theyre the reason I get up in the morning with a smile on my face. I treat them like real babies but I know theyre not real. They just mean so much to me as a real baby would. Losing my own baby was a hard time for me but I have to think positively for the future. He will never be forgotten. I love the comfort of holding the reborns and feeling like a mother, but its not like a real baby where they give you affection. Thats whats missing.   Holly treats the babies astheyre her own children and even her fiance Adam enjoys cuddling them. Holly said: I have a friend who also has reborns and she introduced me to them last year. We have mummy meet-ups and go baby shopping with them. She has a beautul girl called Elena. You can get reborns that eat and drink, known as silicone dolls. They soil their nappies like real babies and breathe and coo, but theyre very expensive to buy. At least I dont have to change their nappies. Adams very supportive about me having reborns too - he classes them as family and his children. A lot of the clothes Holly uses for her dolls are second-hand baby outfits from eBay, which she buys in bulk. Her pricey hobby has chose her more than pound, in a year and she is even considering how shell fit another bundle of joy in her flat. Holly said: Some of my baby stuff is second-hand and was cheap as I cant afford new stuff, but I would say all together about spent on my babies is about pound for all their stuff. I had to save up most of the money for them. I buy them from eBay in bundles and its a lot of money. I have pound every month to buy them new accessories. The twins together were pound and Christopher was pound. I dont knowIll buy another doll yet as I live in a one bedroom flat and its small.

The House of Lords will today decide whether to pass the latest stage of a Bill to introduce an opt-out organ donation system in England. Abbie Burkmar spoke from the bedside of her -month-old boy, Oscar, who has heart failure. Like many other patients, his le hangs in the balance as he waits helplessly for a new le-saving organ. Abbie urged the Lords to pass the bill, ahead of the vote on Friday.  She said: “I would be really in favour of them voting for this. Organ donation can save lives. I’m hoping that a new law will encourage people to start talking about donation and sharing their wishes.” The Mirror has been campaigning for the opt-out system, where consent to donate is assumed unless people specy otherwise.The current law means that le-saving organs are not used unless the deceased has signed the NHS Organ Donation Register, and the family agree to donate.  But Abbie, from Bournemouth, Dorset, says bereaved parents often feel too crippled by grief to make a decision moments after the death of their child. “My hope is that parents think about whether they would want to donate their child’s organs beforehand. Then,anything horrible was to happen, they would have already made that decision. “So, at the time, they would already know they want to donate rather than having to make that decision on the spot when they are already going through such a horrible time.”  Oscar has dilated cardiomyopathy – an enlarged heart – the same condition suffered by Mirror boy Max Johnson, , who fronted our campaign to change the donation law. Max is now thriving after receiving a donor heart last year, and Abbie and husband Josh hope any day to hear that Oscar will be given the same gt of le. Oscar contracted the superbug clostridium dficile earlier this week but has pulled through at Great Ormond Street Hospital in London.  Relieved Abbie said: “He is OK. We think he is starting to bounce back. His heartbeat has gone down again and he is looking a lot happier, so we are just really hoping that it looks good, for now.” Oscar is hanging on to le thanks to the drug milrinone, which allows blood to flow more easily through the veins, reducing pressure on his heart. Abbie has quit her part-time job and stopped her biology degree to stay at his bedside.  The rest of the family – Oscar’s dad, factory machine operator Josh, and his brother Jack, four – visit him as often as they can. There are currently , people on the active transplant waiting list, including  children. Oscar is one of  children waiting for a heart.Last year,  patients died on the transplant waiting list. This included  children, with seven waiting for a heart.

Blazing, charred fragments rained down on Hoyle Mill pit village, where an entire community was widowed or orphaned when the mine blew up “like a volcano”. The sky turned deathly grey and dropped soot “like a touch of hell to make thee tremble” over a huge area, even on farmers in fields five miles away. It was Christmas time , in the middle of a bitter winter, and the colliers were working flat out to buy toys and food for the festival. They never saw it. It was the worst disaster of Victorian England, claiming the lives of  men and boys – a double catastrophe that killed not only miners on sht but those who fought to rescue them. Their ages ranged from  to . They left behind  widows and  orphans under .  Even by the grotesque standards of exploitation by th-century bosses, the carnage at the pit near Barnsley that December  was unparalleled in scale. Yet, except for a modest cenotaph in a rural churchyard, this sacrice has largely been forgotten – just another footnote in the history of an industry that claimed , lives. This glaring omission is put right in a moving documentary titled Black Snow, by writer director Stephen Linstead. It won the Best Research Film of the Year at the  Arts and Humanities Research in Film Awards at BAFTA in Central London earlier this month. The film came from a collaboration of ex-miners, trade unionists and historians who also raised funds for a statue of a distraught mother and child running towards the shysiren-sounding pithead. It’s by well-known Barnsley artist Graham Ibbeson, a miner’s son who discovered a forebear died in the tragedy.  In a dramatic reconstruction of real eye-witness accounts, the film opens with pitman’s we Kitty recalling: “It were a black day that Wednesday. “Bitter cold. Snow dusting t’ground. It’s been bitter for days and though we didn’t want a hard winter it meant plenty of work for t’men. “Men who went down that cursed ’oyle to keep country warm and they all wanted all t’work they could get for t’bairns, for Christmas.” They knew the danger. Oaks was a gassy pit, prone to explosion. Nineteen years earlier, another large blast killed more than . Men had often refused to go down. Miner Andy Munro picks up the story: “T’owners were never forward about safety. Coal were good, demand were great. People were sacriced. “Seventy-three souls at Oaks in  Darley Main  in   at Warren Vale in  six at Lundhill in , followed by a further  in   at Edmunds Main . “Five-hundred-and- lives in  years. Barnsley were t’mining disaster capital of England and too few people were ashamed of that. “The Queen’s Inspector himself said owners armed themselves wi’ clever lawyers and tampered with witnesses.”  Mining families always lived in the shadow of this corruption. Victoria Munro, Kitty’s friend in the film, accuses: “I was born in , same year that  bairns drowned when t’Huskar pit up Silkstone flooded.Should have been playing in t’sunshine not being underground, shychildren o’t dark. Lord Ashton tried to change things but t’owners bullied Parliament to pull report’s teeth. “The  Act would’ve saved only  kids that terrible day. “There were only one inspector to enforce it so it was worth t’owners’ while to ignore it. There were always families desperate for money and women and children left weeping and starving.” Modern-day ex-miners explain the dangers. Paul Darlow says: “Methane gas is in little fissures and it escapes all the time. In a confined place like a coal mine it’d be like being in the barrel of a gun.” Fellow ex-miner Paul Hardman adds: “When it explodes, it produces other gases. The main one is carbon monoxide, which will kill you pretty rapidly.” At .pm that Wednesday, with only an hour of the sht to go, a massive explosion ripped through the workings. The earth shook and dense columns of smoke and debris flew into the air.  Victoria Munro speaks: “When t’pit went up it were like a volcano. It shook all t’houses for miles around. Houses emptied and we ran – wives, mothers, babes in arms, toddlers dragged to t’pit top with smoke, flames and charred wood rising, cages blown away.” She adds: “Some poor wretch were brought up burned black, hair singed off his head, body blistered, hands and arms skinned. His cries when t’cold air reached his skin were excruciating.And I saw my friend Kitty, when she heard his voice, her shyhorror, her agony, screaming, ‘Oh me poor lad. Me poor dear Tommy’.” Kitty wails: “Please, not mine. My Tom! Is he in heaven or hell  Or is he a broken, twisted, half-melted man that’ll never walk again ” Taking up the narrative she adds: “I were at home wi’ t’youngest of my eight when t’Oaks exploded. “It blasted coal from deep in t’earth up to t’sky, turning clouds ghastly grey and dropping its terrible death-laden soot on to t’farmers in Cudworth as they stood terried in their frozen fields, as far as five miles away, they said. “Black snow. Strange, silky soft, bloody, a touch of hell to make thee tremble. A black-hearted, deathly day.” As the tragedy moved into its second day, rescuers such as William Ward and John Riley put themselves at risk – some dying in an even larger explosion. One man was so mutilated by this second blast he was only identied by the collar of his shirt, another by his fob watch.  But there were some escapes. Samuel Brown crawled over the bodies of dead mates to ring a signal bell just as the shaft was about to be sealed off. William Hart only survived because a donkey beside him took the full force of the blast. An inquest into the tragedy was inconclusive and nobody was ever prosecuted. The mine reopened a year later. There is now a le-size statue, named Kitty, commemorating Oaks and hundreds of wooden crosses have been planted.Artist Graham Ibbeson, with family in the pits since the th century, feels he was “born to make” the sculpture of a woman with a child on her hip. Graham says: “To me, she represents the community moving forward over  years. In a way, the biggest memorial is the community that’s around now. It’s the end game of my sculpture career. It won’t get any better than this.” Stling tears, he adds: “Sorry, I’m the son of a Barnsley miner. Great grandson as well. Ah told yer ah’d get emotional.” It would be a man of stone, or possibly a Victorian mine-owner, to feel otherwise watching this brilliant evocation of a lost way of le – and the lives lost in it.

Paul Measor, , subjected ex-partner Lauren Smith to daily abuse, teaching their one-year-old son to tell her to “f*** off” and call her a “slag”. Lauren, , recorded nine of Measor’s vile rants, which were played to a court. He was also heard spitting in her face. But District Judge Helen Cousins acquitted him of using controlling and coercive behaviour.She called Measor’s actions “disgraceshyshyful” but ruled they did not have a “serious effect” on Lauren’s le. The decision prompted Women’s Aid to call for judges to be sent for training on the Serious Crime Act .  The judge had said: “I have to be satisfied the behaviour was controlling, coercive and had a serious effect on the victim.

Today’s Doodle celebrates Manuel dos Reis Machado, or Mestre Bimba, the master who legitimised capoeira and founded the world’s first school to teach this dance   fight martial arts style. Mestre Bimba was born in Salvador, the capital of Bahia, on this day in  as the youngest of  children and son of a batuque champion, another Brazilian fighting game. His parents named him Manuel dos Reis Machado, but everyone called him Bimba.He worked ious odd jobs – longshoreman, carpenter, and coal miner – before dedicating his le to his real passion of capoeira. Developed by former slaves, capoeira was outlawed by the Brazilian government for many years and anyone caught practising it would be arrested, tortured and muitlated by police.Therefore it was only practised in secret.   “In those days, when capoeira was spoken of, it was in whispers,” Bimba recalled. “Those who learned capoeira only thought about becoming criminals.” Former slaves used Capoeira in unconventional ways - war lords and criminals used capoeiristas as hitmen and bodyguards. As studying martial arts was forbidden by law, music was added to disguise the powerful fighting techniques as dance moves. Developing his own style, known as capoeira regional, Mestre Bimba instituted a strict set of rules and a dress code. In  he was invited to demonstrate his style of capoeira for Getulio Vargas, then president of Brazil.   “In those days, when capoeira was spoken of, it was in whispers,” Bimba recalled. “Those who learned capoeira only thought about becoming criminals.” Former slaves used capoeira in unconventional ways - war lords and criminals used capoeiristas as hitmen and bodyguards.

In  he was invited to demonstrate his style of capoeira for Getulio Vargas, then president of Brazil.   The President was so impressed that he gave Mestre Bimba the go-ahead to open the first capoeira school in his hometown of Salvador, giving this unique martial art a new sense of legitimacy. Today capoeira is one of Brazil’s biggest exports. In the s the “masters” of the art – or mestres – began to emigrate and teach it in other countries.A big part of the art is being able to speak Portuguese so disciples make a big effort to learn the language. The fighting and martial arts aspect of capoeira can be masked within the grace and beauty of the music and dance – but it is still there and experts can disguise vicious attacks as a friendly gesture. In modern culture capoeira is featured in many films, video games and TV shows.Even Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire has some capoeira scenes, as well as Meet the Fockers. It inevitably features in many video games. Street Fighter has its own capoeirista called Elena and Pokemon Hilltop is partly based on the fighting style.And in World of Warcraft the maletrollracial dance animation includes movements based on capoeira.  Most recently young Syrian women from the Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan have made it into the finals of the “Girl Rising” challenge that involves capoeira. The girls said that “capoeira brings out the bravery in everyone” and gives women the chance to enjoy more creative and free movement. Experts have also said that capoeira can help heal trauma, release negative emotions and build bridges. In terms of technique, capoeira is fast and versatile.The style emphasises using the lower body to kick, sweep and take down and the upper body to assist those movements and occasionally attack as well. Theginga moveis the fundamental movement in capoeira, important both for attack and defense purposes. It has two main objectives. One is to keep the capoeirista in a state of constant motion, preventing him or her from being a still and easy target. The other, using also fakes and feints , is to mislead, fool, trick the opponent, leaving them open for an attack or a counter-attack.

Jaymielee Stewart, , was horried when she discovered three-year-old Lucas Thomson had coated his hair in the petroleum jelly in a bid to style his hair ahead of his first day at nursery. The full-time mum said she spent more than six hours desperately trying to remove the waterproof substance using shampoo, conditioner and washing powder but all failed. Online advice suggested she try talcum powder however Jaymielee didnt have any so tried self-raising flour in a last-ditch attempt - but it instead congealed into a gooey paste. The fail is similar to the predicament in Friends season five episode The One With All the Resolutions where Ross tried to squeeze into leather trousers using lotion and powder. It took  washes with shampoo and lots of combing to get most of the product out, but the tots hair still retains a greasy sheen. Jaymielee from Glasgow, Scotland, said: I could have cried when I saw him. I knew something was up as normally when I call him down for his porridge he sprints down instantly, but he was too quiet. It took  washes with shampoo and lots of combing to get most of the product out, but the tots hair still retains a greasy sheen. Jaymielee from Glasgow, Scotland, said: I could have cried when I saw him. I knew something was up as normally when I call him down for his porridge he sprints down instantly, but he was too quiet. When he walked in and said look Mummy Ive done my hair I couldnt believe it. I got him in the shower and tried to wash it off with shampoo but nothing was happening, because its a waterproof substance it was just dripping back off his face. All of his hair was really greasy, it was ashe had put chip pan oil all over him. The hair-raising incident came just a week after the tot grabbed some childrens craft scissors and chopped a chunk out of his fringe when Jaymielees back was turned for a couple of seconds. The mum said she became suspicious when little Lucas failed to race to the breakfast table to wolf down his porridge. It was only when he proudly announced that hed styled his hair that she discovered hed sneaked into her bedroom, swiped her Vaseline pots and coated himself in the product. Jaymielee rang her mum Andrena Stewart, , in a desperate bid to find out how to get the greasy substance out of his hair but instead of advice, simply heard laughter down the phone. Mum-of-one Jaymielee said: Mum was no good, she was in stitches laughing. I looked online and it suggested using talcum powder or baby powder, I didnt have either but was trying to think of something similar. I knew I had self-raising flour so ran to get it. I tried to rub it in but it just looked like I was baking a cake on his head. I hoped it would absorb it but it made a paste, it was like the episode with Ross from Friends with the leather trousers. I rinsed that out and saw someone  had posted about using a deep-cleansing soap. I didnt have that but I did have soap powder so I stuck about half a box on his head and kept washing it. In total I washed his hair  times. I have used every single bottle of shampoo, two bottles of conditioner, half a bag of self-raising flour, half a box of soap powder and cornflour. Ive managed to get most of it out with the shampoo and combing but its still very greasy. Ill just have to hope it rains on the nursery run so I can get away with him wearing a hat and explain to the nursery teachers whats happened.

The indigenous Sentinelese were already one of the most feared and mysterious tribes in the world before they killed American missionary John Allen Chau, who was trying to convert them. Very little is known about the tiny group or their ways, as few people who have met them have lived to tell the tale. The hunter-and-gatherer tribe fires a flurry of arrows at anyone who approaches by boat and even tries to attack low-flying planes or helicopters on reconnaissance missions. It lives in complete isolation on what looks like an idyllic Indian Ocean island that is said to have been populated for , years.  The Sentinelese - considered the last pre-Neolithic tribe in the world - have rejected modern civilisation and have no contact with the outside world. Few photographs or videos exist, and it is not even known what they call themselves. One thing is for certain, however. Their reputation is fearsome. They have killed a number of outsiders who have strayed onto or too close to the island, which belongs to India and is about the size of Manhattan, over the years. In , the tribe killed two men who were fishing illegally in waters in the Bay of Bengal. The men had moored their boat near the island to sleep, but they were killed when the boat broke loose and drted onto the shore.  A tribesman was pictured firing an arrow at an Indian Coast Guard helicopter checking on the groups welfare after the devastating Indian Ocean tsunami in . Members wear little clothing and they live off the land and the fish that they catch. They are known to make narrow canoes that are propelled with a pole like a punt and are only used in shallow waters, according to Survivor International. Their rituals are a mystery. It is thought that they live in three small bands, residing in large communal huts with several hearths for multiple families, and temporary, single-family shelters with no sides. Survivor International, a group that pushes for tribal peoples rights, said the women wear fibre strings tied around their waists, necks and heads, while the men also wear necklaces and headbands, but with a thicker waist belt.  The men carry spears, bows and arrows that they use to hunt or attack outsiders who stray too close. For tools or arrow tips, the uncontacted tribe has used metal which has washed up on shore or been recovered from shipwrecks on reefs. Survivor International said the islanders are clearly extremely healthy and thriving, unlike the Great Andamanese tribes that were colonised by the British in the s. It says on its website: The people who are seen on the shores of North Sentinel look proud, strong and healthy and at any one time observers have noted many children and pregnant women. The size of North Sentinel Islands population remains a mystery.  India has tried to carry out official counts by air, but the island has dense forest. The government has tried to make contact with the group, largely without success. On a few occasions, the Sentinelese allowed officials to get close enough to hand over coconuts. According to Survival International, in the late s, Maurice Vidal Portman, a British naval officer who pacied Andamanese tribes, landed on North Sentinel Island with a large team to make contact. They discovered abandoned villages and paths, and didnt come across the first islanders - an elderly couple and children - until a few days later. They took the couple and children to Port Blair, on South Andaman Island, in the interest of science, but they soon fell ill and the adults died, Survivor International said.  The children were ed to the island with gts. Experts say its likely that the children passed on their illness to other tribe members, possibly with devastating results. In the s, Indian authorities tried to befriend the tribe, leaving two pigs and a doll on the beach during one trip. The Sentinelese speared and buried the pigs, along with the doll. During other visits, coconuts, bananas and bits of iron were left as gts. On some occasions, tribe members made friendly gestures. On others, they took the gts into the forest and then fired arrows at the officials. In the s and s, several members of the tribe were killed by armed salvagers who were recovering irons and other goods from a shipwreck, it was reported.  Survivor International said there appeared to be a breakthrough for Indias government in , when tribesmen approached without weapons for the first time and waded into the sea towards the contact partys boat to collect more coconuts. But officials were met with attacks during later visits. India halted regular visits in  amid concerns for the well-being of the tribe. Officials still make periodic checks from afar, but India has banned people from getting close to the Sentinelese, while allowing them to carry on with their way of le. It passed a law making it illegal to try to contact the tribe or travel within three miles of North Sentinel Island. In , the Indian Coast Guard apprehended seven men who were fishing illegally.  One of the men is said to have briefly set foot on the island before getting back on a boat unscathed. Last week, the tribe killed Mr Chau, a -year-old missionary from Vancouver, Washington, and buried his body on the beach as he tried to convert its members. Before he was killed, he wrote in his journal that tribesmen, about ft ins tall and wearing yellow paste on their faces, reacted angrily as he tried to speak their language and sing worship songs to them during his initial approach on November . He shouted at them: My name is John, I love you and Jesus loves you. He brought gts including a football and fish. But the group reacted angrily and one of the younger members fired an arrow, which pierced his waterproof Bible, and he retreated, the Washington Post reported.  He went on shore the next day, on November . It was the last time he was seen alive by the fishermen who took him to the island. The following day, last Saturday, they watched as islanders dragged and buried his body on the beach. In his last note to his family, Mr Chau wrote: “God, I don’t want to die. His mother, Lynda Adams-Chau, doesnt believe the reports that he was killed. She told the Post: I believe he is still alive. Asked why, she replied: “My prayers.” In an earlier Instagram post, Mr Chaus heartbroken family paid tribute to the adventurer and said they forgive his killers. The post read: “He was a beloved son, brother, uncle, and best friend to us. To others he was a Christian missionary, a wilderness EMT, an international soccer coach, and a mountaineer.  He loved God, le, helping those in need, and he had nothing but love for the Sentinelese people.” Indian authorities have detained the fishermen who took Mr Chau to the island, and a friend in Port Blair who helped to organise the trip. It was unclear whether officials would attempt to make contact with the tribe and recover Mr Chaus body. A helicopter was sent to the area to conduct reconnaissance on Tuesday. A separate team was travelling to the area on Wednesday. Survivor International has pushed for the tribes protection to be maintained and respected, saying it is very vulnerable to diseases due to its extreme isolation. It says on its website: They vigorously reject all contact with outsiders. It is vital that their wish to remain uncontacted is respected –not, the entire tribe could be wiped out by diseases to which they have no immunity. Contact imposed upon other Andaman tribes has had a devastating impact. Following a campaign by Survival and local organisations, the Indian government abandoned plans to contact the Sentinelese. Survival is campaigning to ensure that their current position – to not make further attempts to contact the tribe – is maintained.

The case of the missing Beaumont children and the unidentied tall, blond man gripped Australia and the wider world after the youngsters mysteriously vanished in . Jane, nine, Arnna, seven, and Grant, four, left their family home on January  and headed for Glenelg Beach near Adelaide in the south of the country. Their mum Nancy stuffed a total of six shillings into their pockets for bus fare and lunch and waved them goodbye. That was the last time she, and her husband Jim, would ever see their young children again. Nancy, now , expected them tohome at midday, and became worried when they still hadnt shown up when Jim arrived home from work at around pm.   Two hours later, the frantic parents reported the children missing - unaware they were about to enter a decades-long hunt for their children. Within  hours, news of their disappearance had spread across Australia and reports came in of them last being seen with a tall blond man who seemed in his mid s, reports MammaMia. Witnesses said they had seen the children playing on the beach with the man, before they later went to a nearby bakery to buy lunch. Suspicions of the man they were spotted with soon grew into fears they had been abducted, after it emerged they used a pound note to buy pasties for themselves and an extra meat pie for an unknown person.   Nancy told police she had not given them any notes on the morning they left home and that her children never ate meat pies. Police believed this indicated the unidentied fair-headed man was still with the children at the time they bought lunch. As the police search escalated, detectives desperately searched for some of the  items they had on the persons at the time - including clothing, towels and a bag. Despite their best efforts, not of these items were ever recovered. The case even saw a Dutch psychic Gerard Croiset being flown in to help track down the children and bring up any potential leads.  Two days after first being reported missing, their mum Nancy had become so traumatised by their disappearance, she was put under sedation by a doctor. Five days later after the children left home, their father Jim made an emotional plea to anyone who may have or know where the children were. In the following weeks and months, the heartbroken parents retreated from the public eye and cut off all connection with the media. Earlier this year, fresh leads led police to search a factory in North Plympton, but the dig only found animal bones.  Chief superintendent Des Bray said: There has been nothing human located on the site. Sadly, this means for the Beaumont family that we still have no answers. Over the years, police released computer generated images of the children and how they may look having aged.

So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar.

I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

Star lost possession in midfield and Connor Crawford’s clearance was closed down by the Kings Park forward whose shot beat Kalache from the edge of the box and the hosts took a - lead on the hour mark.This visibly knocked the confidence of the Star team and Kings added a second goal when poor play again from Star trying to break gted possession to the hosts and once again their striker was on hand to make it - and give Star a mountain to climb in the last twenty minutes.Star didn’t give up however and could have been back in the game when the ball fell to Gregor Peacock in the box, the ing striker hit the shot and the ball was saved by the Kings Park goalkeeper.Kyle Selfridge went close to claiming a late leline but his free kick from twenty yards cannoned off the bar and the game finished - to the home side.The Star management team were disappointed as that’s the first time the Lochgilphead side have failed to score in the league in more than two years.On Saturday November  Red Star play host to Campbeltown pupils in what looks like another tough league match.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as .

Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13594714.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/1_ayr-u.jpg","title":"ayr united appear itv show","story":"NewsAyr United appear on ITV show The Chase as Bradley Walsh asks questionsThe Honest Men appeared as an answer on hit ITV show The Chase yesterday .Share.\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"facebook|share|\".\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"messenger|share|\".\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"twitter|share|\".\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"whatsapp|share|\".\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"linkedin|share|\".\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"flipboard|share|\".\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"email|share|\"ByLochlin Highet:,  NOV NewsThe Chasers \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAyr United have been flying high at the top of the Championship - and now theyve made prime time national TV.

It has been very successful in that time.”Referencing food trends, he said research showed people buying breakfasts and takeaways was on the increase.He added: “The building we built  years ago is not as fit for purpose as it was then. We want to bash it about a bit.”Mr Blair said the current retractable roof in the terrace area was “impractical.”The frontage of the building will be remodelled with awnings installed.A glazed atrium will also be installed on the rear roof to improve natural light.A community council is among objectors to the move.Michael Tomlinson, of Burgh Road, has hit out against the plan on behalf of Prestwick North Community Council.His objection claimed changes would lead to an “unwelcome overdevelopment and intensication of an already intensively developed establishment.”An objection from George Wallace said: “I am the adjacent building owner and am unhappy about the close proximity of the new deli and toilet extension to my property.”A supporting statement from Buzzworks said: “We hope that the alterations to the building will add a signicant change to the internal layout of the venue adding new experiences for the customers and keeping the building fresh and up to date. There will be no increased public areas.” Troon Conservative councillor Peter Convery said: “It think it is a remarkable change. It will certainly enhance the town of Prestwick.”Prestwick and Conservative councillor Margaret Toner said she was delighted by the plan.She said: “I was always amused by the retractable roof.”"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"south ayrshire council chiefs now","story":"NewsSouth Ayrshire Council chiefs now refuse to call Station Hotel by its nameOfficials have begun referring to the B Listed pile as the “building adjacent to Ayr train station”.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  NOV NewsStation Hotel \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe famous Station Hotel in Ayr has had its name wiped from history – by bosses at South Ayrshire Council.

Perhaps a little too early for the jumpers, I attended the Memorial Hall eager to feast upon the much-anticipated performance of these young thespians.Could they really deliver this magical Christmas story and live up to the incredible reputation set by their mentors, Innerleithen  District Amateur Operatic Society  You bet your bottom dollar they did!From the moment the music started and the curtain opened on this stunning production, I along with the audiences were captivated.Playing the hopeful orphan was Freya Wilson. She already looked the part with red hair and freckles, and with stunning vocals she belted out classics lsquoTomorrowrsquo and lsquoMaybersquo, which I have no doubt produced a few tears from the audience. She embraced the character with her cheeky charm and wit, and carried out the role of the ever-optimistic character beautully.Hatching a plan to escape the orphanage and find her parents, Annie is helped by her urchin friends, who had the crowdrsquos toes-tapping and knees bouncing to a fantastically choreographed lsquoHard Knock Lersquo. Credit where itrsquos due, this incredible young cast, who reprised their roles as servants and New Yorkers, were amazing, bringing le to the entire show.But Anniersquos cunning plan to escape fails, and it isnrsquot long before she is dragged back to the evil clutches of the vile Miss Hannigan, played by Lizzie Bell. What was in the champagne bottle, I do not know, but the teenager stumbled about the stage, and conveyed the child-hating orphanage boss to comic perfection. Hanniganrsquos flirtatious manner with Officer Ward , who brings Annie back after running away, had the audience chuckling, and truly convinced us of her distaste for the girls in her care with a jaw-dropping performance of lsquoLittle Girlsrsquo.Anniersquos capture isnrsquot the end of her adventure, itrsquos only just begun, as she s in perfect time to meet Grace Farrell.Miss Farrell is gracefully played by the suave and sophisticated Ava Church, dressed impeccably as the rsquos private secretary to Oliver Warbucks. Annie cheekily seizes a golden opportunity to spend Christmas with Mr Warbucks, and is swept off to live the le of royalty at his mansion.Annie soon melts the heart of wealthy businessman Oliver Warbuckswho gave an endearing performance as the billionaire. The two gave a heart-warming rendition of lsquoI Donrsquot Need Anything But Yoursquo. This will be Thomasrsquos first and last performance with KIYT, but Irsquom sure it wonrsquot be last wersquoll see of this talented young man.After promising to help Annie find her parents, in step the villains of the show ndash scheming Rooster Hannigan and his ditzy blonde girlfriend Lily St Regis.Together with Miss Hannigan, the three plot to swindle Mr Warbucks out of a , dollar reward by posing as Anniersquos parents.Alex Paterson pulls off the flashy self-assured gangster brilliantly, and with his money-grabbing side-kick Lily St Regis, the two are perfectly paired bringing not only the comic element to the show, but impeccable American accents, which polished off their characters.Now at this point I must declare my motherly interest, as Lily was played by my daughter Neve Scott. It is very dficult for one to critic her own child. However, I am very proud to call her a vain, blonde bimbo, red-lipstick wearing, smoking, winey voiced, floozy!The three baddies gave a show-stopping performance of lsquoEasy Streetrsquo which had the audiences in stitches.True to the classic, their evil plotting is foiled and Annie has her happy ending after being adopted by Mr Warbucks. The whole cast came out in glorious chorus for the finale of lsquoTomorrowrsquo.There is one furry four-legged actor who deserves a mention for his tail-wagging performance, the adorable Harry who is no stranger to the spotlight after his dog debut as Toto in the Operarsquos lsquoThe Wizard of Ozrsquo. Stardom beckons for the pooch, whom Irsquom sure could be crowned a Peeblesshire Pet Idol in the future!Praise swept over social media for the young cast last week, leaving many hoping this will be the first of many shows by the talented KIYT cast.

It will be deal or no deal.I wonrsquot pretend the deal is perfect.No-one gets everything they want in a negotiation ndash and wersquove had two years of tough negotiations with the EU.So the deal is a compromise.If between now and the final vote in Parliament we learn the deal does not deliver everything wersquove promised our fishing industry, Irsquoll not be able to support it.And the same goes for Northern Ireland.I need to be sure the so-called backstop plan does not threaten the integrity of the UK by creating fundamentally dferent, permanent arrangements for Northern Ireland.But Irsquom encouraged those risks have been avoided because itrsquos clear the arrangements focus on the specic circumstances in Northern Ireland ndash the need to honour the Belfast Agreement and maintain the fragile peace process, and to avoid a hard border with Ireland. One thing I am absolutely certain about is this: a no deal Brexit would be a disaster for Scotland and the whole of the UK.It would harm the economy, threaten jobs and damage peoplersquos standards of living. I will do everything I can to stop that happening.Irsquove been disappointed by the soap opera of cabinet resignations over the past few days and Irsquom dismayed that colleagues might yet try to force a vote of no confidence in the Prime Minister.That would be a huge distraction at the worst possible moment.It is time for MPs on all sides to recognise that the alternative to the deal we have negotiated is leaving the EU without a deal. I hope that nightmare prospect really focuses minds in the days ahead.There is nothing to stop the SNP and Labour backing the deal. It achieves key goals set out in their own Brexit plans, like protecting trade and citizensrsquo rights. However, to support their own political objectives, they currently plan to vote against the proposed agreement.Prime Minister Theresa May has shown resolve, determination and strength of character as we move towards the final, dficult stages of the Brexit process.

new high school as soon as possible and unite the townrsquos politicians behind a united front.Scottish Borders Council launched a review of all educational facilities in the Borders in September , with a view to building new schools, assessing which schools may need to be merged or closed, and considering how appropriate current catchment areas are.Education bosses at the council are known to prefer an intergenerational model of education, such as the poundm campus at Jedburgh which will cater for - year olds and contain community spaces and a library.In April , Scottish Borders Council agreed to create inidualised plans for schools in Galashiels, Hawick, Peebles and Selkirk, and agreed to bring an update to the council in October.However, the update has so far failed to materialise leaving parents and students in the dark about the future of their school.John Lamont, who represents Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk in Westminster, said: ldquoHawick High School has had its fair share of publicity recently, but it is clear that hard working pupils and staff are being let down by a site which is simply not fit for purpose.ldquoThat is why I have joined with my colleague

community and for its representatives to come together to focus on delivering for Hawickrsquos pupils, teachers and parents.ldquoIf we argue amongst ourselves about details, the effect will be that Hawick is put to the back of the queue.Rachael Hamilton, who represents Ettrick, Roxburgh and Berwickshire in Holyrood, added: ldquoMaking a decision on a site would give pupils, teachers and parents a real boost.ldquoOther towns in the Borders have been fortunate to benefit from a new modern teaching and learning environment and Hawick is clearly in need of some investment.ldquoPolitical infighting wonrsquot help, clarity should be provided over such an important issue, this is about giving young people and future generations a place to be proud of.The townrsquos councillors have welcomed the intervention of the two politicians, and threw their weight behind the campaign.Councillor Stuart Marshall commented: ldquoI think itrsquos very important that all politicians, councillors and community leaders join forces to continue the campaign for a new high school.ldquoOf course funding such a project will be a major factor in whether we can deliver such a project, and itrsquos great that both our Westminster and Holyrood representatives in the area are throwing their weight behind such an initiative.ldquoLet us hope that between them they can come up with much of the finances required.Councillor Watson McAteer said: ldquoI am delighted that our local elected UK and Scottish Conservative politicians are throwing their weight and influence behind a new high school for Hawick.ldquoI am in complete agreement that politics should have no role in deciding the future of our children and by definition our town and the quicker this project is agreed by all the better.ldquoHawick High School has seen its fair share of problems and a new learning campus would go a long way to resolving existing and future problemsCouncillor David Paterson added: ldquoAll of the Hawick councillors are campaigning furiously to get a new high school for Hawick, and the councillors in other wards are shouting for their areas as well.ldquoIrsquod like John Lamont MP to

independence and the means through which Scotland might become an independent country.Contrast this with the Brexit campaign.The concern of some in the SNP can be shared, but it should be noted that the circumstances for a people’s vote are very dferent from an independence referendum.Ultimately the public has a right to change its mind, that’s democracy.Many did not know what they were voting

It is a collection of stories and anecdotes mainly relating to sporting le and animals.The following tale is inspired from one of the anecdotal stories in Eganrsquos book:ONE autumn evening in the early th century, a storm descended on the county. Dark clouds opened their dreich souls and drenched the land with a torrent of rain. The wind and downpour kept people awake for the whole night, and but by sunrise the tempest was over.Yet all the sudden rain had caused the River Tyne to flood. The folk of Haddington gathered by its banks to witness a strange sight. For the surface of the water was laid with huge masses of hay. The storm had obviously caused the hay recently cut and stacked in the fields upriver to be blown into the flood water, or swept away by it.They watched as small mountains of hay floated by. It was an intriguing sight but of course for farmers it was their winter feed for their animals going waste to the sea.Then someone spotted a swan. It seemed to be attempting to find a place to land. The river was in a torrent and at times the majestic creature seemed to give in to the current and glide on its course until once again it found the strength and motivation to make for the river bank. It was in no imminent danger, but clearly desired to get out of the fast-moving water.As people watched the swan it was noticed that a strange black spot could be seen amidst its white feathers. As the swan drted closer to the bank, people realised what the black spot was: a rat!The rat was clearly alive, at times peeping over the plumage asto see where they were. The swan seemed unperturbed by the ratrsquos presence on its back. In fact, as people watched more closely there seemed to be a connection between the swan and the rat which was most unusual.The royal bird was clearly giving the rat a collie-buckie, or piggy back. How the rat came to be on the swanrsquos back in the first place nobody could tell. The wee creature was very likely at home in one of the bales of hay when it was swept away by the river. In the swirling water it must have struggled to survive.Then rescue came with the swan. Could the creature have scrambled onto the swan without its permission  Surely not! Did the swan actively help the rat  If so, the moment of rescue had been a compassionate act unseen by human eyes. As people followed the drama they realised that the swan was looking for a place to land, not for itself but for its passenger.A crowd had soon gathered to witness the swanrsquos progress. The power of the flood water meant it had real dficulty in finding a place to get close to the river bank. But finally the swan found the strength and opportunity to swim close to the riverrsquos edge.The rat, recognising the opportunity, leaped from the swanrsquos plumage and landed safely on dry land. For an instant the rat turned and looked at the swan, then scampered away. The swan, its mission accomplished, majestically glided back into the main flow of the river.If the rat had thought itself safe then it soon realised this not to be the case. The people watching the spectacle had motivations very dferent to the swan. As soon as the rat landed, dozens of young men, urged on by their elders, chased it with sticks and set their dogs upon it.The animal, having survived naturersquos tempest, now faced an even greater danger his le was sport for humans. The creature zigzagged as people, yelling and howling with delight, chased it this way, then that. The rat, being cornered by a group of about  lads armed with stones and sticks, turned and headed back towards the water.But it didnrsquot make it. The creature was given a deadly blow by a lsquomerciless fellowrsquo. A cheer rang out and people came to view the dead rat. Then a strange silence descended as people reflected, now too late, on what had happened. In the frenzy of the chase it had been so easy to see the rat as merely vermin, rather than a living creature who had struggled to survive and so earned the right to le.People dispersed, no longer cheering.The whole scene had been witnessed by the swan from its vantage point on the river. What its thoughts were on the human behaviour it saw we can only guess.Humans can be made to do this to each other as well, of course. In the frenzy of war, people are encouraged to see others as no more worthy of le than that rat. And the insidious power of this is that both sides are encouraged to think the same way.But deep down, when we touch our humanity, we know how wrong this is. Old soldiers themselves are the first to understand the tragedy of it and see the humanity in those who had been on the lsquoother sidersquo.

We had just popped in to get a few simple items, but I ended up with a very upset wee boy. The supermarket had already begun to display toys. My son had noticed them immediately because they had been deliberately placed at his level.I eventually managed to distract him and we made it out without a major meltdown, but it just highlighted to me the pressures we are all put under.I kept on saying to my son: ldquoNo, but maybe for Christmas.It was a tactic to get some immediate peace, but I realised I was building up expectations that Christmas is the time when all the accumulated desires for stuff are met.We are made to feel that the value of Christmas is measured in the amount of stuff we acquire or give. I hate this and reject it but I am by no means immune from its pressure. I am made to feel guilty and every year I give in some way or another.The psychological warfare in our minds has already begun. The new toys laid out in that supermarket was but the opening shot. Soon a lsquoChristmassyrsquo atmosphere will engulf us as we do our shopping, designed to press our internal panic button that we need get on with buying lots of stuff, like a stressed squirrel collecting nuts for the winter.I know Irsquove ranted about this before but in February I spoke to a group of vulnerable parents in a course I was delivering. Many had huge debts yet had spent literally hundreds of pounds on Christmas presents, most of which were by this time broken, forgotten about or discarded.One of the parents encapsulated it perfectly: ldquoThe trouble is itrsquos easy to realise after itrsquos all over that yoursquove gone overboard, but the pressure is so hard to resist before Christmas. Yoursquore made to feel that you are a bad parent or a failureyou donrsquot get all that stuff. Itrsquos everywhere you go and on the screens. Itrsquos impossible to escape from it.In the discussion the parents said they wished there was a course or some guidance on how to resist the pressure while still making Christmas special for their kids.In a sense, this issue is not just a Christmas one, although the consumerist pressure is at its most intense in the run-up to Christmas, and even immediately afterwards with the sales. We have literally been sold the idea that buying stuff is what defines us.It has been a conscious, deliberate and sustained ideological assault on us and our children.In her brilliant film The Story of Stuff, Annie Leonard gives a quote from a retail analyst Victor Lebow: ldquoOur enormously productive economy. . . demands that we make consumption our way of le, that we convert the buying and use of goods into rituals, that we seek spiritual satisfaction, our ego satisfaction, in consumption. We need things, consumed, burned up, worn out, replaced and discarded at an ever-increasing rate.While this was in reference to the USA a number of years ago, it holds true for us here and now.Christmas, as well as other seasonal festivals, have been made a festival of buying stuff.Itrsquos destroying the very planet we live on, it piles our homes with unneeded and soon-to-be discarded consumerist items .Meanwhile, more and more of us are time poor and running about to pay for things we soon forget we even bought and are likely already in the dump or charity shop.I was once told I was being a Scrooge when I spoke of this issue. But the message in Scrooge, when he realises whatrsquos important, is that he gives his employee time off to be with his family, and a pay rise so they can eat he shows kindness and shares a meal and social time with his family. Itrsquos not about tons of stuff.Our time together is the most valuable and valued thing we will ever have. Irsquod never say donrsquot buy presents, as I know a thoughtful present is a wonderful thing. Butitrsquos lost in a sea of other stuff then its signicance is lost too.What I think is important is doing things together and measuring the value of gts by the thought put into them, rather than the price or quantity of them. And there are a host of local Christmas fairs taking place in schools and community halls all over East Lothian where many local craftspeople, artists and others will be selling locally produced and environmentally friendly gts which have real value and are designed to last. It seems to me this is the best place to take our custom.I know this has not been a proper story but, then again, in a sense it is. Itrsquos the story of how our rituals and the meanings of our lives have been turned into market value, and we now often feel powerless or unable to step out of it without feeling guilty, inadequate or ldquoa Scrooge.Thatrsquos how I feel every Christmas but Irsquom going to make a Herculean effort this year to practice what I preach. Irsquom not rejecting that lsquoChristmassyrsquo feeling or refusing to buy presents. But Irsquom defining it on my own terms, or at least Irsquoll try. Itrsquos about my time with people I value. Itrsquos about putting in thought rather than looking at the price tag.Itrsquos also about understanding how terribly dficult Christmas is for so many people and finding ways to connect with them and show them some kindness and inclusion.Maybe itrsquos just me, but I think that is one of the best gts you can give your children and others you love."},{"url":null,"title":"great-grandmother-84-enjoys-microlight-flight","story":"Jenny Lyall, , was the passenger in a microlight, taking off from East Fortune Airfield, earlier this month.The small aircraft, piloted by Kim Ritchie, gave Jenny the chance to look over her home in Haddington.Clients at the townrsquos day centre, managed by Caroline Scott, have been outlining things they would like to do, from having a holiday in the spring to going on the London Eye.For Jenny, though, it was a chance to take to the skies.She said: ldquoIrsquove always watched the microlights going over and would be sitting in the garden saying: lsquoI quite fancy doing that.rsquoldquoWhen Caroline askedthere was anything anybody would like to do I said I would like to go up in a microlight.A few days later Jenny received a phone call telling her there was a surprise for her at the day centre and she said she was thrilled when she found out that was a microlight flight, adding: ldquoI thoroughly enjoyed it ndash I would do it again tomorrow.ldquoNot bad for an -year-old!Caroline was delighted to be able to help.

But theres a time when resilience turns into defiance, and then defiance turns into delusion. Theresa Mayrsquos staying power is the nations curse, as she perseveres with a orce deal which has no hope. She has finally united Leavers and Remainers, but only to the extent that theyrsquore against her. Shes lost both her Brexit Secretaries, a host of ministers and both houses of parliament. But, like Monty Pythonrsquos limbless Black Knight, she battles on regardless.MPs on all sides say the European Court of Justice will continue to have effective jurisdiction over UK laws on things like state aid, labour conditions, environmental standards and tax. Theresa May insists it wonrsquot, and that by , a deep and meaningful future trading relationship will have been negotiated, which will make the backstop unnecessary. But that is a triumph of hope over experience. No one has yet come up with a way of ensuring frictionless trade that doesnt involve either membership of the Customs Union, or accepting many of the rules of the European Single Market. If you keep all or part of the single market you keep the ECJ.This doesnt mean that the ECJ is involved in every negotiation. There is to be an arbitration  to sort out everyday problems between the EU and UK. But when it comes to a dispute on EU law, the ECJ rulings are final. That is crystal clear in Article  of the Withdrawal Agreement which says that the ECJ ldquoshall have jurisdiction to make such a ruling, which will be binding on the arbitration .Theres nothing sinister in this ndash except in the eyes of paranoid europhobes. When you join a tennis club, no one complains that your rights and liberties are being removed just because you accept the rules. The real issue is whether you have any say in the making of them. Democracy demands that members of an international trading organisation should have have a share in the decision-making process. This is where the Withdrawal Agreement, indeed the whole Brexit project falls down, because as things stand, we dont. We will be rule takers.Theresa May realised very early on that the economic cost of leaving the EU completely was just too high. She gave assurances to all those big international companies like Nissan, Siemens and Rolls Royce, who have complex, just-in-time supply chains, that she would negotiate a deal that was at least as good as the single market. She effectively promised no tarfs, border checks or regulatory issues ndash ie no ldquofriction - between Britain and the EU. She had to, or theyd have upped and left . Components for Vauxhall cars are said to cross and recross EU borders at least  times before theyre finally assembled in Ellesmere Port.But removing tarf and non-tarf barriers is precisely what the Customs Union and the European Single Market were originally created to do. The EU is first of all a free trade area, the most comprehensive in the world. When Britain decided to leave, it meant that frictions would inevitably . Theresa May has been trying to square the circle ever since: getting the benefits of a single market without being in it.Shes achieved quite a lot, to give her credit. Under her orce deal, Britain gets broad access in to the single market in goods without having to accept free movement. But the cost was always going to be some continued observance of the EUrsquos regulations, plus ECJ oversight. Weve had to agree to ldquodynamic alignment with EU regulations, meaning that when they change in future Britain will have to go along with the new rules.The obvious solution might be to just join the single market, as Norway did after . It is not in the EU, the Common Fisheries Policy or the Common Agricultural Policy. This is Nicola Sturgeons preferred option, and she said last week thatScotland even got the same deal as Northern Ireland, which is to remain largely in the ESM, she would vote for the Withdrawal Agreement. But while this Norway option has worked after a fashion, it has powerful critics. It costs quite a lot, and there have long been complaints in Oslo about ldquofax democracy - that new laws are simply faxedfrom Brussels. But hey ndash thats just how these things work. You are either in the EU or you arent.So what happens now  Mays deal wont fly, yet she stands her ground. The deal will almost certainly be rejected in parliament, even though Labour dont really have a coherent alternative. Jeremy Corbyn was scathing about Mayrsquos ldquobotched deal, but he too wants to leave the EU. Nor do Labour wish Britain to be a formal member of the Customs Union or the European Single Market. John McDonnell, the Shadow Chancellor, says he would renegotiate the deal to achieve a ldquoclose and collaborative relationship with the single market. In other words, a better deal than Mayrsquos. But the German Chancellor, Angela Merkell, has made clear that negotiations are over. End of story.Faced with a disastrous no deal, and no prospect of renegotiating the Withdrawal Agreement, the opposition parties face a very hard parliamentary choice next month. Do they join with Jacob Rees Mogg and the DUP, and vote for an economic disaster which would damage the livelihoods of countless Labour voters  Or do they suck it up, back Theresa May and then blame the Tories in future for landing Britain with such a bad settlement  If they vote down Mayrsquos orce deal, they must know that renegotiation is not now an option. Nor is a general election, because the Tories wonrsquot vote, like turkeys, for an early Christmas. The only alternative is for the opposition parties to do what they should have done months ago: unite the Remain majority in the House of Commons to demand a delay on Article , and then force May to hold a repeat referendum.If parliament cant decide what to do, the only option is to hand it back to the people who got us into this mess in the first place: the voters."},{"url":null,"title":"the-cool-list-hotels","story":"Built in  by Lord MacDonald of Sleat and once surrounded by orange trees ndash hence the hotelrsquos name ndash Marmalade is a -minute walk from Portree harbour and offers fine views over Portree Bay and to the Cuillins beyond.

While we have good evidence about how vigorous exercise affects our health, little is known about this disappearing background of daily light activity.The study, published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, showed that light activity dramatically reduces the risk of premature death, even after accounting for levels of moderate to vigorous activity and other factors such as smoking.The researchers also found that moving around can help people control their blood sugar and is particularly beneficial for people with Type  diabetes. When a person interrupted sitting with a few minutes of light activity such as slow walking, it reduced blood sugar and insulin levels by  to  percent on average. People with type  diabetes had even greater benefits.Dr Naveed Sattar, Professor of Cardiovascular  Medical Sciences at the University of Glasgow carried out a randomised study into the metabolic effects of breaking prolongued sitting in older people, which is associated with insulin resistance and poor cardiometabolic health. He found that walking breaks of five minutes every  minutes after meals lowered insulin and blood pressure but standing breaks did not improve the outcome.:House of Cards review: Netflix replace stench of seedy bloke with uber lsquowokersquoldquoItrsquos simple physics ndashyou walk after a meal, you burn calories that would otherwise stay in the blood.

We are doing as much sport as we did  years ago, but what has changed is the time we spend doing household chores, being active at work. Most activities that used to involve moving are now geared to sitting down ndash whether itrsquos transport or how we work and spend our free time ndash and that is having a detrimental effect on health.His message is to ldquomove as much as you can ndash the more the better. He recommends getting up to talk to people at work instead of sending emails, more standing or walking meetings, taking the stairs, walking to the local shops, and putting an alert on your computer every  minutes to get up and walk around.ldquoAnd stop binge-watching on-demand television series for hours from the sofa. Itrsquos up to us to be aware of how long we are sitting watching boxsets. I watch them but I do so on my tablet while sitting on a static exercise bike, he added.ldquoWe move so much less now than we used to ndash a ship worker on the Clyde expended around , calories a day in the freezing cold and could hardly eat enough to keep up, while we spend less than  calories a day sitting around in an office.ldquoOur bodies are made to move but our reptilian brains want us to conserve energy, so We have to watch our own behaviour and fight against a modern lestyle that is damaging our health.Employers also have a responsibility to make workplaces less sedentary, according to Professor Chastin added: ldquoMany workplaces effectively forbid us from moving ndash leaving your desk is frowned upon and seen as slacking while some workplaces police toilet breaks. Itrsquos wrong.

This contrasted starkly with the near universal provision of calorie and nutrient information on pre-packaged products available in retail outlets.FSS also suggests using greater promotion and marketing to encourage consumers to choose healthier options and said it would be encouraging food businesses to take their own voluntary measures to change their promotion and marketing practices.\"Caterers, manufacturers and businesses who supply food for the catering industry all have a role in reducing calories and resetting the norms away from excessive consumption,\" said the FSS. It said that food outside the home could be improved by businesses dropping practices that encourage overeating while postively marketing and promoting fruit and vegetables.There are , restaurants, supermarkets, takeaways and food delivery services who sell food on-the-go in Scotland. Approximately half of so-called out of home visits in Scotland are made to branded businesses and half are made to independent businesses.Ross FinnieChips, cakes and pastries, specialty coffees and sugary soft drinks are among the top foods and drinks purchased outside the home.The FSS said that given the high calorie content of these types of foods, there is a need to \"rebalance the out of home offering towards more nutritious lower calorie menu options\".Obesity and diet related ill health is one of Scotlandrsquos biggest health concerns, costing around pound. bn every year.FSS says that with two thirds of adults in Scotland already overweight or obese, the health consequences of a poor diet are \"already very real\" and they impact the nationrsquos economy and productivity.It is estimated that up to a quarter of our calories may come from eating outside the home and the FSS says \"it is important that the out of home sector plays its part to improve the Scottish diet\".Mr Finnie added: \"Given that this sector is projected to grow, change is needed now to make out of home food and drink healthier.

Let me assure the House that that permission certainly did not come from me.Mr Bercow explained that he had received ldquogracious, indeed fulsome, letters of apology from Conservative backbencher Tracey Crouch, the former Sports Minister, Labourrsquos Stephanie Peacock and Louise Haigh. The other MP involved in the kick-about was fellow Labour MP Alison McGovern.ldquoI gently remind colleaguesthey are seeking to use the chamber outside of sitting hours beyond for the purpose of simply showing it to guests, frankly they should write to me asking for their request to be considered, explained the Speaker.He added: \"I have said what I have said there are no hard feelings and I consider the matter to be closed.\"Ms Bardell told The Herald she would drop Mr Bercow a line, ldquonoting his comments and that I very much respect him saying I certainly didnrsquot mean any disrespect but wonrsquot be apologising.Askedplaying football in the Commons chamber was not a sign of disrespect, the SNP MP replied: ldquoFar from being disrespectful, it shows Parliament in a dferent and more accessible and positive light at a time when itrsquos deeply ided the womenrsquos parliamentary football team[was] seeking to be positive, inclusive and have a little fun.This is not the first time the Nationalist backbencher has defied convention.Earlier this year she was ticked off by the Speakerrsquos Office after tweeting a video from inside the Commons voting lobby, complaining about theof time votes took.

A spokesman noted how last week the PM had said thatMPs voted down her deal, ldquonobody can know for sure the consequences that will flow from that it would be to take a path of deep and grave uncertainty.But when it was pointed out Mrs May had given Ms McVey an assurance on leaving the EU, the spokesman replied: ldquoThe PM is determined she is going to ensure that we leave the EU on March , which is what the British people voted for.Hang on. Ms Rudd said a no-deal was not possible and Mrs May said there could be no BrexitMPs rejected her deal, so how could she say for certain the UK would leave the EU next March  No  simply repeated how the PM was determined to get her deal through ndash and that was that.Of course, one of the many complicating factors in this game of D political chess is that the Democratic Unionists, whose  MPs prop up the minority Tory Government, are in a huff over the withdrawal plan, believing it sets out the path to the break-up of the UK.Earlier this week, Mrs May and her colleagues had the humiliation of a seeing the DUP vote against part of the Finance Bill and b accepting opposition amendments for fearthey went to a vote, they would be voted down thanks to Nigel Dodds and his chums.No , in another show of bravado, insisted the so-called confidence and supply deal with the DUP, was \"intact\". Another insider declared: ldquoIrsquom not aware of any change to its status, noting how the DUP itself had said it was still alive.Hang on. The DUP are breaching the deal by voting against the Government. But the spokesman noted how it was only one vote and ldquowe won it by five votes.Askedthe PM could rely on the DUP, he replied: ldquoI have given you my answer.Earlier during a less-than-easy PMQs Mrs May had to face hostile questions not only from Jeremy Corbyn and Ian Blackford but also from some of her own MPs, urging her to change tack.One Tory backbencher suggested that her withdrawal plan would threaten the integrity of the UK, at which the DUPrsquos Mr Dodds was nodding vigorously.The Belfast North MP noted how, in the December joint UK-EU report, it was agreed Northern Ireland would have the ldquofinal say on whether it erged from the UK single market, the so-called ldquoStormont lock, but this bit had been deleted from the draft withdrawal agreement.Mrs May replied that the matter of regulations was for Westminster and, anyhow, Stormont had not sat for two years.Hang on. So why put the Stormont lock in the December report anyway The No  spokesman, also noting how Stormont was not currently in existence, said he had ldquonothing more to add.So, following a bruising PMQs, Mrs May set off for Brussels for talks with Jean-Claude Juncker to try to finalise the so-called future framework that will set out Britainrsquos future relationship with the EU post-Brexit.But things did not seem to be going smoothly. Surprise surprise.One senior German diplomat warned: ldquoIt needs to be finalised or Merkel will not attend. We do not want changes to the text making it even harder for May to agree with.The PM finally emerged from her tea and croissants to say further progress had been made but she would be going back to Brussels for more talks on Saturday, just hours before the planned Sunday summit.So things will, as many predicted, go to the wire and, of course, nothing is agreed until everything is agreed.As Alice would say the Brexit process is getting curiouser and curiouser."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-the-future-for-renewables-has-to-be-large-scale-offshore-wind","story":"The future is offshore. Norway, for example has few land-based turbines ndash in September I drove theof Norway from Larvik to Tromso and recall seeing only one wind farm, well away from people and their magnicent wild landscapes. The Norwegians build their wind farms offshore, where the smooth, laminar flow of wind allows the turbines to operate at maximum efficiency, unlike their poor relations on the Scottish mainland.Anyone in the Scottish renewables industry will confirm that offshore is the future ndash today all the necessary knowledge and skills are available and, with costs falling with every offshore turbine, there is no need for further onshore development. The MW turbines in the Beatrice Field off the Caithness coast have been put in place on time and on budget. Already a  MW turbine is under development for future deployment. Large-scale onshore wind is yesterdayrsquos technology, only pursued by commercial companies chasing public subsidy while bribing local communities to support their planning applications.Now we need to identy those parts of Scotland dominated by large-scale wind farms so that visitors can recognise those areas to avoidthey want a hill walk without turbines. I look forward to the day when Visitscotland produces its ldquono-go areas brochure in a desperate attempt to kid the rest of the world that Scotland still is a magnicent country to come to for unspoilt natural beauty.Dave Morris, Bishop Terrace,Kinnesswood, Kinross.SOME years ago rural folk were slightly ldquocomfortedby the assurance that wind turbines would be in their communities for a generation only, until the subsidies ran out. Then sites would be decommissioned and operators would pay for the clean-up. Most were not naiumlve enough to believe that would necessarily happen or the thousands of tonnes of concrete and steel in the bases would be removed or the miles of access tracks would ever disappear but the turbines would go. ldquoTemporary was the word used and some were, no doubt, convinced industrial wind might be a necessary evil as a stepping stone to more reliable generation. Maybe they didnrsquot object to developments because they believed what the SNP administration was telling them.Then we started to see the words ldquoin perpetuity and realised that wind turbine installations may well be there forever.Now the watch word is ldquore-powering and even bigger turbines are to be placed on existing sites.Those that are to be re-powered, and it can only be the most recent approvals, must have full ecological surveys done as existing turbine bases will not be in the right place for these signicantly larger machines. They will also have greater visual impact and be potentially noisier.They must be treated as new applications with full planning fees paid.Why should we bankroll this industry any more than we do already  If they fail in any area the wind farm must be decommissioned.To do anything less confirms that we were quite simply lied to and it should be challenged.I would also askan increase in size of turbine mean more subsidiesthe original contracts have not run out  If so that is another cost that will burden the consumer.Lyndsey Ward,Darach Brae,Beauly.THE suspiciously precise figure of . tons of CO to build and install a ldquotypical wind turbine is quoted by George Herraghty , without any reference to the hundreds of tonnes of CO that a gas-fired power station might generate per hour. The Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology reports letime gas-fired power stations emissions equivalent to -g of CO per kWh, and offshore wind at -g.If we are to reduce green subsidies, then we must tax fossil fuels more. If the Scottish Tories contend that the oil price has fallen too far for Scotland to pay for itself, their Westminster Government should have plenty of room to raise some taxes on petrol to compensate. Yet petrol duty has remained frozen since .AndIan Moirwants a plan to grow the economy, may I suggest we start by rebuilding maybe three per cent of Scotlandrsquos housing stock each year to a passive heating standard Alan Ritchie, Waverley Street,Glasgow.NOT for the first time you have printed a letter from Ian Moirin which he produces his quite fantastical electricity generation figures and his ridiculous consequential financial implications for Scotland.He states lsquorsquo to phase out TWh of gas, implying that this has been done by the Scottish Government.In fact TWh is about five times the annual demand for electricity in Scotland, and would require about ,MWs of gas capacity working at an annual load factor of  per cent ndash about  large gas fired power stations. Where were these stations And could I point out to Mr Moir that the Scottish Government has not ldquophased out a single MW of capacity as, a all generating plant in Great Britain is privately owned, and b energy policy is reserved to Westminster.On the back of his above fantasy figure of TWhs Mr Moir then computes that the dference between his assumed p unit figure for gas and his assumed p unit for renewables produces a figure of pound billion year. Actually that piece of arithmetic is correct. But for some reason he somehow thinks that this translates into a poundbn annual hit to Scotlandrsquos public services, which will be a surprise to anyone with a knowledge of our public finances.Nick Dekker, Nairn Way,Cumbernauld."},{"url":null,"title":"brian-beacom-id-be-lying-if-i-said-older-generation-are-naturally-more-truthful-than-youngsters","story":"Studies suggest that those over  find it harder to lie.

Theresa May in the back. Frazer ignores the question and replies, repeatedly: ldquoThe Prime Minister has worked incredibly hard to ensure there is no hard border in Northern Ireland. Blah, blah.Of course, not all lies are bad. Each of us lies about once or twice a day. About little things, sometimes for altruistic reasons. We use Santa as a potential reward device. One psychologist even suggests, ldquoOur social lives would collapse under the weight of honesty.

I would love to give teachers and all public sector workers a % pay rise but that is simply not affordable in a single year.\"So what we need to do now, and the Scottish Government will play our full part in this, we need to come back to the table to agree a fair and affordable agreement, in the same way that the Scottish Government has already done for nurses and other health care workers and police officers.\"The Scottish Government will proceed to do that in good faith and I hope we can before too much longer reach that fair and reasonable agreement.\"She pledged ministers would go into talks \"in good faith and with the political will to find an agreement\", and said: \"What we need to do is get back round the table, which is happening, and come up with a fair offer, but one that is also realistic and affordable.\""},{"url":null,"title":"analysis-westminsters-moment-of-truth-and-the-uncertain-way-ahead","story":"Sources at Westminster first talked up Monday December  and have this week been talking up Monday December .The Commons Procedure Committee has argued there should be at least five days allotted for debate on the historic Withdrawal Agreement and Future Framework to leave the EU, pointing out how back in  there were six days granted for the debate on whether Britain should join the European Economic Community.Counting back from the two suggested Mondays, this would mean MPs starting their debate on Monday December  or Monday Dec .However, MPs have first to agree on how the vote will be taken. This debate itself could take a day or so. Why  Because there are dfering views naturally.The committee offered three choices, preferring the first.This would mody the current practice to allow the Speaker to call more than one amendment at the end of the debate but before the main vote on the Government proposal.The second would be an adaptation of Opposition Day debates with the motion taken before amendments this is the Governmentrsquos preferred option. The Prime Minister has said the public would expect MPs to vote first on her actual plan but her opponents fear this would maximise her chances of getting her plan through.The third would be voting on a series of freestanding and non-binding motions, expressing alternative views before the actual vote on the main motion.Charles Walker, who chairs the Committee, noted how the so-called ldquomeaningful vote would be ldquoone of the most momentous decisions ever taken both for the House of Commons and for the country.If, as now seems certain, Mrs May arrives in Brussels this weekend to see the withdrawal agreement and political declaration signed off by the EU, the focus will turn swtly to Westminster and the parliamentary arithmetic.Given that earlier this week Amber Rudd, the new Work and Pensions Secretary, unexpectedly declared Parliament would stop a no-deal, there is now a choice on the table: Mrs Mayrsquos or, rather, the EU+rsquos plan, or an alternative that the likes of Jeremy Corbyn, Nicola Sturgeon and Sir Vince Cable can coalesce around.It is now a race against time.Because the Tory leadership now appears to have accepted there cannot be a no-deal scenario, the PM cannot seek to encourage Labour moderates to her cause. Why would they  If they believe in having a Peoplersquos Vote to keep the UK in the EU or in having a softer Brexit, they can just vote down Mrs Mayrsquos plan and back an alternative.This means Mrs May faces a political Everest in that she can only look to convincing her own party as well as the Democratic Unionists to back her plan to give her a majority. On the evidence of Conservative and DUP reaction so far, this seems like mission impossible.On the other side, talks will begin in earnest next week between Labourrsquos Sir Keir Starmer and the SNPrsquos Stephen Gethins to try to bridge the gulf between their two parties to come up with a workable alternative.The three options appear to be Labourrsquos plan for a customs union, staying as close to the single market as possible and protecting workerrsquos rights and privileges, the SNPrsquos for staying in the current single market and customs union or having a Peoplersquos Vote to try to keep Britain in the EU.The key dference between Labour and the SNP is on freedom of movement the former wants it restricted as was voted for south of the border, the latter doesnrsquot as was voted for north of the border.One parliamentary source involved in the Lab SNP talks admitted that, as things stood, coalescing behind a Peoplersquos Vote looked like the best option as this might also persuade Tory Remainers to back it. But this might change.Of course, Mr Corbyn and his colleagues want a general election but because such a move is now governed by statute, the Fixed Term Parliaments Act, there are only two ways to call an early poll: by getting a two-thirds majority of MPs and a simple majority on a confidence vote. Both seem unlikely given neither the Tories nor the DUP want another general election.One theory is thatMrs May loses the meaningful vote, then, as the pound slumps and the markets take fright, she will amend it so that the Tory Party, having looked over the abyss, steps back and supports a new, hastily revised version.One Cabinet minister admitted: ldquoWe are looking at this as a possible way out.Talk about high stakes."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/3030106.jpg?type=article-full","title":"fiona-bruce-set-to-become-the-first-female-host-of-question-time","story":"It would make the daughter of a Scots Unilever executive who has become one of TVs most recognisable stars, the first female host in the programmersquos history.The Antiques Roadshow presenter, who has previously professed to feeling Scottish because of her family roots, was not considered one of the favourites for the current affairs debate programme after Mr Dimbleby said he would be leaving the position at the end of the year.Ms Bruce, , is expected to take over the role in early  and was said to have impressed executive in a series of auditions held behind close doors.

Jim therefore tried to find historical accuracy as far as possible by researching contemporary documents and manuscripts that held vital evidence.\"There are certain liberties you can take, like for example the drumming used by the armies preparing for battle and that is often for dramatic effect.\"The film is billed as a \"true David versus Goliath story\" of how the great th-century \"outlaw king\" Robert the Bruce used cunning and bravery to defeat the larger and better-equipped occupying English army.At the films debut during the Toronto Film Festival last year there were a few raised eyebrows when American actor Chris Pine, who plays Bruce, appeared full-frontal naked in one scene.Directed by Oscar-nominated film-maker David Mackenzie the epic was shot in ious Scottish locations throughout  and Jim spent six months working on the diegetic soundtrack.Jim said: \"I had a meeting with David Mackenzie just a few weeks before the shoot and none of this particular aspect was planned.

We all love it.\"Gill Arrowsmith and Shirley Sinclair both thought the painting was \"fantastic\" while Annemarie Simpson thought that a similar venture in Wick would help tackle the \"towns eyesore\" buildings.While on that subject, one dissenting voice condemned the piece and said there was a \"masterpiece eyesore now in Wilson Street thanks to Caithness Horizons\".Beauty is, of course, in the eye of the beholder.The mural depicts a portrait of Thursos renowned botanist and geologist Robert Dick surrounded by a kaleidoscopic representation of the CHMAG facade and the scientists specimen collection.The bold use of line and colour based on modern urban graffiti cannot fail to be noticed just like the mural on nearby Tollemache House but is sited in a much less conspicuous space ndash the gallerys car park.CHMAGs curator Merran Gunn, who was instrumental in commissioning Delaye to create the work, said the artist had also spray painted a wall within the building as part of a show running called Graffito.His earlier piece has an explosive anime style figure punching out of the wall toward the viewer.\"Marcs work is bold and vibrant, electric colours jostle for dominance, and the new outside mural is no exception with tangerine skies set behind the historic Thurso of Robert Dick,\" said Gunn.Thursos illustrious scientist had his herbarium collection feature in an earlier work by the artist Joanne Carr which in turn is featured within Delayes mural ndash a clear case of one artist paying homage to another.\"Graffiti and street art is more relevant than ever whether it be in the art world ndash with the recent record sale of Banksys girl with a balloon ndash or here in the Highlands where graffiti has made its way onto the syllabus at Farr High School through art teacher Tracy Wilkinson,\" she said.After garnering great positive feedback from the current show Merran decided to \"have a moment of spontaneity\" and raised funds through a crowdfunding website and the Dounreay Communities Fund to commission Marc Delaye to breath some le into a fairly drab corner of the town.Tracy Dodson, commercial manager of CHMAG, said that the gallery was \"breaking boundaries\" with Graffito.\"It questions what actually constitutes art and what gets shown in a gallery. Graffito is an exhibition that celebrates artwork that is available to everyone.\"Traditionally graffiti has been seen as anti-social, fringe or even as criminal vandalism, but with an emphasis on social inclusion, we are celebrating street, pop, comic and zine work as mainstream art for hanging in our gallery.\"Tracy unabashedly declares that Graffito is \"aimed at young people and the young at heart, as a way of inviting new and future audiences to a museum and gallery experience\".\"This is a multicoloured on-the-wall exhibition devoted to all manner of graphic mark-making and breaking the boundaries of what art is all about,\" she said. \"We have also hosted street painting and comic workshops, guided gallery tours, and collaborating with our local schools and council.\"Marc Delaye is an established community projects artist with Freshpaint.org which is based on the Black Isle.\"Murals are as alive now as ever before and an excellent way to introduce art to internal and external spaces, giving iniduals and communities something that they can be proud of and enjoy each and every day,\" said Marc.The murals can be privately commissioned and can be an \"ideal means of advertising products, services, messages and campaigns\".Other exhibitors at Graffito include Andy Strachan, of Comic Creations Studios Dundee, David Robertson of Fred Egg Comics and Zu Dominak, all of whom work at the University of Dundee within the Masters degrees in Comics and Graphic Novels ndash the only course of its kind in the UK.Other exhibitors include Victor Nobis and his series Fallen Giants ndash a fantasy dream space where cities like Edinburgh rise and twist through the torso of neon lit giant figures.Graffito finishes on Saturday with a day of childrens workshops, guided tours and a colouring competition.Friday  Nov  : AM"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"November ,  at : pmResidents and businesses in Westray and Shapinsay are being reminded that changes to their recycling and refuse collections start next week.

There are a number of potential routes we could now take with them – some of which offer us the opportunity to generate income, some to make savings # and officers will be exploring these opportunities in due course.”According to OIC, the Stewart Endowment Trust disperses the majority of its funds locally, including to NHS Orkney. The council therefore anticipates that most of the money generated from the sale will stay in and benefit Orkney.Iain Macdonald, chair of the Stewart Endowment Trust said: “The Stewart Endowment Trustees offered these islands for sale in order to generate funds, which are used to support the work of local congregations, the Balfour Hospital and a couple of national charities, as defined by the Endowment’s founding document.#We are delighted that they will be moving into ship of the local authority, where they will remain a precious asset for the whole community for generations to come.”The main island, Faray is around  acres, the Holm of Faray around  acres and the smallest of the three, Red Holm, is just five acres.There are a number of ruinous dwelling houses scattered across Faray together with a bothy which is housed in the former school. The island is mainly semi-improved grassland and has several sandy beaches together with rocky shorelines and clfs.According to the council, Faray had a population of  in , falling to  by . By the late s, there were eight crofting families living on the island, making a living through lobster fishing. In  the last islander had left Faray.The islands are home to a colony of grey seals with parts designated as a Site of Special Scientic Interest and Special Area of Conservation.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Albyn Housing is asking them to pay a lot more each month in some cases.The concerns were echoed by the MP Mr Blackford who said ldquofor quite a while now, he has been working with the CAB to get to bottom of ldquowhat I would generously describe as curious practices from Albyn Housing.He added: ldquoIn one case an Albyn Housing client who had just undertaken a tenancy was immediately sent a letter informing her rent was already in arrears.ldquoIn effect, they are asking for a payment arrangement in view that it is a debt, and extra payment is, therefore, being requested each month.ldquoI am sure as a charitable organisation Albyn Housing has their tenantsrsquo best wishes at heart, however, their recent practices raise many questions.ldquoThese must be reviewed to ensure that no additional hardship is being brought upon the people who take up a tenancy with them.In response, Calum Macaulay, chief executive at Albyn Housing Society, insisted his rent due date had not changed and said his organisation followed the statutory form of tenancy laid out by the Scottish Government in the HousingAct  ldquowhich states that rent is due on, or before, the first day of the month, paid in arrears.He went on: ldquoTenants claiming housing benefit previously had their rent paid directly to Albyn Housing.ldquoWe were always made aware that the payment was due, and as such, any arrears would be treated as technical.ldquoNow, with universal credit, the tenant is responsible for paying their rent direct. The society has no dealings with the DWP and we are not made aware of incoming housing payments. This means that all tenants, regardless of whether they are claiming universal credit or not, are required to pay their rent in accordance with their tenancy agreement.He said housing officers would be ldquomore than willing to help tenants make arrangements that work for them.It comes weeks after Albyn Housing had to apologise to a vulnerable tenant in Inverness after a boiler check bungle ended up leaving the single mum locked out of her flat for the night with her toddler daughter and having to rely on social workers to pay for emergency accommodation.Friday  Nov  : AMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

a package including the political declaration and the -page withdrawal agreement setting out the terms of the ‘orce’ from the EU - to be approved by European leaders at a special summit on Sunday.“The draft text that we have agreed with the Commission is a good deal for our country and for our partners in the EU,” told the House of Commons.“It honours the vote of the British people by taking back control of our borders, our laws and our money while protecting jobs, security and the integrity of our precious United Kingdom.”As many as  Conservative MPs have publicly declared they will not vote for the deal.• : Brexit: UK and EU agree outline for trade and security talksA Downing Street charm offensive aimed at convincing eurosceptics that a backstop plan for the Irish border can be avoided using “alternative” customs technologies appeared to have failed, with Iain Duncan Smith telling Mrs May that “none of this is at all workable” unless the withdrawal agreement is renegotiated.Dominic Raab, the former Brexit Secretary, claimed the backstop “ties the UK to the customs union and single market rules with no voice” and will be used by the EU as “the starting point for future relations to build on”.Mr Raab said Brexit voters wanted to “take back control” but said it was “the regrettable but inescapable reality that this deal gives even more away”.And the chief whip of the DUP, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, also called on the Prime Minister to renegotiate, telling her: “If she wants to have the support of my party for the withdrawal agreement then we need to see an end to the backstop and those alternative arrangements put in place.”• : PM’s Brexit document is  pages of waffle, Jeremy Corbyn claimsMrs May told MPs that “the best way to ensure the backstop is not used is to get the future relationship into place” before the end of the post-Brexit transition phase, which is scheduled to end in December , but could be extended as far as the end of talks drag on.The draft political declaration outlines the objectives for trade and security cooperation after Brexit.European Council president Donald Tusk announced it had been “agreed at negotiators’ level and agreed in principle at political level” and sent to Britain’s  European partners for further consideration.“The Commission President has informed me that it has been agreed at negotiators’ level and agreed in principle at political level, subject to the endorsement of the Leaders,” he added.An earlier draft of the declaration came to seven pages, but the final version is now  pages long.Unlike the withdrawal agreement, the political declaration is not legally binding, but is linked to the UK’s ‘orce’ terms.The UK Government has said that the withdrawal agreement, including the £bn financial settlement, will not be enacted without the political declaration.Jeremy Corbyn criticised the trade outline, calling it “ pages of waffle” and a blueprint for a deal that is the “worst of all worlds”.“The only certainty contained within these pages is that the transition period will have to be extended or we will end up with a backstop and no exit,” the Labour leader told MPs.“It represents the worst of all worlds, no say over the rules that will continue to apply and no certainty to the future.”He added: “We have  pages of waffle, this empty document could have been written two years ago.”Mr Corbyn also called on the PM to “abandon her poisonous rhetoric” on immigration.Instead of negotiating a “new, comprehensive customs union”, he said the Tories were more interested in “dog whistling on immigration”.Focusing on fishing, SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford called the document “an absolute dereliction of the promises Scottish Conservative members and [Environment Secretary Michael Gove] made to Scotland - shame on them.”He askedher Scottish MPs and Scottish Secretary David Mundell had agreed to the political declaration, adding: “Is it not the case that she’s just lost further critical votes on the deal because Scottish Tory MPs could not possibly vote in favour of this sell out of Scottish fishing interests ”The Prime Minister was expected to speak to a number of EU leaders last night. She acknowledged that she must still convince some of them to back the deal, with the Spanish Prime Minister threatening to vote against it because the political declaration does not grant Madrid a veto over the application of future trade agreements in Gibraltar.Speaking in Downing Street before addressing MPs, the Prime Minister said she had spoken to Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez on Wednesday night and was “confident that on Sunday we will be able to agree a deal that delivers for the whole UK family, including Gibraltar.”Two-thirds of the  other EU members must agree to the deal for it to be approved.Last night Mrs May met Austria’s chancellor in London ahead of Sunday’s summit. Ahead of the meeting, Sebastian Kurz said he hoped to get a “realistic picture” of May’s chances of getting the deal through Westminster, and warned: “Reopening the deal is not an option.”©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4833776.1542905585!/image/image.jpg","title":"nicola sturgeon 10 pay rise for teachers simply not affordable","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Scottish teachers must be prepared to accept a #fair# and #realistic# pay deal, not the unaffordable  per cent rise unions are demanding, the First Minister has said.Nicola Sturgeon said she recognised the “strength of feeling” there was on the issue, after a ballot by Scotland’s largest teaching union saw  per cent vote to reject the wage offer.It comes as the SNP leader was told teachers were having to “buy pens, pencils, books for pupils because Scotland’s schools are starved of cash”.Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard challenged her on the issue after two unions voted overwhelmingly against the offer that has been made by councils and the Scottish Government.Education Secretary John Swinney has already said that while teachers are being offered a  per centpay rise across the board, restructuring of the main pay grade scale, combined with other changes will mean most would receive a rise of between  per cent and  per cent.In a ballot  per cent of EIS union members rejected that, with  per cent of members of the SSTA teaching union who took part in a vote also opposed.Mr Leonard said: “The First Minister wants to be judged by her record on education, so let’s examine that record - it’s a record of austerity, which even SNP councillors now admit is going too far.“How can education be your top priority with underfunded schools and undervalued teachers ”Ms Sturgeon insisted: “Teachers are not undervalued, we highly value the work that teachers do.”But Labour’s Iain Gray, a former teacher, said: “The last time Scotland’s teachers were angry enough to go on strike Margaret Thatcher was still prime minister, I was a school teacher, the First Ministerwas a school pupil and some of the  per centof current teachers who have just rejected the pay offer were not even born.• : Scottish teachers reject pay deal put forward by Holyrood“That is how badly this government has handled teacher pay.”Patrick Harvie of the Scottish Greens also called on the Government to come back to pay talks with a “realistic offer” - saying staff in classrooms had seen their salaries fall in real terms by almost a quarter over the last decade.“We all want teaching to be an attractive rewarding profession, where people fell valued for that hard work, but that isn’t happening now,” he said.“Huge numbers of teachers feel overworked, under resourced and demeaned as they see the value of their salaries eroded year after year.”To avoid the prospect of a teaching strike he said ministers needed to they “work towards a realistic offer and give local councils the resources they need to meet it”.Ms Sturgeon said the government and the council body Cosla would negotiate with teaching unions in a bid to resolve the pay row.She told MSPs: “I recognise that offer has been rejected, I respect that and I recognise the strength of feeling, so the Scottish Government and Cosla will go back to the table and we will continue to seek a reasonable agreement in good faith.”She said she wanted to “see teachers get a good pay rise, one that recognises the vital and very dficult job they do, one which recognises not just the current cost of living pressures but starts also a process of restoration of the lost ground that all public sector workers have suffered because of the years of pay restraint”.But she made clear the  per centrise unions are demanding is not affordable.The First Minister said: “This is a statement of simple fact - pay awards have to be affordable, becausethey are not affordable they can not be delivered. I would love to give teachers and all public sector workers a  per centpay rise but that is simply not affordable in a single year.“So what we need to do now, and the Scottish Government will play our full part in this, we need to come back to the table to agree a fair and affordable agreement, in the same way that the Scottish Government has already done for nurses and other health care workers and police officers.“The Scottish Government will proceed to do that in good faith and I hope we can before too much longer reach that fair and reasonable agreement.”She pledged ministers would go into talks “in good faith and with the political will to find an agreement”, and said: “What we need to do is get back round the table, which is happening, and come up with a fair offer, but one that is also realistic and affordable.”©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4833266.1542829034!/image/image.jpg","title":"the beginning of the end of global democracy leader comment","story":"Russia#s failed bid to take over Interpol was a lucky escape, but tyrants the world over are getting bolder.The election of a South Korean police officer as president of Interpol would normally not have warranted much of a mention. Indeed, Kim Jong Yang’s appointment was described by one lawyer as a “solid, uncontroversial choice”.However, the reason why the election took place at all and what nearly happened are deeply alarming signs of how close we are to a new world order in which democracy, the rule of law and basic human rights no longer hold sway.The vacancy arose after the previous Interpol president, Meng Hongwei, disappeared in his native China. The authorities later said he was suspected of taking bribes, a claim his we denies, saying he is the victim of a vendetta by rivals in China’s security ministry. Such disappearances are not uncommon in China. Earlier this year, actress Fan Bingbing, star of the X-Men and Iron Man films, vanished for months before eventually surfacing to apologise for failing to pay her taxes.: Russia loses Interpol presidency vote as South Korean is electedJustice in China does not involve the idea that it must be seen to be done, leading to the well-founded suspicion that China’s leaders use state powers to silence critics. Kim’s election was also something of a surprise. The favourite was Alexander Prokopchuk, a former Russian interior ministry official. Businessman Bill Browder – whose lawyer Sergei Magnitsky was allegedly tortured and killed in a Moscow prison after investigating alleged corruption involving Kremlin-linked figures – had warned that Prokopchuk would take his instructions from Vladimir Putin, pointing out that Russia carried out Salisbury chemical weapons attack, has interfered in democratic elections in the US and Europe, and that a Russian missile was used to shoot down a passenger plane over Ukraine.: British academic jailed for le over spying allegations in UAEDonald Trump’s response to the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in a Saudi embassy – Trump said the Saudi royal family promised to spend billions on US arms – was another sign of how the rule of law is being diminished. All this sends out strong messages to elected leaders who look enviously at Putin’s corruption of democracy and to straightforward tyrants like the Saudi Crown Prince: democracy is falling, might is right, and murdering or disappearing a rival won’t have many repercussions. Interpol, already abused by non-democratic states, narrowly avoided being taken over by a deeply sinister regime.

Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of le.

To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear..."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 25 ","story":"Those responsible finally saw sense this week, reversing the ridiculous decision to play both Scottish League Cup semi-finals at Hampden Park on the same day.Celtic, one of the four sides involved, had indicated that a draw should be made to determine which game was moved to Murrayfieldthe original plans were scrapped.But the holders’ game against Hearts will now take place in Edinburgh at .pm on Sunday th October. The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"whalsays new research arrives in lerwick for first time ","story":"The Research leaves Symbister with bunting flying as she heads for Lerwick on Saturday.

He had represented Cunningsburgh, Ness United and ious Shetland select sides, once making a trip to Faroe with a county squad.Alastair was probably a wing-half in his early days, but after the change from -- to modern formations he usually formed part of the central defence.He played alongside the late Ian Manson for Ness, while for Cunningsburgh his long-term partner was Douglas Halcrow. They were part of a team which enjoyed many successes in Southern League football, and also which won the Parish Cup in  and .Cunningsburgh had a number of outstanding players in that era, not least twins Billy and Malcolm Adamson and the late George Adamson, but Alastair was definitely one of the most consistent.Very similar to his -year career at The Shetland Times, he was as dedicated as it was possible to be, someone you could always count on whatever the issue.As former goalkeeper Peter Farmer said after the funeral last Friday, “I played behind Alistair for  years and he was so reliable, the way he read the game.”Football runs in the family. His younger brother Gordon also played for Cunningsburgh and Ness while another brother Jim represented Shetland in  and . Nephews Raymond and James Aitken and Tony and James Johnston did likewise, with the latter becoming the county’s equal most-capped player.When the Times started a works league team in the s Alistair was persuaded to come out of retirement and take part in the very first match, a friendly against Bressay. That was where his we hailed from and I recall him saying that “I better no score a goal or Margaret will nivver spaek ta me again”.He also came with the works team on a trip to Orkney. He was a bit unsure about that and actually got injured in one of the matches, but as far as I recall he had as good a time as anybody where the after-match entertainment was concerned.Alastair and Margaret had three daughters, Wendy and twins Susan and Alison. They were all musically gted while Susan and Alison excelled at hockey.One of his grand-daughters, Sophie Moar, is a top athlete. At the island games in Jersey three years ago she won a bronze medal in the long jump and was a member of the gold medal-winning # metres relay squad. Alastair and Margaret were there to see it and I would imagine that was one of his proudest ever moments. After his retiral in  our paths crossed a few times but unfortunately not all that often. He was always friendly and good company.The last time I saw Alastair was earlier this year when I visited him and Margaret at Bremmer in Cunningsburgh. It was a very dficult experience as by then the dementia had taken its toll, and he was a shadow of the vibrant figure he had been. He still knew me though, which made it worthwhile.Alistair was a tremendous guy. I know Margaret, their daughters and grandchildren, and the other family will miss him greatly, and I would like to give my condolence to them all.: : : : : : : :News came this week that Crystal Palace footballer James McArthur had retired from Scotland duty as he believed it was the only way he could “continue to play at the top level”.There was a time when representing your country was considered the “top level” but sadly that is not a view shared by an increasing number of people in the game.McArthur, who won the last of his  caps a year ago, says he has found it increasingly dficult to manage a number of physical issues. He is only .The Crystal Palace midfielder will continue to turn out for his club in what could be -odd games a season. However, he has deemed the half a dozen or so he could be required for his international side to be just too much.McArthur follows in the wake of a number of Scottish players who have taken this decision, the highest profile being Celtic captain Scott Brown. Others, such as Alan Hutton, are still performing regularly for their clubs.There were also the recent instances where both Leigh Grfiths, Robert Snodgrass and Kieran Tierney asked to be released from the international squad because of perceived “fatigue”.No doubt McArthur, like the others mentioned, has his reasons for arriving at this decision. But I cannot help thinking that players from a dferent era would never have done so.Some, notably Denis Law and current Scottish boss Alex McLeish, have said they have never retired from their country.

SIC has a poor record of flag flying in my opinion from the senior flagstaff. It#s the UK government#sand Scottish Parliaments policy to encourage councils to fly the Union Flagon a regular daily basis. It#s very rare to see a flag flying any time except on the Lord Lieutenants flag flying days list ofwhich is out of date.It is troubling to hear where the British media still blame German militarism and nationalism for WW, asnationalism and militarism were ever missing from the British national outlook. All major European powers fought to gain advantage over neighbours.It is refreshing though to hear the French President tell world leaders, including Putin and Trump, that nationalism is a #betrayal of patriotism#.#By saying #our interests first and never mind the others#, you stamp out the most precious thing a nation has # its moral values,# he said, thereby insisting these sometimes exist.The European Union used to be widely regarded as a moral endeavour. It seems most of our neighbours still see it that way, as something worthwhile which tempers selfish instincts and secures peace.If Brexit goes ahead the prospect of Britain forgetting its responsibilities as a victor, as Churchill put it in, #for the immediate future of the world# looms large. Let us hope some lessons can be recalled.#Patriotism is when the love of your own people comes first nationalism, when hate for people other than your own comes first.# # Charles de GaulleSadly we see Donald Trump, #America First!, Let#s make America great again#. A nationalist doctrine of utter selfishness!We seem the same doctrine of the Alt-right gaining a foothold in the UK and Europe. Remember #The Only Thing Necessary for the Triumph of Evil is that Good Men Do Nothing#,It is a sad reflection of the many, many people which has died due to war and conflict.There is one institute which promotes, encourages and sanctions war and conflict more so than any other establishment within a modern society.We have probably killed and maimed more people in the last  years than at any other time in  years. What has brought this to the fore is technology but also the institutes which have remained silent on such atrocities, this being the backbone of modern societies driven by economics, our banking systems.Never has there been so much money spent on war and conflict, never have so many countries been destroyed by war and conflict, and who stands by the sideline reaping in massive profits as a result, our banks.The Bible says # For the Love of Money is the Root to All Evils # never a truer word said with our modern banking systems.Rather sad that at a time when we remember those that saw the horror of so many European conflicts, we also saw the French and German leaders announce they want to create a #real# EU Army. I presume by #real# they mean, #the ability to kill people#. Not only was it tactless of Merkel and Macron, we surely have enough standing armed forces already in the world. Do we really need another Jane , I feel sure that Merkel and Macron were not thinking along the same lines as yourself .They stated the need for a ‘ real army’without any references to the huge revenues that could be gained from the manufacture of arms.It’s all very well trying to pass their claim off as being for the strength and safety of Europe but with no reference whatsoever to the economic   financial benefits which would bolster the banking strengths of Germany and France. What an oversight !!Too much sauerkraut and champagne probablyto blame.I wondertheir suggestion is in any way due to their much reduced popularity in their respective countries.I would have thought the present EU decision-making structure e.g. nations’ vetoes, is hopelessly incompatible with having its own military, capable of defending Europe against Russia, China and laughably, the US. How much will that cost  It will need massive further integration, possibly, to United States of Europe level , a ghastly spectre that motivated many Brexiteers to vote ‘Leave’. year more than the next seven countries put together at  billion dollars.To say that the E.U. should not work militarily together is preposterous.Europe has been ided by maniacs with delusions of grandeur,their own ego#s and agendas on too many occasions # the last fty years has brought us peace,economic stability and a continent able to feed itself.I am sure WinstonChurchillwould be very proud of that after the hell of World ,he fought like so many others for it and would be appalled at the prospect of Little Englanderism and the new Westminster faith with its no deal brexit nonsense! Hungarian Revolution of , Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia, the Turkish invasion of Cyprus, The Bosnian War, The Kosovo War, Annexation of Crimea, The Ukraine crisis, The Russo-Georgian War and that is ignoring The Troubles in Ireland and countless terrorist attacks. We have a death toll here of tens of thousand and rising! Graham Fleming at least make a stab at historical fact occasionally.John, look at the EU command structure! The most expensive army on Earth would require a  Sate agreement before it could deploy. Then it could not fire a shot. If it hit an killed an enemy how about that enemy#s human rights  Iy takes # The Europen Court # about four years to reach a design!Thank God we are not talking about a European Navy, climate change and all that, sailing ships only.All of these good things I mentioned happened within our European Union,the bad bit you mentioned truthfully# was Northern Ireland, mainly the domain and remit of the British state doesn#t bode well for the future at all,at all.Interesting that the Great War commemoration coincides with Theresa May#s abject surrender to the EU.One big threat from May#s deal is to the UK union itself with the proposal that Northern Ireland be separated from the rest of the UK and be under Brussels laws and regulations.As predicted, the SNP now want the same treatment and will use that as a #grievance# to win support for a second Scottish independence referendum.The current mess will also play straight into their hands by confirming their allegations of #Westminster incompetence#.How on earth could anyone accuse the Westminster government of incompetence QC Martin Howe, writing in the Spectator, spells out the alarming legal consequences of the UK accepting May#s surrender terms:Many events over the past four years that have commemorated the sacrice of so many people have been profoundly moving .However I have been a bit upset this year.I have noticedthat local communities were trying to #outdo# each other with their poppydisplays.Well-meant I am sure, but remembrance is not about community #one-up-man-ship#, it is very personal and I am sad that in some places it has been turned into a #best display# competition # a Halloween of who can remember best.

MusgroveRESIDENTS in the strath will once again have access to affordable swimming at the Macdonald Aviemore Resort after a deal was finally agreed after a three-month stand-off.The breakthrough follows \"extremely positive and constructive\" high-level discussions between the hotel group and Highland Council.Local Highland High Leusers have been unable to use the leisure pool since the end of August when access ended because of a funding wrangle.Macdonald Hotels chairman Donald Macdonald and deputy chairman Gordon Fraser met with the councils new chief executive Donna Manson in Aviemore on Tuesday and reached a one-year agreement to resolve the stalemate.HLH users will not have to pay any additional charges which had been one of the options on the table as attempts were made to break the deadlock.There is further good news with confirmation that HLH swimming lessons for children and aquafit will also resume.Details of the funding arrangements have not yet been made public nor when the doors will re-open.Speaking after the meeting, Mr Fraser said: \"Were extremely encouraged by the positive and constructive approach taken by Donna Manson and her team and are very happy that we have reached an agreement which will see the local High Le Highland members enjoying the facilities at Aviemore Resort very soon.\"We understand that local authorities throughout the country are facing financial pressures and that there is a clear responsibility to spend tax-payers money wisely.\"We were also encouraged by the recognition of our own position that we have had to swallow a wide range of very signicant cost increases in rates, energy bills and staffing costs over the past  months.\"Mr Fraser continued: \"Its clear that both we and the council were very keen to welcome back local people and reach a clear and swt resolution to what has been an unfortunate situation for everyone concerned, and particularly for the many local High Le Highland members.\"For our part, we are very keen to have our local guests back through the doors, and I know that members of the local community will be happy that this matter has been resolved.\"The new agreement will allow time for further consultation on public access to the leisure facilities in future years.Highland Council convener Bill Lobban, who lives in Aviemore, said: \"I am delighted that a sensible agreement has been reached.\"This new deal is great news for Highland Council, High Le Highland and Macdonald Aviemore Resort but most importantly its fantastic news for the residents of Badenoch and Strathspey.\"The swimming pool is a well-used, important attraction and I would like to congratulate the staff from both sides who have worked really hard behind the scenes to get this result and more especially members of the local community who made sure that their voice was heard in the process.\"Well done to all.\"A positive community campaign had been launched called Save Our Swimming following the doors closing to HLH users at the end of the summer.SOS co-ordinator Joe Kirby described the agreement as a fantastic result for all the parties.He said: \"It is great that the council and Macdonald Hotels have listened to the concerns of the community and that a pragmaticto talks has delivered this deal.\"I know as a father myself that folk across the strath will be really looking forward to getting backing into the swimming pool with their children and other families members.\"Id like to thank everyone who wrote correspondence to Macdonald Hotels, attended the public meetings and demonstrations

not the pound.m which Councillor Bruce has claimed.\"HIE also acquired pound.m in preference shares.\"However, due in large part to delay, obfuscation and obstruction by the previous administration of Highland Council, planning permissions were still not able to be delivered after  frustrating years of trying.\"As a result, and to the intense dismay and signicant financial cost of the three partners involved, the scheme, which would have created hundreds of much-needed jobs locally in an area of the country which desperately needed them, was forced into administration.\"This obviously meant the loss of pound.m of public money, which was utterly lamentable and deeply regrettable, as well as millions of pounds of losses to the three partners involved, but it also delayed huge investment in the local economy.\"It was only because Macdonald Hotels had a rock-solid commitment to regenerating the resort that we reached an agreement with the administrators in June  which prevented it from closing down completely for a second time.\"Ironically, it was only after the administration process that Highland Council granted the planning permission which had been applied for  years previously and which two previous owners had walked away from during that time.\"There was nothing controversial within that planning permission and itrsquos no more than the design of the resort as it is today.\"Since then we have invested pound.m in transforming the infrastructure at Aviemore and are now the largest private-sector employer in the area, with hundreds of full and part time staff employed there and an annual wage bill of pound.m.\"\"Indeed, we estimate that the resort will have hosted over , overnight stays, including several international conferences ndash some of them with up to  delegates - in the current year, many of which will provide vital additional income to local bars, restaurants, shops and attractions.\"Gordon Fraser, deputy chairman of Macdonald Hotels  Resorts, said: \"It is, of course, right and proper that local politicians get involved in such important issues, but for Councillor Bruce to insist that we should simply swallow the enormous increases in rates, salaries and energy costs at Aviemore without seeking a reasonable increase in the amount we receive for allowing Highland High Le members to use private leisure facilities, is blatant double-standards.\"Itrsquos a bit rich for the council to increase our annual rates bill by . per cent in the year to March  and yet when we seek a modest uplt in charges to help us cover a small element of those and many other cost increases, one of the councilrsquos own officials described our request as lsquounaffordablersquo.\"Like us, many local businesses might consider their large rates increases to be lsquounaffordablersquo but we have no choice other than to pay them.\"Councillor Bruce should remember that we entered into this agreement, and were happy to do so, on the basis that it saved Highland Council from having to spend many millions on building their own swimming pool and leisure facilities locally.\"And he should also bear in mind that the annual sums we are discussing are far, far lower than those which Highland Council would face each year for running their own facilities.\"Despite the ill-judged intervention of Councillor Bruce, we have been encouraged by the constructive and helpful approach of other politicians and hope to meet with senior council officials in the very near future to resolve what has been a damaging and unnecessary episode.\"The sooner we can welcome High Le members back into Aviemore, the better, but it has to be on a sustainable and viable commercial basis.\"Councillor Bruce was unavailable for comment.He had asked: \"Given that HIE awarded an pound. million funding package to Macdonald Hotels to develop the Avie-more Resort ndash including the construction of the leisure arena in the early s ndash should Macdonald Hotels not allow High Le card members to use the swimming-poolfacility in view of the public funds they enjoyed and has this point been raised in negotiations rsquoHighland Council has said it remains open to restarting negotiations.Aviemore Primary School pupils recently wrote to Mr Macdonald asking for the pool to reopen and the schools parent council led by Judith Thurlow has also been part of the campaign.Friday  Nov  : AM"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118344.jpg","title":"Its far from being the end of the line","story":"Tom Ramage\"IM nervous as heck!\" confessed Karen Blessington, as she prepared to launch her own railway line last Friday.\"I have never spoken in public in my whole le so please bear with me...\"The huge crowd certainly did that and they loved every minute of the occasion as the flag went up again at Grantown East exactly  years to the day it last went down.It had been quite a journey \"from sadness to joy\" as she put it, following those drastic Beeching cuts of the s.\"The Phoenix has risen from the ashes of a derelict brown site.

Importantly that means that visitors will be travelling through the Sleat peninsula, where communities have worked long and hard to build up a viable industry.“In the midst of the important debates about ferries and not least the importance of the MV Coruisk to the Armadale-Mallaig crossing, it’s important to celebrate the huge contribution that RET has made to the island economies.”If CalMac#s league tables of ferry route usage tell us anything, it is that moving the MV #Coruisk# from its purpose-built harbours on the busiest crossing in the north-west remains inexplicable.If the two tables of passengers and coaches highlight anything , it is that CalMac badly needs its two new ferries from the Clyde to be delivered according to their revised schedule and not experience a third delay.It is a mild surprise, as Kate Forbes MSP says, to discover that more people sail between Mallaig and Armadale in Skye than between Stornoway and Ullapool and that more coaches cross the Sound of Sleat than make any other journey on CalMac#s itinerary.It is good news not only for Sleat but for the whole of the island. It is good news which is tempered by the fact that this busy, bustling route is now served only by whatever ships CalMac can spare, when the tide permits them, while its purpose-built vessel, the MV #Coruisk#, which can dock at Armadale in all tidal conditions, is ploughing between Mull and Oban  nautical miles away.If CalMac had the ships, Mallaig Armadale would be dependable and therefore even busier, Mull would have a vessel of its own and almost everybody would be happy.CalMac do not have the ships in large part because two new deep-sea vessels which were commissioned in  from Ferguson Marine Engineering at Port Glasgow show no sign of turning up for duty.One of them is due to operate on CalMac#s busiest passenger route between Ardrossan and Arran. The other is to work between Uig, Tarbert and Lochmaddy, which last year carried almost , people.The delivery date for those two ships has been put back twice. On each occasion, the £ million contract to Ferguson Marine — which is the property of one of the Scottish Government#s friends, advisors and allies, the billionaire tax exile Jim McColl — was topped up by a multi-million-pound handout from the public purse.If all was on schedule at least one of those ships would now be in service, and CalMac would have substantially more leeway in manoeuvring its fleet from one part of the west coast to another. They might even be able to keep the #Coruisk# on the Sound of Sleat.They are very far from on schedule. The new Ardrossan Arran ferry is now supposed to be delivered next summer, and the new Uig Tarbert Lochmaddy ship in spring .Will they be delivered  Or will we experience a third delay, which would certainly plunge CalMac into even greater chaos as its ageing fleet breaks down or requires routine maintenance somewhere in the Baltic Those are important questions. As we reported last week, the chief executive of Outer Hebrides Tourism, Rob MacKinnon, has criticised the Scottish Government for a lack of any #tangible action# to address the islands# ferry problems.The Scottish transport ministry, said Mr MacKinnon, must #pursue all feasible options to increase ferry capacity in both the long and the short term for the benefit of both visitors and islanders#.As we report this week, Labour#s Western Isles# candidate Alison MacCorquodale has added her voice to the many demanding to know the precise terms of the private finance initiative deal which has bound the Scottish Government into using just one ferry for all passengers and freight between Ullapool and Stornoway, with unacceptable consequences.Ullapool Stornoway may not yet carry as many tourists as Mallaig Armadale. But it is the definition of a leline service, with , passengers last year, many of whom found themselves unable to squeeze onto an overbooked #Loch Seaforth#.We should be told how and why one of our biggest and most important ferries came to be owned by Lloyds Bank.We should be toldJim McColl is going to deliver two badly-needed ships at the third time of asking.It is not enough to say, as does transport minister Michael Matheson, that building CalMac#s ferries is #providing vital support to our shipbuilding industry#The way things are going, building and rebuilding CalMac#s ferries will keep Scottish shipbuilding alive well into the next decade. Their higher purpose, and Mr Matheson#s job is to provide vital support to the Hebridean ferry service.

However, during Thursday’s meeting Councillor Cockburn was quick to dismiss the likelihood of this happening: “Who in their right mind would take  miles of the worst road in the Highlands” He said. “After six and a half years we still only have two options… and the delays and the consequences for the wider community have been absolutely shocking.”The SNP member for Wester Ross, Strathpeffer and Lochalsh also went on to question the tendering process behind the work at the bypass, saying: “Was it necessary to shut the road during the day  I believe there was a tender on the table that would have allowed the road to open during the day.”He went on to argue that the council needed to release money straight away to enable design work on the replacement options for the current bypass to begin, adding that it was a matter of urgency due to the risks identied in the  annual sloping report which detailed four very high-risk rock slopes at the Stromeferry bypass.In response to Councillor Cockburn, the council’s head of infrastructure Colin Howell said that the council did receive an alternative tender from a contractor who said they could carry out the required works at night, however, Mr Howell said the cost was signicant and due to concerns about these plans it was decided it would be wise for some of the work to be undertaken during the day.Mr Howell said that while there were ongoing issues with rockfalls and managing slopes, he believed that the council had done a good job. He went on to add that the council were prioritising the high-risk slopes and currently working on the cost and details in relation to stabilising those areas which would be delivered at the next EDI committee meeting. He added that there were “three optimum solutions” in respect to replacement options and said that the committee had “decided to leave those three on the table# and seek dialogue with Scottish Government for funding. He said: “The administration is looking for feedback, we are working on slopes with high risks and will come back to the next EDI with the costing.”Councillor Derek MacLeod described the current situation as “one episode in a long, long history of problems with the route#, and in contrast to his fellow ward member, Councillor Cockburn, he argued that the route should be “trunked between Auchtertyre and Garve” as he believed it to be strategic in linking the ferry points of Uig and UllapoolCouncil Leader Margaret Davidson told the committee that she would be meeting with the Transport Secretary Michael Matheson and would report back “what options have been put on the table.” Councillor Davidson said that the council were “acutely aware of what’s needed” and were working towards a long-term sustainable option for Stromeferry. She also thanked the public for their cooperation during the works and the council staff for their efforts."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/COL-JOCK-18-HANNAH-MATHESON-1.jpg","title":"meet donald the new animated face of","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineA local businessman from Skye has created an animated character with the aim of providing useful information to visitors to the island.Donald from Skye is an animated character and the star of a short film about the island.

For anartist of his stature this was courageous, dependent as he was, tosome extent, on commissions from people who, to say the least, wouldnot be subscribers to our paper. But this was an artist who went hisown way in art and who acted as a citizen with a conscience in anIreland where State-imposed censorship distorted not only politicaldebate but also national self-image. For Robert Ballaghcreative work and active citizenship have gone hand in hand all hisle. This is depicted in his double self-portrait ‘Upstairs No.’,one of the many illustrations of his work in this superbly writtenand beautully presented book. It is not a standard autobiographywith chapters set out in chronological order beginning with genealogyand ending with this week’s news. As you would expect from Ballagh,he takes a dferent approach, starting towards the later years andcircling through his days in no particular order before coming backto the present. More than that, he weaves narrative, anecdote andreflection together seamlessly and conversationally showing a skillwith words akin to his skill with brushes. He has a story to tell ofa very ied le, from his unusual family background to his time asa showband guitar player, through his unorthodox beginning as apainter and his development as an artist and an activist. Withfrankness and clarity he tells us how he learned and matured as anartist and his brief commentaries on many of his works areilluminating both of how they were made and the concepts behind them.It makes the reader want to look again and more intensely at thepictures. The Prologue isessentially a dedication to Robert’s late we Betty, his lelonginspiration, mentor and most important critic. The first chaptertells the harrowing story of how Betty, in her serious illness, wasdisgracefully let down by a healthcare system which basically allowedher to die through neglect, as was admitted in legal proceedings. Butthis does not cast a shadow over the book, as her positive presenceis felt throughout, and is celebrated by the author. These days I rarely getthat urge immediately to re-read a book when I reach the end, but Idid with this one. Thankfully the chapters are so well defined thatthey can be read as stand-alone essays or stories. Take just twoexamples: ‘Who Fears to Speak ofEaster Week’ recounts the tremendous people’s commemoration ofthe  Centenary in which Robert played a central part, aculmination of his activism which has included campaigning againstapartheid, for the Birmingham Six, for artists’ rights, with theIrish National Congress opening border roads, in solidarity withPalestine and as an enthusiastic participant in Féile an Pobail inWest Belfast from its commencement.‘Dining at McDonald’s’is a brilliant critique of the dominant and stultying modernistideology and practise in art and an appeal for an opening up. Ballaghattacks “the notion that the artists’ choice imbues a givenobject with special properties which are tantamount to a metaphysicaltransformation of the object that it ceases to be a pedestrianartefactand becomes,by virtue of the artist’s choice, art”. This ideology leads tothe absurdity of much of the ‘installation’ stuff in galleriesthat baffles all but elitist insiders and, as Ballagh recounts, theclaim by loyalist killer Michael Stone that his attack on Stormontwas a piece of performance art. He argues that the bureaucracies mustset aside this ideology and make galleries more open and democratic .For these views and forhis artistic method and, among some I suspect, for his politics,Ballagh has been frowned upon by certain elites. One prominent figurein the Irish art world said of him with dripping condescension thathe is “not a real artist, he is a mere illustrator”. Typically,Ballagh responded with humour and defiance in a self-portrait wearinga t-shirt saying ‘Fuck the Begrudgers’. I cannot recommend thisbook highly enough. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27487  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe Liberal Party was in government in Britain and had introduced the Home Rule Bill with the support of the Irish nationalist MPs in Westminster. They had abolished the veto of the House of Lords and Home Rule was due to be implemented in . The Tories seized on the issue of Home Rule as the most effective weapon to bring down the Liberals. Leading members of the British landed aristocracy, capitalists and senior military figures jumped on the bandwagon and backed up Unionist leader Edward Carson with threats of civil warHome Rule was brought in.Amidst the political frenzy there were very few Protestants in Ulster who were prepared to oppose Carsonism. But there were some and among them was the Reverend J.B. Armour of Ballymoney, County Antrim. A minister of the Presbyterian Church, Armour stood out from most of his co-religionists in advocating self-government for Ireland. In , he opposed a resolution at the Presbyterian General Assembly condemning Gladstone’s second Home Rule Bill. He was also a strong critic of landlordism.In , he again opposed a resolution against Home Rule at the Presbyterian General Assembly.Calling for freedom of conscience for Protestants to support or oppose Home Rule, Armour slammed the intolerance of Carsonism when he told the assembly:“If you deny the right of private judgment and of free speech, how much do you have of Protestantism worth keeping  Nothing at all.”Armour organised a public meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney to support Home Rule and oppose Carsonism. Banners in the hall proclaimed “No provisional or provincial government for us” and “Ulster for Ireland and Ireland for us”.The resolution stated that the meeting of Protestants of Ballymoney and the protests in The Route“against the claim of Sir Edward Carson and the self-constituted Provisional Government of Ulster to represent the Protestant community of north-east Ulster” and “disputes the narrow claim that dferences of creed necessarily separate Irishmen and women into hostile camps”. Among the speakers at the Ballymoney meeting were JB Armour himself, historian Alice Stopford Green, Jack White, son of a British Army general and later a leading figure in the Irish Citizen Army, and Roger Casement, who was executed in . This was Casement’s first appearance on a political . With his Antrim family background, Casement regarded the occasion as hugely signicant and in his speech he denounced any notion of partitioning Ireland. The meeting was a once-off and failed to turn the tide of Carsonism but it did show that a signicant minority of Protestants in the North-East were still prepared to stand up for Irish unity and self-government. The meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney in support of Irish self-government was held on  October ,  years ago this week. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27490  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.- Declan KearneyLast weekend the Irish Congress of Trades Unionsand Irish Labour History Society organised a conference to commemorate William Walker in Belfast.Walker was an anti-Home Rule unionist who was a leader in the Belfast Independent Labour Partyin the early twentieth century.When James Connolly, Irelands most signicant historical, socialist republican leader called on the ILPs membership to support socialist unity in Ireland, his appeal provoked a rebuke from Walker.This led to a robust debate between both figures in the pages of Forward between May and July .Their debate came to be known as the Connolly Walker controversy and later became an historical reference point for the anti-imperialist struggle in Ireland.I participated in a  alongside veteran trade unionist Joe Bowers, Ulster Unionist councillor Chris Mc Gimpsey, and ICTU Assistant General Secretary, Owen Reidy, to discuss the post Walker years and the current situation in the north.Not surprisingly we delivered four very dferent perspectives on Walker and his legacy as well as, Brexit the north strategy and politics on the Left and, future prospects.A very challenging but fraternal debate ensued between the lists and the audience.I opened my comments by saying that any consideration today of William Walker’s legacy needs to be within the historic and contemporary reality that the advancement of socialist and Labour politics has been held back due to the effects of British colonial policy in Ireland.He was a product of his native Belfast and directly influenced by the communal environment within which he grew up.He was a protestant in a largely protestant workforce. Sectarianism in the late s and early s stalked Belfast.While Walker was severely limited in his political analysis he was committed to improving the conditions of his fellow workers.He is an integral part of Belfast’s industrial history and his contribution to the city’s labour heritage deserves recognition.British policy in Ireland and its consequences for Irish society has ided Irish workers along communal lines. It has paralysed the labour movement from effectively challenging partition and championing the strategic aim of Irish unity.Partition is the central fault line at the heart of Irish society and politics.Sectarianism remains a visceral blight in this state.Following partition, it was used by the ruling unionist elite to cement the foundation of the state and prevent unity among citizens on issues of common concern.The fact is Labour was indeed told to wait as the resurgent struggle for national independence grew in momentum just over  years ago.The counter revolution which took place post partition represented a strategic setback for labour and working-class interests in the new free state.It eclipsed the seminal influence which socialist republicanism had on the  Proclamation and the Democratic Programme of the First Dáil.The rights of workers became subservient to the conservative elites, north and south.However, sections of the labour movement were compliant with British policy in Ireland and the imposition of partition.That was personied in the political thinking of Walker and others pre partition.This tendency opposed Connollys core position that \"the two currents of revolutionary thought in Ireland, the socialist and the national, were not antagonistic but complementary\".Walkers debate with Connolly reflected a key contradiction inherent in the Irish labour movement and its relationship with the Irish national liberation struggle, and anti-imperialism generally.That contradiction has existed ever since.Walkers brand of ‘Municipal Socialism’ was in reality a euphemism for self-imposed strategic and political limitations which went on to define the Trade Union movement in the north.As a result, the Irish labour movement, particularly in the north has failed to challenge partition and modern British political policy towards Ireland.Partition has been an abject failure. It was never designed to make the northern state a political or economic success.From the beginning this state has carried within it the conditions of inherent instability.It was built upon institutionalised and structural sectarianism which ensured that a substantial minority was destined never to be treated as equals.The Civil Rights Movement fty years ago exposed the inability of the unionist state to treat the minority as equals.That belligerent opposition from powerful sections within political unionism against reform of the northern state persists today in the form of political unionism, and specically DUP hostility towards implementation of the Good Friday Agreementsince .Refusal by the DUP to embrace a rights-based society and equality, culminated in the collapse of the GFA political institutions in January , and our associated political crisis which has continued since then. Those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power-sharing.The party brand is now indistinguishable from financial scandal and sharp practice in government.As a party, the DUP is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic reforms, social modernity, and standards in public office.Its project is negative and tactical, and entirely focused upon slowing down and blocking progressive change, while maintaining a sectarian hegemony within the unionist constituency.The DUP is in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarian, homophobic and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists and many others, including sections of civic unionism, have concluded that the DUP has had its chance and cannot now be trusted in government.They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power at the risk of allowing it to continue practicing discrimination, intimidation, bigotry, or sharp practice.The enduring political crisis is accentuated by systemic structural weaknesses in the regional economy.The required investment in local public services and protection of workers’ rights are confronted with a combination of Tory austerity and Brexit.Pressures on public services are intensying.The regional block grant, or public expenditure settlement, has been reduced by .%.Real term cuts to public funding are now factored into future budget profiles alongside ·         Actual net cuts in take home pay for public and private sector workers·         Welfare cuts and the universal social charge·         Higher inflation and living costs, adults in working families live in relative povertyAverage wages in the north remain lower than ten years ago.Precarious working conditions, zero hours’ contracts, and the scam of bogus self-employment used by some employers are in common practice.Workers’ rights and protections are being systematically reversed.The onset of Brexit will be a catastrophe for the regional and island economiesIt will deepen an existing race to the bottom by further undermining the potential for economic growth, and new investment.The Brexit agenda, twinned with Tory austerity threaten jobs across all economic sectors, workers’ terms and conditions, and, any potential for sustainable public services in the north.The dawning political and economic reality is that Brexit has changed everything.It has exposed the negative role that partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentally anti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.  The British state has been pushed into an unprecedented, existential political crisis.Brexit is a train wreck being jointly steered by the DUP and extremists in the British Tory party.But it also has become a defining moment for these islands.A new generation is questioning partition.There has been a seismic sht in the ambitions and expectations of citizens in the north.A new political discourse has begun about the future of Ireland north and south, and our relationships with Britain and EuropeThe debate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have moved centre stage.The time has come for a fundamental paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.The Irish government needs to begin preparing constitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish Unity.It should facilitate an open, inclusive national conversation involving all citizens, political parties, social partners, and civic society.That is a dialogue about our collective future on this island which addresses all the concerns, accommodations and compromises relevant to negotiating a new, all Ireland, constitutional, pluralist democracy.Today this new focus upon Irish unity provides Irish trade unionists and workers with an opportunity to influence the debate about future constitutional and political change.Previous moments of political change have required that labour should wait.The emerging challenge for the Irish labour movement north and south is to engage with this emerging discussion.To paraphrase Connolly in his opening contributions to the Connolly Walker debate\"Constitutional change then is almost a certainty of the future.”The labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.I said to the Belfast conference this reality will require Irish trade unionists to take strategic positions on supporting an Irish unity referendum and then to campaign positively for constitutional change.On Monday of this week I reiterated that opinion when I met Patricia King, General Secretary of ICTU in Dublin.Of course, this will be a challenging discussion for the Irish labour movement, as comrades noted both during and after the plenary discussion. But it should not be feared or avoided.Today in modern Ireland there is a battle for hearts and minds about how society is organisedThe status quo has failed us all.Connolly’s vision of a united Ireland which serves the interests of the many instead of the few will not be wished into existence.Labour should not wait again.The Irish labour movement needs to assert itself on the Irish unity debate by introducing a progressive labour agenda to the unfolding discourse on future constitutional and political change.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27491  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe writer, newspaper editor and Irish republican Seumas O’Kelly was a native of Loughrea, County Galway. Author of short stories, plays, poems and a novel, The Weaver’s Grave which was his masterpiece, O’Kelly’s le was cut short because of his commitment to Irish freedom. The O’Kelly family of Loughrea were flour millers and merchants and Seumas received a good education. He was a fellow student of James Joyce in University College Dublin. There is a remarkable photograph of the BA degree class of  including Joyce, O’Kelly and George Clancy. Like O’Kelly, George Clancy, a close friend of Joyce, was to die a tragic death. He was Sinn Féin Mayor of Limerick when on  March  he was murdered in his home by the Black and Tans, on the same night as former Mayor Michael O’Callaghan. Seumas O’Kelly was a committed republican from an early age. He is recorded as one of those to the fore in the centenary commemorations of the  Rising in . He was writing for Arthur Grfith’s Irish Republican Brotherhood-funded newspaper The United Irishman from  and for its successor Sinn Féin from . While a full list of attendees is not available it is probable that he was at the founding meeting of Sinn Féin in November . In  O’Kelly was appointed editor of the Leinster Leader in Naas, County Kildare. He founded a branch of Conradh na Gaeilge in the town and was active in Sinn Féin locally. He welcomed republicans to his home during the annual Wolfe Tone commemorations in nearby Bodenstown. O’Kelly’s first book of stories was published in  and his first play was produced the following year. Several of his plays were produced at the Abbey Theatre. Constantly busy with literary and journalistic work, O’Kelly was subject to poor health. He joined Óglaigh na hÉireann when they were founded in  but was unable to play an active military role. His brother was a Volunteer and was jailed in England after the  Rising. The paper Nationality, edited by Grfith, was established in  and O’Kelly was one of its writers. It was the main organ of Sinn Féin during the  and  by-elections. In May  Grfith was arrested and jailed in England and O’Kelly took over as editor of Nationality. Following the  November  Armistice which ended the First World War, British soldiers and loyalists ran riot through the streets of Dublin, attacking suspected Sinn Féin supporters. On the night of  November a crowd of drunken soldiers invaded the Sinn Féin Ard Oig at  Harcourt Street . Seumas O’Kelly was at his desk in the Nationality office and tried to defend himself with his walking stick. The office was wrecked and O’Kelly collapsed. He was brought to Jervis Street Hospital where he died of a brain haemorrhage. Seumas O’Kelly was honoured with a republican funeral to Glasnevin Cemetery, attended by huge crowds. He died on  November ,  years ago this week.  test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27492  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaAt the start of the th century women began to campaign actively against the denial of their right to vote. In  the Women’s Social and Political Union was founded in England and the militant feminists commenced the battle for the vote. In Ireland there had been groups working for women’s suffrage but the campaign really began here on the instigation of Hanna Sheehy Skeffington and Margaret Cousins. Margaret Cousins came from a unionist family in Dublin but she later wrote: “I belonged in my heart from the beginning to the fighters for freedom.” Her husband James Cousins also rejected the unionism of his background and became involved in the Gaelic revival. Margaret came into contact with the women’s movement in England in . On herto Ireland she co-operated with a remarkable young woman who was to make her mark on Irish history. Hanna Sheehy was the daughter of a Fenian, David Sheehy, who took part in the  Rising and was elected as a Parnellite MP in . Hanna was an exceptional student and excelled academically despite the restrictions on women’s access to education she achieved a first class honours MA in . She became a teacher and married Francis Skeffington. In line with their shared feminist principles they adopted each other’s surnames. Francis resigned his post as registrar of University College because the authorities refused to register women on the same basis as men. In  Hanna and Margaret founded the Irish Women’s Franchise League , with the active support of both Francis Sheehy Skeffington and James Cousins. From the beginning they stressed that the IWFL would address the specic needs of Irish women in “a subject country seeking freedom from England” and would “work on independent Irish lines”. Margaret Cousins described the IWFL’s position: “Its policy was to educate by all forms of propaganda the men, women and children of Ireland to understand and support the members of the League in their demand for votes for women, and to obtain pledges from every Irish Member of Parliament to vote for Women’s Suffrage Bills introduced in the British Houses of Parliament, and to include Women’s Suffrage in any Irish Home Rule Bill.” The IWFL campaigned throughout the country and made an impact beyond their numbers of about  activists. Not all militant women agreed with the IWFL’s tactics the republican group Inghinidhe na hÉireann refused to join in lobbying the British parliament, preferring to “organise a women’s movement on Sinn Féin lines, or on lines even broader still”. Despite this dference, republican women such as Constance Markievicz played an active role in the IWFL’s work and Hanna Sheehy Skeffington herself was strongly republican. Markievicz urged young Irishwomen to prepare to fight: “Arm yourselves with weapons to fight your nation’s cause. Arm your souls with noble and free ideas. Arm your minds with the histories and memories of your country and her martyrs, her language, and a knowledge of her arts and industries. Andin your day the call should come for your body to arm, do not shirk from that either.” Markievicz said Irishwomen were “doubly enslaved with a double battle to fight”. Following the  general election the Irish Party at Westminster was in a position to press the Liberal government to publish a Home Rule Bill. But Redmond and his party still refused to support women’s right to vote. The IWFL became more militant and Hanna and Francis founded the Irish Citizen newspaper to further the cause of women’s rights as well as Irish independence, social justice and pacism. When British politicians visited Ireland they were challenged by the IWFL. Margaret ‘Meg’ Connery confronted British Tory leader Andrew Bonar Law and Unionist leader Edward Carson when they came to Dublin. In Belfast Hanna Sheehy Skeffington challenged Winston Churchill. Margaret Cousins joined protests in England in  and was jailed for a month. In June  eight women from the IWFL smashed windows in Dublin Castle and other prominent buildings. Hanna was arrested at the Castle and she and the seven others were imprisoned in Mountjoy. The following month British Prime Minister Asquith visited Dublin and there were more protests. Three English feminists had followed Asquith to Ireland and they were also jailed for their protests. After a hunger strike in Mountjoy by the English suffragists and the IWFL women, all were released except two of the Englishwomen who were subjected to forced feeding. Many meetings of the IWFL were physically attacked at this time by Redmondites who saw the campaign for women’s suffrage as a threat to their political dominance and their relationship with the British Liberal government. In contrast, republicans such as Pádraig Mac Piarais and Thomas MacDonagh were supporters of the IWFL. The IWFL also won the support of prominent trade unionists James Larkin and James Connolly. They were closely allied with the Irish Women Workers Union in Liberty Hall and in  Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed after a confrontation with the Dublin politan Police during the Great Lockout. She was released after a six-day hunger strike. That year also saw the death in England of feminist Emily Davison who ran on to the course at the Epsom Derby and was trampled by a race horse. Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed again in  for campaigning against recruitment to the British Army. Her influence and that of the IWFL was seen in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic of  which enshrined women’s right to vote. Her friend James Connolly told her: “You will be glad to know that in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic we are including equal citizenship for women.” Hanna replied that she knew who was responsible, meaning Connolly himself. “We were practically unanimous, Only one questioned it,” replied Connolly. Francis Sheehy Skeffington was murdered in Portobello Barracks by a British Army officer during the Easter Rising. Hanna embarked on a tour of the United States to expose the truth about the murder and other British atrocities. She continued to play a leading role in the struggle for Irish freedom, as did many of the pioneering feminists of the IWFL. In  the IWFL saw its central aim achieved when women voted for the first time in the general election which resulted in a massive Sinn Féin victory, although women under  were still excluded. The IWFL actively opposed British rule and supported Dáil Éireann. For example in August  Hanna was badly beaten by the RIC who attacked a Sinn Féin meeting at which she spoke in Kilbeggan, Co.

They must not be allowed to destroy the democratic option formaking change in the north.It is these circumstances which bring sharply into focus theIrish governments responsibilities.Those who courageously signed this letter to the Irish government are saying the negative position of the DUP and British governmentmust not be tolerated.These are citizens who want the political institutionsre-established but only on the basis of democracy and equality.They are assertive in their resolve to see a rights basedsociety created, which guarantees rights, respect, and parity of esteem, in ashared, inclusive future.But they are not prepared to be treated as second-classcitizens in this part of Ireland.Those days are over.It is time for the Irish Government to indeed redouble itsefforts to step up to the mark by absolutely opposing the imposition ofBrexit, and guaranteeing equality and rights for all citizens in the north.An Taoiseach and the Irish Government needs to reflect verycarefully about the signicance and timing of this intervention, respondpositively and act decisively, in cooperation with the politicalrepresentatives of Irish citizens, and others in the north, to ensure thattheir democratic rights are delivered upon.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27494  ","story":"• th NOVEMBER  - Newly elected Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams Mícheál Mac DonnchaTHE Ard Fheis of  marked a signicant stage in the political development of Sinn Féin. The historic gathering came in the wake of the campaign in support of the H-Block and Armagh prisoners, the epic Hunger Strikes, the intervention of prisoner candidates, North and South, in  and Sinn Féin’s electoral rise in the Six Counties in  and .The party’s performance in the October  Assembly elections – when five republicans were elected to the body set up by British direct ruler Jim Prior – caused alarm to the SDLP and their supporters in the Establishment parties in the  Counties. Sinn Féin’s lead in boycotting the Assembly was followed by the SDLP for fear of losing further support to republicans. The Fine Gael Labour Government, led by Garret FitzGerald, set up the New Ireland Forum in Dublin mainly as a  for the SDLP. In June , the political establishment in Ireland and Britain was rocked by the election of Sinn Féin Vice-President Gerry Adams as MP for his native west Belfast. For long a leading republican activist, Adams advocated the deeper politicisation and popularisation of the republican struggle and the building of Sinn Féin across the  Counties.The British Tory government of Margaret Thatcher was also concerned at the rise of Sinn Féin. In the week before the Ard Fheis in November , Prior told Tory MPs that Ireland could become a “Cuba off Britain’s west coast”. He said he feared Sinn Féin could overtake the SDLP electorally and “we must do all we can to strengthen constitutional nationalism”. When the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis gathered in the Mansion House in Dublin on  and  November, it was set to elect a new leadership. Ruairí Ó Brádaigh had been president since  and he announced that he would not be seeking re-election. He said the four-province federal Ireland plan, of which he had been a strong advocate, had been rejected at the  Ard Fheis and his approach on other issues, including electoral strategy, had been rejected by the Ard Chomhairle.In his address, the new party president, Gerry Adams, dismissed media claims of a ‘Northern takeover’ and said:“We are not a Northern, nor a Southern party – we are an Irish republican party organised throughout Ireland.”The main theme of his speech was the need for republicans to break out of political isolation and “get among the people in the basic ways which the people accept”. In line with this approach, the Ard Fheis voted to contest European Parliament elections with the intention of taking seatsthey were won. This followed the expansion of party electoral strategy the previous year. The Ard Fheis coincided with a by-election campaign for the Dáil seat of Dublin Central, which was contested by Sinn Féin candidate Christy Burke, turning in a creditable performance. There was further controversy after the Ard Fheis, and discomfort for Fianna Fáil leaders in particular, when Gerry Adams was confirmed as the main speaker at the annual Kilmichael commemoration in west Cork. Gerry Adams was elected president of Sinn Féin at the Ard Fheis of November ,  years ago.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27495  ","story":" Robbie SmythOver the last  years Irishsociety has evolved and transformed in many ways.

Ireland north or south was never a concern yet we will all pay the cost for generations to come.Brexit represents a huge threat to the social, economic and political le of this island. The outworking of Brexit could be the imposition of hard border.That is why the people of the north - from all communities and backgrounds - voted to reject it.They knew it would devastate the economy, strip away rights and undermine our political agreements.And that is why, in the immediate aftermath of the referendum result, Sinn Féin embarked on a diplomatic offensive across Europe warning of the dangers of Brexit and putting forward our demand for a unique solution for the north which would respect the majority remain vote.Through intense lobbying in Brussels, Strasbourg, Dublin and London, Sinn Féin led and built support for the idea that our unique position and peace agreements required a unique Brexit solution.Our case for special status for the north within the EU sought to ensure there would be no hard border, that citizens rights would be upheld and the Good Friday Agreement protected in all its parts.As the prospect of a no deal Brexit became more likely, we made it clear the north needed to remain in the customs union and single market in order to prevent our economy being driven off a clf by the Tories and their DUP allies.That was reflected in the backstop which was agreed by the EU and the British government. But as soon as it was agreed the British government, as they always do, began trying to renege on its commitments.Our position remains now as it was then. That backstop must be maintained and protected. It provides the bottom line and is our insurance policy against the worst excesses of Brexit, which we know will be a disaster for this country.The backstop is not perfect and neither is the withdrawal agreement. There is no such thing as a good Brexit after all.There are still issues of concern and clarication required, particularly relating to the issues of rights and representation.Over the course of the last number of days Sinn Féin has met with An Taoiseach and An Tanáiste and have been in contact with Theresa May about all of these concerns.The pro-remain parties represent the majority of people in the north and are fighting on their behalf.By contrast, the DUP are actively trampling the best interests of people and business in the north in their reckless cheerleading for an as yet  Tory Brexit.Sinn Féin will continue to stand with all other parties who advocate for citizens’ rights, our economic interests and our agreements in the face of Brexit.  We will continue to put pressure on the Irish government to act in the interests of citizens, north and south and hold the Taoiseach to his pledge that the people of the north will never again be left behind by an Irish Government.Whatever twists and turns the Brexit debacle takes next, the backstop as agreed must be maintained. It cannot be sacriced in an attempt to save the ailing career of Theresa May or to serve the hard-line agendas of the Brexiteers in the Tory party or the DUP. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27499  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonGUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers# rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.- Declan Kearney MLADimitrios Papadimoulis is a Greek MEP who represents the Syriza party in the European Parliament.He has spent a le time involved in left wing political activism in his native Greece and has been a member of the Syriza central leadership which brought the party from opposition into government in , while the country was still in the midst of its financial and economic crisis and subjected to extreme political and economic pressure by the European Unionestablishment.Dimitrios is ‘laconic and philosophical in the way of Sparta’ – to borrow a phrase he used during a contribution at a recent conference which we attended together in Brussels, organised by GUE-NGL the European Parliamentary group to which both Sinn Féin and Syriza are affiliated.This meeting brought together leadership representatives and MEPs from twenty of the most signicant political parties on the progressive Left in the EU to discuss the future direction of GUE-NGL and future political strategy and co-operation among left wing and progressive parties including the  European elections, and the next term of the EU parliament.During one of our conversations at the conference Dimitrios recalled a story from - years previously, when he was travelling to deliver a speech.Dimitrios told his taxi driver what he was planning to say at the meeting.The taxi man replied:“Remember, you are a politician, not a prophet. Do not promise me things it will take  years to achieve. Make change for me tomorrow.”Dimitrios immediately decided to change his speech. He learned a lesson that day from the taxi driver which has stayed with him ever since.Theories or notions, and even visions for changeremain just that unless they can translate into concrete change in society.People want change which makes a material dference in their lives for them and their families.And thats how it should be.Fair wages high quality education and health services free at the point of delivery and a clean sustainable environment should not be dreams. They need to become realities.So political activists who are committed to transformational change need to be grounded in the real world.They have to understand what they can deliver in the here and now, and then to have a plan to achieve even more.But the progressive Left can only make change when it has the strength to do so.That means setting realistic objectives and priorities, and then devising strategies which work.I said in my opening comments to the conference that Europe is at a crossroads.The political direction, policy orientation, and increasing need for reform of the EU coupled with, and often fuelling the rise of the extreme right wing, now presents an existential threat to the principles of the progressive Left.Social democracy has effectively collapsed both politically and electorally across Europe.There is a need to build a progressive Left alternative, and to popularise a new political narrative or common sense based upon core ideas: To include:·         That economies serve the many and not the few:·         That human and democratic rights are inalienable:·         That the global environment is protected:·         That Europe should act as a force for international peace and solidarity: and·         That racism, sectarianism, misogyny, homophobia and xenophobia are opposed.These ideas should be a common  for expanding the political strength of the progressive Left.However, that potential faces many challenges.Some of these are beyond the control of the progressive Left, but others are not.All of this was under discussion at the GUE-NGL conference.There were many notable contributions.Arnaldo Otegi, the General Secretary of the EH Bildu was in attendance.He had just received the ground breaking judgement from the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled his prosecution was wrong.During Arnaldos presentation he provided a powerful critique of global capitalism and the importance of defending community and social values.Panos Skourletis has been a senior minister of the Syriza government.In a highly signicant move several months ago, he moved from that role to take up the position of Secretary of Syrizas Central Committee.Panos set out an analysis of the situation in Greece and wider Europe and argued that it is time for a common front of left parties and other progressives and democratic forces in Europe.Earlier I argued that unity and cohesion are essential between parties and democratic forces on the left in Europe: and that we must focus on what expands unity, whilst respecting our dferences and uniqueness as parties and national movements.Sinn Féin believes that GUE-NGL has successfully enabled progressive parties from the left to co-operate within the European Parliament, whilst recognising the autonomy of political delegations.This is one of GUE-NGL’s strengths as a parliamentary group and deserves to be consolidated.Unanimity is not required on all issues, all of the time but progressives cannot afford to be disunited.Political sectarianism undermines political strength, solidarity and fraternity on the progressive Left.The collective strength of the progressive Left in Europe stems from the domestic relevance and political strength of its constituent parts.The left will only be as strong in the European Parliament as progressive Left and republican parties are relevant and strong in their national contexts.The success of a real progressive Left alternative,  depends upon securing strategic beach heads of political strength and influence.This is why support for Europes only left wing government in Greece is so politically important.Whilst progressives need to be in a hurry to make change and in pursuit of a social and more democratic Europe, we also need to be realistic and pragmatic.The distinction between strategy and tactical positions need to be understood.Alliances with others are indispensable to the process of changing the overall balance of forces.Rigid or dogmatic ideological positions can prevent agreement upon shared objectives and securing unity among the widest cross section of progressive and democratic opinion.The political discussion and focus upon an emergent European Progressive Caucus embracing the Left, social democrats, and environmentalists is such an innovative and welcome initiative.I proposed to the Brussels conference that a strategic consensus among the progressive Left and others should be based upon support for national independence, social emancipation, citizens rights, and democratic control over the economy.For our part Sinn Féin will contest the European election in  on an agenda which advocates for the creation of a Social Europe.We will be emphasising the need to protect rural and fishing communities the promotion of economic democracy enhanced environmental policy, human rights and social justice as well as defence of the Irish peace process and support for a united Ireland.The onset of Brexit has changed the political and social landscape in Ireland, and also signicantly influenced political discourse within the EU itself.It has swept away all of the established constitutional, political and economic assumptions about the status quo in Ireland and refocused international attention upon the democratic case for Irish unity.During the conference I highlighted the denial of citizens rights and blocking of political democracy in the north of Ireland by the DUP and British Tory government. The point was made that this existential rights crisis, combined with the imposition of Brexit represented the most serious threat to the Good Friday Agreement, and the democratic option for managing change in the north of Ireland.The European Parliament  EU institutions have become strategically important forums within which to promote the democratic aim of a united Ireland and to encourage support for an Irish unity referendum. The level of interest in, and support for constitutional change in Ireland is now at an unprecedented high level across the EU.Sinn Féin will continue lobbying to make the case for a united Ireland a priority for the progressive Left and within other sections of democratic opinion represented in the European Parliament. Irish unity is integral to the vision of a new Europe.Going forward, the progressive Left in Europe needs to focus its collective efforts upon maximising representation and influence in the next parliament.GUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.That is what the shared ambition of a New Europe should mean. Sinn Féin has a central role in promoting that vision.The progressive Left across Europe has much to do.We need to be people in a hurry.The future cannot wait.We need to plan, organise and attract the popular support to make change for all tomorrow: To build a New Europe - a Europe of Equals. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27501  ","story":" Oisín Mac Canna“We already have all-island teams that demonstrate that we can achieve great success when we work on an all-island basis.

After an introduction to the abattoir, the group was given a comprehensive tour of the kill floor and lairage.In the chill area, the group members had the opportunity to see dferent grades of lambs coming through the plant that day. Gary outlined what the ideal lamb is for Linden Foods to allow them to process for their customers’ needs, with discussion on how farmers can market lambs that meet this specication. The group was joined by William Chesneywho explained the grading system and what the grader is looking for when assessing each carcase as the lambs were weighed and graded at the scale, prior to entering the chill.William and Gary both reinforced the importance of weighing and handling lambs regularly to assess their market readiness. In particular, they emphasised the importance of not allowing lambs to becoming overfat. This not only restricts the potential market outlets, but is uneconomical for the farmer.The farmers were guided through the slaughter area where each stage of the slaughter process was explained. The visit finished with a walk through live lamb reception area where Gary was able to demonstrate the type of live lambs that produce the carcases Linden require for their customers. There was good discussion on the use of electronic identicationand especially feedback to the members on inidual lambs. Members stressed that, where they had invested in electronic readers and on farm software packages using EID to become more efficient, they were not receiving enough feedback information from the abattoir. Gary agreed that more information on inidual animals would be of benefit to the farmers. Linden Foods have invested in the hardware and software to allow inidual animal feedback to farmers linked to tag numbers and are keen to develop put this service in place for suppliers.The group members were impressed by the skill or the operators on the slaughter and processing lines and the efficiency of the overall processing system. The high level of animal welfare standards demonstrated was impressive in such a busy but efficient working environment.

Playing over  characters between them, Jo and Marty are still being stopped by fans eager to catch another viewing of the production such was its success during a run at the Roddy’s in August.“We wanted to bring the play back as we have such a successful relationship with the Balmoral Hotel, especially in the run-up to Christmas,” explained Brassneck Director Tony Devlin. “This will be the fourth production we have brought to the hotel. There has been huge demand for aof the show, as a lot of people didn’t get a chance to catch it first time around. We thought it was the next natural step to bring it to the Balmoral.”Jo spoke of how from the first night the play was staged “we soon realised very quickly that this was something special.”“The audience response was incredible after opening night,” she said. “People are still stopping us saying ‘When are you coming back, when are you coming back ’”“I think it’s a perfect way to finish the year especially after all the celebrations for Féile,” explained Marty. “One of the loveliest things was the audience reaction we got when we travelled to Coalisland. The audience there, who might not have been all that familiar with the beginnings of Féile, gave us a standing ovation, they were bowled over by the Féile story. To have a Christmas slant on it is just the icing on the cake. The performances in December will be a chance to raise a glass and tip the hat to all the people who created the festival combined with the celebration of Christmas,” he said.“The play starts with our two protagonists waiting to get into heaven, it will be a nice Christmas gt to find outFra or Bridie get into heaven or end up in limbo in Larne,” he laughed. A Christmas Station Once Again will be performed at the Balmoral Hotel from December  to  at pm. Tickets are priced at £ and are available from the hotel or by telephoning  .

I am not doing the work here for the students to recognise me in that way, I teach because I love it but it was such a great boost. I came into the classroom so happy and delighted to share the news with the class,” she said.Alanah spoke of the importance of young teachers making their mark in the city especially with so many who are choosing to go across the water or travel further afield.“Loads of my friends have left and gone to Liverpool, places like Qatar. I’m very much a home bird, I love being here, teaching here but I ask myself the question what does going across to Liverpool to teach have that we don’t have here at home  How are we supposed to make young lives betterwe leave and take our skills where “There is a young teaching staff in the Religion department here and our big focus is very much on ethics, making the subject more relevant to the pupils’ lives, how do you live out your faith through action  The girls I teach are so kind, there is a real kindness about our pupils, they would offer you the food from their lunch boxes, they are just so, so caring. At the minute our ‘Mini Marillacs’ named after St Louise, are collecting for the homeless and I would put a big emphasis on helping those less fortunate and the girls would bring in hats, gloves, scarfs, toiletries which are then brought to the Legion of Mary for distribution.”“Our sixth years go up to St John’s residential home every Tuesday to make cups of tea, bring buns and biscuits for the elderly. I can see them from my window and it just makes me smile knowing they are going up and more importantly want to go up, you don’t have to police them,” she said.Alanah spoke warmly of the “community spirit” in St Louise’s and how “everybody knows everybody” as school le presents “always something new”.“This is a huge school but you know everyone in it. It’s like a wee family. There isn’t a day I don’t laugh in this school,” she said."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"renowned west belfast artist to set out stall at culturlann","story":"PROLIFIC West Belfast painter and illustrator Tony Bell is set to unveil a personal retrospective exhibition entitled ‘Special People Special Places’ at the Cultúrlann on Thursday November .

These pressures have left many of our members on the verge of quitting their jobs. This is an intolerable situation for the NASUWT, we are committed to defending the rights of our members in this school and hope that a constructive engagement can begin soon with the employers to fully address the situation.”A spokesperson for the CCMS, which oversees St Patrick#s said: “CCMS fully appreciates the right of teachers to take industrial action. However, we do not believe that in this instance such action is either proportionate or warranted. It is our firm belief that the issues at the heart of this dispute can best be dealt with through an open and honest dialogue which seeks to provide balance to the concerns of both sides.“CCMS echoes the Board of Governors in its call for a suspension to the proposed industrial action in order to create the time and space for meaningful and respectful dialogue aimed at resolving the issues of concern and dispute.”"},{"url":null,"title":"threequarters of belfast telegraph readers reject mays draft deal in snap poll","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The best way to ensure the backstop is not used is to get the future relationship into place.\"Ed Curran: Who speaks for Northern Ireland on Brexit - Business bosses or the DUP Tory former Northern Ireland secretary Theresa Villiers warned the EU would be \"unlikely to agree\" a future trading agreement with the UK as the backstop in the withdrawal agreement offered more favourable terms.The Brexiteer said: \"There are clearly parts of this document which are positive and which I welcome, my grave worry with it is that itll never come into effect anyway because the EU is unlikely to agree a new economic partnership with us because the withdrawal agreement locks us in to paying the £ billion and also commits us to a backstop which has us obeying their rules and applying their customs rules without any say over them.\"Three-quarters of Belfastreaders reject Mays draft deal in snap pollAnd former Brexit secretary Dominic Raab said Mrs Mays backstop would do the opposite of the will of the people by giving control away.He told the Commons: \"The backstop ties the UK to the customs union and single market rules with no voice and an EU veto over our exit whilst paragraph  of the political declaration makes that the starting point for future relations to build on.\"The top reason people voted to leave the EU was to take back control over our laws.

mum says she intends to raise more awareness of an advanced treatment for a rare spinal condition in that hope that it will be made available to children in the North.Donna Ferris’ three year-old son Charlie was diagnosed with progressive infantile idiopathic scoliosis when he was just six months old.If left untreated, the spinal deformity can lead to severe twisting of the spine, respiratory problems and even decreased le expectancy.When little Charlie was first diagnosed back in February , doctors in Belfast told his anxious parents Donna and Jodie that their only option was to put their son in a plaster jacket to hold in the curve in his spine until he was old enough for surgery.However, determined Donna vowed to do everything in her power to keep her baby son away from the operating table and invasive surgery.After hours of online research, the mum-of-four found a hospital in the United States which offers specialised scoliosis treatment.Donna discovered that Shriners Hospital in Philadelphia offered advanced treatment which could potentially avoid surgery.She said: “When I was researching I checked for hospitals in the east coast of America as I knew it would be easier to fly into there from Ireland.  I came across Shriners Hospital and made contact straight away askingthey accepted international patients.  They said they did and sent me some forms which I filled in.  Within four days of applying to the hospital for the treatment Charlie was accepted, and within a month he was at the hospital.”On April , , Donna, Jodie and their four kids made the trip to Philadelphia for Charlie’s first appointment.Just a few days later, Charlie was fitted with a Mehta cast which was specially designed to correct the curve in his spine.Over the last  months, Charlie has made the same journey  times.Before having his first cast fitted, the curvature in Charlie’s spine was at a -degree angle.Earlier this month, during their th trip to Shriners Hospital, the Ferris family received the news they had been hoping for.“They took Charlie’s brace off  hours after arriving at the hospital and sent him for x-rays.  After this the doctors brought us in and gave us the great news that Charlie’s spine is now down to six degrees,” said Donna.“I just burst into tears crying.  I just couldn’t believe it.  The staff at the hospital were also crying and hugging us.  They were just so, so happy.  They are always willing the children on there.  It was just amazing news to get.”Donna said before starting his treatment in the US, Charlie was a ‘very restless baby’ and she ‘really struggled to get food into him’.Now, she says her son is a completely dferent person.“The boy we have now is just perfect.  He is meeting all his milestones and is doing everything a wee child of his age should be doing and he will go on to lead a healthy le,” she said.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“Charlie knows that he’s dferent and he has to wear a brace that not everyone  does but he’s adapted to it all from the get-go, he’s just brilliant.“The plan now is that Charlie will remain in brace until June next year and then he will switch to a night time brace for six months at least.  Hopefully he will not have to wear a brace at all eventually.”Following Charlie’s diagnosis and the news that he would have to travel to America for the specialised treatment, the Ballinderry and wider community set about fundraising for the family to help fund their travel, something which the Ferris family are ever grateful for.Donna also has nothing but praise for Shriners Hospital.“Words cannot describe how grateful we are to the hospital for what they have done for us,” she said.“When we first took him to the hospital we knew Charlie was going to be in expert hands as they specialise in infantile scoliosis.“We are so, so grateful to them and it’s very hard to put into words how good they all are.  They don’t just treat Charlie, they treat the whole family.  It’s the same people treating Charlie each and every time and he has become so familiar with them all.“Shriners is a non-profit hospital and they treat families regardless of their ability to pay.  All the time we have been there we have never received a bill from them.  To go half way across the world to another hospital and not be billed is just amazing.”Charlie’s journey over the last  months has been well documented by Donna on a Facebook page named ‘Charlie’s Journey with Infantile Scoliosis’.Through the page, other parents in similar situations have reached out to Donna who has offered them support and advice.  She has also given them ‘hope of what can be achieved’.On November , Donna attended the Families First awards ceremony in Sligo Park Hotel where she was presented with an ‘Inspirational Person’ award – an accolade which she had been nominated for by a parent from Co Cavan.“I spoke to the audience and told them our story and I received a standing ovation afterwards.  I was just overwhelmed by how many people I have touched out there.  It was the perfect end to the perfect week.”Donna now hopes that by speaking out about Charlie’s treatment that it will give other children hope.“The treatment that Charlie received at Shriners Hospital has been available at Great Ormond Street Hospital since July this year however I really want it to become available across the UK and Ireland.“Charlie is living proof of what can be achieved by this gentle, non-invasive treatment so why not offer it to babies here and give them a chance.“I want to be able to help other children in our own country and want parents not to have to feel the need to travel abroad for adequate care.  I would just love to see this treatment available here so there is hope for other families.”To follow Charlie’s progress visit ‘Charlie’s Journey with Infantile Scoliosis’ on Facebook."},{"url":null,"title":"people derry urged think twice visiting emergency department winter

extreme pressure placed on the department last winter due to the outbreak of the norovirus, and also urged people to take advice from their GPs on their condition before attending the AE.However, she also stressed thatpeople do feel that they must attend the unit, then they should not ‘take any chances’.“Go to your GP and take the advice,” Mrs McKay said.“If you need to the be there , then you

I hope new hotel investment, which would provide the local economy with a signicant boost, can be realised, he added.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokesman confirmed that the council undertook a study to review hotel provision across the district and identied additional need specically within the Newcastle area.ldquoThe council has carried out an initial feasibility study on the Newcastle Centre site which identied that a hotel could be built on the site. General discussions have subsequently taken place with a number of potential developers about hotel provision in the Newcastle area,rsquorsquo he continued.ldquoThe council is also currently working with a consultant on the feasibility study for leisure provision in the Newcastle area and it is anticipated that a report will be presented to the Active and Healthy Communities Committee in the coming months..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Castlewellan wildlife activist recognised by Prime Minster  ","story":"A CASTLEWELLAN teenager has been recognised by Prime Minister Theresa May for urging young people to protect the environment.Fourteen year-old Dara McAnulty is one of the latest recipients of the the Points of Light award, which recognises outstanding volunteers who are making a change in their community and inspiring others.He was presented with his award at an event held at Kew Gardens in London last week.Mrs May wrote to Dara congratulating him on his achievement.ldquoThrough your award-winning blog, you are encouraging young people to support their local environment and learn about the importance of conservation, she said.ldquoYour writing is raising awareness of how nature can help people cope with autism and you should feel proud of this remarkable achievement.Dara has been a driving force behind the Grassroots Challenge run by Ulster Wildle.In his blog he encourages other people his age to make videos of the out-doors and at the same time participate in conservation.Dara, who is autistic, says he is inspired by the beauty of the Mourne countryside on his doorstep and that developing a connection with nature helps him manage his anxiety.This in turn helped him to open the door for other people his age to become conservation enthusiasts too.Dara said: ldquoI am honoured to receive the Points of Light award. I sincerely hope that it shines a light on how vital nature is to us all, our mental health, our wellbeing and the survival of all le.ldquoWe need more young voices to speak up and take action for nature though. I will continue my work and hope that many more will follow.Dara recently worked with Springwatch presenter Chris Packham on The Peoplersquos Walk for Wildlecampaign.He spoke to , people at Hyde Park about conservation and also completed a -mile walk that raised over pound, to tag and record threatened birds of prey.He is soon to publish a book called lsquoDiary of a Young Naturalistrsquo based on his blog, which won runner-up in the BBC Wildle Magazine Blogger Awards.Charlotte Hill, CEO of Step Up To Serve, which coordinates the #iwill campaign, said: ldquoWe know that young people have the energy, ideas and drive to address issues in their community and to tackle many of societyrsquos tougher challenges.ldquoWe are so pleased to see the Prime Minister recognising the astounding achievements that Dara has made through his volunteering, fundraising and campaigning, and hope this inspires Dara and other young people to continue their fantastic work..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Class act Connolly secures final spot  ","story":"RYAN Connolly was the hero of the hour as Olympic claimed their spot in the Bobby Dalzell Cup final and also claimed the bragging rights in Ballynahinch.Connolly made two saves in the penalty shoot-out and then converted the decisive spot kick at the end of a largely forgettable semi-final at Bignian Park on Friday night.Olympic will face either Killough or Celtic Bhoys, who meet this Friday night in the second semi-final at the same venue, in the Newcastle Leaguersquos Boxing Day showpiece at Drumaness.There was little to cheer the good-sized crowd who braved the Mourne chill well into the night.One hundred and ten minutes of football produced barely a handful of chances, which meant that all the excitement was reserved for the spot kick shoot-out.Connolly had little to do over normal and extra time, but he produced the goods when it mattered and was mobbed by his delighted team-mates after putting his spot kick past Raymond Tate in the YM goal.However, Olympic know they will have up their gamethey are to pose a threat to either Killough or Celtic Bhoys in the final.Neither they nor YM could be faulted for effort. The players ran their socks off and there was plenty of commitment. The tackling was hard, but fair, and it was a credit to the spirit in which the tie was played that not a single player was yellow-carded.The first half chance of the match fell to nippy YM striker Aaron Cheevers, who was almost through on goal, but was thwarted when Connolly came quickly off his line to save.Jack Roddy then headed narrowly over for Olympic and not long afterwards Olympic were awarded a free kick outside the box following Richard Annettrsquos challenge on Shane Rodgers. Unfortunately, Darryl Russell shot tamely against the wall.The best chance of the half fell to Olympic just after the half hour. Following a corner Gary Wilsonrsquos shot was cleared off the line and Roddy blazed over the bar.Cheevers was always a threat up front for the YM. On  minutes he was clean through, but again Connolly came out to thwart the danger. On  minutes he came within inches of putting his head on a cross by the impressive Wilson and just before the break his flicked header were narrowly wide.Ten minutes into the second half Olympicrsquos Simon Marmion found Joshua Fennell with a long pass, only for Fennell to shoot over from outside the penalty area on the right side.Four minutes later Damian Travers found himself with space in the box, but his left-footed shot was easilysaved by Connolly.On  minutes YMrsquos Sam Annett let fly, but his shot took a deflection off an Olympic defender for a corner.Both sides made a number of changes to break the deadlock and with five minutes to go YM substitute James Croskery shot low and hard, but straight at Connolly.The breakthrough nearly came moments later when Wilson delivered a dangerous free kick into the YM box, but Adam McDowell and Lee Maxwell couldnrsquot get a touch.In the first period of extra time, Rhys Patterson thought he had won it for Olympic, but Tate pulled off a great save.Just at the end of the second period Ronnie Johnston shot inches wide for YM after a good cross from the left by Adam McDowell.But the goals didnrsquot come and in the end it was all down to a penalty shoot-out. Olympic deserved to win, but it was cruel on the Young Men.Ballynahinch Olympic II: R Connolly, J Roddy, D Russell, N McGlew, M Rice, S Marmion, J Fennell, G Wilson, R Patterson, D Travers, S Rodgers.

It has also argued that the current application represents the ldquobest value for money.ldquoThe RNLI applies the highest standards and practices to all its applications for its facilities. The site chosen, from what was available, is the one that represents the best location and value for money for the Institution.That assertion is one that has been challenged by the LEYC who has said in its letter to members: ldquoWe also believe that the cost of the new site will be considerably more expensive overall with higher ongoing maintenance and cost and therefore a waste of donations.The LEYC also claim that the RNLI have changed their mind over the site of its proposed new station: ldquoWhen we originally discussed the proposed site with the RNLI they told us that they preferred to build as part of a bigger development as originally it was submitted as part of a bigger development plan. They later changed this to saying that the newer site would give them more visibility and potential footfall despite it being obvious that the original site was much more public facing.The LEYC also asserts that the original site it refers to would not require as much dredging as what is being proposed by the RNLI. In its letter however the LEYC stated that ldquowe are supporters of the RNLI and any objection we have is only to the proposed siting of the boathouse and should not be interpreted as any fallout with the local volunteers who we respect and support.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

setting out aspirations in areas like trade and security co-operation and believed to run to a few dozen pages - in order to press ahead with the legally-binding withdrawal agreement.In a tweet, Mr Tusk said: “I have just sent to EU a draft Political Declaration on the Future Relationship between EU and UK.“The Commission President has informed me that it has been agreed at negotiators’ level and agreed in principle at political level, subject to the endorsement of the Leaders.”Mrs May is to make a statement to the House of Commons on Thursday afternoon on the latest developments and was speaking to members of the Cabinet in a conference call ahead of that.There was speculation that the Prime Minister was struggling to keep her Brexit deal alive, after she announced following her meeting with Mr Juncker that she wouldto Brussels on Saturday for further talks.Mrs May said after the meeting that she and the Commission president had given “sufficient direction” to negotiators for work to begin “immediately” on resolving remaining issues.It is believed that negotiators worked through the night to produce Thursday morning’s breakthrough.The new text was dismissed by Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon as “lots of unicorns taking the place of facts about the future relationship”.“Fair play to the EU for pushing it as far as possible, but it adds up to a blindfold Brexit,” said Ms Sturgeon.‘Secret’ Blair-Libya deal stinks, says Lord Empey Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“Dficult issues unresolved - so extended transition backstop almost certain.”It remains unclear whether further negotiation will be needed on Sunday to resolve tensions over elements of the separate withdrawal agreement, or whether the summit will be a simple rubber-stamping exerciseThe PM has faced a strong pushback from Spain over the status of Gibraltar in the “orce deal”, while France is understood to have sought amendments to wording on fishing rights in UK waters.Spanish PM Pedro Sanchez has said his government is “annoyed” that the orce agreement does not specy that Gibraltar’s future must be decided directly by officials in Madrid and London.He insists that the issue is a bilateral matter and has threatened that Spain could vote against the withdrawal agreement unless its interests are taken into account.Mrs May spoke with Mr Sanchez by phone on Wednesday evening to try to deal with the situation.A Downing Street spokesman said: “She said there had been good engagement between the UK, the government of Spain and the government of Gibraltar in order to come to an agreement in the withdrawal agreement and associated package of memoranda of understanding relating to Gibraltar.“She said that the UK and government of Gibraltar looked forward to these discussions continuing as we discuss the future relationship.“The Prime Minister reiterated her commitment to agreeing a deal that works for the whole UK family including Gibraltar, the other UK overseas territories and the crown dependencies.”As the countdown to the scheduled summit intensied, Chancellor Philip Hammond said thatthe Brexit deal is rejected by Parliament it would unleash “political chaos” and could lead to EU withdrawal not happening.He told ITV’s Peston: “It’s clear thatthe deal is not approved by Parliament we will have a politically chaotic situation.“And we don’t know what the outcome of that will be.“And for those who are passionately committed to ensuring that we leave the EU on the th of March, , one of the things that they are going to have to bear in mind is the possibility that, in that chaos that would ensue, there may be no Brexit.”Germany’s economy minister Peter Altmaier told BBC’s Newsnight: “There is a lot at stake.“And thereforeit is possible to agree on Sunday we should do it.“I know there are a lot of ergent interests still, but I believe these problems can be overcome.”Meanwhile, it was reported that Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt had warned the PM that her Brexit proposals risked taking the UK into a “Turkey trap”.The Dailysaid Mr Hunt told Mrs May the UK faced a situation similar to Turkey which has been negotiating its status with the EU for decades.try catch     .               ..

Photo: Jane Barlow PA WireThe Scottish First Minister tweeted: “Just read Political Declaration. Lots of unicorns taking the place of facts about the future relationship.“Fair play to the EU for pushing it as far as possible...but it adds up to a blindfold Brexit. Dficult issues unresolved - so extended transition backstop almost certain.”Ms Sturgeon also highlighted her concerns that proposals by the Conservatives could be damaging to the fishing industry.She wrote: “Looks to me like fishing will be a bargaining chip in wider trade negotiation .“UKG was trying to get commitment to annual agreements on access - looks like they failed. Another Tory sell out of fishing on the cards.“Andwider trade negotiation not agreed by July , nor will fishing agreement- and possibility of  year transition kicks in. So not guaranteed to be out of CFP by end . Feels to me like David Mundell has some explaining to do.”Scottish Secretary of State David Mundell last month stated he wanted assurances any extension to the transition would not delay exit from CFP beyond the agreed date.He had been urged to quit by Scottish Conservative MP Ross Thomson, who said “no unionist” could support the proposals set out in the Prime Minister’s Brexit deal.Traffic and travel: Belfast route now reopened to traffic after ‘serious road traffic collision’Vandals attack Armistice solder statue in Dublin Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch     .               ..

The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Plans have now been submitted to construct the homes close to Sprucefield, outside Lisburn. It would also involve a new link road on the M motorway. An initial pre-application notice was issued for the scheme last year, but now the developer behind the scheme – Neptune Carleton – has submitted an outline planning application for the ambitious project. If the plans, which could include , homes on the large site at Blaris, get the go-ahead, it would be one of the largest residential property developments to be built in Northern Ireland in recent years. Elsewhere, this week a major £m housing development in Larne was awarded outline planning permission. Nuport Developments has been given the early go-ahead for  houses on the -acre site at Ballyboley in the town.

Since Wednesday evening, several cabinet members have resigned, opposed to what they see is a softening of Theresa May’s position on leaving the EU. Essentially, for Northern Ireland’s business community in particular, it would remain part of the same customs territory as the rest of the UK and the entire area would be subject to \"level playing field\" commitments requiring the UK to follow EU rules in areas like animal welfare, environmental and workplace protections. Northern Ireland would be in a deeper customs relationship with the EU than where in the UK, and more closely tied to EU market rules. But what do Northern Ireland business groups think   Aodhan Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium “While it will take some time to go through the  plus pages of the agreement, on the face of it this document provides some reassurance to our industry and the NI consumer. “It provides solutions to customs, tarfs, an innovative solution on VAT, support for the Peace Process and a possible longer transition period. There certainly is some work to be done by both the Westminster Government and  the EU on the checks and administration for goods coming in to Northern Ireland from GB. “That will need to be light touch and be mitigated in further agreements, hopefully to an absolute bare minimum. However this agreement must pass through Parliament. We have always said the backstop is better than no deal.”   Carolyn Fairbairn, CBI director-general “After  months of debate, this agreement by Cabinet is progress. It moves the UK one step away from the nightmare precipice of no deal and the harm it would cause to communities across the country. Securing a transition period has long been firms’ top priority and every day that passes without one means lost investment and jobs, hitting the most vulnerable hardest. “Time is now up. This deal is a compromise, including for business, but it offers that essential transitional period as a step back from the clf-edge. \"More clarity on the final relationship is needed, and uncertainty remains high, but this is an important step forward. “Transition and the backstop are not the intended permanent solutions for either side, but should pave the way for more work on the future deal. This must secure frictionless trade, ambitious access for our world-beating services, and a say over future rules. “The UK has had many months of discussion and ision. A long journey still lies ahead but now is the time for decisions. And the first decision is to avoid no deal.”  Retail NI chief executive, Glyn Roberts and Hospitality Ulster, Colin Neill  “This is a complex and detailed document which needs considerable analysis and further clarication from the UK Government. “We will be consulting our respective memberships on this document and we will set out in greater detail our views when we have completed this process. “Both our organisations have always sought a deal that ensures no delays in the supply chain, which promotes bridges rather than borders and above all , ensures that Northern Ireland businesses have full and free access to the EU and UK single markets. “Retail and Hospitality are two of Northern Ireland’s leading sectors of industry and our voice needs to be heard as this draft deal moves toward a vote in the House of Commons”  Michael Hall, managing partner, EY Northern Ireland “Business will clearly welcome last night’s announcement in that there is now better clarity on the terms of a deal however many will also be reluctant to put contingency plans on hold until there is a stronger signal on whether this will hold politically in the UK and Europe. “The backstop guarantee is a positive development for NI firms operating on an all-island basis, not least the restatement that both sides intend to work towards a free trade agreement longer term, which should not be overlooked. “The scale of political uncertainty and the volatility which this creates can be seen in the signicant currency fluctuations we have witnessed in the past  hours. Firms should not take this lightly and as such, factor these continued unknowns into their scenario planning. “On the positive side, Northern Ireland businesses have continued to expand and employ more people in the period since the Brexit referendum, which we remain hopeful they will continue to do as we look towards a further period of uncertainty. “By focusing on business fundamentals and contingency planning, firms will arm themselves so that they are ready to act when the road ahead becomes clearer.”  FSB NI policy chairman, Tina McKenzie “Businesses have been calling for months for agreement to be reached between the UK and EU negotiators, so it can only be welcome that a text has been agreed and approved by the Cabinet. “We are acutely aware of the political machinations which are ongoing, however it must be remembered that without an agreed withdrawal agreement, the UK will crash out in March , without a transition period, nor agreement on citizens’ rights, nor any plan to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. “While the exact nature of the backstop is being robustly debated, it must be remembered that the backstop will only take effectthe future relationship fails to deliver a frictionless border, after December . “We believe that the Withdrawal Agreement is a signicant step back from the clf edge which would result in a chaotic no deal Brexit that would be deeply damaging and dangerous for our small firms. “We would encourage all political actors to keep this in mind as we move forward.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/shore_1.jpg","title":"alternative london the place to be seen in the city","story":"Posted on Monday  November  by Ulster Business From London’s thriving bohemian hub and street art capital to a food, drink and nightle must-visit... John Mulgrew explores Shoreditch and beyond Once just the purview of the artistic and trendsetting, Shoreditch has fast become a location worthy of a trip in itself when visiting London.Nestled in the East End of the city, Shoreditch offers up a buzzing cultural environment, lots of independent places to eat and drink, and boasts one of the city’s best markets. Now, those in the north west always feel a little hard done by when it comes to connectivity outside Northern Ireland.In this case though, Flybmi now connects City of Derry Airport regularly with London Stansted. From there, it’s a regular train into Liverpool Street station, and then onwards using the tube or bus across the city.Andyou’re visiting Shoreditch, it’s hard to miss Boxpark. Sitting close to the tube station, it’s an array of black-clad shipping containers, with a host of retailers and places to eat. A bite at posh chip shop Poptata helps fuel the day.Journalists often prefer the freedom to explore a city at their own pace – picking up things along the way, without being ferried from place-to-place. But a food-focused tour from Alternative London brought out areas that might have otherwise been missed.Shoreditch is famous for the sheer volume of graffiti and art strewn around the area, but getting an insider’s view on the changes taking place in the area – including paid-for advertising now adorning some of the spaces reserved for artists from the area, or a Banksy – really helps take in as much as possible.Christiaan Nagel’s mushrooms, which can be found in several roof-top locations, led us to teashop T, taking in a salt-beef bagel at Beigel Bake on Brick Lane, followed by the modern, family-run self-styled home-style Indian restaurant, Gunpowder. The aloo chaat is a signature, with punch, depth and zing, while an almost unavoidable venison and vermicelli ‘doughnut’ is worth the visit alone.A brief half in the grade II listed Ten Bells, which has links to Jack the Ripper, was followed by a familiar trip to Old Spitalfields Market. It has a dense, tight offering of top-end food stalls, from Asian steamed buns at Yum Bun, to Portuguese custard tarts and fruit tea at Yi Fang.An unmissable food destination sits across from the market. St John Bread and Wine is one of Fergus Henderson’s London outlets. It’s a casual, laid back and sparse affair, which allows you to same some of the best British cooking available. You can stop by for a very reasonably priced, and one of the restaurant’s signature dishes, such as Welsh Rarebit, devilled kidneys on toast or, my choice on this visit, blood cake and egg. Think richer, chunkier black pudding, crispened in a pan with a rich-orange hued yolk. There are plenty of spots to socialise in and around Shoreditch, with some of London’s better beer bars included. The Craft Beer Co has a location on Old Street, while there’s a Brewdog and the Draft House, hidden in the Bower development.Arriving back to the hotel in the evening, don’t expect dull or leless environment at the Hoxton. The downstairs is thriving during the day, with the usual spectrum of aluminium-clad Apple Macs, but at night, especially at the weekend, it’s very much a nightspot in the area.Butyou’re after a decent night’s sleep, there’s very little sound making its way to the bedrooms from the ground-floor buzz.Leaving the hip surroundings of Shoreditch, and heading to the rather more touristy affair of Leicester Square, the Hotel Indigo is offers a grand view of the London skyline.The new rooftop bar is a superb vantage point to overlook the square, and pick out the city’s most famous structures. Then there’s the National Portrait Gallery – which sits just a short distance away from the Hotel Indigo.During the trip there was a Michael Jackson ‘On the Wall’ exhibition – one for Jackson fans, certainly – but the gallery itself, which is free, is worth a visit for everyone . It also hosts a ‘Friday Lates’ event – opening into the night, and with a small pop-up bar for visitors.Not far away, the Japan Centre offers up a myriad of everything the country has to offer in regards to food and drink in particular – from freshly made miso, to a ied and wide-selection of sake, it’s a stop worth making for anyone keen on trying to replicate the flavours they’ve had while visiting the country.Meanwhile, Shoryu Ramen – located very close to base camp at the Hoxton – offers some of the best casual noodles in the city. Starting off with cleanly flavoured salmon sashimi, followed by the garlic kick of the Dracula Tonkotsu – a heady allium-rich version of their -hour pork broth.For those in and around what is one of the city’s most tourist-heavy locations, Granaio is a reasonably recent addition.It’s a fairly familiar format – Italian classics and a wide-ranging menu, which will keep the majority of visitors content, at a reasonable price, considering the location. A beef tartare was solid, and a ribeye cooked correctly on the inside, despite a lack of charring on the outside.The theatre obviously plays a large part in the attraction to London, but the Immersive Gatsy experience turns a chunk of a Long Lane building into an interactive re-telling of F Scott Fitzgerald’s the Great Gatsby. It’s dferent, but impressively choreographed, and something alternative to spending a huge wad of cash on a West End show.A crisp sunny day before heading back on the train to Stansted offered a chance to try Hawksmoor.

Here Emma Deighan scours some of the top NI venues to see how they are catering to the corporate Christmas Arguably the most anticipated social event in the work diary, the Christmas ‘do’ has evolved over the years.And many of Northern Ireland’s top hosts agree and have widened their offering in response.Event managers and venue owners say everything from the format of the Christmas party to its timing have changed to accommodate the demands of employees today. How, when and where we celebrate are top priorities.Take the evening do, for example. For many, that age-old three-course setup doesn’t cut the convenience factor, prompting my employers end the work day early to take advantage of lunch dates. It’s a favourable move that delivers on two fronts – it offers time-poor workers the relief of a shorter day but doesn’t infringe on family obligations.Owner of Bishop’s Gate Hotel in Derry and former president of the Northern Ireland Hotel’s Federation, Ciaran O’Neill agrees. “Christmas has changed over the last number of years for our industry with more businesses looking for lunches, as opposed to the traditional party nights of old,” he said. “We do still have ‘big nights’, but these tend to occur on Fridays and Saturdays.”Ciaran says he has also noted an increase in smaller party sizes over the years.“We are seeing less private large events and more small groups dining with us. Employees are arranging ‘get togethers’ with colleagues or teams that they work directly with.”Bishop’s Gate, which has become Derry’s hospitality jewel attracting the AA Hotel of the Year- accolade, among many other awards, pairs an historic setting with parties for Christmas.The Bullitt Hotel in Belfast is setting the scene for the experience-savvy hipster workforce – and this Christmas Bullitt’s ‘experiences’ reflect the discernment of its guests.General manager at Bullitt, Michael Sullivan has seen a spike in ‘experience’ events, upgrading the turkey feast to a cooler, more casual event.“We have had a number of enquiries for informal gatherings in our Good Room event space, with a festive lunch to follow. The Good Room is the perfect space to blur the lines between work and play for intimate company get togethers ahead of a more traditional Christmas do,” he said.“We’ve also had enquiries for private gin and whiskey tastings and can also organise a number of unique events and team-building activities for groups, from candle-making to chunky knitting workshops for a truly memorable Christmas party.”This December Bullitt has a range of packages to suit private and shared s – from sit-down meals in its restaurant Taylor and Clay to VIP packages in its Baltic Bar or secluded enclaves above in Babel – its rooftop bar. And its ‘Tipsy Tea’ is geared towards the day-time revellers. Prices range from £. to £. a head.“Bullitt has brought something new and exciting to the traditional Christmas party market, with a range of novel spaces set within cool, contemporary surroundings. We like to think that we’re helping to shake up the scene somewhat by offering something a little dferent,” Michael said.If you want to push the boat out with your corporate squad, Titanic Belfast is ready for boarding. Its play on Belfast’s shipbuilding heritage and the fateful Titanic is always a crowd pleaser.

People increasingly seem to be looking for something out of the ordinary.“We have seen a trend for corporate bookings where companies are looking for alternatives to a traditional evening dinner. For example, our Festive Afternoon Tea is very popular – especially the Champagne iety.
