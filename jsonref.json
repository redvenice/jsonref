Designer Mrs Hindmarch received a CBE in the 2017 New Year’s Honours while sitting on the economy committee.Mr Rittner, chief executive of the Royal Academy of Dance, got a CBE for services to the arts at the same time. He was a member of the arts and media committee. Dame Julia, former director of London’s Serpentine gallery, received her gong in the 2016 Birthday Honours while on the arts and media committee. And Labour MP Dame Rosie, then opposition chief whip, was honoured in the 2016 New Year’s Honours when she was sitting on the parliamentary and political service committee.Several civil servants received gongs despite being involved in the honours process. They do not appear to have sat on committees which dealt with their cases.In 2016 a knighthood went to Martin Donnelly, permanent secretary of the business department, despite sitting on the economy and education committees.Malcolm McKibbin, ex-head of the Northern Ireland civil service, was knighted that year while on the education and sport committees. Tom Scholar, permanent secretary at the Treasury, was knighted in 2017 while on the economy committee. Chris Wormald, permanent secretary at the Department of Health, was knighted last year when on the health committee.And this month Sue Owen, permanent secretary of the culture department, was made a dame while on the arts, economy and sports committees.           It is believed recommendations for civil servants come from the state committee, which none of these people sat on.The revelations came just weeks after the furore surrounding the Queen’s Birthday Honours. The list was dubbed ‘rewards for failure’ after figures such as Mark Carne, the outgoing boss of Network Rail, received a CBE amid travel chaos for millions of commuters. It also emerged that three honours went to clients of a prominent literary agent who sits on one of the committees.These include historian Simon Schama, who received a knighthood, and author Jeanette Winterson, who was given a CBEThe Cabinet Office said systems were in place to ensure people were not involved in decisions regarding themselves or professional colleagues. The rules state people should declare an interest if they have a professional relationship with a potential recipient. If a committee member is put forward, they are not involved in discussions regarding the case – and should not even know it is being discussed.A spokesman for Dame Rosie said: ‘Rosie Winterton was nominated by the Labour Party. She did not play any part in the nomination process and was not present when her nomination was discussed.’Mr Rittner said: ‘I was not aware that I had been nominated for an honour, nor was I part of any discussions relating to my nomination ...

The increase in weight misperception in England is alarming and possibly a result of this normalisation.’There has been a rise on the high street in ‘vanity sizing’, where dress sizes are inflated for women with larger waists and hips and bigger busts, to flatter them that they wear a smaller size. Experts say this can ‘undermine’ action to lose weight.The study analysed the Health Survey for England, to find the answers of 23,459 people asked whether they were about the right weight, too heavy or too light.          A study of more than 23,000 people has found more than half of men do not recognise they are overweight or obeseThe results, analysed for five years between 1997 and 2015, show the proportion of overweight men in denial has leapt from 48.4 per cent to 57.9 per cent in that period. At the same time, the proportion of overweight women misjudging their weight has jumped from 24.5 per cent to 30.6 per cent.The study, published in the journal Obesity, says the normalisation of being large has become ‘widespread’ in England, with men most likely to ignore their weight problem.On the Marks \u0026amp Spencer range, Dr Muttarak wrote: ‘By introducing a new design and styling tailored for plus-size customers and using carefully selected fabrics complementing fuller figures, Curve primarily contributes to promoting body positivity.‘While this type of body-positive movement helps reduce stigmatisation of larger-sized bodies, it can potentially undermine the recognition of being overweight and its health consequences.’Among people who were overweight and obese, 38.5 per cent of men and 17.2 per cent of women thought they were ‘about the right weight’. The proportion of obese men misperceiving their weight in 2015 was almost double that seen in 1997.People who underestimated their weight were 85 per cent less likely to try to lose it, with only 51.8 per cent of those who were overweight in the study telling the Health Survey they were trying to shed the pounds.Almost two-thirds of adults in Britain are overweight or obese, with the study focusing on those with a body mass index (BMI) of 25 or over, classed as overweight, and of 30 or over, classed as obese.Dr Muttarak, a senior lecturer in UEA’s School of International Development, said: ‘Identifying those prone to misperceiving their weight can help in designing obesity-prevention strategies targeting the specific needs of different groups.’ "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/23/18/4D8F0A0400000578-5877091-image-a-19_1529773261931.jpg","title":"Starters orders bar Champagne Pimms flow Ascot","story":"    Autumn Phillips and the Queen smiled and seemed to be enjoying each other\u0027s company during the iconic racing event  Autumn Phillips and the Queen enjoying the final day of Ascot together, peering over the balcony decorated with bright pink flowers          Look over there!

You got this, but it still was not enough. PayPal’s next demand was for a ‘seizure document’ from Trading Standards or the police. This would guarantee a refund, you were promised. You arranged this with your local authority’s Trading Standards Office in Milton Keynes and told PayPal, but the next day you received an email saying this was again not enough. Worse was to come.

As I pointed out to PayPal, if the seller was indeed a crook, he would likely deny ever having received the watch if you returned it. Or, he could claim that the watch you returned was not the same as the watch he supplied. Either way, you would then be without both the watch and the £9,000.A final twist in the tale came when Trading Standards pointed out that as Rolex had confirmed the watch was a fake, if PayPal released your money to the fraudster, this could be regarded as money laundering, which is an offence in itself. I asked officials at PayPal to look into all of this. It told me: ‘We never ask a buyer to return goods when we have been given proof they were counterfeit.’          Let down: Ryanair is currently investigating a phone call one reader had with a \u0027rude employee\u0027It said it received that proof from Trading Standards on May 30. Now, I am not sure what proof that was exactly since I have seen a statement sent to PayPal by Trading Standards as long ago as March 26. It confirmed Rolex itself had judged the watch to be a fake. No matter, though. The important thing is that PayPal has now refunded the £9,000 back to the credit card you used. It has also made a goodwill credit of £100 to your PayPal account. Perhaps it might be best to avoid buying expensive second-hand watches.Why have my tax letters been ignored for months?S.T. writes: My tax office asked me to obtain official confirmation from the Department for Work \u0026amp Pensions showing the amount of my state pension for the tax years 2016-17 and 2017-18.

I telephoned but was fobbed off by a rude employee who told me it was not possible to contact customer services by phone because, ‘Who would want to listen to that all day? Anyone can make up a plausible story.’Tony Hetherington replies: Ryanair was concerned at the way you were treated when you called. I have given the airline the contact number you rang so this can be investigated. As for your refund Ryanair agrees you cancelled your flight and requested a refund, but it says you were asked to complete a claim form and failed to do this. You have told me that you submitted the claim form at least three times along with a copy of a doctor’s note about your husband’s illness. After I asked the airline to look into this, it emailed you to say the refund would go ahead. You have now received £233.I never agreed to be guarantor on policyM.H. writes: My son was learning to drive and was insured on a learner policy with Adrian Flux Insurance Services. I was paying monthly for this, and part of the policy was that it would be cancelled once he passed his test. He did pass and the policy was cancelled, but when he took out a new policy he found he could not have a monthly payment plan as he is only 17. Adrian Flux then put me down as guarantor and opened a finance agreement in my name, without my signature or consent. It says they are allowed to do this, but is it legal?Tony Hetherington replies: THE answer of course is no. You cannot be held to a finance agreement that you never authorised. But you told me that when you protested to Adrian Flux, you were informed that the Financial Conduct Authority was aware of this practice, and if you cancelled the cover it would cost £486.I do not believe the regulator would ever accept this, but it does not matter now as the insurer has told me there has been ‘a simple misunderstanding’. It seems that when your son took out his new policy, your details were mistakenly transferred over from the old policy. The company told me that naming you as ‘guarantor’ was ‘incorrect and a human error’. The agreement has been scrapped and Adrian Flux has made a goodwill offer which you have accepted. £50 bonus to openNo fees to use abroad£150 Expedia voucher or top end tech to join"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/23/19/4D8F556700000578-5877813-image-a-18_1529778479194.jpg","title":"Get sold new builds Mail Sundays property special","story":"    Hot spot: The Boiler House development in West LondonThen there’s the fact that new homes are built to the latest specifications, so major repairs should be unnecessary for the first few years. They tend to be more energy-efficient, too, so you could benefit from lower utility bills.If you buy off-plan, you might be able to choose your fixtures and finishes, and of course there’s no upward chain to contend with when you buy a new-build.About 145,000 new homes have been bought so far using the Government’s Help To Buy equity loan and London Help To Buy schemes.But new-builds can also appeal to existing homeowners. Some house-builders, such as Bellway, run part-exchange schemes, which allow people to buy a new-build and use their current home as part payment. Bellway also offer Help To Buy, plus an ‘express mover scheme’ in which they work with a local agent to market your property. While you agree the selling price on your existing home, Bellway chase the agent to encourage them to find a buyer as quickly as possible and also pay the estate agents’ fee.At The Boiler House, which was completed this month and is part of the huge Old Vinyl Factory conversion in Hayes, West London, the developer, HUB, is offering to pay the stamp duty on the new-build homes for sale.          For a start, new-build homes come with a ten-year National House-Building Council warranty covering structural defects. Most developers also provide their own two-year warranty (stock image)The Boiler House consists of 54 studio, one- and two-bedroom homes and has rooftop allotments for residents to grow their own vegetables and plants. The £250 million Old Vinyl Factory development is regenerating a 17-acre former EMI site that produced records until the late 1970s.Other kinds of new-builds gaining popularity include homes in garden villages, where sustainability is key and green spaces are a priority.Crest Nicholson Strategic Projects are behind garden villages at Monksmoor Park in Northamptonshire, Tadpole Garden Village in Wiltshire and Kilnwood Vale in West Sussex.Public space is a large feature of garden villages and homeowners pay an annual service charge to fund its maintenance.Chris Tanner moved to Tadpole Garden Village in June 2016. ‘The fact that community engagement has been made a priority is the icing on the cake,’ he says. ‘We get to guide and shape our own community.’ Today, Chris helps organise community events at the garden village, from wildlife walks and meet-your-neighbour get-togethers to Christmas carols and Easter egg hunts. ‘The events are really important in helping us feel a strong sense of community,’ he says. ‘They offer a chance to get to know each other and what’s planned for the development. Everyone feels a part of it and in turn we’re proud of where we live.’  In with the new... and the oldAs the Old Vinyl Factory development at Hayes in West London shows, new-builds don’t have to be devoid of history. Pristine new flats can be on the site of – or even housed in – buildings of historic significance.First-time buyer Wahab Ahmed, 28, an analyst in the City, feels he has the best of both worlds: a new flat he bought off-plan but within the Royal Arsenal Riverside development in Woolwich, South-East London, which has 20 converted listed buildings, some dating from the 17th Century.The Royal Arsenal was a huge area used for weapons manufacturing that grew on the south bank of the Thames over centuries. ‘It’s steeped in history and the mix of old and new really makes it stand out,’ says Wahab. He had been renting in Hoxton and Shoreditch in East London before buying his first property in Royal Arsenal Riverside’s Cannon Square, above the new Crossrail station.He says: ‘Each time I thought I’d found somewhere, something would make me doubt I was making the right decision.‘As soon as I stepped foot on the Royal Arsenal Riverside development, I knew this was the right place for me.‘One of the main reasons I bought my home was to be close to the River Thames – for me it’s the heartbeat of London.‘Waking up each day to see the sun rise over the Thames, and to see it set at night, really is something special.’Wahab’s two-bedroom property is on the second floor of the Naval House building. He has a spare room for his brother and the property has a terrace that stretches the length of the flat.          Royal Arsenal Riverside will be home to one of only two Crossrail stations south of the river once the line opensRoyal Arsenal Riverside will be home to one of only two Crossrail stations south of the river once the line opens. Wahab believes Crossrail will have major economic benefits for everyone in the area.‘The development is already really well connected, but I think Crossrail will bring even more businesses, shops and bars to Woolwich. It feels the perfect time to move here as I get to see the area change and grow.’Alongside existing rail links and the DLR, the Thames Clipper provides another way to travel through London, with the O2 arena only an eight-minute boat ride away. City Airport is just two stops on the DLR.Wahab adds: ‘Unlike my previous rented properties, this home is more sustainable and my bills are considerably lower. It’s also very low-maintenance, which is what I was looking for from the start.’          Wahab (pictured) believes Crossrail will have major economic benefits for everyone in the area  ‘I wish I’d been taught that in school’ is a refrain many of us repeat time and again over the course of our lives.Since 86 per cent of us want to buy a home – and for everyone who does, there has to be a first time – purchasing a property is likely to be high on the list of topics that many wish had been on the curriculum when we were younger.Well, for everyone daunted by expressions such as ‘completion date’ and ‘exchanging contracts’ – and which order they come in – estate agent Yopa has produced an advice guide to talk property virgins through those tricky first stages, where everything seems like a step into the unknown.1 GET YOUR MONEY IN ORDERIt is likely you will need both a deposit and a mortgage, so try to build up as much as you can for your deposit, maybe asking your family for help. The mortgage you can get will depend on how much you earn, so have your bank statements – and details of other financial affairs – to hand.2 CHOOSE YOUR NO 1When you know how much a mortgage lender will give you and what you can afford to pay, settle on a property and view it more than once – during rush hour, during the evening, and during the school run. Get a surveyor’s report done if you’re unsure about anything.3 MAKE A SENSIBLE OFFERMake an offer – and offer what you think it’s worth, not what the owner believes it’s worth. Check similar properties in the area to make sure that you’re in the right ball park.4 SPREAD THE WORDTell the agent your offer, but don’t worry too much – it can be altered later. It’s not set in stone until you pay your initial deposit and exchange contracts.5 SIT BACK AND WAITVendors can take a long time to respond to your offer, but should normally come back within two working days.6 GET A SURVEYOR AND A LAWYERIf your offer is accepted, find a surveyor as soon as possible. If the surveyor’s report is acceptable, move on to what’s called conveyancing – the legal transfer of the property from one owner to another.7 LET THE WHEELS TURNDeal with the contracts for the purchase, and the disbursements (such as the cost to register your name against the title). Or rather, let your legal representative do it for you.8 EXCHANGE CONTRACTSPaying the initial deposit and exchanging contracts commits you to moving into the property. There’s no going back now.9 COMPLETE THE DEALCompletion day is when you transfer the remainder of the money and pick up the keys to your new property. Try not to make it the same day as when you exchange. A little breathing space is advisable.10 TIME TO MOVE ITIt’s all yours.

She says: ‘It’s a percentage game. You have to ask yourself honestly, “Did you overpay in the first place? Is the property still in the good condition it was in when you bought it?”’ She also says: ‘You need to know the state of the market. If the Queen put in bi-fold doors on the back kitchen of Buckingham Palace, would it increase in value by ten per cent? No. But if you take the average family house with a narrow old-style kitchen, sitting room and dining room, classic semi-detached style, and you knock down a wall and put in bi-fold doors and a family kitchen then, yes, it will add ten per cent. I’ve no fear in saying that.’Be careful to consider the state of the whole house though, if your budget is limited. ‘If something big needs fixing, such as the roof needs replacing, then do it. But let’s say Granny dies and her whole house is just very dated. There’s no point only doing the kitchen. People will say: “Oh yes, a new kitchen but I’m going to rip it out because I’m doing the whole house anyway.” It’ll also show up just how much the other rooms need work. It’s about balance.’Allsopp may be the daughter of a baronet and live in upmarket Notting Hill – with her partner, property developer Ben Anderson and their two boys Bay and Oscar, aged ten and eight – but she is passionate about the struggle moving home can be, having spent more than two decades speaking to families across Britain, rich and poor, about their own difficulties in doing so. So what else will ensure your home sells – especially as the market slows?First impressions count, says Kirstie: ‘Sometimes it’s difficult to see what needs doing when you live in a place, so ask a friend. Your agent won’t tell you, because they’re afraid they’ll offend you and you’ll fire them. Chipped tiles, scruffy unfinished DIY jobs, damp and mould. It’s not always necessary to get someone in – there is a lot you can do yourself.‘But be practical – big jobs, such as rewiring the house, will also mean you need to re-plaster and repaint. You may well not need to get into that.’    Spread the word: A quality extension can add 11 per cent to the value of a home4 INVEST IN BATHTIMEReplacing a bathroom is a job most people don’t want to do themselves. While cost can range from £2,000 to £20,000, at the top end of that scale, a smart new bathroom could add as much as £25,000 or more to the value of your home. Even spending a small amount on an update – from £500 upwards – can add at least three per cent to the potential selling price of your home, according to GE Money. To the average UK homeowner, that’s £6,800.5 DIG DEEPDigging out a new basement to create a whole extra floor is generally deemed to be a good idea, although there is some debate whether it adds to a property’s value. I think it can, but it depends on where you live and how much the work costs. Expect to pay on average from £200 a square foot to convert something already there and from £250 to £300 a square foot if starting from scratch. Not every house suits a subterranean extension, but an estate agent will tell you the local value of property per square foot. That will help you work out whether the cost justifies the expense.6 SPLASH OUT ON WARMTHCentral heating almost always more than pays for itself. The cost to install central heating ranges from £1,000 to £3,000 depending on the system you choose, but value added can be as much as £5,000. Double-glazing likewise doesn’t cost a great deal – anything from a few hundred pounds to a few thousand, depending on the size of the task – and it can add £10,000 or more in value.7 BANK ON GARDENINGEstate agents reckon a garden is one of the best value-adders, swelling value by 20 per cent or more. In cities and large towns, a simple balcony, terrace or patio can augment a home’s value. In the country, buyers tend to expect a property to come with a garden. As with interiors, spend money on the structure of the garden if you can. Buying lots of expensive plants might add less value than working out where a good big feature tree can go, along with a patio and pathways. Installing decking or a patio can add two per cent (£4,538 on the average house price) to a house’s value, says GE Money.9 GO GREENInstalling sensible green devices such as solar panels or wood turbines could certainly add value to your home. Research by the Energy Saving Trust shows that a third of those polled said they would be willing to pay more for a home that uses energy from renewable resources, such as wind, solar or hydropower.10 STAGE A TAKEOVERIf there is a patch of land nearby – big or small – it is always worth doing your research to find out who owns it and see whether you can rent or buy it. There are so many options for how you might use it – including a kitchen garden, an office, a pool, tennis court or a children’s play area – and it will certainly return your investment. 8 STORE THAT BIKEWith more people cycling to stations, work or school these days, secure, waterproof bicycle storage is becoming as important to buyers as parking space or good public transport.

Which makes sense, considering the huge variety of housing that we live in.Some might love the community feeling and historic details found in the terraces that so many of us have as our homes or were brought up in. Others might like the quieter life offered by more suburban houses some might crave the wide-open spaces of the countryside, while others might prefer more modern houses with eco features.So, here, Life’s property experts have handpicked a selection of five homes from across the country, all on the market, to give a flavour of the range of housing on offer in Britain. And we have let Kirstie Allsopp loose on them to tell us what she really thinks, and where they each have potential. Because, whether dating back to the 1400s or having been built in the past few years – and whether costing less than £400,000 or £2 million – they all have room for improvement.Kirstie says: ‘One of these could be your dream home but, as I always say, only if it’s in the right location. If the area you live is where you feel happy, then almost any property there will be the right one. I think what happens is that, sometimes, we look for a home that we feel projects our aspirations.

He also points to the area around Bodrum becoming more accessible as Turkish Airlines has launched a new summer Gatwick to Bodrum route, running every Wednesday and Saturday until September 8.Across the Mediterranean, the property market in Ibiza is booming. Entry prices for villas, fincas and apartments in some of the most desirable locations increased once again in 2017.There have been increases of up to 17 per cent for fincas in the north of the island and 11 per cent for villas in the west. Florian Fischer, managing partner of Engel \u0026amp Völkers estate agents, which has two outlets on Ibiza, says the luxury end of the market is strong: ‘The number of properties coming on to the market is growing in the luxury segment,’ he says.Engel \u0026amp Völkers cited the sustained growth of private air traffic to Ibiza – it rose by 8.5 per cent in 2017 – and an increase in the number of wealthy visitors drawn to the island’s marinas as indicators that the rich are favouring the island more and more.The company anticipates that residential properties on Ibiza will continue to have a high level of interest, particularly among international buyers and clients from the Spanish mainland, with the current new construction activity resulting in a higher availability of quality properties on the market.However, it feels strict building regulations will mean that a scarcity in supply can be expected in the long term.

There is also a 24-hour security service, gardens and a communal pool.If having a return on your investment is what you’re after, you may feel more comfortable investing in property in Britain. In which case you could enter the buy-to-let market. One way to do this with the confidence of knowing that you will have a guaranteed income is to buy in a development that promises a certain yield.Developer Crest Nicholson say that investors will receive a return of six per cent for two years if they buy an apartment in Bath Riverside, a collection of flats and penthouse apartments a short walk from the city centre. The variety of accommodation – set on the banks of the River Avon – stretches from studios to four-bedroom homes.Just across the river is the Royal Victoria Park, a substantial green area that includes botanical gardens, children’s play area, tennis courts and Victorian landscaping.However, it is northern England that is regularly top when it comes to percentage profit from buy- to-lets. The cities of Liverpool, Manchester, Sheffield and Leeds have properties that can command yields of eight per cent.It’s surely no coincidence that these cities also have high student populations, and in recent years landlords have profited from the need for housing for the increasing numbers of students in the areas.But if there is someone in your family moving to another part of the country for further education, why not buy a property for him or her so you know they have somewhere decent to live when they are there? And after they have left it could be let to other students.On pages two and three of this supplement we have already dealt with the benefits of new-builds, particularly for first-time buyers.Many of those incentives are transferrable for the buy-to- let market.While you won’t be able to take advantage of Help to Buy, there are other measures that developers offer that might bring down the cost of your investment.Companies such as Galliard Homes have a number of incentives, such as properties coming fully furnished – as many of their new-builds do, including Harbour Central in London’s Docklands.There, Galliard provide Smeg integrated kitchen appliances and free furniture packages that include 40-50in LED TVs, Sonos playbars and mood-lighting.Across the Thames at Surrey Quays, Galliard are specifically targeting investors with their offers at the Marine Wharf East development.Galliard are offering a three per cent discount, a service charge allowance plus a free parking space with three-bedroom apartments there.And in Shoreditch, at their Stage development, Galliard are offsetting the extra three per cent Stamp Duty surcharge that investors pay if buying additional residential properties within England, Wales and Northern Ireland.The Stage also has a unique history to it – the 37-storey tower will include 412 apartments designed around the remains of Shakespeare’s original Curtain Theatre.  Discover the joys of lodge life When it comes to holiday homes in Britain, park homes can work out very cost effective. Because of how they are constructed, they are often a lot cheaper than traditional bricks and mortar houses. And some are located in the most spectacular settings.One example is Palstone Lodges, in the pretty village of South Brent in Devon’s beautiful South Hams. The site includes a collection of contemporary cedar lodges set among landscaped grounds which boast more than 1,000 species of rare and exotic plants, trees and shrubs from around the world.          One example is Palstone Lodges, in the pretty village of South Brent in Devon’s beautiful South Hams (pictured) It extends to five and half acres on the edge of Dartmoor and, as the grounds were established more than 25 years ago, the plots have the privacy that a mature woodland setting can afford.Co-owner Matt Morgan grew up on the farm where the lodges now sit and has been planning the site for more than 30 years.Six lodges are currently available to buy, starting from £175,000 for a two-bedroom and rising to £255,000 for a three-bedroom lodge.Peter and Yvette Cheeseman, both retirees from Dorset, say they made a lifestyle investment when they purchased their Palstone lodge and claim their family now saves £10,000 a year on holidays.‘We had money available from our pension and we were trying to think about what we might be able to buy,’ says Peter.‘We liked the idea of escaping to Devon to get away from our busy lives in Dorset where I still have business interests and Yvette competes with her horses.’          Devon delight: One of the Palstone lodgesWhat really stood out for Peter and Yvette were the secluded plots the lodges were sat on and how they are exclusively for the use of owners, their friends and family only.‘That gave us the added confidence that we were making the right decision,’ says Peter. ‘It meant that we could have certainty and peace of mind that people buying at Palstone Lodges genuinely cared about their property and who stays there.’Peter and Yvette’s four children also enjoy their Devon bolt-hole. ‘For them, it’s a free holiday,’ says Peter. ‘We take pleasure in the fact that we’re giving them something special as part of our family unit.’Each plot has a 125-year licence and annual service charges of £2,750, plus VAT, which covers garden and grounds maintenance and general insurance. Each property is free from Stamp Duty and Council Tax.The lodges are designed as holiday homes and not places of permanent residence.          Regulars: Phil and Rebecca Grant with their children Rory and OscarRebecca and Phil Grant, from Harpenden in Hertfordshire, often come to their Palstone lodge with their children Rory and Oscar.‘For me, working in horticulture, the attraction came from the setting, with established planting and carefully curated landscaping,’ says Rebecca. ‘It seemed to suit us perfectly. We wanted a gentle, soft green space.’Since buying more than ten years ago, they have visited the lodge most months, taking extra time there in the summers.Rebecca and Phil have made good friends with the neighbours and even socialise with them away from Palstone Lodges. Rebecca feels this has been of vital importance to them, and even more so now they have a young family.‘When we visit now we know people are there, some of whom have become great friends, but we can’t hear or see them from our lodge,’ says Rebecca.‘It’s really nice to have a sense that everyone who has a home there wants a similar way of life.’"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/23/19/4D62E26B00000578-5878117-image-a-5_1529780104780.jpg","title":"Boom Boom Boris blasts Becker insists hes not broke","story":"    Boris Becker has been declared bankrupt and forced to sell his precious trophies to begin paying off a rumoured £54 million debt, while his nine-year marriage to Lilly, the mother of his eight-year-old son, has collapsedIt has been a tumultuous year, to say the least, for Boris Becker.The former Wimbledon champion has been declared bankrupt and forced to sell his precious trophies to begin paying off a rumoured £54 million debt, while his nine-year marriage to Lilly, the mother of his eight-year-old son, has collapsed.Then, in a farcical twist to an already bizarre story, he was accused of falsely claiming to be a diplomat for the Central African Republic in a bid to wriggle out of paying his debts. On Friday, even the country’s foreign minister, Charles Armel Doubane, called Becker’s diplomatic passport a fake.So it’s a surprise to see the tennis legend so ebullient. He’s frustrated, yes, but still instantly recognisable as the irrepressible, confidently –and often bluntly – outspoken Boris whose BBC commentary will again entertain and inform Wimbledon fans when the tournament starts next week.And in a series of volleys of the same ferocity that earned him the nickname Boom Boom Becker during his stellar tennis career, he hits back, saying:He’s not bankrupt – in fact he makes ‘more money than 99 per cent of the world’ and has paid the money he owesHe is a genuine diplomat with the passport to prove it, and he took the role purely because of his ‘passion for humanitarian affairs’Divorcing his second wife at the age of 50 makes him ‘conservative’ compared to other celebrities.          In a series of volleys of the same ferocity that earned him the nickname Boom Boom Becker during his stellar tennis career, he insists that he is not bankruptBoris admits that since the High Court declared him insolvent on June 21, 2017, ‘it’s probably been the most difficult year of my life. \u0027The case has put a lot of pressure on me. \u0027I know how it looks from the outside. Whatever I owe, the price I’m paying is much higher.’But after reading the torrent of stories about himself – in which he claims ‘the only thing they did write correctly was my name’ – he’s here to set the record straight. And, he says, the true picture is very different from what’s been reported.                            This has been the most difficult year of my life                         First and foremost, he says: ‘I’m not broke’ – emphasising he’s been made personally bankrupt, not professionally bankrupt.‘Boris Becker plc is doing very well. We are still making more money than 99 per cent of the world, let’s be realistic. \u0027I have plenty of money in my account, my credit card works and everything’s normal.‘Yet the whole world is asking, “But how can you pay for dinner? How can you pay for your flat? We thought you were bankrupt.” \u0027But as far as I’m concerned, I’ve paid all I owe. I’m not running from my responsibilities. \u0027On the contrary, I would like to close the insolvency book as quickly as possible.’          Boris denies that his split from Lilly, with whom he has a son, Amadeus, has anything to do with his financial woesMost of what’s happened is, he insists, a big misunderstanding, which he describes in detail during our meeting at his agent’s office. His blue eyes fix me with an intense gaze throughout the conversation, but when he smiles, his face transforms back into that of the good-natured boy from Germany who won Wimbledon aged just 17 in 1985. Wearing an expensive suit paired with red Puma trainers, his hair slicked back and a smattering of sunburn, he looks relaxed, but says he is ready to do battle.‘I’ve never been afraid of a fight,’ he says, with a flash of the grit that won him six major singles titles.He triggered a collective raising of eyebrows earlier this month when it was reported that he had become a diplomat for the Central African Republic. As his lawyers pointed out to the High Court, this would make him immune from bankruptcy proceedings under the 1961 Vienna Convention. To critics, the timing of his appointment as sports ambassador to a tiny nation seemed a little too convenient.Cherubin Moroubama, chief of staff for the nation’s foreign ministry, said: ‘The diplomatic passport that he has is a fake’, adding that its serial number corresponded to a batch stolen in 2014. The country’s prosecutor is now investigating.But according to Boris, his appointment is real and he has the paperwork to prove it.‘I was approached by the ambassador of the CAR in March and consequently met the President who asked if I’d be interested in representing the country internationally, and I was very honoured,’ he says. ‘I was inaugurated by the president in April in Brussels, witnessed by dignitaries from the CAR and my own legal advisers as well as the ambassador who gave me the diplomatic documents and a passport which is currently at the US embassy in Brussels for visa applications, so I don’t have it with me.‘I agree that the comments from the foreign minister and his office are confusing and perplexing. I’m very keen this should be resolved.’And he insists: ‘My appointment has nothing to do with my insolvency case. Humanitarian affairs are something I care deeply about.’          He’s aware some people assume a major reason for his money troubles are the payouts he’s made to women, first to Barbara (pictured), mother of his two eldest sons, in 2000, then to Russian model Angela Ermakova, with whom he fathered a daughter, Anna, after a tryst in a London restaurantBut Boris, I ask, have you ever been to the Central African Republic? ‘No, not yet, I was only recently appointed,’ he says, adding quickly: ‘We’ve been looking at dates, but the President is a busy man.’He says the reason the High Court was told of his new diplomatic status was purely because he was bound to disclose his new, official address in Brussels. Can he see, though, how it could be viewed as a scheme cooked up to help him out of his predicament?‘I can see why it could look like that,’ he concedes. ‘But that’s why I’m talking to The Mail on Sunday now, to put the record straight.’Boris denies that his split from Lilly, with whom he has a son, Amadeus, has anything to do with his financial woes. ‘A marriage break-up doesn’t happen overnight – it’s a long process,’ he says.Love split Lilly turns her back on Boris Becker after nine...Share this article‘We are moving on and ultimately, there will be a orce. It’s being done as amicably as possible and our main concern is Amadeus. Lilly’s a wonderful woman and a great mother, but people unfortunately break up.’The continuing interest in his private life frustrates him. ‘When I look at how many celebrities have been married and orced since I split up with my first wife, Barbara 19 years ago, I’m very conservative. \u0027My second orce and I’m 50 – could be worse!’ He’s aware some people assume a major reason for his money troubles are the payouts he’s made to women, first to Barbara, mother of his two eldest sons, in 2000, then to Russian model Angela Ermakova, with whom he fathered a daughter, Anna, after a tryst in a London restaurant.  In a farcical twist to an already bizarre story, he was accused of falsely claiming to be a diplomat for the Central African Republic in a bid to wriggle out of paying his debts. He is pictured left with President Faustin Archange Touadera‘That’s absolutely not accurate,’ he says. ‘I had a pre-nup with my first wife and a orce in Germany so whatever people fantasised about a double-digit million number, not true. \u0027But more importantly, we’re on great terms. And Anna is on great form and my relationship with her mother is intact.’He’s found recent reports about his mansion in Majorca being taken over by squatters perplexing ‘because I sold it two years ago. \u0027It’s terrible that squatters are there, but it’s not mine’.Becker’s problems stem from a loan taken out with private bank Arbuthnot Latham, who launched the insolvency case over a reported £9 million he owes them.          Becker’s problems stem from a loan taken out with private bank Arbuthnot Latham, who launched the insolvency case over a reported £9 million he owes themBecker puts the figure at £3.4 million and claims that the bank charged him 25 per cent interest – claims the bank deny.He also claims the bank has used his celebrity status to demand more, and says he tried to find a solution before the bankruptcy judgment last June, such as moving the loan to another bank. ‘But there was no chance for me to negotiate a settlement. They refused to meet me and my advisers and they kept moving me into insolvency.’But the bank say: ‘Mr Becker’s colourful version of events simply does not tally with the facts and has already been dismissed by a judge. Arbuthnot Latham has at all times dealt with Mr Becker in good faith.’The £54 million figure bandied about for Boris’s total debts – including a claim for £34 million from a Swiss businessman – is absurd, he says. ‘How can you spend that much? Do you see any yachts?’But he says. ‘I have a good income and can spend whatever I want.’He can’t deny he’s made some poor business decisions over the years. In 2002, he received a two-year suspended sentence in Germany for tax evasion. Some of his businesses, including the website Sportgate, have failed. ‘Mistakes have been made, but Sportgate was almost 20 years ago. That’s business.’He adds: ‘I’ve never been driven by money. I won my first Wimbledon and forgot to take the pay check because it wasn’t important to me. I just wanted to win.’ Still, he was ‘completely taken aback’ by the High Court judgment, which he says, in typical Boris-speak, ‘happened to me like a baby to a virgin’.He believes the assets which have been collected from him in the past year by the court-appointed trustees from law firm Smith \u0026amp Williamson, which total £4.4 million, more than cover the debt. ‘I’m happy to pay back what I owe,’ he says.Theoretically, he should have been discharged from bankruptcy last week, a year after the ruling. However, the situation is rumbling on. ‘The trustee wants to prolong the insolvency for at least another six months because he doesn’t believe I’m co-operative,’ he says.    Speaking of his orce from Lilly, Boris said: ‘A marriage break-up doesn’t happen overnight – it’s a long process\u0027Boris does not believe the trustee is as neutral as he should be. ‘For some reason, they were fascinated with selling all my trophies, although I explained to them that they have strong emotional value but very little financial value. \u0027There was no need to do it, but that’s just taking the knife and digging it into my heart and saying, “We have you and we can do what we want.” ’The trustees, however, say their job is to act in the best interests of Boris’s creditors and say the sale of his trophies and memorabilia should raise more than £200,000, ‘not a sum we consider immaterial’.Becker says he is preparing a counter-suit against the bank for malpractice and gross negligence. ‘The fact is we’re going back to court soon to fight this and expect to win. I strongly feel that they were taking advantage of my fame and they thought I couldn’t afford to go to court so I would probably agree to pay a much higher sum.  Becker says he is preparing a counter-suit against the bank for malpractice and gross negligence. Becker says he is preparing a counter-suit against the bank for malpractice and gross negligence and right victorious‘If you want to blackmail me, you’ve picked the wrong guy because I’m happy to fight.‘What they are doing isn’t right. It’s probably the toughest match of my life, but I’m not afraid. Let’s play. I’ve never been known as someone to run away.’He now has until July 30 to present evidence that he has paid what he owes and he hopes his insolvency will be over in October. ‘I’m looking forward to having this difficult year out of the way,’ he says.He’s also excited about Wimbledon, which begins on July 2. ‘It’s the best part of the year for me, working for the BBC and talking about tennis. This country has adopted me, it’s my home and I love it.‘I’ve had to concentrate at times on keeping my spirits and sense of humour up by remembering what my passion is.’He says his ordeal has made him more reflective. ‘Some of what has happened I think is because I’m Boris Becker, a celebrity. But that’s the price to pay for all the opportunities I’ve had.‘I have a chance now to wipe the slate clean, to learn from my mistakes, to associate myself with better people perhaps. I’m not bitter. I’m healthy, I have a job I love and a wonderful family. I have a lot going for me.’"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/23/20/4D8F5E1300000578-5878161-image-a-39_1529781037200.jpg","title":"The downsizing lowdown make moving smaller home","story":"    Home comforts: The Greenhouse and Pavillion at Wadswick Green in WiltshireCraig Gibson, a partner at WDM Chartered Accountants, says: ‘Homes are a massive asset for people who have been committed to them for decades, so understanding your options is essential, especially when you’re selling.’And if you’re tempted to hand over your house or large chunks of money to your children, he says, ‘there are some ways to give your children cash or your home, but it’s very important to get good independent financial advice’. For instance, the annual allowance for tax-free gifts to children (or anyone else) is £3,000 per person. But parents can give up to £5,000 to children as wedding or civil-partnership gifts tax-free. Regular payments are exempt from inheritance tax, as long as they come from your income and not your savings and don’t significantly affect your lifestyle.When downsizing, it is important to consider what would be left to your children when you die.The inheritance-tax threshold currently stands at £325,000, and the rate payable on estates of more than that is 40 per cent of the amount above £325,000. The exception is if you are married, as you can pass your full estate to your spouse in the event of your death without paying inheritance tax. By doing this you also pass on your £325,000 inheritance-tax exemption, so £650,000 of your combined estate would then be free from inheritance tax.          Luxury living: One of Birchgrove\u0027s apartments in SidcupIf you go into residential care, you may have to sell your home to pay for it. One way to hold on to your home so you can pass the proceeds on to your children is to buy in a retirement development, like Wadswick Green in Wiltshire, where help is on hand for that care. However, exit fees that the development takes when you die will deplete any money you can pass on – as will service charges.Another option to free up money from your home is equity release. You have to be over 55 to go down this path, but it allows you to release money as a lump sum, or in several smaller amounts, or as a combination of both. And while equity-release products give you access to the cash in your home, they tend to be more expensive than regular mortgages and have associated fees. Triggering equity release may also affect your ability to claim state benefits.With so many people’s money in bricks and mortar – and with, these days, so many options available to those reaching retirement age – it’s no wonder that experts say it’s more important than ever before to look at ‘succession planning’.  Rent your way to riches In America, Australia and on the Continent, renting in retirement is much more popular than here. The British obsession with home ownership means we are keener than those in other countries to tie up our money in property.But there was 13 per cent increase in retired renters here between 2012 to 2016, according to the National Landlords Association, and Scottish Widows recently predicted figures will double to nine million by 2022.

Perched on top of the dome was a statue of Neptune, which protruded from the lake’s surface and was the only part of the structure visible from land.An air vent emerged through Neptune’s mouth and wisps of smoke were sometimes seen drifting out of it when Wright and his friends were enjoying cigars.To ensure clear views, Wright hired ers to keep the dome free from algae. Spellbound guests were able to watch fish and sometimes swimmers overhead. On summer nights, he switched off the lights so his friends could watch firework displays or gaze at the stars magnified by curved glass and water.A short flight of steps led to another underwater room with concrete walls and a curved ceiling supported on cast-iron columns. Lit by porthole-shaped skylights and equipped with a billiards table and card tables, this was the Lord of the Manor’s secret gaming room, where the men could head off for post-prandial fun.Run-down farmhouse which was bought for £300,000 then...There’s not much SPACE! Boatbuilder creates tiny...Share this articleThe ladies were catered for, too. From the gaming room, another staircase led to a stone viewing platform on the surface of the lake, where on summer afternoons his wife Anna and her friends could take tea.Wright’s tale has fascinated me ever since I first encountered this underwater hideaway while researching architectural follies. I wondered what sort of person could have built such a place. And the answer, I found, was a man the Victorians called the Napoleon of Finance, whose epic story – the subject of my new biography – was in many ways a forerunner of more modern financial disasters.Corpulent, grandiose and bull-necked, James Wright was an unlikely tycoon. Born in 1846, the eldest of five children of a Methodist preacher, he, too, became a minister before setting up a printing business in Halifax with his brother that promptly went bankrupt.The pair narrowly avoided prison, and on their father’s death, both emigrated to Toronto. Wright – by now using his middle name Whitaker – was lured by an oil boom to Philadelphia, where he met and married Anna in 1878. He set up a series of businesses, again sailing perilously close to the wind. In 1877, he and four partners were accused of making false claims in the prospectus of a new company and charged with conspiracy to defraud stockholders. Yet Wright escaped prosecution and, ever the adventurer, decided to became a prospector in America’s Wild West. An outgoing man with a quick wit and a ready charm, he made friends freely in saloons and gambling dens. Indeed, he enjoyed the rough-and-tumble boomtown life and later claimed he had witnessed ‘fierce revolver fights in the dancing halls’.          Deep secret: The underwater dome\u0027s 200 panes of glass were kept clean by a team of ersIt was in Leadville, Colorado, that he made his first fortune, talking up the prospects of a silver mine in 1880 and floating the company for $5 million (about £85 million in today’s money) on the New York stock exchange.By the time the business went bust, Wright had made a fat profit and was long gone. He repeated the trick in Utah, California, Nevada and New Mexico, where he set up a company that initially, at least, rewarded its investors handsomely.For the first five months it paid out $100,000 a month in idends as more than $1 million in silver was brought to the surface. The company’s share price soared, but again the bonanza did not last. In 1889, with his reputation tarnished and creditors breathing down his neck, he decided to reinvent himself in the land of his birth. Wright began promoting West Australian gold mines on the London stock exchange and, as the money rolled in like never before, he looked for a country property befitting of his enormous wealth, in part to prove to himself and his family that he had left that early disgrace in Halifax far behind.With money no object, he bought two tracts of land at Witley, near Godalming, paying £150,000 for the Lea Park estate, which included a 19th Century manor house, and £100,000 for the adjacent South Park Farm estate.Striding through his 9,000 acres, which contained 90 miles of roads and lanes, five lodges and ten farms, he set his swirling imagination to work. A small tributary of the River Wey meandered through the grounds, but Wright envisaged a series of great lakes, complete with islands. Most of the exotic ideas were his own. Under the direction of London architect Paxton Hood Watson, two wings were added to the existing manor house at the stupendous cost of £400,000.          Whitaker Wright was convicted of fraud in 2004The new west wing was adorned with a vast conservatory, which alone cost £10,000 (about £1 million today) and a large central glass dome filled with trees and exotic plants from across the world – a rival to Kew Gardens. The east wing, meanwhile, accommodated a domed observatory with a revolving copper roof.Between these two great embellishments were 32 bedrooms, 11 bathrooms and seven reception rooms, the largest of which, at more than 2,600 square feet, was the cedar-panelled ballroom, with a dancefloor capable of accommodating hundreds. Wright even found room for a small private hospital and, oddly, one of Britain’s first private velodromes.The stable block, capable of holding 50 horses, was a centrally heated equine palace with a viewing space from which visitors could admire their mounts from the comfort of leather-upholstered settees shaded by palms. Months of work resulted in the creation of the square lake, the bathing lake and the big lake. A boathouse was home to a flotilla of electric launches, sailing craft and rowing boats.It all came at quite a cost. Over the years his improvements to the estate cost an estimated £1,115,000 – then an extraordinary amount of money. But the overblown and impossibly extravagant house – he had a staff of 77 – was a perfect expression of his creator.In Queen Victoria’s diamond jubilee year of 1897, government Ministers and peers were among those who rushed to buy shares in his booming London and Globe Company and other mining-related companies.To impress investors, Wright made a point of appointing Establishment figures as directors. Future prime minister Arthur Balfour and members of the Spencer-Churchill family all invested. Even the Royal Family was said to have benefited.Whether or not these rumours were true, they were widely believed and Wright did nothing to dispel them. He established another Royal connection when he struck up a friendship with the spendthrift Sir James Reid, personal physician to Queen Victoria – in 1896 he sought Wright’s advice on how to make a killing on the stock market.To the world at large, it seemed he could do no wrong.But like the latter-day conman Charles Ponzi, inventor of the fraud scheme that bears his name, Wright’s business acumen was not as it seemed.          A dolphin\u0027s head water feature in the grounds of the estate which included lakes and islandsJust as in America, many of his much-vaunted mining prospects turned out to be duds and he used accounting tricks to make them appear solvent in annual accounts All such frauds must, eventually, come crashing down.And in a true fin de siècle moment, his house of cards collapsed on the last day of trading of the 19th Century.Panic spread in the stock market. Shares in Wright’s companies halved and 20 firms of stockbrokers were ruined.Wright fled to France and boarded a liner to New York, only to be arrested on arrival thanks to a transatlantic cable from Scotland Yard. He was brought back to London to stand trial.On January 26, 1904, he was convicted of fraud at the Royal Courts of Justice and given a seven-year prison sentence, but he evaded justice by swallowing cyanide in a court anteroom almost immediately afterwards.Magnificent as it was, Wright’s great project at Lea Park was never completed. After passing through a variety of owners, the big house burned down in 1952 and the buildings were demolished.The underwater dome, still watertight after 120 years, is now a Grade II-listed building – a monument not merely to folly, but to a life of extraordinary excess.lUltimate Folly: The Rises And Falls Of Whitaker Wright, by Henry Macrory, is published by Biteback at £20.

Ms Ardern is set to make history as the first New Zealand Prime Minister to give birth while in the top seat          Following the birth, the government will be led by Winston Peters, 73, for six weeks.

Designer Mrs Hindmarch received a CBE in the 2017 New Year’s Honours while sitting on the economy committee.Mr Rittner, chief executive of the Royal Academy of Dance, got a CBE for services to the arts at the same time. He was a member of the arts and media committee. Dame Julia, former director of London’s Serpentine gallery, received her gong in the 2016 Birthday Honours while on the arts and media committee. And Labour MP Dame Rosie, then opposition chief whip, was honoured in the 2016 New Year’s Honours when she was sitting on the parliamentary and political service committee.Several civil servants received gongs despite being involved in the honours process. They do not appear to have sat on committees which dealt with their cases.In 2016 a knighthood went to Martin Donnelly, permanent secretary of the business department, despite sitting on the economy and education committees.Malcolm McKibbin, ex-head of the Northern Ireland civil service, was knighted that year while on the education and sport committees. Tom Scholar, permanent secretary at the Treasury, was knighted in 2017 while on the economy committee. Chris Wormald, permanent secretary at the Department of Health, was knighted last year when on the health committee.And this month Sue Owen, permanent secretary of the culture department, was made a dame while on the arts, economy and sports committees.           It is believed recommendations for civil servants come from the state committee, which none of these people sat on.The revelations came just weeks after the furore surrounding the Queen’s Birthday Honours. The list was dubbed ‘rewards for failure’ after figures such as Mark Carne, the outgoing boss of Network Rail, received a CBE amid travel chaos for millions of commuters. It also emerged that three honours went to clients of a prominent literary agent who sits on one of the committees.These include historian Simon Schama, who received a knighthood, and author Jeanette Winterson, who was given a CBEThe Cabinet Office said systems were in place to ensure people were not involved in decisions regarding themselves or professional colleagues. The rules state people should declare an interest if they have a professional relationship with a potential recipient. If a committee member is put forward, they are not involved in discussions regarding the case – and should not even know it is being discussed.A spokesman for Dame Rosie said: ‘Rosie Winterton was nominated by the Labour Party. She did not play any part in the nomination process and was not present when her nomination was discussed.’Mr Rittner said: ‘I was not aware that I had been nominated for an honour, nor was I part of any discussions relating to my nomination ...

The increase in weight misperception in England is alarming and possibly a result of this normalisation.’There has been a rise on the high street in ‘vanity sizing’, where dress sizes are inflated for women with larger waists and hips and bigger busts, to flatter them that they wear a smaller size. Experts say this can ‘undermine’ action to lose weight.The study analysed the Health Survey for England, to find the answers of 23,459 people asked whether they were about the right weight, too heavy or too light.          A study of more than 23,000 people has found more than half of men do not recognise they are overweight or obeseThe results, analysed for five years between 1997 and 2015, show the proportion of overweight men in denial has leapt from 48.4 per cent to 57.9 per cent in that period. At the same time, the proportion of overweight women misjudging their weight has jumped from 24.5 per cent to 30.6 per cent.The study, published in the journal Obesity, says the normalisation of being large has become ‘widespread’ in England, with men most likely to ignore their weight problem.On the Marks \u0026amp Spencer range, Dr Muttarak wrote: ‘By introducing a new design and styling tailored for plus-size customers and using carefully selected fabrics complementing fuller figures, Curve primarily contributes to promoting body positivity.‘While this type of body-positive movement helps reduce stigmatisation of larger-sized bodies, it can potentially undermine the recognition of being overweight and its health consequences.’Among people who were overweight and obese, 38.5 per cent of men and 17.2 per cent of women thought they were ‘about the right weight’. The proportion of obese men misperceiving their weight in 2015 was almost double that seen in 1997.People who underestimated their weight were 85 per cent less likely to try to lose it, with only 51.8 per cent of those who were overweight in the study telling the Health Survey they were trying to shed the pounds.Almost two-thirds of adults in Britain are overweight or obese, with the study focusing on those with a body mass index (BMI) of 25 or over, classed as overweight, and of 30 or over, classed as obese.Dr Muttarak, a senior lecturer in UEA’s School of International Development, said: ‘Identifying those prone to misperceiving their weight can help in designing obesity-prevention strategies targeting the specific needs of different groups.’ "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/23/17/4D8ED90F00000578-5877309-image-m-4_1529770858963.jpg","title":"Are Manchester Sheffield really SOUTH BBC sparks controversy tweet","story":"    A map of where the \u0027North\u0027 and \u0027South\u0027 lie based on a suggestion by a Newcastle Uni academic          Professor Mark Tewdwr-Jones said the North-South ide should be based on transport accessibility to LondonBBC Radio 4\u0027s Today current affairs show opened up the question of where a North-South boundary would exist as part of the Great Exhibition of the North in Gateshead, which opened on Friday.In anticipation of a broadcast from the summer-long event, they tweeted out Tewdwr-Jones\u0027 lopsided proposal of where the \u0027North\u0027 ides the \u0027South\u0027.The marker starts at the lowest tip of Wales in the Vale of Glamorgan stretching up and around the Midlands up as far as York before looping back down, encompassing Lincolnshire and ending near Norfolk and East Anglia.            Mark Tewdwr-Jones\u0027 lopsided map is tweeted out by BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today current affairs show          BBC radio broadcaster Mishal Husain was bombarded with messages from Twitter users about the map          Mishal Husain was \u0027fully briefed\u0027 on the discussion of the North-South border after BBC Radio 4 tweeted out an illustration of the mapIt separates regional neighbours Liverpool and Manchester, which are placed in the  \u0027North\u0027 and \u0027South\u0027 respectively.Cardiff is also considered \u0027South\u0027 while Swansea is in the \u0027North\u0027, despite being roughly 200 miles south of Manchester in proximity.Leeds and Sheffield are also placed in the \u0027South\u0027 while nearby Bradford and Huddersfield are \u0027North\u0027.The map irked a number of Twitter users who bombarded host Mishal Husain with messages on the subject.     \u0027South\u0027?

They tend to be more energy-efficient, too, so you could benefit from lower utility bills.If you buy off-plan, you might be able to choose your fixtures and finishes, and of course there’s no upward chain to contend with when you buy a new-build.About 145,000 new homes have been bought so far using the Government’s Help To Buy equity loan and London Help To Buy schemes.But new-builds can also appeal to existing homeowners. Some house-builders, such as Bellway, run part-exchange schemes, which allow people to buy a new-build and use their current home as part payment. Bellway also offer Help To Buy, plus an ‘express mover scheme’ in which they work with a local agent to market your property. While you agree the selling price on your existing home, Bellway chase the agent to encourage them to find a buyer as quickly as possible and also pay the estate agents’ fee.At The Boiler House, which was completed this month and is part of the huge Old Vinyl Factory conversion in Hayes, West London, the developer, HUB, is offering to pay the stamp duty on the new-build homes for sale.          For a start, new-build homes come with a ten-year National House-Building Council warranty covering structural defects. Most developers also provide their own two-year warranty (stock image)The Boiler House consists of 54 studio, one- and two-bedroom homes and has rooftop allotments for residents to grow their own vegetables and plants. The £250 million Old Vinyl Factory development is regenerating a 17-acre former EMI site that produced records until the late 1970s.Other kinds of new-builds gaining popularity include homes in garden villages, where sustainability is key and green spaces are a priority.Crest Nicholson Strategic Projects are behind garden villages at Monksmoor Park in Northamptonshire, Tadpole Garden Village in Wiltshire and Kilnwood Vale in West Sussex.Public space is a large feature of garden villages and homeowners pay an annual service charge to fund its maintenance.Chris Tanner moved to Tadpole Garden Village in June 2016. ‘The fact that community engagement has been made a priority is the icing on the cake,’ he says. ‘We get to guide and shape our own community.’ Today, Chris helps organise community events at the garden village, from wildlife walks and meet-your-neighbour get-togethers to Christmas carols and Easter egg hunts. ‘The events are really important in helping us feel a strong sense of community,’ he says. ‘They offer a chance to get to know each other and what’s planned for the development. Everyone feels a part of it and in turn we’re proud of where we live.’  In with the new... and the oldAs the Old Vinyl Factory development at Hayes in West London shows, new-builds don’t have to be devoid of history. Pristine new flats can be on the site of – or even housed in – buildings of historic significance.First-time buyer Wahab Ahmed, 28, an analyst in the City, feels he has the best of both worlds: a new flat he bought off-plan but within the Royal Arsenal Riverside development in Woolwich, South-East London, which has 20 converted listed buildings, some dating from the 17th Century.The Royal Arsenal was a huge area used for weapons manufacturing that grew on the south bank of the Thames over centuries. ‘It’s steeped in history and the mix of old and new really makes it stand out,’ says Wahab. He had been renting in Hoxton and Shoreditch in East London before buying his first property in Royal Arsenal Riverside’s Cannon Square, above the new Crossrail station.He says: ‘Each time I thought I’d found somewhere, something would make me doubt I was making the right decision.‘As soon as I stepped foot on the Royal Arsenal Riverside development, I knew this was the right place for me.‘One of the main reasons I bought my home was to be close to the River Thames – for me it’s the heartbeat of London.‘Waking up each day to see the sun rise over the Thames, and to see it set at night, really is something special.’Wahab’s two-bedroom property is on the second floor of the Naval House building. He has a spare room for his brother and the property has a terrace that stretches the length of the flat.          Royal Arsenal Riverside will be home to one of only two Crossrail stations south of the river once the line opensRoyal Arsenal Riverside will be home to one of only two Crossrail stations south of the river once the line opens. Wahab believes Crossrail will have major economic benefits for everyone in the area.‘The development is already really well connected, but I think Crossrail will bring even more businesses, shops and bars to Woolwich. It feels the perfect time to move here as I get to see the area change and grow.’Alongside existing rail links and the DLR, the Thames Clipper provides another way to travel through London, with the O2 arena only an eight-minute boat ride away. City Airport is just two stops on the DLR.Wahab adds: ‘Unlike my previous rented properties, this home is more sustainable and my bills are considerably lower. It’s also very low-maintenance, which is what I was looking for from the start.’          Wahab (pictured) believes Crossrail will have major economic benefits for everyone in the area  ‘I wish I’d been taught that in school’ is a refrain many of us repeat time and again over the course of our lives.Since 86 per cent of us want to buy a home – and for everyone who does, there has to be a first time – purchasing a property is likely to be high on the list of topics that many wish had been on the curriculum when we were younger.Well, for everyone daunted by expressions such as ‘completion date’ and ‘exchanging contracts’ – and which order they come in – estate agent Yopa has produced an advice guide to talk property virgins through those tricky first stages, where everything seems like a step into the unknown.1 GET YOUR MONEY IN ORDERIt is likely you will need both a deposit and a mortgage, so try to build up as much as you can for your deposit, maybe asking your family for help. The mortgage you can get will depend on how much you earn, so have your bank statements – and details of other financial affairs – to hand.2 CHOOSE YOUR NO 1When you know how much a mortgage lender will give you and what you can afford to pay, settle on a property and view it more than once – during rush hour, during the evening, and during the school run. Get a surveyor’s report done if you’re unsure about anything.3 MAKE A SENSIBLE OFFERMake an offer – and offer what you think it’s worth, not what the owner believes it’s worth. Check similar properties in the area to make sure that you’re in the right ball park.4 SPREAD THE WORDTell the agent your offer, but don’t worry too much – it can be altered later. It’s not set in stone until you pay your initial deposit and exchange contracts.5 SIT BACK AND WAITVendors can take a long time to respond to your offer, but should normally come back within two working days.6 GET A SURVEYOR AND A LAWYERIf your offer is accepted, find a surveyor as soon as possible. If the surveyor’s report is acceptable, move on to what’s called conveyancing – the legal transfer of the property from one owner to another.7 LET THE WHEELS TURNDeal with the contracts for the purchase, and the disbursements (such as the cost to register your name against the title). Or rather, let your legal representative do it for you.8 EXCHANGE CONTRACTSPaying the initial deposit and exchanging contracts commits you to moving into the property. There’s no going back now.9 COMPLETE THE DEALCompletion day is when you transfer the remainder of the money and pick up the keys to your new property. Try not to make it the same day as when you exchange. A little breathing space is advisable.10 TIME TO MOVE ITIt’s all yours.

She says: ‘It’s a percentage game. You have to ask yourself honestly, “Did you overpay in the first place? Is the property still in the good condition it was in when you bought it?”’ She also says: ‘You need to know the state of the market. If the Queen put in bi-fold doors on the back kitchen of Buckingham Palace, would it increase in value by ten per cent? No. But if you take the average family house with a narrow old-style kitchen, sitting room and dining room, classic semi-detached style, and you knock down a wall and put in bi-fold doors and a family kitchen then, yes, it will add ten per cent. I’ve no fear in saying that.’Be careful to consider the state of the whole house though, if your budget is limited. ‘If something big needs fixing, such as the roof needs replacing, then do it. But let’s say Granny dies and her whole house is just very dated. There’s no point only doing the kitchen. People will say: “Oh yes, a new kitchen but I’m going to rip it out because I’m doing the whole house anyway.” It’ll also show up just how much the other rooms need work. It’s about balance.’Allsopp may be the daughter of a baronet and live in upmarket Notting Hill – with her partner, property developer Ben Anderson and their two boys Bay and Oscar, aged ten and eight – but she is passionate about the struggle moving home can be, having spent more than two decades speaking to families across Britain, rich and poor, about their own difficulties in doing so. So what else will ensure your home sells – especially as the market slows?First impressions count, says Kirstie: ‘Sometimes it’s difficult to see what needs doing when you live in a place, so ask a friend. Your agent won’t tell you, because they’re afraid they’ll offend you and you’ll fire them. Chipped tiles, scruffy unfinished DIY jobs, damp and mould. It’s not always necessary to get someone in – there is a lot you can do yourself.‘But be practical – big jobs, such as rewiring the house, will also mean you need to re-plaster and repaint. You may well not need to get into that.’    Spread the word: A quality extension can add 11 per cent to the value of a home4 INVEST IN BATHTIMEReplacing a bathroom is a job most people don’t want to do themselves. While cost can range from £2,000 to £20,000, at the top end of that scale, a smart new bathroom could add as much as £25,000 or more to the value of your home. Even spending a small amount on an update – from £500 upwards – can add at least three per cent to the potential selling price of your home, according to GE Money. To the average UK homeowner, that’s £6,800.5 DIG DEEPDigging out a new basement to create a whole extra floor is generally deemed to be a good idea, although there is some debate whether it adds to a property’s value. I think it can, but it depends on where you live and how much the work costs. Expect to pay on average from £200 a square foot to convert something already there and from £250 to £300 a square foot if starting from scratch. Not every house suits a subterranean extension, but an estate agent will tell you the local value of property per square foot. That will help you work out whether the cost justifies the expense.6 SPLASH OUT ON WARMTHCentral heating almost always more than pays for itself. The cost to install central heating ranges from £1,000 to £3,000 depending on the system you choose, but value added can be as much as £5,000. Double-glazing likewise doesn’t cost a great deal – anything from a few hundred pounds to a few thousand, depending on the size of the task – and it can add £10,000 or more in value.7 BANK ON GARDENINGEstate agents reckon a garden is one of the best value-adders, swelling value by 20 per cent or more. In cities and large towns, a simple balcony, terrace or patio can augment a home’s value. In the country, buyers tend to expect a property to come with a garden. As with interiors, spend money on the structure of the garden if you can. Buying lots of expensive plants might add less value than working out where a good big feature tree can go, along with a patio and pathways. Installing decking or a patio can add two per cent (£4,538 on the average house price) to a house’s value, says GE Money.9 GO GREENInstalling sensible green devices such as solar panels or wood turbines could certainly add value to your home. Research by the Energy Saving Trust shows that a third of those polled said they would be willing to pay more for a home that uses energy from renewable resources, such as wind, solar or hydropower.10 STAGE A TAKEOVERIf there is a patch of land nearby – big or small – it is always worth doing your research to find out who owns it and see whether you can rent or buy it. There are so many options for how you might use it – including a kitchen garden, an office, a pool, tennis court or a children’s play area – and it will certainly return your investment. 8 STORE THAT BIKEWith more people cycling to stations, work or school these days, secure, waterproof bicycle storage is becoming as important to buyers as parking space or good public transport. A ready-made bike shed costs about £400, and a simple bike rack less than £100.SPREAD THE WORD: A quality extension can add 11 per cent to the value of a home                                                                Your perfect place - at the right priceNo one has exactly the same idea of a dream home – with period, location and space varying according to who is doing the dreaming. Which makes sense, considering the huge variety of housing that we live in.Some might love the community feeling and historic details found in the terraces that so many of us have as our homes or were brought up in. Others might like the quieter life offered by more suburban houses some might crave the wide-open spaces of the countryside, while others might prefer more modern houses with eco features.So, here, Life’s property experts have handpicked a selection of five homes from across the country, all on the market, to give a flavour of the range of housing on offer in Britain. And we have let Kirstie Allsopp loose on them to tell us what she really thinks, and where they each have potential. Because, whether dating back to the 1400s or having been built in the past few years – and whether costing less than £400,000 or £2 million – they all have room for improvement.Kirstie says: ‘One of these could be your dream home but, as I always say, only if it’s in the right location. If the area you live is where you feel happy, then almost any property there will be the right one. I think what happens is that, sometimes, we look for a home that we feel projects our aspirations.

One way to do this with the confidence of knowing that you will have a guaranteed income is to buy in a development that promises a certain yield.Developer Crest Nicholson say that investors will receive a return of six per cent for two years if they buy an apartment in Bath Riverside, a collection of flats and penthouse apartments a short walk from the city centre. The variety of accommodation – set on the banks of the River Avon – stretches from studios to four-bedroom homes.Just across the river is the Royal Victoria Park, a substantial green area that includes botanical gardens, children’s play area, tennis courts and Victorian landscaping.However, it is northern England that is regularly top when it comes to percentage profit from buy- to-lets. The cities of Liverpool, Manchester, Sheffield and Leeds have properties that can command yields of eight per cent.It’s surely no coincidence that these cities also have high student populations, and in recent years landlords have profited from the need for housing for the increasing numbers of students in the areas.But if there is someone in your family moving to another part of the country for further education, why not buy a property for him or her so you know they have somewhere decent to live when they are there? And after they have left it could be let to other students.On pages two and three of this supplement we have already dealt with the benefits of new-builds, particularly for first-time buyers.Many of those incentives are transferrable for the buy-to- let market.While you won’t be able to take advantage of Help to Buy, there are other measures that developers offer that might bring down the cost of your investment.Companies such as Galliard Homes have a number of incentives, such as properties coming fully furnished – as many of their new-builds do, including Harbour Central in London’s Docklands.There, Galliard provide Smeg integrated kitchen appliances and free furniture packages that include 40-50in LED TVs, Sonos playbars and mood-lighting.Across the Thames at Surrey Quays, Galliard are specifically targeting investors with their offers at the Marine Wharf East development.Galliard are offering a three per cent discount, a service charge allowance plus a free parking space with three-bedroom apartments there.And in Shoreditch, at their Stage development, Galliard are offsetting the extra three per cent Stamp Duty surcharge that investors pay if buying additional residential properties within England, Wales and Northern Ireland.The Stage also has a unique history to it – the 37-storey tower will include 412 apartments designed around the remains of Shakespeare’s original Curtain Theatre.  Discover the joys of lodge life When it comes to holiday homes in Britain, park homes can work out very cost effective. Because of how they are constructed, they are often a lot cheaper than traditional bricks and mortar houses. And some are located in the most spectacular settings.One example is Palstone Lodges, in the pretty village of South Brent in Devon’s beautiful South Hams. The site includes a collection of contemporary cedar lodges set among landscaped grounds which boast more than 1,000 species of rare and exotic plants, trees and shrubs from around the world.          One example is Palstone Lodges, in the pretty village of South Brent in Devon’s beautiful South Hams (pictured) It extends to five and half acres on the edge of Dartmoor and, as the grounds were established more than 25 years ago, the plots have the privacy that a mature woodland setting can afford.Co-owner Matt Morgan grew up on the farm where the lodges now sit and has been planning the site for more than 30 years.Six lodges are currently available to buy, starting from £175,000 for a two-bedroom and rising to £255,000 for a three-bedroom lodge.Peter and Yvette Cheeseman, both retirees from Dorset, say they made a lifestyle investment when they purchased their Palstone lodge and claim their family now saves £10,000 a year on holidays.‘We had money available from our pension and we were trying to think about what we might be able to buy,’ says Peter.‘We liked the idea of escaping to Devon to get away from our busy lives in Dorset where I still have business interests and Yvette competes with her horses.’          Devon delight: One of the Palstone lodgesWhat really stood out for Peter and Yvette were the secluded plots the lodges were sat on and how they are exclusively for the use of owners, their friends and family only.‘That gave us the added confidence that we were making the right decision,’ says Peter. ‘It meant that we could have certainty and peace of mind that people buying at Palstone Lodges genuinely cared about their property and who stays there.’Peter and Yvette’s four children also enjoy their Devon bolt-hole. ‘For them, it’s a free holiday,’ says Peter. ‘We take pleasure in the fact that we’re giving them something special as part of our family unit.’Each plot has a 125-year licence and annual service charges of £2,750, plus VAT, which covers garden and grounds maintenance and general insurance. Each property is free from Stamp Duty and Council Tax.The lodges are designed as holiday homes and not places of permanent residence.          Regulars: Phil and Rebecca Grant with their children Rory and OscarRebecca and Phil Grant, from Harpenden in Hertfordshire, often come to their Palstone lodge with their children Rory and Oscar.‘For me, working in horticulture, the attraction came from the setting, with established planting and carefully curated landscaping,’ says Rebecca. ‘It seemed to suit us perfectly. We wanted a gentle, soft green space.’Since buying more than ten years ago, they have visited the lodge most months, taking extra time there in the summers.Rebecca and Phil have made good friends with the neighbours and even socialise with them away from Palstone Lodges. Rebecca feels this has been of vital importance to them, and even more so now they have a young family.‘When we visit now we know people are there, some of whom have become great friends, but we can’t hear or see them from our lodge,’ says Rebecca.‘It’s really nice to have a sense that everyone who has a home there wants a similar way of life.’"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/23/20/4D8F5E1300000578-5878161-image-a-39_1529781037200.jpg","title":"The downsizing lowdown make moving smaller home","story":"    Home comforts: The Greenhouse and Pavillion at Wadswick Green in WiltshireCraig Gibson, a partner at WDM Chartered Accountants, says: ‘Homes are a massive asset for people who have been committed to them for decades, so understanding your options is essential, especially when you’re selling.’And if you’re tempted to hand over your house or large chunks of money to your children, he says, ‘there are some ways to give your children cash or your home, but it’s very important to get good independent financial advice’. For instance, the annual allowance for tax-free gifts to children (or anyone else) is £3,000 per person. But parents can give up to £5,000 to children as wedding or civil-partnership gifts tax-free. Regular payments are exempt from inheritance tax, as long as they come from your income and not your savings and don’t significantly affect your lifestyle.When downsizing, it is important to consider what would be left to your children when you die.The inheritance-tax threshold currently stands at £325,000, and the rate payable on estates of more than that is 40 per cent of the amount above £325,000. The exception is if you are married, as you can pass your full estate to your spouse in the event of your death without paying inheritance tax. By doing this you also pass on your £325,000 inheritance-tax exemption, so £650,000 of your combined estate would then be free from inheritance tax.          Luxury living: One of Birchgrove\u0027s apartments in SidcupIf you go into residential care, you may have to sell your home to pay for it. One way to hold on to your home so you can pass the proceeds on to your children is to buy in a retirement development, like Wadswick Green in Wiltshire, where help is on hand for that care. However, exit fees that the development takes when you die will deplete any money you can pass on – as will service charges.Another option to free up money from your home is equity release. You have to be over 55 to go down this path, but it allows you to release money as a lump sum, or in several smaller amounts, or as a combination of both. And while equity-release products give you access to the cash in your home, they tend to be more expensive than regular mortgages and have associated fees. Triggering equity release may also affect your ability to claim state benefits.With so many people’s money in bricks and mortar – and with, these days, so many options available to those reaching retirement age – it’s no wonder that experts say it’s more important than ever before to look at ‘succession planning’.  Rent your way to riches In America, Australia and on the Continent, renting in retirement is much more popular than here. The British obsession with home ownership means we are keener than those in other countries to tie up our money in property.But there was 13 per cent increase in retired renters here between 2012 to 2016, according to the National Landlords Association, and Scottish Widows recently predicted figures will double to nine million by 2022.

Ms Ardern is set to make history as the first New Zealand Prime Minister to give birth while in the top seat          Following the birth, the government will be led by Winston Peters, 73, for six weeks. Ms Ardern (pictured at Polyfest in March) assured she would still be on call, and it would be business as usualDuring Ms Ardern\u0027s maternity leave, Mr Peters - the leader of the minority NZ First Party which forms part of New Zealand\u0027s coalition government - will have powers similar to those he would have if the prime minister was overseas.He will run the day-to-day operations in Wellington and will consult with Ms Ardern on \u0027significant political, strategic or public interest, or national security\u0027 matters.But he\u0027ll still be limited by the decisions of the Labour Party-dominated cabinet. Recent Newshub-Reid research polling found 39 per cent think Mr Peters will do a good job, the rest were either unsure or pessimistic.Often described as a populist, Mr Peters is the most experienced hand and one of the most iconic figures in the country\u0027s political landscape - but he is also polarising and has an often combative relationship with the media.He\u0027s formed coalition governments with both the centre-left and centre-right (playing the role of \u0027kingmaker\u0027 to leverage concessions out of the major parties), and since entering parliament in 1979 has held numerous senior cabinet posts, including deputy PM in the 1990s .

This series, developed from a film entitled Outremonde (Underworld) after the novel by Don DeLillo, was produced during the two months that Henno lived in Slab City in 2017. Even in an apocalyptic nightmare, Henno finds light: Revon and Michael become friends, then lovers after she introduces them, and Dave, a former drug- and alcohol-addicted evangelical pastor, creates a community vegetable patch in the desert.“I went back after a year and the bus in the picture was burned and Revon and Michael had gone their separate ways but the garden was growing,” Henno says. “There were even tomatoes.

These plaits and elaborate structures take anywhere between 30 minutes and five hours to create and can mark special occasions such as weddings and birthdays, denote a particular family or region or respond to political and artistic movements of the day. The acclaimed Nigerian photographer JD ’Okhai Ojeikere spent 40 years immortalising nearly 1,000 of these hairstyles, until his death in 2014. “Apart from being fascinated by their beauty and the artistic nature of each hairstyle, he documented them for posterity,” says his son, photographer Amaize Ojeikere. There is a danger, he adds, that these skills will be lost. “Particularly now the younger generation think it is ‘old-school’. That is one of the reasons the images were taken: to showcase the beauty of our people.” Structures of Identity will be at the Foam photography museum in Amsterdam from 29 June to 29 August.

Like her narrator, Mackmin grew up in a kind of commune in 1970s Norfolk. Both Mackmin and Nearly Thirteen had a poet father, a younger sister and an agoraphobic mother who drove a white Saab. Both were precocious, home-educated and excellent cooks. And both endured the spectre of abuse as they came of age in a rackety era of bohemian self-discovery.So the passage in Devoured in which Mummy runs out of Swallow’s Farm and bares her breasts in protest at a crop-spraying plane must, I assume, be true. “I made that up,” laughs Mackmin in triumph when we meet near her London home. “There are profound resonances with mine and my sister’s childhood, and massive acres of made-up stuff. I’d never written anything before and it was a visceral pleasure to invent stuff.”At this stage Mackmin is best known as a theatre director, acclaimed for productions of Tom Stoppard’s The Real Thing, Brian Friel’s Dancing at Lughnasa and a version of Arthur Miller’s The Crucible, as well as new plays by the likes of Amelia Bullmore and Charlotte Jones. Bullmore’s Di and Viv and Rose tackles themes of women and work, and it was when Mackmin became a mother seven years ago, adopting a child in her mid-40s, that she turned to writing.“I stopped work thinking, ‘Great, now I’m going to be a mum’, and I woke up the next morning thinking ‘Urrrgh, I am my work,’” she says. “This bomb had exploded in my heart – who was I if I wasn’t working?” Writing, she says, “was the rope that I threw myself – clambering up this slippery wet rope out of the horror of it all”.Mackmin had been “pretending” she was going to turn her “crazy childhood” into a novel for years and now, having a wakeful child, she began writing in three-hour nocturnal bursts. “I know this sounds very unlikely and pretentious but I really didn’t imagine a single other person reading this book,” she says. “I just knew I had to keep doing something in all those awake hours that was properly me.”It is Mackmin’s fourth creative career, and all have been self-taught except her first, acting, for which she studied at the Royal Central School of Speech and Drama. She and her sister Scarlett, a choreographer to whom Mackmin remains very close, then became clothes designers, successfully teaching themselves to make wraparound clothes that fitted both their contrasting body shapes. Mackmin believes everyone is creative, but her fending-for-herself childhood bequeathed her a bewildering array of practical skills. “I can sew, I can make my own clothes, I can make my own shoes, I can build a bonfire from nothing, I can drive a tractor. Rabbit skinning? Boom! Job done. Disgusting but I can do it,” she laughs.She took the same approach to writing as directing. Mackmin says she always knew she wanted to direct a new play if she read it and could visualise exactly how she would do it. She pictured Devoured this way too. Throughout the novel, the narrator, Nearly Thirteen, looks down upon herself, as if she’s directing herself. Speech appears before the speaker is identified, and sentences are staccato short. This style is as experimental as Mackmin’s childhood, and she isn’t sure whether to attribute it to a lack of formal education or her dyslexia. “There was an urgency of breath and rhythm in using short sentences. When I read it out to myself, I felt, ‘That’s. What. I. Thought. Like’ as a child.”Its originality ensured it was rejected by dozens of cautious publishers until it reached Henry Layte, the Norfolk-based publisher and bookseller who discovered and co-published Eimear McBride’s A Girl Is a Half-Formed Thing. “He gave one absolutely brilliant editorial note,” says Mackmin, suggesting “one big tweak. I will be grateful forever. He’s my kind of person. He’s funny and he’s direct to the point of almost rudeness which gives me enormous pleasure.” By coincidence, Layte lives a mile from where Mackmin grew up and loves cooking as much as she does.Devoured is rare among novels for being studded with recipes for everything from homemade glue to “chocolate idiot biscuits”. “They are all very good recipes,” says Mackmin – all from her childhood. Just as in Devoured, Mackmin’s father and mother and assorted friends were too busy making poetry or pots to cook for their children. “I could cook a six-course meal easily by the age of 10,” she says. “We didn’t know that we were running the house but we wanted to eat. Why would you not, if the ingredients are in the fridge and you’re starving and everybody else is too drunk or stoned?”Of all Devoured’s excoriating comic portrayals of wayward hippies, Nearly Thirteen’s Mummy – a matriarch who challenges norms of work, motherhood and marriage – is the most nuanced. One day, Nearly Thirteen hears a noise coming out of her bedroom like a lorry reversing. “Eurngh eurngh eurngh” Mummy is sleeping with other residents of Swallow’s Farm.Mummy is “a literary creation” says Mackmin, but her own mother, who recently died after developing Alzheimer’s, “inspired it, utterly and totally”. Two weeks before her mother died, Mackmin had a conversation with her in hospital. “I told her: ‘I’ve written a book, you are in it, it would’ve never happened without you, and I am so very grateful.’ She gave me one of those laser looks right to the back of my head, nodded, and turned away to carry on looking at an old bloke covered in trifle.” Could she have published Devoured if her mum was still alive? “I don’t know. Fortunately for us all, life doesn’t work like that. The origami shape of life allows things to be folded round a corner that you’re not quite sure about and then – ‘Oh look, I’ve made a swan.’”Devoured portrays a time when a generation of parents were preoccupied with their own liberation at the expense of providing children with the space or safety to be children. It is a funny book but an angry one too. “Yes, I have been angry but I’m not blameful,” says Mackmin. “I don’t blame my mum. My mum and indeed my dad were victims of that moment in history, of supposedly women’s emancipation and the psychotherapeutic generation – ‘oh me, me, me’ – putting themselves at the centre. Despite this ideology, they were still dragging behind them an idea of women where their bodies and sexuality were really the only thing that had any currency – and that’s what I was interested in.”Without giving too much away, one hippy befriends Nearly Thirteen in a way that today would be called grooming. I’m surprised when Mackmin says it’s not. “He’s doing what those adult children were doing – working out who he is by saying what he thinks in the moment. All of them are feeling themselves – feelings, feelings, feelings are everything. ‘I feel this and therefore I am,’ rather than ‘I feel this and therefore I’m going to think about it, and the cake I make out of the mix of those two will lead me forward.’”Did she experience abuse in her childhood? Mackmin speaks carefully. “I was around a reckless level of lack of care from the ‘adults’ to the children. I knew of too many children who were having sexual encounters with adults, far too many, and yes, it impacted upon me.”Mackmin believes she was saved from trauma by work, not therapy – and perhaps laughter too. She has poured all her good jokes, and knowledge of theatrical comedy, into Devoured. “Laughter is breath, it alters your being, and it allows you to move on, and keep living. I hope people find it funny but I hope they see that’s the point – it’s laughter as its most important function. It’s not just ‘ha ha ha, crazy hippies’, it’s ‘laugh or you’re going to end up full of bitterness and blame and picking the spot of your childhood forever.’”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c0d90db1981ea7443a0b757ba9f930dc382933bc/0_389_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1bef45b3c8d3d83c2516b11e8c61df5e","title":"black girl woman bible elizabeth uviebinene yomi adegoke slay your lane","story":"The bottling, she thought, would come in the form of a book – a bible no less – to offer black teenagers and women the kind of advice she would have liked to have received growing up, to help navigate her way to a bigger, freer life.The problem was that she was a marketing manager and not a writer. So the perfect person to write it, she decided, was her best friend, Yomi Adegoke, then also 22 and working at Channel 4. “Because Yomi’s a\u0026nbspjournalist, I thought she would write it and I would market it,” says Uviebinené. “But she sold the idea back to me to both write it together.”So that’s what they did. It did not matter that they were both working long hours in highly competitive careers – they wrote every evening and weekend for the next year. Nor that neither had written a book before – they simply Googled “how to write a book” and set up focus groups with friends to discover the breadth of what they needed to research.Taking the dictum to work twice as hard to get half as far as their white counterparts – which they believe is one of the only ways for black communities to succeed in Britain – they secured a book deal a year later, despite the outrageous odds against two black women with no inside connections to an overwhelmingly white, elitist publishing industry.It was not just any book deal either. Slay in Your Lane: The Black Girl Bible is arguably the book for 2018, fought for in a nine-way publishers’ auction with Uviebinené and Adegoke receiving – to their astonishment – a five-figure sum.Uviebinené was at work when she got the phone call from her agent. She hid in the office loos and made a breathless call to Adegoke. “I was trying to Whatsapp Yomi from the top of Canary Wharf tower, trying to explain what had just happened and I felt so overwhelmed.”Adegoke was celebrating her 25th birthday in Rio de Janeiro. “I had just broken up with a boyfriend and I wanted to go away after one year of working intensely. I was having a really great time and I’d lost my phone for the previous few days.”Both are 26 now. They met as 18-year-old freshers at the University of Warwick. There they found themselves marooned and misunderstood in an almost uniformly white environment that seemed unconsciously hostile. Adegoke took a year out from Warwick after suffering from depression (she turned this into a productive experience by founding a magazine titled Birthday).“Her confidence was mistaken for arrogance,” explains Uviebinené. “It was ‘us’ against everyone else.”“Yeah,” adds Adegoke, “We’ve both been through a lot. It’s one of the reasons we get on so well. There is a lot of respect there.”Both are of Nigerian heritage – Uviebinené’s father came to Britain when she was two (leaving behind her mother, from whom she is estranged) and she is the eldest of six children. Adegoke was born and raised in Croydon, south London, and has two sisters to whom she is very close. Uviebinené has become a kind of third sister: she moved in with Adegoke’s family in 2016 and has lived there since.The book looks at the mechanics of succeeding at school and in the workplace within a greater system that is structurally tilted against British black communities (they back this up with a barrage of statistical research). In it, they talk of the “concrete ceiling”, “impenetrable glasshouses”, the “long, back-door route into success” and of such flagrant bias at work that some black candidates have fared better by sending in job applications using aliases.They grapple with issues around health, dating and representation that are specific to black female experience. What is most impressive is the book’s penetrating research as well as its argument. “Well, if you are going to call a book ‘the black girl bible’, you have to do your research, and incorporate the full cross-section of black women’s concerns,” says Uviebinené.Adegoke nods vigorously. “In the past year and a half, our lives have been dedicated to making sure we get this right. It’s been the most challenging thing we’ve ever done. I don’t know that I would have a book deal without Elizabeth.”“We are each other’s champions,” Uviebinené shoots back. “Yomi is one of the most confident and articulate people I know.”There are many such tender exchanges. They are friends who seem more like sisters, though in temperament they are yin and yang. Uviebinené turns up bang on time and is calmly composed and earnest. Adegoke, who arrives late, is a whirlwind of energy. They do not talk over each other or finish each other’s sentences but seem to know what the other will say. Much of this sisterliness and fierce spirit of “strength in adversity” is channelled into their book. Uviebinené says it was written for her younger self, and all those girls and women who, like her in those formative years, are trying to figure out who they are in the world, and how they can succeed at life. “When I was 16, I’d write notes to myself every time things got hard on the type of person I wanted to be. I was always looking to what life held for me. So this book is about what I wanted to know when I was 16, and 18, and 21, that popular culture wasn’t telling me.” It also gives young black girls a host of role models or “cheerleaders” that the authors believe are badly needed. They interview 39 accomplished black women for their perspectives on success, from Malorie Blackman to Laura Mvula, June Sarpong, Denise Lewis, Jamelia, Margaret Busby and Estelle. Young girls need to “see it to be it”, they say, quoting Dr Karen Blackett, chair of MediaCom, from the book’s foreword, and such cheerleaders were not always visible while they were growing up.Uviebinené found inspiration in older women who accomplished great things, while for Adegoke, it came from closer to home. “My older sister, Yemisi, is a journalist for BBC Africa. She always told us dark skin was beautiful. She made sure we didn’t have issues around it. She was like a third parent, making sure we grew up confident.”Since Uviebinené’s lightbulb moment in 2015, the subject of ersity has exploded in publishing. Bestselling books by Reni Eddo-Lodge and Afua Hirsch have shown the industry that there is an immense appetite for a conversation around race and inequality in Britain.What do they feel about this moment? “Liz was trying to set the agenda, not follow it,” says Adegoke. “So we didn’t think: ‘This will work because black girls have traction right now.’”But they welcome the drive for better representation. “We see it as a blessing that our book has coincided with a trend for ersity,” says Adegoke. “We can see that just as it is in fashion now it can fall out of fashion. But then again, black women are not going anywhere. We don’t fall off the planet when we’re not in fashion. We’ll still here and we believe we’ve written a good book, and that people will read it, even if people get bored of ersity.”Is it relevant to non-black readers, too, and inspiring girls across the range? “I think non-black people should read it to understand the experience of what it means to be a black woman. I have been reading books that have not been written for me all my life,” says Adegoke.For Uviebinené, intersectionality is key in feminism: “You can sing from one voice but it’s also not as straightforward as that. You need to see your privilege for what it is first. Feminism for me is about gaining choices and breaking down the insidious structures that hold us back. White women tend to want to be more like white men in their privilege. I don’t want to be more like white women.”Do they think unequal structures are slowly being broken down, and that Britain is changing? After all, a mixed-race woman recently married into royalty. “I don’t think Meghan Markle massively marked a change. It’s Harry’s choice, not an institutional choice, though I do think she could be an agent of change for women,” says Adegoke. “But if Harry had brought home a girl who looked like us – black girls with kinky hair and big noses – it would be a very different conversation.”They swap a look again, a kind of signal that they have each other’s backs. What about boyfriends, I ask. Where do they sit within their friendship? “My boyfriend is basically a version of Liz – a short, dark-skinned Taurus.” Does he get on with Uviebinené? Adegoke shrugs as if this is a no-brainer. “They have to love her. Of course.”• Elizabeth Uviebinené and Yomi Adegoke will join Afua Hirsch for a  Live event on Wednesday 25 July at Kings Place, London N1• Slay in Your Lane: The Black Girl Bible is published next month by Fourth Estate (£16.99).

Aside from the occasional bit of scatological humour (scatology being the study of faeces … delightful), most of us happily steer away from regularly talking about it, for fairly obvious reasons.But, if you push past the initial icky revulsion of talking about human waste, you’d find out that it actually contains a vast amount of potential value in terms of energy, providing a sustainable form of fuel that we could all help supply.In 2015, research by the United Nations University found that human waste was a potential fuel source and if all of it was collected worldwide, annually it would be “great enough in theory to generate electricity for up to 138m households” – which is all of Indonesia, Brazil, and Ethiopia combined. An equivalent amount of natural gas would cost $9.5bn (£6.7bn).Poo-powered innovations are already happening, too. Earlier this year, a Worcestershire man made headlines when, fed-up with seeing bags littered across the scenic Malvern Hills, he designed a street lamp that runs on dog poo – two hours of light for every 10 bags of poo.There are companies across the UK that are also starting to explore the potential of poo power on a larger scale. Bristol-based renewable energy company GENeco is using sewage waste from the city to create green gas, which is then supplied to homes across the UK by Bristol Energy.“When sewage waste arrives at GENeco’s treatment plant in Bristol, it is treated and turned into what’s called ‘sludge’,” explains Bristol Energy renewables and origination manager Simon Proctor. “This forms the raw fuel for the anaerobic digestion plant.”During anaerobic digestion, organic matter – in this case, the sewage sludge – is broken down by microorganisms in an airtight container Proctor compares it to “the way a cow’s stomach breaks down grass”.This process produces methane-rich biogas, which is treated to remove impurities and ensure emissions are odour-free. The enriched biomethane is then injected into the gas distribution network. “It has the same quality as natural gas, and can be used in our homes as an alternative to fossil fuels,” Proctor says.The results are impressive. According to Bristol Energy, an average household’s weekly flushes could produce enough biomethane to cook a fry-up two weeks’ flushes could cook a roast dinner and annual flushes from every household in Bristol could fry 83m eggs.Biomethane was also used as fuel by GENeco to run a “Bio-Bus” shuttle to and from Bath and Bristol airport and also on a regular bus service within Bristol, aptly named the “number two route”. The bus travelled more than 180 miles on a tank of gas produced by the annual food and sewage waste of just five passengers.Sustainability is at the heart of the entire process. “Producing biomethane from sewage waste means that we don’t have to use fossil fuels,” Proctor says. “Burning fossil fuels is one of the biggest sources of CO2 emissions in the UK. Switching the average UK home to renewable energy can save more than 1.5 tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions a year, that’s equivalent to taking a car off the road for six months.”He also points out that while we can try to reduce other forms of waste, such as packaging, plastic or food, reducing the level of sewage waste “is obviously going to be more difficult” – making the process an important step towards a more sustainable world.Bristol Energy will also invest its profits back into the city, creating what Proctor calls a “circular economy”. “Sewage waste from Bristol is recycled into green gas our customers switch to a locally owned company and save money – and then our profits will go back into the local community,” he says.That doesn’t mean there aren’t drawbacks, however, particularly in terms of the adoption of the process. Installation and maintenance costs for anaerobic digestion systems can be high, and many companies have been forced to rely on government initiatives to keep running. Proctor says that support under such schemes has been “very ambiguous at times”, which could be, in part, what is preventing more companies from adopting similar systems.Prof Chris Metcalfe, director of the Institute for Watershed Science at Trent University in Canada, worked on the UN study into human waste. He believes that biogas should be considered a resource not only for energy production, but also as compost “for improving agricultural productivity” and for the recycling of water for irrigation.“In most cases, we’re wasting this resource by either putting the solids into landfill or by discharging the liquid sewage into lakes and rivers,” he says.The main issue, Metcalfe believes, is not the technology – in fact, he says there are no real technological barriers to the use of human waste as fuel. Instead, it’s “people’s attitudes about using human waste” that causes problems. “In many countries, the idea of collecting and using human waste is not culturally acceptable, even though animal manure is often used for biogas production,” Metcalfe explains.But Proctor says human waste is already being used more widely than we may think. This is evident across the world, where the process is increasingly being used to improve sanitation in developing countries. In India, where $20bn (around £14bn) of government funding has recently been put towards building sanitary toilets, social project SHRI (Sanitation and Health Rights India) uses an anaerobic biodisgestion system to provide electricity to pump ground water that is later filtered and sold, with profits paying for the ongoing maintenance of the toilets.It may not be glamorous, sexy or particularly futuristic it may still seem slightly icky. But it’s undeniable: whether it’s being used to fuel cars, buses or homes in the UK, or to improve sanitation conditions across the world, poo has the power to change lives.To find out more about how you can support green energy and save money on your bills, visit bristol-energy"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b8b134f4594db650d47ed65b39b74ba1ec9aaa70/0_66_3441_2065/master/3441.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1f2a02fcd64fb77685f60f5260b18d76","title":"huge hole in theresa mays spending pledge for the health service","story":"Every other government department is already cut to the bone, so just where will that £20bn a year for the NHS come from?One of the more sensible things that the Tories did during their otherwise terrible general election campaign last summer was not to make too many promises about tax. Though they never explicitly acknowledged that taxes might have to go up during this parliament, Theresa May and Philip Hammond signalled this could be so when they dropped many of the pledges inherited from David Thingy and George Whatnot. Anyone with a basic diploma in political semaphore could intuit that this meant that there was a strong possibility that taxes would rise.Possibility has turned into racing certainty. That is one conclusion we can draw from Mrs May’s announcement that there will be £20bn extra per year for the NHS by 2023. Even the magic money tree can’t produce that kind of cash without some watering by the taxman. This is more than the chancellor wanted to sign off on before Jeremy Hunt, the wily survivor as health secretary, managed to persuade the prime minister that money would be the most popular 70th birthday present\u0026nbspfor the NHS.While the new financial settlement is more generous than the chancellor wanted, the money is less than many analysts think the NHS needs if it is to handle the pressures of an ageing and growing population. A recent joint study by the Institute for Fiscal Studies and the Health Foundation suggests that the spending trajectory proposed by the government may only just about sustain a “status quo” NHS. So headlines suggesting the rise is “dramatic” are misleading, as is Mrs May’s rhetoric about a “profound transformation”. Spin today, repent at leisure. That is my free advice to her propagandists. Some of the hyperbolic descriptions attached to this extra money will do the government more harm than good in the long run if they excite anticipation of radical improvements that do not then materialise.That is one reason why the Conservatives would be foolish to imagine that they will get much credit. Another reason to doubt that there will be joyful whooping in hospital corridors is that there is no such thing as enough when it comes to NHS spending. Staff and users often express their love for the health service, but that is rarely accompanied by any gratitude towards the politicians in charge of it. The NHS received exceptionally enhanced funding when Tony Blair was in office. His big increment in spending did show up in improved provision, falling waiting times and record public satisfaction, but this did not guarantee a smooth ride for his health secretaries. On one memorable occasion, Patricia Hewitt got a torrid reception from the Royal College of Nursing when the annual convocation of the angels booed her like the devil.For Tories, it is invariably worse. Voters are inveterately suspicious of Conservative intentions towards the NHS. In the competition with Labour to be regarded as best for health, the most Tories can aspire to achieve is a position of “neutral”. Mr Cameron achieved that in opposition, only then to throw away the benefit of the doubt in government by allowing the Lansley reorganisation that no one had voted for and fewer understood.So the best-case scenario for the Conservatives is not that this money will be transformative of the NHS and public trust in the Tories. The most they can hope for is that the money will shore up a vulnerable flank by preventing a series of rolling and roiling health funding crises up to the next election. Labour will say the money is not enough. This might be true, but the public will be conscious, and may discount accordingly, that Labour always says the Tories are not spending enough on health. The Tory aim is to reduce the salience of health as a cause of public discontent and make it less probable that the state of the NHS will induce swing voters to support Labour rather than them at the next election.There is still a huge hole in the government’s plans. Where is the money going to come from? Jeremy Corbyn made a bit of a hash of posing this question at his most recent encounter with the prime minister. Asking where the money is coming from to pay for spending promises is not natural territory for the leader of the Labour party. That doesn’t make it a bad question and Theresa May has yet to come up with a coherent answer. She has suggested that some extra cash will be provided by a “Brexit idend”. And the tooth fairy is visiting me tonight, the moon is made of cheese and Elvis lives on Atlantis where he and Lord Lucan ride their pet unicorns. There is no “Brexit idend” for the NHS – or for anything else. Everyone knows this is a fantasy. The government has itself accepted the Office for Budget Responsibility’s forecast that the public finances will be weaker, not stronger, as a result of Brexit.It is generally supposed at Westminster that Mrs May made herself complicit in this Johnsonian fabrication in the hope that it will induce the hard Brexiters in her party to swallow some of the concessions she is going to have to make in the negotiations with the EU. Even if it has that effect, and I’m highly sceptical, it was foolish of Mrs May to parrot that most mendacious piece of Leaver baloney.So where will the money come from? It is hard to see how it can be found by cutting elsewhere. As I remarked a few weeks ago, there are significant spending pressures on other departments and electoral challenges for the Tories virtually across the spectrum of government activity. Sajid Javid has buried the truncheon with the Police Federation by as good as telling them that he’ll be fighting the Treasury to secure improved funding. There is Tory backbench pressure to relieve the squeeze on school budgets. Gavin Williamson has already fallen out with the chancellor over the condition of the armed forces and the defence secretary now seems to be going to war with the prime minister as well. Local government has already had central government support slashed by nearly a half since 2010. There’s nothing left to cut from housing and transport.The chancellor indicated his irritation with the health\u0026nbspsettlement by telling the cabinet that the bill for Mr Hunt’s boost will be paid for by the rest of them with a continuing clamp on all other departmental budgets. The Treasury then briefed the media that other spending ministers will remain strapped in austerity straitjackets. Good luck to the chancellor with holding that line if he does not have the reliable support of the prime minister.She edged towards candour when she acknowledged that taxes are going to rise “across the nation” while claiming this would happen “in a fair and balanced way”. What she didn’t say is which taxes. In this case, it is not because she is being dishonest, but because she simply doesn’t know. A hypothecated health tax has been shot down. The Treasury hates that concept and there are big problems with linking NHS funding to the ebbs and flows of the economy. A wealth tax is an idea that has been gaining support among some Tories. They favour it both for the revenues it could produce and because asking for a larger contribution to the exchequer from asset-rich baby boomers might be represented as an act of intergenerational fairness. The obvious target of a wealth tax is property, but that is politically perilous, as Mrs May discovered when the “dementia tax” blew up her campaign during the last election. There are a lot of affluent baby boomers with property wealth among Tory members and MPs.One way to bring in more is to freeze income tax thresholds. The Treasury has often used this as a sneaky method of harvesting extra revenue. But Tory MPs are alert to that, many do not like it and it would breach one of the tax promises that they did commit to in their last manifesto. Any kind of tax rise sticks in the throat of many Tories. Hiking taxes is not what they think they came into politics to do. Getting tax increases through parliament will be additionally tough when the government lacks a majority.Mrs May has made this dilemma even thornier by separating the announcement of the extra spending for the NHS from Mr Hammond’s next budget, which is not until November. Five months will have passed by then and the extra health funding will be a fading headline, while tax rises will be a live and hot issue of the day.The health service may have been promised its birthday present, but it has been bought on political tick.\u0026nbspWe still don’t know who will pay for it. Neither does\u0026nbspthe prime minister or the chancellor."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7818df2c1f85a045e74b64e9a6d885085b83372b/0_0_4608_2765/master/4608.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f3a0c6ed61028481608a49393513a6ae","title":"coral reefs overwhelmed by rising oceans","story":"Scientists have uncovered a new threat to the world’s endangered coral reefs. They have found that most are incapable of growing quickly enough to compensate for rising sea levels triggered by global warming.The study suggests that reefs – which are already suffering serious degradation because the world’s seas are warming and becoming more acidic – could also become overwhelmed by rising oceans.Sea levels rose by several inches over the past century and measurements indicate the speed of this increase is now rising significantly. Two key factors are involved: climate change is making ocean water warmer and so it expands. And as ice sheets and glaciers melt, they increase amounts of water in the oceans.At the same time, reefs are being weakened by ocean warming and also by ocean acidification, triggered as more and more the seas absorb more and more carbon dioxide. These effects lead to bleaching events that kill off vast stretches of coral and limits their ability to grow.“Our predictions, even under the best case scenarios, suggest that by 2100 the inundation of reefs will expose coastal communities to significant threats of shoreline change,” said co-author Prof Peter Mumby of Queensland University.This point was backed by US marine scientist Ilsa Kuffner writing in a separate comment piece for Nature. “The implications of the study are dire.

He was taken aback when publishers snapped up his first novel and turned it into a bestseller in 2016. Now he has had the “surreal” experience of watching Sir Ian McKellen and Dame Helen Mirren bring his characters to life in a major Warner Bros film adaptation of that debut book.The Good Liar, a thriller full of twists and turns, tells the story of ageing conman Roy, who preys on a wealthy widow, Betty, after meeting her online. Searle, who describes himself as “60, but a baby in the writing business”, told the Observer that watching such a dream cast flesh out his characters has been extraordinary.“Perhaps it’s me as a star-struck author.”He added: “The performances are just so strong. They bring the whole thing to life. When one reads the screenplay, one sees the gaps, but one doesn’t realise quite how the actors and the director fill the gaps between the lines. That’s the absolute magic of acting.“Betty in the book appears at the beginning to be quite a light-hearted, almost ditzy character, but all the time – and this was my aim, at least – you’re conscious that there’s rather more to her... That’s exactly what Helen brings to the part.” The film is directed by Bill Condon, who worked with McKellen on Gods and Monsters and Mr Holmes. Searle said: “I’m absolutely flabbergasted, both with the two stars and to have such a strong director.”He began his novel on a course run by Curtis Brown, the leading literary agency. Once finished, he submitted it to the agency’s joint chief executive, Jonny Geller,whose authors include John le Carré.Geller responded to it immediately. Describing it as “absolutely brilliant”, he said: “I sold it to Penguin and around the world and it went on to sell 100,000 copies in paperback last year. So it did really well.”He added: “It’s about an elderly man who finds love on a website… A slightly oddball romance begins. Then you realise something’s just not right about this… There are loads of twists. It’s very clever.”It is all a world away from Searle’s previous career, which he will only describe as working “in the sphere of security and intelligence”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b221146a21bfecfa7fa5f90431ab0b10649f58b4/0_230_4917_2952/master/4917.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bbdde9865bb1b0d6064a45e0608552a9","title":"overboard remake sunk by unseaworthy performances","story":"This new version of the Goldie Hawn amnesia comedy sadly forgets to make sure the principals have any chemistryWith so much fundamentally wrong in the world right now, it’s probably a misuse of energy to care too much about Overboard.

Anna Faris plays Kate, an overworked single parent who cons amnesiac yacht owner Leonardo (Eugenio Derbez) into thinking he is her husband. Then, accompanied by a ferociously jolly score that sounds as though it was recorded by a demonically possessed klezmer band, she effectively uses him as slave labour, kitchen skivvy and on-tap childcare. Although Faris is not in the role originally played by Hawn (Goldie was the spoilt heiress to Russell’s widowed carpenter), she channels her predecessor’s acting style, going all out with the bubbly, goofy ditz act.

Was he cross? Not in the slightest. Was he bemused by the way it had been whipped up? Absolutely. “It’s a bonkers environment, isn’t it?” he asked, nursing a dislocated shoulder, supposedly at war with the England press corps and fending off questions from a Chinese journalist about the “hilarious” and “ridiculous” mistakes of England’s footballers through the ages, Raheem Sterling in particular.A degree of sanity is needed because England remains a largely stress-free camp and Southgate – previously part of the England travelling media – is not, as purported, in a huff with anyone. He explained his views on the reporting of his possible team, starting with an acceptance that he wished he had worded Friday’s comments differently. There is no row. There never was – “I’m totally relaxed,” the manager said – and it was probably a relief for everyone once he had put it to bed and we could start talking about football again, the old-fashioned way.England will, after all, qualify for the knockout stages, with a game to spare, if they can cope with the punishing heat and a muscular Panama side in their second assignment of Group G. That cannot be sniffed at bearing in mind it would be only the third time that England have won their opening two fixtures in a major tournament, dating back to 1950. The last occasion was the 2006 World Cup when Sven-Göran Eriksson’s team beat Paraguay and Trinidad and Tobago. Before that, it was 1982 and back-to-back wins for Ron Greenwood against France and Czechoslovakia.Otherwise, England have not managed it in 21 other tournaments, which leaves the current manager wondering sometimes why the expectations are always so high. “It goes back to what I’ve always said to the lads,” Southgate said. “There’s a perception that England have always been hugely successful. When you dig deeper, our history is actually different.”England’s total of six knockout wins in major tournaments since 1966 emphasises the point again. The message from Southgate was that it was time for his players to create their own history, rather than being weighed down by what had happened in the past, and he can certainly be encouraged by the number of chances his team created against Tunisia in their opening game.Dele Alli will be missing because of his thigh injury but Southgate has everyone available, the most pressing issue being whether he perseveres with Raheem Sterling or opts for Marcus Rashford to play alongside Harry Kane.The downside is that England would have to win by six goals to overtake Belgium at the top of the group on goal difference. Far more likely, Roberto Martínez’s side will need a draw to win the group when England take them on in Kaliningrad on Thursday. In that scenario, England would play their first knockout tie in Moscow against the winner of Group H, where Japan and Senegal have won their opening fixtures. Yet Martínez’s declaration that he will make a number of changes against England, with Romelu Lukaku and Eden Hazard among the players likely to be rested, adds another element of intrigue.Not that England should be thinking too far ahead when Panama have the potential to be awkward opponents, with temperatures of 30C (86F) forecast and the locals here warning that the glass panels of the stadium will make it feel much hotter.On that front, Southgate said there was “no physiological benefit to train in the heat the couple of weeks before and think there will be an adaptation”. He sounded like he meant it but it is a concern behind the scenes. The advice given to Southgate was that England should acclimatise in a hot area and England had initially identified a hotel in the Black Sea resort of Gelendzhik. The decision to base themselves in Repino, where it has been 16C to 18C, surprised a number of officials at the Football Association. The heat in Nizhny Novgorod is fierce, to say the least.All of which increases the importance of England’s players to move the ball well and make sure their opponents expend energy trying to win it back. “We’ve done a lot of due diligence on Panama over the last few months, watching all their qualifiers and all their matches since,” Southgate said. “We don’t expect too many surprises in terms of how they play.”One danger will be Panama’s tactic of long throw-ins. England have been practising how to combat that in training but Southgate has also stressed the importance of not giving away free-kicks in dangerous areas, noting the number of set-piece goals so far.“I studied Germany a lot from the previous World Cup and one of the big things was they didn’t concede fouls in their third of the pitch. They were incredibly low numbers. We’ve been consistently doing that over a period of time because the quality of every team these days on set plays is high.”As for the hullabaloo about a photographer taking a picture of Holland’s notes during an open session for the media on Friday, Southgate made his position clear. “I totally understand the media have a role to report the news\u0026nbsp…\u0026nbspI don’t expect the media to be supporters of us in terms of the way they work. They’re here to work. I know they want us to do well. That’s been clear through the tournament.”The headlines, indeed, will be kind if England can achieve their aim in the oppressive heat."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8eec94e40c38eadcf5d6f58a263cac7f4ca4740c/0_202_3000_1799/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=287a03854f566c37d5f65d4ab694509f","title":"toni kroos germany sweden world cup match report","story":"Joachim Löw had been asked about the curse of world champions past. Three of the previous four World Cup winners had exited at the group phase – France (2002), Italy (2010), Spain (2014) – and the Germany manager knew his team stood to be the next. After the debacle that had been the defeat against Mexico in the opening Group F tie, the pressure was on. It pulsed against German temples because everybody knew that Sweden were likely to be a tough nut to crack. Their goalkeeper, Robin Olsen, had entered the game having not conceded since October last year.It was pretty much win or bust for Germany because even a draw would have left them without control of their destiny in the final round of group matches. On a wild night, they once again showed their defensive frailties and it was a glaring example of their indiscipline when Jérôme Boateng, who had been booked, leapt into a reckless 85th-minute tackle on Marcus Berg to leave his team with 10 men.But at the other end, they attacked with abandon during a thrilling second half and, with 18 seconds of the five minutes of stoppage time remaining, they got their reward, their reprieve. The angle to the left of the penalty area looked to be too tight for Toni Kroos as he stood over a free-kick. But he made it slightly better by touching the ball to Marco Reus, who gave it back and what happened next was a contender for goal of the tournament.Kroos’s technique was flawless, the bend on the shot wicked and it fizzed beyond Olsen into the far, top corner. Germany roared Sweden were broken, even though a win over Mexico in their final game would see them qualify, and there were angry scenes upon the full-time whistle, as the rival benches clashed.“Some of the German bench celebrated by running in our direction and rubbing it into our faces by making gestures and that really got me annoyed,” Janne Andersson, the Sweden manager, said. “We fight it out for 95 minutes and then you shake it out and leave so I was very angry. People behaved in ways that you do not do. This is probably the most crushing end to a game I’ve\u0026nbspexperienced.”It was a result that got away from Sweden because, make no mistake, they could have been home and hosed at the interval, after a first half in which they scored through Ola Toivonen and might have had more. There was the highly contentious decision on 12 minutes not to award them a penalty after Boateng had pushed Berg when he was the last man, which looked to be the wrong call and the impression would only be strengthened with each TV replay. Don’t mention the VAR. The video assistants did not come into play.Löw was brave and fortune favoured him. He had made four changes from the Mexico game – the most eye-catching of which were the omissions of Sami Khedira and Mesut Özil – and he lost the former’s replacement, Sebastian Rudy, to a broken nose after half an hour. Rudy was bloodied after being caught, inadvertently, by Toivonen.Löw introduced Mario Gomez for the second half, with Timo Werner moving to the left wing and Thomas Müller pushing up as a second striker, and he and his players threw everything into the salvage operation. The sense of adventure was pronounced.Jonas Hector, the left-back, wandered into an inside-forward position at times and Löw’s final move in the 87th minute was dramatic. He withdrew Hector, despite being a man down, and sent on the attacking midfielder Julian Brandt, who promptly rattled a post with a ferocious drive. Joshua Kimmich and Antonio Rüdiger were the only recognised defenders on the pitch at the end. Thanks to Kroos, the gamble paid off.Kroos had been the villain for Germany in the first half. He gave the ball away, uncharacteristically, to Berg and, when it was worked wide, Viktor Claesson crossed for Toivonen. The striker took an excellent first touch on his chest and the second was even better – a glorious lob that gave Manuel Neuer no chance.Germany played on the front foot but the worry for Löw was how threatening Sweden looked in the first half on the counterattack how easily they carved apart his team. It was extraordinary to see a German defence in such open and obliging mood.The penalty controversy followed a simple pass that set Berg clean through – the chasing Boateng not only shoved him, he also appeared to trip him – and when Emil Forsberg drove an opening on 44 minutes, he had two yellow shirts in glorious positions. Where were the defenders? He picked out Claesson but he decided against the first time shot, which was a bad move. Hector got across to tackle. Berg also worked Neuer with a glancing header.Germany had gone close early on through Julian Draxler and Hector while the substitute Ilkay Gündogan extended Olsen with a deflected long-ranger but they were a different team after half-time.Reus, who more than justified his selection ahead of Özil, got the equaliser from Werner’s cross and it was all Germany. Reus could not flick home with a trailing leg from Kimmich’s lovely cross Werner lifted high and, after Andreas Granqvist had extended Neuer at the other end, the 10 men almost snatched it only for Olsen to tip over from Gomez’s header. The sting in the tale was still to come."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dfb5b674c267a7ed098018df204166e12cff4a51/177_0_4641_2785/master/4641.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9f851d9f7e0e3eb674a4a72dee2d644a","title":"xhaka and shaqiri goal celebrations bring balkan politics to world cup","story":"Fifa has opened disciplinary proceedings against Switzerland’s Granit Xhaka and Xherdan Shaqiri after they celebrated their goals during a 2-1 World Cup win over Serbia in Kaliningrad by performing an Albanian nationalist symbol.Xhaka and Shaqiri, who are of Albanian-Kosovan heritage but were raised in Switzerland, put their hands together to form what looked like a double-headed eagle similar to the one on the Albanian flag. The gestures risked inflaming political tensions in the Balkans among Serbian nationalists and ethnic Albanians. Kosovo is a former Serbian province that declared independence in 2008. Serbia does not recognise Kosovo’s independence and relations between the two countries remain tense.The Serbian FA lodged a formal complaint on Saturday, with football’s governing body later confirming that Arsenal’s Xhaka and Shaqiri of Stoke are both under investigation. A preliminary investigation has also begun into alleged comments made by the Serbia coach, Mladen Krstajic, after the match, while disciplinary proceedings have also been opened against the Serbian FA “for crowd disturbance and the display of political and offensive messages.”Shaqiri, who was born in Kosovo, played with the Kosovan flag stitched to one boot and the Swiss flag stitched on the other. Xhaka’s parents are from Kosovo and are of Albanian heritage. The Arsenal midfielder’s father was imprisoned and beaten in the former Yugoslavia for campaigning in favour of Kosovan independence and his brother Taulant plays for Albania’s national team.Jovan Surbatovic, the secretary general of the Serbian FA, had earlier said he would write to world football’s governing body regarding “the case of the boots, a question of several controversial flags and the celebration of both goals for Switzerland”. Fifa rules do not directly contemplate punishment for showing a national flag but, according to its disciplinary code, sanctions can be handed out for “provoking the general public”. If found guilty, players can be banned for up to two games. Fifa was approached for comment but has not responded. Xhaka and Shaqiri have suggested their actions were not provocative.“Frankly, my opponents did not interest me at all,” Xhaka said. “It was for my people, who always supported me. For those who did not neglect me, in my homeland, where my parents’ roots are. These were purely emotions.”Shaqiri, who plays for Stoke City, admitted that he was not allowed to talk about “politics” and insisted the celebration was “just emotion”. As he went through the stadium’s mixed zone he grew irritated at the questioning, replying “let’s not talk about this” and walking out when again asked what the significance of the celebration was.“It was a fantastic goal, an important goal for my team and I am very proud I was able to score it for them,” Shaqiri said. “I can’t discuss the gesture I’m afraid. We are footballers, not politicians… Emotions sometimes take over footballers and there was a lot of emotion out there.” He acknowledged it was “a very special game for some players”. Among the Switzerland team that started against Serbia, Valon Behrami is also of Kosovan heritage.Those players had been whistled by a crowd in which it appeared most Russians in the stadium supported Serbia. There were chants of “Serbia-Russia! Serbia-Russia” and a banner declared the two countries “brothers”.After the match, Switzerland’s coach, Vladimir Petkovic, said: “It’s clear that emotions show up and that’s how things happen. I think we all together need to steer away from politics in football and we should focus on this sport as a beautiful game and something that brings people together.” Krstajic was less magnanimous when asked about the decision not to award a penalty to Aleksandar Mitrovic in the second half. “We were robbed,” he said. “I wouldn’t give him either a yellow or red card, I would send him to the Hague. Then they could put him on trial, like they did to us.”Krstajic also posted photographs from the match on his Instagram account, accompanied by the comment: “Unfortunately, it seems that only the Serbs are condemned to a selective justice, once (it was) the damned Hague and today in football the VAR...”The Serbian press officer angrily intervened to prevent what he called “political” questions when Serbia’s Nemanja Matic was asked what he made of the celebration. He threatened to report journalists for doing so.The buildup to the match had seen exchanges between Serbia players and Shaqiri. Mitrovic, who scored Serbia’s goal, asked: “If he loves Kosovo so much and decides to flaunt the flag, why did he refuse a chance to play for their team?” There were a couple of clashes between the pair on the pitch too. At one point, Mitrovic leant forward to say something to Shaqiri when he was on the floor, covering his mouth with his hand as he did so. “I didn’t understand, maybe he spoke Serbian to me,” Shaqiri said. “I had told him already to keep calm and do his job… Of course the Serbian fans were whistling, that’s normal, no? We knew it was going to come but we kept calm. Both teams played with respect and that’s important.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58dcd5e3088812b0b6d436121f26a8d50bcbe663/6_176_3491_2094/master/3491.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9e2ba3dcecdfbfc92c7c4400eb5e2d46","title":"world cup low goals count financial inequality lack of time","story":"Low strike rate has its roots in the bunker mentality created by the growing gulf between rich and poor and the lack of time more talented teams have to develop attacking tacticsIt did not take long – it never does – for all the pre‑tournament hype to sink into grumbling that this is the worst World Cup ever. The pattern repeats, sooner or later, at every major tournament. Perhaps it is simply the surfeit of football – it’s very easy to consume too much and end up feeling nauseated – or the glum realisation that all the wallcharts and sticker albums in the world cannot disguise the fact that if you have 32 teams at the tournament, most of them are not going to be very good.The dearth of goals is the obvious complaint. As of Friday night, there had been 2.33 per game. By comparison, there were 3.21 per game in the Champions League last season and 2.67 in the Premier League. The lowest average for a World Cup is the 2.21 of 1990.Whether that makes this a poor tournament is a slightly different question: World Cups tend to be defined as much by their storylines and drama as by the actual quality of the football and so far there has been plenty of that – from Julen Lopetegui’s pre-tournament sacking to Russia’s discovery of some unexpected form to the struggles of Argentina.But goals, clearly, are an issue. The pattern has been clear for at least three decades and is predictable and natural. The lack of time available to coaches mean that they, naturally, make a priority of defensive structures over attacking ones: while an under-drilled attack can always conjure a goal from nothing, an under-drilled defence will always concede. Besides, defensive principles are relatively universal much less adaptation is required than for attacks that can vary wildly.The result is that teams attack with less fluency and pace than they do in the club game – each pass takes a fraction of a second longer because moves have not become instinctive – which in turn makes it easier to defend against them.Then there is the mismatches that regularly occur in international football leading to a tendency for one team to dig in, packing players behind the ball and denying the opposition space. That makes attacking extremely difficult, particularly for teams that lack the polished interaction sides display at club level. Iran’s performance against Spain was a classic of its kind, a narrow back four and five midfielders often becoming a 6-3-1 that stifled more gifted opposition for most of the game.It is no coincidence that the two sides that have set their defensive line deepest – Mexico, eschewing their usual pressing game against Germany, and Iceland, playing to type against Argentina – were also those that achieved the most eye-catching results.That is not to blame those sides, who have a duty to do what they can within the laws of the game to achieve the best possible result. But it is perhaps to wonder how dangerous the pattern is for the general spectacle. It is an issue that has faced the World Cup for some time and will become even more prevalent after the expansion to 48 teams. It is an issue in football generally as the gulf between rich and poor grows ever greater and matches even within the same league become ever more unbalanced.Certainly, the low scoring at the World Cup should not be taken as evidence of increasing equality between the continents, a subject on which Iran’s coach, Carlos Queiroz, was surprisingly animated. “In Asia, the development process is struggling at both national and youth level and by that I mean absolutely everything. It means coach education, youth development, infrastructure, facilities – everything – Europe is taking off and the others are being left behind.“The only nations that are able to compete in the World Cup are those with luck and those who are able to play for clubs in Europe, and that’s not just in Asia but also Africa and elsewhere. People point to Morocco or Senegal as strong African nations, but what they really are is African players playing in Europe.“I’ve been coaching for 37 years and I can tell the gap between Europe and the rest is only growing. Eight years ago it was bad, four years ago worse and now it’s even worse.”By Europe, he means not every Uefa nation but those four or five who financially dominate to the extent that they absorb almost every gifted player. And that means more one-sided games of one team going into the bunker and, as the Russian journalist Vasily Utkin said of Iceland, looking to do no more than “resist fire from artillery weapons”.Of more progressive football there has been little at this tournament, with the one side that promised something new, Argentina, never quite embracing the 2-3-3-2 blueprint of Jorge Sampaoli and collapsing into anarchy as they tried to operate a back three against Croatia. The revolutionary shape – actually just a 4-4-2 diamond with very attacking full-backs – was an ambitious attempt to reconcile Sampaoli’s hard-pressing principles with a sluggish defence.But instilling radicalism at international level is all but impossible in the time available. That Sampaoli did with Chile was largely the result of years of preparation by Marcelo Bielsa.Lionel Messi had warned that the 3-4-3 shape did not suit him because it naturally drew defenders into his zone and so it proved while the insistence on having the wing-backs push high meant that, as against Iceland, Argentina were desperately vulnerable on the flanks.Sampaoli could play like that with Chile because his side pressed well enough to drive the opponent back. Argentina lacked the pace, the organisation and perhaps even the inclination to do so. The lesson was hard-learned, but this is international football: only in very specific circumstances, with settled squads and a long-term plan, can teams attempt anything tactically complex or look to press with anything like the sophistication and drive of club sides.Against that is the tendency of national sides to focus on one key player. That has worked well for Portugal and rather less effectively for others teams, particularly those less box-focused players who can be crowded out by massed midfields (Messi with Argentina, Neymar with Brazil, Robert Lewandowski with Poland).But this is the fundamental difficulty of international football that remains, emphatically, a team game, but where attacking is left to iniduals, defences prevail and the goals dry up."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ca5e7a828ebdc004dce9493a2dc7ab6162bf6675/0_150_3872_2323/master/3872.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1d6dcaf121f3b22e49df71b3b65141af","title":"world cup team so far cristiano ronaldo","story":"Standing at 1.93 metres (6ft 4in) Beiranvand commands his box well while showing the reflexes and strong hands to make improbable saves, such as the one that denied Hakim Ziyech against Morocco or the double-stop from a Sergio Busquets shot against Spain. The only time the ball has beaten him was not from a shot, but a ricochet off Diego Costa. Group stage performance rating 8Left-back was a problem position for Senegal before the tournament but their manager, Aliou Cissé, solved the puzzle against Poland by moving the erstwhile right-back, Youssouf Sabaly, to the left and entrusting their right-back slot to Wagué, an inexperienced 19-year-old. The teenager justified that decision with an immaculate performance, helping his country to a famous win. Rating 6A powerful and composed bulwark in the heart of Switzerland’s defence, the 22-year-old ensured Gabriel Jesus barely featured when the Swiss held Brazil. Aleksandar Mitrovic did his utmost to avoid him when the Swiss played Serbia: the striker bullied Switzerland’s other centre-back, Fabian Schär, but came off second best whenever Akanji was close to him. Rating 7Outstanding in the win over Colombia, who were reduced to 10 men but still exerted plenty of pressure, which Yoshida helped to repel, negating any aerial threat from the South Americans. He was also a menace when he went forward for set pieces. An honourable mention must also go to Croatia’s Dejan Lovren. Rating 7Mexico’s lightning counter-attacks against Germany were joyous to behold and Gallardo was often involved, combining slickly down the left with the goalscorer, Hirving Lozano. His attacking potency does not come at the expense of defensive stability. Rating 7Herrera called the shots in the win over Germany. An all-rounder, he was the conduit of attacks thanks to his precise passing and also the leader in defence, making more tackles than anyone against the defending champions, combining the roles well by setting up the goal after hustling the ball from Sami Khedira. Rating 7An artful and industrious linchpin for Croatia, he deservedly rounded off the scoring during the dismantling of Argentina, having previously starred in the win over Nigeria. His determination, imagination and technique help make his side solid while enabling their attacks to flow. Rating 9The Watford player should not have featured against Portugal after being knocked out in a collision while playing at right-back during the narrow defeat to Iran. But he started, all the same, even throwing away his protective head wear as if it was holding him back, and showed his versatility – not to mention his strength and skill – by excelling in a more attacking role when moved further forward, tormenting the left‑back, Raphaël Guerreiro, from start to finish. Rating 7His precise and nimble scheming is perhaps Croatia’s greatest weapon, a key part of what makes them genuine contenders. His goal against Argentina, following a penalty in the win over Nigeria, was one of the best of the tournament so far. Rating 9A month after his 22nd birthday the elegant midfielder has been confirmed as a national treasure in Russia, his creative skills being instrumental to the hosts’ early surprise successes at this tournament. He has made things happen around him without ever being predictable and played at a level that suggests he will be moving on shortly from CSKA Moscow. Rating 8His hat-trick against Spain had an element of luck but, then again, is it really a coincidence that the normally flawless David de Gea made an uncharacteristic mistake while attempting to save a shot from Ronaldo? Or that Morocco’s usually tight defence disintegrated when Ronaldo ed in for the winning goal. He makes his own luck and, at 34, still sets the standard for all others.

Here’s more on the US site, which is better known for its baseball coverage.So Gareth Southgate opts to keep faith with the brilliant Raheem Sterling, instead of replacing him with the brilliant Marcus Rashford. It wasn’t a bad dilemma to have, was it? Here’s Daniel Taylor on the cautious optimism in the England camp.BREAKING NEWS. Here’s how England will be lining up this afternoon against Panama, courtesy of our man Dominic Fifield.Raheem Sterling is to retain his place in the England lineup for this afternoon’s Group G game against Panama, with Gareth Southgate set to make a solitary change - Ruben Loftus-Cheek for the injured Dele Alli - for the matchin Nizhny Novgorod.While Steve Holland’s training notes, photographed at an open session on Thursday, had appeared to indicate Marcus Rashford might get the nod up front alongside Harry Kane, Sterling will partner the captain against the side ranked 55 in the world. The Manchester City forward is aiming to score his first goal for his country since October 2015, 21 caps ago, as England seek to secure qualification from the section.Ashley Young has again been preferred to Danny Rose at left wing-back, while Loftus-Cheek will make his first World Cup start as Alli continues his rehabilitation from a thigh strain. The Spurs midfielder is hopeful of proving his fitness ahead of Thursday’s final group game against Belgium in Kaliningrad.So, good old Germany, eh. But they’re not resting on their laurels. Despite that victory over the Swedes, they’re planning to make some more changes for their final must-win group game over South Korea. “My players were tired at the end of the game and Marco Reus had cramps as early as 10 minutes before the end,” says Joachim Loew. “Jerome Boateng is suspended and Sebastian Rudy broke his nose. We will need a couple of days to recover. Rudy could potentially play on Wednesday but we will need to wait and see. Mats Hummels is likely to play and if he does then we have another option in defence.” Thanks to Jonathan. Swedish fatalism, anyone?Speaking of that cuppa, I can hear the kettle boiling, which must mean Scott Murray is due any second now. As always, thank you for your company and engagement. I’ll see you again here soon.“Morning Jonathan!” Morning David Penney (not the David Penney we established yesterday, but still a David Penney). “Stir-fry this in your mind-wok! Brazil’s success in every World Cup over the past 25 years has been directly proportional to the quality and form of their No. 9 at the time. Discuss.”Over to you dear reader. I’m off for a cup of tea soon, so I’ll leave you lot to figure out if Mr Penney is onto something or not. Allegations of doping continue to bubble beneath the surface of the World Cup. The Mail on Sunday has today published a story suggesting a Fifa cover-up.Have you selected your all-time England XI yet?While the circulation of what may prove to be England’s XI has caused conniptions in some quarters, Panama coach Hernán Darío Gómez doesn’t know what all the fuss is about.Northern Ireland manager Michael O’Neill believes England will overcome Panama but warns they must be aware of the passion the Central Americans will bring to the contest.They are well organised, they get men behind the ball, but beyond that, they play with a great pride this is a massive thing for them. When we played, the ground was virtually sold out, there were fireworks before the game, kids on the pitch and all sorts going on. You quickly realised what a big moment this is for them, to be in the World Cup. So they’ll play with a great passion. You saw that in the first half against Belgium. It was obvious from the start that these guys would defend for their lives and it took a bit of brilliance to open that game up. Belgium had huffed and puffed a little bit.”If long-lens cameras are to be believed Ruben Loftus-Cheek is due a World Cup start. Dominic Fifield has filed this lovely profile of a young man who once made an admiring Michael Ballack ask “Who the hell is that kid?”There are concerns England’s cool-climate training base could leave them unprepared for the heatwave facing them in Nizhny Novgorod. As dawn breaks over Blighty, time to turn some attention to England’s clash with Panama later today.Seth Levine wants a right to reply on the VAR debate. “With respect to @cricketingview’s, err, view, the clue to the suitability of the “probable cause” test in American criminal law is in the title. The “clear and obvious error” test makes perfect sense if used for overturning a decision. It makes no sense as a referral test. I’d be quite happy with a “probable cause” type referral system, as the on-field referee would not then run to the screen with the knowledge that the VAR has already deemed there to be a clear and obvious error.”There’s further explanation over @cricketingview’s Twitter page, expanding on their post below. I think we might park VAR for a while. On the subject of wine, the pod described the shorts on Meixco’s away kit as burgundy. There was then a comment that not many kits contain burgundy (Northampton Town highlighted as exception). Which got me thinking about the high-profile clubs with claret in their colours and how claret and burgundy are near-enough the same product (come at me sommeliers!). It struck me as a curio that the minor differences between a pinot noir grape and a cabernet sauvignon grape could have repercussions in the world of football.Mark Pulham has a suggestion that Fifa has so-far avoided engaging with, presumably to ensure the on-field referee remains the sole arbiter of the contest.. “Treat it like cricket appeals - one per side per game. No more histrionics  false claiming (for fear of triggering a lost appeal). No more ing  lying (the other side will appeal). No more howlers. No more suspicion of ref or FIFA bias.”“If the trigger for a VAR referral is a ‘clear and obvious error’,” asks Seth Levine, “why do they bother reverting to the on-field referee at all? That’s not a paradox - it’s just a really poorly defined test. It makes sense for the on-field referee to check if he’s not sure, but every “check” called for by the VAR is, by definition, the result of a clear and obvious error (in the view of the VAR).”Indeed. It remains very much a work in progress. As someone who lived through the A-League trial it was clear the system was still some way off where it needed to be. That said, it has operated far more efficiently in Russia than it has in Australia.Matt Le Tissier can see the upside.Some background to the Xhaka and Shaqiri situation:Meanwhile, the animosity between Switzerland and Serbia rumbles on, with Fifa now getting involved.How’s the round of 16 shaping up after yesterday’s games? Likes this:Belgium’s win may have come at a cost with key players collecting knocks. Although the battle to top Group G is far from the most fierce at Russia 2018 thanks to the wildcard that is Group H. Roberto Martinez was pragmatic about the situation in his post-match press conference. The answer is very clear. If we could have seven days to prepare the game and then have seven days for the next game I would say carry on with the same starting XI. The reality now is that we are qualified, and in a tournament like the World Cup you’re only as good as the 23 players in your squad. There’ll be opportunities to give minutes to other players who deserve them. We need to assess the three injury concerns.”Back to the task in hand, and Belgium’s muscular dismissal of Tunisia, featuring braces from Romelu Lukaku and Eden Hazard.Andrew Benton (see earlier) may have given me a bum steer. That’ll teach me to trust Google Translate as a sub-editing tool. And for the avoidance of controversy, I shall amend the previous post. The combination of results in Group F leaves us with the tantalising prospect of three sides on equal points at the end of the phase. With the final group matches kicking off simultaneously I’m looking forward to a scenario where groups of players are huddled over pieces of paper like cricket captains studying Duckworth-Lewis permutations.Raul Vilchis celebrates Mexico’s tactical versatility after El Tri shifted from a counterattacking to a possession-based strategy between their clashes with Germany and South Korea. As jubilant Mexican fans broke out into renditions of “Cielito Lindo” in the stands, the Mexican players were able to thwart South Korea’s well-ordered defensive line with tactical discipline that drove the action to the sides of the field. The Mexicans knew how to create depth in their plays towards the goal by widening out their placement on the pitch.”In other Group F action Mexico impressed once again as they defeated perhaps the most disappointing side in Russia so far, South Korea. Javier Hernandez bagged his 50th international goal in the process while Hirving Lozano increased the rate of inflation to his transfer fee.Peter Rist has a VAR question. “Something I don’t understand about how VAR is bering used is: when the head VAR guy contacts the on-field ref suggesting he look at something, should the ref automatically check or not? I don’t understand why the German ref in the SwissSerbia game did nothing when Mitrovic was Tag-teamed in the penalty area, or when Sweden had a clear penalty shout yesterday, the ref did nothing.”My understanding is once the VAR instructs the on-field ref to review an incident then that is what occurs. In incidents like the ones described above my presumption is the VAR decided there was no clear and obvious error worth the on-field referee’s time reconsidering. Frustrating, I know. Somebody just reminded me of this glorious piece of Toni-related creativity as a counterweight to the Kroos supremacy. Although I’m not sure it qualifies as Tony Wilson was Tony with a y, and I’m not even sure Toni Kroos is an Anthony Kroos (can anyone confirm?). Regardless, I’ll take any excuse to share this marvellous clip.“’Squeaky-bum time’ is apparently ‘krånglig bumtid’ in Swedish. Seems the squeaking continues for these two.” Lovely stuff from Andrew Benton who opens the email floodgates in superb fashion. The pod point out that with just 75 seconds of injury time remaining John Guidetti shoots tamely at Manuel Neuer from a low percentage angle when he could easily have bled more time from the clock by running the ball into the corner. It brought to mind similar fateful incidents. What other brain freezes deserve a place in this hall of shame?Unsurprisingly, Germany’s comeback (only the second of Russia 2018 so far) dominates the latest World Cup Daily.This is worth listening to all the way to the end in order to savour Barry and Max’s haunting duet of the Home \u0026amp Away theme tune.Do last night’s heroics (not to mention the 2014 World Cup winner’s medal, four Champions League titles, four Club World Cups etc etc) make Toni Kroos the world’s preeminent Toni? Surely he’s knocked Braxton, Basil, and \u0026amp Guy into a cocked hat.There were handbags after the final whistle at the Fisht Stadium with Sweden’s coaching staff unhappy with their German counterparts.“Some of the group leaders of their team celebrated by running in our direction, rubbing it into our faces by making gestures,” Janne Anderson said. “That really got me annoyed and angry. We had fought it out for 90 minutes and at the end you should shake hands. So I was very angry with that.People behaved in ways that you do not do,” the Sweden manager added. “You should leave your opponents to feel sad. You do not act in the way they did. We reacted very strongly.”Heiliger Strohsack! How close we came to the most ignominious German exit from Russia since Eurovision 2009. Die Mannschaft, seconds from a fateful draw only for Toni Kroos to welly in one of the all-time World Cup winners.After the heart-stopping action of day ten, the passage of time compels us to contemplate day eleven. By close of business we will have digested 32 of the 64 matches scheduled for Russia 2018. The halfway point, if you like, of a tournament that has yet to reveal a decisive hand.Over the next few hours we’re going to look back on yesterday’s action and the wins for Germany, Mexico and Belgium, before turning our attention to England’s expected stroll against Panama and a massive night for Group H, the most open in the draw. There’s also no shortage of news to catch up on, including the aftershocks from Switzerland’s controversial victory over Serbia.As happy as I am to treat this shift as a stream of consciousness, it is much more fun for me and everyone concerned if you bombard me with emails and tweets to break up my ramblings. Send emails to jonathan.howcroft.freelance@ and tweets to @JPHowcroft.For now though, where else could we begin but that outrageous German escape act?

She talks to Eva Wiseman about the ‘magic energy’ that drives her and how she’s finally learning to make sense of herselfThere was a time when the voice of Florence Welch was as inescapable as an ambulance siren. “You’ve got the love, youuuu…” It blasted from car windows, it shot over sporting montages, it echoed through Primark. And then, just as quickly, it was gone.Now 31, her hair less roaring fire, more gentle sunset, Florence Welch is a calmer woman than the whirling girl behind three number one albums who headlined Glastonbury in a silver suit. Today, removing her jewellery so as not to jangle over the tape recorder, she looks like the Lady of Shalott in blue jeans. It was during that everywhere period, when Welch could hear herself coming every time she stepped out of the house, that she started to crack, slightly.“That’s when the drinking and the partying exploded, as a way to hide from it. I was drunk a lot of the time, on extra dirty Martinis – my way of drinking three shots at once. I was never interested in,” and she laughs, bitterly, “a nice glass of wine.” She says the phrase as if it were an urban myth she had always enjoyed a party. It was in the toilets of a London nightclub that, in 2006, she auditioned in front of her now-manager, becoming Florence and the Machine and breaking America three years later. In that period she rarely slept. When she got home after a two-day party, she was always in trouble. She’d get a text, typically, “Where RU?” “And I’d be like, ‘I’m not quite sure, but I’m wearing someone else’s clothes…’ The partying was about me not wanting to deal with the fact my life had changed, not wanting to come down. It always felt like something had picked me up and thrown me around various rooms and houses, then gone ‘boom!’” She flings her arms out theatrically. “It happened every time, and every time it was shocking.”But still, the music came, these huge bloody songs about love and loss – the director Greta Gerwig described them to Welch as “the deepest, darkest well of pain, and then you just throw a big party in there and invite everybody”. It makes Gerwig cry, she admitted, uncontrollably. The sound took some time to shape – it wasn’t until she started making music with another young woman, Isa Summers, that they emerged with the single Dog Days Are Over, a huge Kate Bush-ian snarl of a pop song that came to define her. Until then she’d been working with older male producers. “And there was an unconscious deferral, a bias against myself that felt ingrained.” Four albums in, she’s still making music the same controlled, “feminine” way, the only difference being today she knows when to take things out. “When it’s too… Florencey?” I nod then stop, for fear of seeming rude.As she approached the 10th anniversary of this career that became very big very fast, she decided to sober up. “When I realised I could perform without the booze it was a revelation. There’s discomfort and rage, and the moment when they meet is when you break open. You’re free.”On stage, she says, she always felt absolved – nobody was angry with her up there. It was her offstage life that she had to work on. Up there she will climb the scaffolding, holding on with one hand, leaping into the crowd and ripping her top off when she gets too sweaty. After those nights it’s quite hard for her to return to earth. Everything, she explains, starts to take on a magical significance. There will be moments – sitting in a friend’s room watching TV, for instance – when, sleep-deprived and sober, she will be suddenly awed. “Mundane moments become incredibly profound. The performing, the transcendence, then sitting watching TV – all can coexist, and the mundane makes the magical. Maybe I’m trying to hold on to normalcy. Maybe because being onstage has become normal, the pockets of peace seem really wild. But I treasure them.”So she stopped drinking and she started staying in, and last night she watched the entire new series of Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. “I think I reached the bottom of Netflix.” And though her life is quieter, her work has become louder. “Before, I thought I ran on a chaos engine, but the more peaceful I am, the more I can give to the work. I can address things I wasn’t capable of doing before.”Florence likes to trick herself. She does it with a blue pen, writing what she calls little “self dares of truth”, reassuring herself that she won’t show them to anyone. “Shh, it’s OK, it’s just us…” And it was as one of these that Hunger, the first single from her new album, High As Hope, began. The first line is: ‘At 17, I started to starve myself.’ “It’s the first time I’ve been able to put it on paper,” she whispers. ‘I thought that love was in the drugs,’ the song continues, ‘but the more I took, the more it took away. And I could never get enough. I thought that love was on the stage. You give yourself to strangers, you don’t have to be afraid.’ “But now I’ve realised that that nugget of insecurity and loneliness is a human experience. The big issues are there however you address them.” She giggles suddenly. “The weirdest thing is, that as personal as it feels, as soon as you say it, other people say: ‘I feel like that, too.’”She was terrified, talking about her eating disorder for the first time. Not just talking – singing. Her sister was baffled. “Like, ‘You couldn’t admit this for years, and now you put it in a pop song?’” But the terror meant, Florence says, that she needed to do it.Terror drives her, or pushes her forward, a sharp pitchfork in her back. She was an imaginative child, but imaginative in a way that sounds oppressive, confusing – she believed that ghosts and werewolves were real. Still wonders. “I learned ways to manage that terror – drink, drugs, controlling food. It was like a renaissance of childhood, a toddler’s self-destruction let loose in a person with grown-up impulses.”Recently, she was staying at the Chateau Marmont in LA, and woke with a start to find a white dress hanging above her head. “Then suddenly I was in the bathroom, screaming. Was it sleep paralysis? I don’t know how I got to the bathroom.” It’s only recently she overcame her fear of the dark, but she says this with no embarrassment. In the lead-up to the release of Hunger, in May, she says: “I was a nightmare – I cried all the way through Avengers: Infinity War.”Did something happen when she was 17, to trigger that descent? She pauses for a very long time. Her coffee goes cold. Outside, seasons change. Apologetically, she looks away. “I know how to deal with it in a song, but a lot of stuff I’m… still figuring out? I can say things in a song I don’t understand yet, like: ‘I thought love was a kind of emptiness’ – that feels important. You think love is unreachable, empty, hungry, then there’s a kind of sadness when something more stable comes towards you. You don’t recognise it as love because it’s not desperate enough. And I’ve never tied the two together until now.”Is she through that now? Is she eating? She takes a deep breath. “I’m further away from it than I ever have been. It was something I experienced and I’m 31 now and at a time where I can perhaps… see what I was looking for?” Her speech is lilting, soft south London, and punctuated liberally with ellipses.On Florence’s 30th birthday her sister had a baby, and the benefit of her new quiet life is that she’s been able to be there for her niece’s first year. “We help each other through. I’ve done career, she’s done family, and we’ve both seen behind the perfection. I’d love to be married, but I can see the good and bad in each life. I’ve wondered sometimes: ‘Did I dream too big, do I have to let it go?’” Going on tour, she’s realised, she goes into a state of stasis, popping out years later to find that not only have all her friends had kids and got married, but grown up in even grander, less definable ways, learning things like how to break up well – something she is yet to master – and how to feel “deserving of love”.Though her father, Nick, an ex-ad executive, left London to open campsites, she lives close to both her sister and her mother, Evelyn, a professor of renaissance studies when Florence talks about her, she nods slowly as if contemplating a difficult Sudoku.“My mum was so worried about me doing music – she thought it was dangerous, could hurt me, could be fleeting. She’s accepted it’s not a phase now. But she’s been through a lot, so always prepares for the worst.” Her mother mourns the fact Florence didn’t go to university. Once, she told her she could remember every outfit she’d ever worn, and her mother said: “What a waste of a brain.”But, as Florence navigates this quiet life, their similarities are becoming more clear to her. Watching Evelyn lecture about a pair of renaissance gloves she saw, suddenly, where her performance gene came from. “And people tell me I disappear – that’s like her, too, and it can be isolating in a relationship, and maybe was isolating when we were kids. Like me, I think she has big feelings, but she’s put them somewhere else, away. I’m still figuring out what that well of longing in me is, and looking at the origins.” Then there is another pause, so deep you could swim in it. “My mother’s mother committed suicide. And the way she was loved by her mother has related to the way she loves us, which then is the way we love others. My grandmother fell, so sometimes I feel like we’re all still in this loop, falling with her. The trickle-down of tragedies.”It’s only recently that she started talking about this with her mother, and those dog days after she was 17, and the way her relationships have followed the patterns drawn in childhood when she was an “octopus of feelings”, always hungry for attention from unavailable people.Her first book of poetry, Useless Magic, an elegant collaged scrapbook, is dedicated to her parents. The first words, written in Biro, are: “I make songs to tie people to me.” It’s in the same pen that she writes daily “sermons”, as she calls them, and she uses them to acknowledge and find the humour in the strangeness of her pop star life. For instance, she wants a record of having been drunk in a corridor with Liza Minnelli, and a record too that she knew this should never be mistaken for a normal afternoon.These undrinking days she still enjoys parties, but uses them to dance rather than get high – if someone starts making small talk with her and there’s music playing she will literally spin away towards the speakers.After we meet, having had a conversation that veered from recurring dreams she had as a child to a new Tinder bio (“Deeply domestic but also high stress, with no middle ground – hugely exposed but deeply hermity. Too many candles burning in my house to be safe”) she emails over a selection of these daily sermons. They’re scrappy and funny, and one ends: “I would also like a thousand texts that say ‘I love you,’ my phone buzzing endlessly, until I am exhausted, and empty. Oh shit.”For somebody whose career balances on drama and the guttural expression of heartbreak, she seems remarkably peaceful, almost happy. But sometimes, while she is in her tour bus on the way home to London, the maggot of an idea will burrow into her mind and she will think: “Wouldn’t it be a relief to go partying now? What if… what if you just fucked it all up? What if you drove all this into the ground?” She shakes her head suddenly like there’s water in her ear. “It’s still there. This, ‘What if I could take a day off, a break from this magical energy?’ But,” she grins, “it passes.”High As Hope is out now. Useless Magic is out on 5 July, £20, Penguin Books.

It isn’t the process of getting pregnant, with its cycles of raised and dashed hopes, or the term “sperm donor”, with its unsettling connotations. It’s not even the queasy feeling that what you are doing sets you apart from other people and that the reason you are doing it is not that you are a powerful, rational, resourceful woman, but, as a friend of mine put it after considering and rejecting the idea of having a baby alone, that “I couldn’t get anyone to shag me”.No. The hardest thing about having a baby alone is making the decision to do it.“So are you going to do it then?” says Rosemary. It is late summer 2013 and we are drinking whisky in a hotel bar in Edinburgh. “Yeah, probably,” I say. “I mean, I might. Are you?”I haven’t seen Rosemary for months and it is only after a lot of whisky, and with a casualness that belies the cold terror underneath, that we reach the main order of business: our ongoing discussion, part lament, part spur to action, over what to do about having children. That is: if, when, how and with whom, or, since we are both, for the purposes of this conversation, single, “with” “whom”.I have always known I wanted children. From the time I was old enough to conceptualise my future, motherhood made sense to me. It was always one child in my imaginings and never part of a fantasy about marriage, and while everything else in my life changed over the years – the country I lived in, the kind of work I did, the gender of the people I dated – the distant outline of a child remained steadfast. On the rare occasions I allowed myself to inspect it directly, the idea that it might never happen made me feel giddy with loss.I met L two years after moving to New York. On the surface of things, we looked very different – me, English, lefty, fundamentally unkempt she, New Yorker, centre-right, well put together. On any given day we could disagree about everything – fact or fiction, subway or car, Republican or Democrat – so that, in the months after we met, it felt like being on safari in each other’s alien worlds. If falling in love is, partly, a question of finding a docking station for one’s neuroses, I knew I was home when L told me that, after her building was evacuated during 911, she went straight to an off-licence and bought hundreds of dollars’ worth of booze in case civilisation collapsed and the world reverted to a barter economy. Come the zombie apocalypse, this is a woman you want on your side. But there was this, too: the house she grew up in would one day have to be sold, she said, and what she would miss most were the things you can’t take with you, like the sound the stairs made when they expanded at night. Somewhere in my system, a pilot light flared.She was three years older than me and told me from the outset that, in the near future, she was planning on trying to get pregnant. Logistically, this made sense it would be madness to forestall while we flapped about for another two years trying to decide what we were doing. Emotionally, however, it stumped me. According to every relationship model I knew, you could either be with someone who’d had kids before you met, have kids together and separate down the line, or split up and have a baby alone. There was no such thing as being with someone who had a baby on her own. It sounded like a terrible deal: all the stress and anxiety without the substance of motherhood.At that stage, the strongest terms in which I could have put my own long-held but dormant desire for a baby were that I didn’t want not to have one. If there was, behind this impulse, a larger, less tangible longing, I didn’t want to look into it too deeply lest it unleash a full-blown baby hunger I couldn’t get back in the box. But I started to notice small, unsettling changes in myself. When somebody asked me, “Do you have children?” – a question that, until recently, I had responded to in my head with versions of, “Are you mental? I’m about 11” – it started to sound less neutral, more unfriendly. I had always believed that, medical issues aside, most women without children had acted through choice, but my faith in this weakened. I watched as a number of friends missed out on having children because their boyfriends broke up with them when they were in the vicinity of 40, before having children with younger women. I watched as women six, seven years my senior finally met someone new and went through round after punishing round of IVF. I didn’t want to be alone at 45, or 50, and on Tinder, dating people with children when I had none of my own. I didn’t want to be 70, the age my mother was when she died, lying on my deathbed without the image of my child’s face in my head. Above all, I didn’t want to look back on this period and wish I’d had the courage to act.I also didn’t want to “help” another woman raise her baby. Unless I was Mother Teresa (I’m not), the only way it would make sense for me to stick around in the event of L having a child was if our relationship became a more conventional union, or if I had my own baby independently, too.It’s not that L’s pregnancy made me more broody (I defy any woman to see another woman’s early pregnancy up close and think, “Hey, that looks fun!”) and I wasn’t bound by her decisions. We didn’t live together. In fact, an infantile strand of my personality deliberately wanted to make different decisions. If we were going to suffer the deprivations of single parenthood, we might as well realise all the advantages, too – in my case, starting from scratch and doing precisely what suited me and my notional baby.All I had to do was figure out what that was. Would I use a friend as a sperm donor, or a stranger? If the former, who? If the latter, how would I make that choice? Would I move back to London for free treatment on the NHS (which, to the horror of the rightwing press, now offers fertility services to single women and lesbians) or stay in America and spend thousands on something that might not even work? In the event, I choose the path of least resistance: America will never really feel like home, but it is where I live, where L has her baby and where, eight months later, I am sufficiently panicked to finally get moving with my own.One of the things you have to get used to when you are a British person embarking on fertility treatment in the US is the pace. In Britain, the law of supply and demand is such that there are more women wanting sperm than there are donors, so even private clinics have waiting lists. In America, where no one with adequate resources waits for anything, you have a chat with your doctor, schedule a date, call the donor bank, which bikes the sperm round to the clinic, and off you go. You might have spent six months or six years deciding to do this but you could, potentially, be pregnant within a month of first seeing your doctor.That is, if you have made what feels at the time like the hardest decision: how to pick a donor. This question probably cost me six months of concentrated flapping, during which time I asked a male friend if he’d do it, because it seemed more “normal” than the alternatives, and was achingly relieved when he said no, before eventually deciding to find an anonymous donor.This is a tricky part of the story for me. There may come a day when it is as regular as milk to share details of one’s sperm donor – when there is a language less alienating to describe it than this, and that feels less compromising of one’s child’s privacy. But we are not there yet, and I’ve no idea how to calibrate this choice. Is it the biggest of my life, or essentially meaningless? Underplay the donor and you risk turning the guy into the elephant in the room go on about him too much and you risk pathologising your child’s background. Scrolling through profiles, I look for characteristics that align with my own. I want someone clever, which here means educated. I want someone with dark hair. I want someone whose favourite film isn’t Once Upon A Time In America or Titanic. In the absence of a metric for gauging a man’s humour or internal beauty or moral worth, I want someone tall and basically symmetrical. A choice is superficial only if it is made at the expense of deeper considerations and so, although I reject sperm donors on criteria that would outrage me if applied in real life by men to women, I tell myself I’m not doing anything wrong.Everything is extra: $35 for the guy’s baby photos $50 for an audio file. Guidelines vary, but in New York you can see photos of him only as a child. Some donor banks offer a “silhouette” of him as an adult, which would be hilarious if it weren’t so creepy. What next – his breath in a jar to rule out halitosis? I don’t listen to the audio files. I don’t try to find the guy, even though there is so much information, it would probably take me less than a day. This is not gene selection it is the selection of the story of how my child came to be, and, through a combination of vital statistics, familiarity of background, a subtle implication that he is a Democrat and his use of the word “tremendous”, which signals to me a certain wryness and enthusiasm, I make my choice. In other words, on nothing substantive. What matters is it’s my choice and I make it.I pay extra for ID disclosure, enabling any child to trace the donor when they turn 18. I decide how much to buy – enough for three cycles – then fill in a form and return it, along with payment for almost $2,000. When I call to confirm my request, I half expect the receptionist to laugh and ask what on earth am I doing, trying to buy genetic material over the phone as if it were lunch? Instead, after I mumble, “Need to order some sperm”, she puts me through to the lab, where a technician will check to see if what I want is available.I give him the donor number. There is a clacking of keys, followed by a short pause. Then, with the smoothness of a sommelier fielding a wine order at dinner, he says, “An excellent choice.”After weeks of monitoring, at the end of 2013, my eggs are ready. This is it, says Dr B. I can come in tomorrow and, after waiting an hour for the sperm to defrost, finally get this show on the road. He asks if I’d like L to be present when the insemination takes place. “Some people find it nice to involve their partners.”Fertility treatment can be hard and excluding, he says, and involving the patient’s partner, even to the extent of inviting him or her to operate the syringe full of sperm, can give them a feeling of inclusion. I blush. Clearly he’s in favour of L being present, either because it gives him a warm feeling or to neutralise some latent ambivalence he has about helping to create single mothers.I try to imagine the scene: me, stressed out and half-naked on a gurney L, holding the catheter and rolling her eyes the medical staff, trying not to intrude on our beautiful moment. I don’t think I want L there – I don’t want anyone there, it’s embarrassing – and when I imagine asking her, I realise I don’t want to give her an opportunity to say no, either.There is a cold, mean streak in me that makes me think trying to involve the partner is ludicrous under any circumstances. Surely there’s a dignity in allowing things to be what they are? This is a medical procedure pretending otherwise risks making the treatment seem sadder, just as choosing a sperm donor will continue to feel sad, or bad, or weird, as long as it’s tied to conventions associated with choosing a spouse.The next day, a week before Christmas, Dr B breezes in full of good cheer. We chit-chat as he loads the syringe with a substance that is, gram for gram, more expensive than the world’s finest heroin (though less expensive than marrying someone you’re not into in order to have a baby).The cycle fails, as do the subsequent three cycles, one of which results in a short-lived pregnancy and all of which mean that, by the spring of 2014, I am taking, for the second month in a row and despite producing too many eggs the first time, large amounts of fertility hormones.It is different this time.“How do you feel?” says Dr B.For five days I have been injecting myself with a preloaded pen, which has bruised me terribly. The skin of my abdomen looks like 1970s wallpaper, all bright purple flowers with a greeny blue border. I feel altered, hideously bad-tempered. I tell myself it’s chemical and will pass. But it doesn’t. A week after finishing the injections, Dr B looks at my charts and tells me to stop taking the drugs. Ten days later I go in for insemination number five.“Whoa,” says the nurse doing the ultrasound. “You’ve a lot going on in there.”I look at the screen: a lot of shapeless dark patches connected by strings.“They look like spider’s eggs,” I say, and shudder.I have, once again, overreacted to the hormones. But Dr B says not to worry: not all of them are mature. I could call off the cycle but I say, “Go ahead.” The sun comes out that weekend, and L and I take a walk with the baby in the buggy. I feel Zen in the face of all possible outcomes. On Monday night I go into my kitchen and crack an egg against the side of a pan for dinner. Two bright yellow yolks slide down. I have never seen such a thing before and stare down at the eggs, feeling bad for the hen. I am so surprised I say it out loud: “Twins.”It’s twins. Of course it is. How could it not be? I am a walking exemplar of the phrase, “Be careful what you wish for.” Over the next few weeks I wait for the idea of carrying twins to normalise, but it doesn’t. For minutes at a time I forget I’m pregnant, then I remember with the force of the original shock. I have lunch with an old friend I haven’t seen for a while. I know he’ll be shocked, too, and he is.“How’s that going to work?” he says.And there it is, the question we’ve been avoiding since L’s pregnancy. If I have these babies, what will the babies be to L and what will she be to them? The answer is only partly to be found in the relationship I have with her baby. There is no honorific to describe what I am to him and there is no word for what he is to me. He is at the centre of us, the miracle over whom we both marvel, but I have no moral, financial or legal responsibility for him. Neither do I perform many of the most basic parental duties. I have always known this lopsided arrangement would be tolerable only until I had a baby of my own. What I hadn’t anticipated is the ways in which its limitations would also prove to be strengths. In the year since his birth, my relationship with the baby has evolved to be oddly free-floating from that with L. He is my buddy, a child in whom I have no stake other than love. That it’s a love I’m not bound – by law or biology – to feel makes it all the more precious.On the other hand, what am I doing potentially bringing two further children into a situation it takes so long to explain? I can just about rationalise to myself why a woman without a child might want to maintain a degree of separation from a partner with a child, given the vast difference in lifestyle. But two women in separate households with babies of a similar age who hang out on evenings and weekends? If we’re not a blended family, then what on earth are we? Clearly, at this point, the proper course of action would be to either give up this nonsense of separate households and separate children, and move in together, or else call it a day. There is no middle way. Perhaps it is selfish. It’s selfish to carry on along parallel tracks, denying the children a second parent and creating two single-parent families. It’s selfish, practically, morally, financially and environmentally, to maintain our independence while being together, like driving two cars to a single destination. And while my relationship with L’s baby is full of joy, how can it survive once I have my own children and am unable to travel back and forth to see him?For the first time I seriously question why I want to do this alone. It isn’t just that L and I have conflicting ideas about parenting – very broadly, I am too mean in her eyes, and she isn’t mean enough in mine – it’s the historical weight each of us puts on those differences and our assumptions about where they might lead us. We both have a highly developed sense of self-preservation, which expresses itself in different ways, except, perhaps, in this one shared belief: that the way one protects children from harm is by controlling who has access to them. The only thing more frightening to me than not having a baby is having a baby in a hostile environment. One afternoon L sends me an email with a link to an apartment listing that is almost double the rent I pay in Brooklyn. The floor plan looks familiar, as does the view from the window. It’s in her building, the mirror image of her home, but one floor down.“?!” I reply.“But do we want to live that close to each other? Isn’t it weird?”I go to see it. The landlord is putting in new flooring and a new bathroom and most of the apartment is under polythene, but because it’s an exact copy of L’s, bar the fixtures and fittings, I don’t have much trouble imagining it. It occurs to me, as I walk around, that he may not even want to rent to a single woman expecting two babies. But in any case, it’s too expensive. Eeven if it’s the kind of building I need, with a mail room and an elevator and a maintenance team on site even if it would be amazing to have L upstairs when I bring the babies home even if the very fact that the listing came up in the first place, in a co-op that discourages rentals, is the kind of coincidence that feels like a gift from above – none of that matters, because I can’t afford it.It is, surely, nuts: to sort of live together but not. It feels like cheating, to have L’s support and proximity without the hard work of cohabitation. How would we explain it to the children? Or to ourselves? That we like each other sufficiently to be in daily contact, except on days when we don’t? What would the kids even be to each other? Cousins? Best friends? The victims of a half-arsed piece of emotional evasion, or beneficiaries of a radical new vision?In those first weeks after moving, we enter a honeymoon period in which the loveliness of living almost together is nothing to the luxury of living sort of apart. The act of leaving my flat and walking up one flight imbues daily visits with the tiny frisson of occasion. When one of us snaps, the other goes home without it being construed as a histrionic gesture. There’s no marriage or joint mortgage, but a commitment has been made. I have the long-overdue realisation that relationships rely on a balance between independence and the right level of curtailment of freedom to liberate one from the burden of choice.One evening, L sits on the sofa with her son, reading a book about different kinds of families. “‘Some people have two mommies,’” she reads, pointing to an illustration of two badgers wearing earrings with a baby badger in their midst. “‘Some people have two daddies. Some people have one mummy, hasome people have one daddy.’” Her baby, who isn’t a baby any more but a toddler and the most delightful child in the world, isn’t quite old enough to formulate questions and we are off the hook for a little while yet. L and I exchange glances. “Some people have a neighbour,” she says, sotto voce.My final ultrasound of the year falls just after Christmas. I am six weeks from the due date. The technician looks at the screen. He frowns, says something I don’t catch and leaves the room. Someone else comes in. Everyone gathers by the monitor while I look at the ceiling and try to figure out what to have for lunch. A fourth doctor comes in and tells me to get dressed and follow him. I feel a spike of alarm. In his office, my high-risk obstetrician, Dr Y, is waiting.“They have to come out,” Dr Y says.“Oh my God.”The placenta for the smallest baby is working only intermittently if it stops altogether, she’ll die.“This is not an emergency,” Dr Y says calmly, “but it is… fairly urgent.” He tells me he has time the following day, New Year’s Eve, or the day after that.“Let’s do it tomorrow,” I say, trembling.My dad is in London and offers to come straight to New York, but I don’t want him in the air while I’m having surgery I can’t add fear of his plane going down to everything else. At L’s that night, I tell her to ask her mother to come across town the following day to watch her son.“I’m so happy you’ll be there,” I say.“It’s only because everyone else is in England.”“No, it isn’t. I would want you to be there, whatever.”As I say this, I realise it’s true. Fear pushes me inward, joy pushes me out, and while I am as frightened of having these babies as of anything, it’s a different kind of fear: not a shrinking but an opening out. I have been so stringent in ensuring I can do this alone, perhaps the reward is that I don’t always have to.Right up until the last moment, a small part of me thinks, what if all this is a mistake? What if Dr Y turns to me and says there’s nothing in there – of course you’re not pregnant! Did you think that, by signing a few forms and handing over your credit card, you could dodge millennia of evolution, not to mention convention and common decency? Go home, buy yourself a cat and never speak of this again.But at 4.17 pm the next day, a tiny, fierce cry fills the room. Baby A is removed from the basement of my body. I burst into tears. L grips my hand. A moment later, Baby B comes out and L leaps from her seat in the direction of the babies while Dr Y, turning to his students, holds a quick pop quiz over my guts. Then the nurses bring over the babies.L gets all of this illegally on camera. It’s not footage I can watch too often. The babies, two flat-faced Glo Worms covered in gel, are blotchy and impossibly alive. I am insane on the gurney, grinning drunkenly at my two girls. Over and over I say it, in the manner of a woman shortly to be given more drugs: “Oh my God, I can’t believe they’re both blond.”• This is an edited extract from An Excellent Choice by Emma Brockes, published by Faber \u0026amp Faber at £16.99.

Here’s how to make it a triumph…“How was the trip to Center Parcs with three generations of your partner’s family?” friends are asking politely. And to them I reply: “I’m still processing.” Here is what I learned:The trick to spending time with children is to give up all pretence of adult life and descend willingly into a world where those over eight are simply used as security and for collecting snacks. And you must go willingly, you must make the choice, first to enter the compound, with its fattened ducks and eerie silence after 9pm, and then to submit fully to a week without saying no. There is a playground round every corner, there’s an entertainer at breakfast time – all meals come with crayons and some taste of them, too. In every restaurant there is a soft-play area, an idea that I urge all businesses to roll out, immediately – it means the children are not tied to their adults through the means of iPads and threats, instead popping over for their chips, then back again to their cousins to continue the construction of an elaborate structure made out of shoes. Which gives the grown-ups time to continue their new favourite game: “Here’s what I’m going to say in an email to the management about how to improve Center Parcs.” Who knew we were such geniuses of town planning and tourism? By the end of each day, we had designed our own far superior versions (my particular irritation was with the add-on prices for each activity, though we did enjoy holding a very large owl) and could rest in the knowledge that, like Westworld or Westfield, we could fix this heaven experiment over the course of an afternoon.There are a handful of places in the UK where I am acutely aware that I’m Jewish, and this is one of them. This despite a colleague, having asked which Parc we were going to, smiling knowingly: “Ah, of course, the one for the liberal metropolitan elite.” Although the first time I visited Center Parcs, with my family and grandma when I was 10, we were perhaps the first chalet to host a full seder night, today we wear it lightly, I think, our Ashkenazi heritage, the only signs being the quantity of food my mother-in-law brought to barbecue and our bafflement at the boating lake. And yet I walked through this English land of burnt skin and badminton with a certain unplaceable anxiety. Perhaps everybody feels different here, a little apart from all the other guests with their artful manipulation of inflatables. It wasn’t until we were driving out into Bedfordshire, the barrier closing behind us, that it occurred to me we could have left at any time.Walking through a high street that’s been plonked in an ancient forest makes you feel dirty, these proud old trees dwarfed by a bustling Café Rouge. The idea was that these parks would be “an effective way for city folk to experience the countryside”. But we experience it with such sad apology that it makes you consider, not the beauty and grandeur of nature, but our too-human impulse to knock it down.I was awed by the 3G (three-generation) holiday, by the complete selflessness of my father-in-law choosing to spend his 70th birthday not at, say, a small Michelin-starred restaurant somewhere near the river, or in a comfortable living room surrounded by his many friends and a number of smoked salmon canapés, but instead with his kids and his kids’ kids, and those kids’ mothers, wiping ice cream off white T-shirts with a slightly dampened napkin. He made sandcastles in blazing heat, he detoured on foot to a supermarket to buy plasters with cartoon characters on them, he brought his own Nespresso machine, just in case.You can call anything a swimming pool if you put water in it. I learned this fairly quickly, as soon as we entered the subtropical swimming paradise and jostled our way into the tepid bubbles. It is a disconcerting feeling when both air and water are the temperature of urine, especially when surrounded by young children. They quickly ide into the too-scared and the too-fearless, the latter leaping off plastic rocks and bombing down slides as if on a stag night, the former clinging to their mothers so hard they bruise their tattoos. Every half hour, a Tarzan call echoes through the dome, signalling the start of the wave machine, and everyone comes scuttering from their games to pile into the pool, where babies float with enthusiastic yet slightly detached expressions, like the Queen seeing cows. Standing in these waves feels like being on a plane going down, with all the screaming and spillage that entails. The subtropical swimming paradise has a Starbucks and its own weather system and a queue for the flumes, and it was while waiting for my family to navigate all this that I read a Mumsnet thread about someone’s Darling Husband returning home from the Longleat park a little bit miffed because he was sure she’d told him that “going to Center Parcs” was a euphemism for anal sex.Some people hung knicker-bunting outside the Conservative MP Christopher Chope’s office after he blocked the recent bill to ban ‘upskirting’. It was the perfect (and perfectly British) response, and should be taken on in the future for all shows of contemptuous protest.Julia Davis and Vicki Pepperdine’s podcast, Dear Joan and Jericha, makes me absolutely hoot. Their advice to listeners with sexual problems is unsurpassable, and I particularly enjoyed the sensitive discussion about how Joan plans to explode her mother."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9bf17566be5bb32867061bc829c974525ca083f2/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d70373e6f60eaf06775726d580409dcb","title":"i couldnt bring myself to read my parents love letters for years","story":"Before her mother died, she handed over a shopping bag of private and personal letters sent long ago between her and her father. But what would Sabine Durrant learn about the man who died shortly after she was born?My father died just after I was born and I knew very little about him until I was in my 30s. I was a journalist then, and I approached it like an investigation, writing a memoir about what I discovered – his unhappy childhood, his life as a pilot in the navy, and his disappearance one November night during practice manoeuvres off the Dorset coast. The memoir was published in a book and serialised in a newspaper. After it appeared, my mother talked to me about him not much but enough. She told me he had been a great love, and she told me in heart-rending detail about the night he didn’t come back. We both cried, which was good, because I had got used to thinking she had forgotten him. We had met for lunch, and when we had finished eating she rummaged in her shopper and brought out a plastic bundle, a small Ottakar’s bag containing a thick pile of letters. “You can read these,” she said. “If you like.”I took the letters home, and I was going to read them that night. In some ways, it felt like victory. The teenage me, the one who in secret trawled for evidence, who had raged against her silence – would have drunk them in. I liked to think I had bypassed her in my search, because I hadn’t wanted to upset her. She was long remarried, with a life of her own. But if I am honest it had also been a way of snatching my father from her, of having him to myself. And maybe their letters were too much of a rebuke of this, provided too concrete a proof that he had been a lover, a husband, hardly a father at all. Or perhaps their existence was just too personal – that squeamish resistance all children feel towards parental intimacy. I put the Ottakar’s bag on the table in the hall, and at one point it was moved on top of the piano, and then it graduated into a space on the bookshelves behind. I stopped thinking about it. The bag, with its green logo and arc of orange, wasn’t sealed, the top with the handles just folded over, but it gave the impression of being bound in Sellotape and masking tape, of being as impenetrable as a cage.Things have changed while the letters have sat there. I had two small children when my mother gave them to me, my third child is now 14. The Ottakar’s in Putney Exchange, where my mother bought her books, was taken over by Waterstone’s many years ago. And for the last 18 months my mother hasn’t shopped there anyway, because the summer before last she went to a wedding in Canada and when she came back she discovered she had cancer and two weeks later she died.I’d always thought of death as something unusual, out of the ordinary, exceptionally unfair. Having a dead dad had made me interesting at school. Now, with the full force of my own mortality, I realise how ordinary death is. There’s nothing interesting at my age about having a dead parent. Lots of my friends are orphans, too. And the pain of it is very different. I had grown used to thinking of my father’s death as a hole, but now I realise it was a rock, a solid object, something you could rub up against. It’s the death of someone you have known and argued with and been frustrated by and loved – that’s a hole, that’s a crevice you have to stop yourself from falling down.I used to collect objects that had belonged to my father – a paisley dressing gown, a hand-knitted jumper, a copy of Knots, Splices and Fancy Work, squirrel them away like talismans, proof he had existed. Faced with the onslaught of my mother’s effects, I could hardly bear to keep a thing. I wrestled her possessions into bags, manhandled them out of the house. Off you go. You’re not welcome here. I asked a friend to take away her little watch, get it out of my sight. But my friend cleaned it and wrapped it in tissue paper and brought it back pressing it in my hand she said she thought I might regret not keeping it. And I knew she was probably right, but the truth of that felt a long way off.Eighteen months have passed now and I am glad I have the watch. I wish I had more not the clothes, perhaps, but the emails that disappeared, in a glitch with my server, and which I decided not to try to retrieve. I long to hear her voice, to have a bit of her back just for a moment. And as a result those old love letters have taken on a different force. I began to think again about reading them, circling the idea, like prodding a bruise – aware this time that it was more about her than him. I wouldn’t be reading them to discover, but to recover – to rewind time, to hear my mother’s words. She had given them to me. She had meant me to read them. And it began to feel like neglect, that I had somehow let her down.Yesterday, I decided to pick them up at least, to feel the weight of them. But we had the decorators in last year and the bookshelf where I was expecting to find the solid package, between Jane Bown’s photographs and the RHS Book of Gardening, was just a neat row of hardback fiction. I went upstairs, to a room we call my study, where I would surely have put it for safe keeping. But it’s a bit of a mess at the moment, a teenage dumping ground, and I began hurling things out – clothes meant for Depop, and broken lamps – and with a growing sense of desperation, shouted: “Where’s the Ottakar’s bag?” And when my partner shouted back, “What Ottakar’s bag?” I felt an overwhelming sense of sickness and loss, remembering all the other precious things I had neglected – including my father’s old jumper and my mother’s emails – and when finally I did find it, carelessly thrown behind some photo albums, coated in builder’s dust, I was crying.I didn’t know when I started writing this whether I would actually read them. I thought I would that essay about my father was a way to control emotions that felt otherwise overwhelming. But there is the old resistance – a feeling that they are not mine to look at. The packet has been in front of me while I have been typing, heavier and more substantial than I remembered a proper clout. I have begun to sigh a lot, those heavy tussles with breath that are an attempt to keep anguish at bay. But I am getting closer. Between that sentence and this I opened the bag and saw how each identical pale blue envelope has been neatly dated in my mother’s hand, that they  two years, 1961 and 62, the time before they were married, before I was born. There are 71 letters, and they were sent to different addresses – Brussels, Queen’s Gate, Copse Hill – all in the same spikey writing.And it comes as a shock, this. I don’t know why I hadn’t realised it before, that they are not a correspondence. Her letters to him would have been received at base or at sea, on the move, read, perhaps kept for a bit, but ultimately discarded. These, cherished and dated and placed in this bag the morning she met me: they are all from him to her. Fifteen years ago it wouldn’t have mattered. But today there is an immediate ache of disappointment, that she isn’t to be found here after all.A couple were loose, out of sequence, and I cast my eye over them. My dearest Anne (9 Jan 61), To my darling, darling Anne (Sept 62). The first was sent from HMS Victorious and is full of boyish high spirits: “There is a gale blowing at present so flying has been rather tricky as the flight deck moves round rather a lot making landing very difficult.” The second, written at Hal Far, is full of longing. “I’m too miserable here without you to write very much.” It’s enough. The poignancy is too painful in view of what was to come.I slip the letters back into the bag and I lay it at my feet. I think about her taking the letters from wherever it was she kept them (not her desk) and the love in her decision to give them to me. Was it by her bed, that bookshop bag? Had she just bought herself a novel? I think about how much she liked Ottakar’s in Putney, the layout, and the nice Costa on the second floor, where she would order an Americano, and her tendency to chide the shop assistant, if I didn’t get there in time, for not prominently displaying my books.And I remember the expression on her face when she gave me the letters. She had a habit, my mother, of showing you her holiday photographs while holding them in such a firm grip you had to strain your neck to see – quite often I experienced entire cruises upside down. And that’s what I think of when I remember this handing over. She was still holding tightly to the bag, not really letting go, even when they were already in my hand.Take Me In, by Sabine Durrant, is published on 28 June by Mulholland, at £12.99.

Shorn of their skins and seeds, the fruits – green, orange and some halved cherry varieties – softened to the point of melting, bloated with the flavours of oil and herbs, and could have been stored for a week or more in the fridge in a glass jar. These, however, were gone within days.A pot or two of preserved tomatoes is as useful to come home to as the remains of a cold roast chicken on a Monday evening. You can dip into the jar for an accompaniment to a pork pie or grilled slices of aubergine, or deliciously eke out a wok-fried supper of shell-on prawns. You can toss them with cooked sausages for a summer version of a traditional cold-weather hot pot, or use them at the heart of a stuffed baked red pepper.The trick here is to make enough. The cooking time is long and it makes more sense to prepare an ample supply for a week or more than it does for one occasion. A large, full-to-the-brim roasting tin will make plenty to keep picking at meal after meal for several days. (Packed in a sealed pot, the confit makes a splendid office lunch.) You could halve the recipe for a single dish or two. The oil in which the tomatoes reside may need a while at room temperature to return to its usual glowing self – anything below 3C sends the oil into a sulk, but it soon bounces back. We made rounds of thick bruschetta and spooned the tomatoes and their oil over the top, but could just as easily have slipped them into the centre of a cheese soufflé as it came from the oven.You can keep such preserves for longer than a week, but you do need to know what you are doing with painstakingly sterilised preserving jars and explicit timings, so I suggest this more as a way to use up a lot of tomatoes and have a week’s worth of bounty rather than a larder full of stored treasure.And treasure it certainly is.Sterilise your jars with boiling water and let them dry naturally or use a spotlessly clean tea towel. I use either Weck, Kilner or le Parfait jars. The oil solidifies in the fridge, but will return to liquid form at room temperature. You will also need 2 x 750ml storage jarsPut the kettle on. Cut a small cross at the tip of each of the medium tomatoes and put them in a heatproof bowl. When the water boils, pour it over the tomatoes and leave them for 4 or 5 minutes. Remove the tomatoes from the water then peel and discard the skins.Halve the tomatoes horizontally, then use a small teaspoon to remove the seeds. Place the peeled and seeded tomatoes, cut side up and tightly packed, in a roasting tin. Set the oven at 120Cgas mark ½. Slice the cherry tomatoes in half, but don’t skin them, remove the seeds with a teaspoon and tuck them among the larger tomatoes.Push the rosemary, peppercorns, garlic and thyme among the tomatoes. Scatter over the salt and sugar, pour over the olive oil and place in the oven. Leave to bake for 3 hours, then remove.Sterilise the storage jars, either by baking them or by pouring boiling water into them, tipping it out then leaving them to dry. While they are still hot, spoon in the tomatoes, herbs and garlic and pour over the olive oil and juices. Seal, cool, then refrigerate till needed.I say green and broad beans here, but you could use asparagus, peas or new potatoes. The point is to use the preserved tomatoes as a sauce for seasonal vegetables. Serve it as a light summer lunch with toasted sourdough or perhaps some pieces of bread, torn into rough chunks and fried crisp in a little of the tomato oil.Bring a deep pan of water to the boil. Top and tail the green beans and lower them into the boiling water, leaving them to cook for 4 or 5 minutes till bright green and just starting to bend. Drain them and dunk into a bowl of iced water to stop them cooking.Let the water return to the boil. Drop in the broad beans and let them cook for 4 to 6 minutes depending on their size and tenderness. Drain the beans, then pop them from their papery shells.Toast the sesame seeds in a hot, dry pan over a moderate heat, moving them around the pan until they are golden and fragrant. Put 3 tbsp of the seeds into a food processor or blender with the tomatoes and process to the mixture to a thick sauce.Warm the sesame and tomato paste in a shallow pan. As it starts to sizzle, add the drained green beans and skinned broad beans and continue to let them warm through for 4 or 5 minutes.Transfer the beans and tomato sauce to warm plates, scatter with the reserved toasted sesame seeds and serve."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a36b7aad5bf895366251920af7035b2efb1bbaed/0_374_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5a92ef385adf8cb25f9efa9ba1e90587","title":"the house and tower on the suffolk coast thats a peaceful artists residence","story":"It can be bleak in winter but it’s always beautiful, and it’s a place that inspires you to be creative, and ambitious, says the owner, Caroline WisemanCaroline Wiseman was enjoying her morning dip in the sea off Aldeburgh, Suffolk where two brick towers once served as sailor’s lookouts, when an epiphany struck. “I noticed a ‘for sale’ sign on the south tower and fell into reverie, dreaming about how it would make a wonderful place for artists to work,” she says. When the owner suggested that she bought the tower and his 18th-century house behind it, she jettisoned caution and said yes. “I’d been looking for somewhere to buy: this place is unique.”Since she set up her first gallery at home in south London, Wiseman has always been an advocate of living with the art that she sells. But the Aldeburgh Beach Lookout is no conventional gallery, “It’s a place where artists can come for a week’s residency. We ask them to respond to the setting in innovative ways, with dance, film, sculpture or poetry,” she says. She also invites artists to stay in the pastel-hued house which she shares with her partner, Francis Carnwath, a former deputy director of the Tate.Built in the mid-19th century, the tower served as a lookout for locals to spot ships in trouble. Later, the tower and adjoining boathouse were used for storage by fishermen. When Wiseman first saw the lookout it was “wind-bashed” but beguiling. “For 30 years the author Laurens van der Post used the second-floor room for writing. It was untouched,” says Wiseman, who preserved the original feel of the interior, with its vertiginous metal staircase. She made few changes to the house, apart from knocking through to the nextdoor cottage, bought from the same owner. “We took a section of wall out of the first floor to link the sitting room with my office,” she explains. On the ground floor a door leads from the dining room to the living room in the cottage.On a midsummer’s day, the interior is uncluttered, welcoming. The walls and floors are painted white and sunshine floods through the new French windows, which open from the cottage on to the shingle beach. Throughout the house you find heirlooms and antiques, including folkish pieces found in upstate New York, where Wiseman used to live, mixed with contemporary art, ceramics and sculpture and 20th-century work by artists such as Terry Frost, some for sale by appointment. “Art isn’t a commodity: it’s about stories, the ideas behind pieces and creating an emotional connection with them,” says Wiseman. “I’ve always believed it’s easier to convey that in a domestic setting.”One of her favourite spots is the sheltered terrace, dominated by a face sculpture by Henry Piper made from bicycle parts with car lights for eyes, their glint visible from afar. “This is my spot for reading, thinking, what I call zezzing,” says Wiseman. She was drawn to Aldeburgh by its cultural atmosphere and her exhibitions never shy away from mind-stretching themes. The latest, Einstein and Picasso, draws parallels between the ways in which the artist and scientist viewed space and time: Picasso through Cubism, Einstein relativity.The indefatigable Wiseman has even written a play about power in the art world (key characters include Damien Hirst and Tracey Emin) which made its debut at the Edinburgh Festival. The graphic black-and-white painting in the dining room is a prop from the play. “I’d sold a piece and needed something punchy to fill the gap,” says Wiseman. From here, glass doors lead to the kitchen where Wiseman stripped paint off the walls for a rustic farmhouse effect. A wide cabinet came from Wiseman’s previous home in south London, along with the Aga, which was dismantled and painstakingly reassembled. “We are always entertaining so it’s ideal for slow cooking fish we’ve bought on the beach,” she says. In summer, guests spill out into the boathouse.Many former residents, including Clara Drummond, who won the BP Portrait Prize, have gone on to find success. Drummond’s striking drawing of a horse hangs in the sitting room, where windows look on to the tower. “We encourage our artists to experiment,” says Wiseman. It is a remit that has lured even established artists. Tai Shan Schierenberg (another BP prize winner), the Turner Prize nominee Alison Wilding and Royal Academicians Eileen Cooper, Sir Peter Blake and sculptor Nigel Hall have found inspiration in the tower where van der Post’s room is furnished evocatively with a Suffolk chair, table and candlestick.Every residency culminates in a show. In summer, bellinis flow and visitors are asked to write something “about the meaning of existence” on the pebbles piled on a wooden table outside. “We took a gamble when we moved here but it’s paid off,” reflects Wiseman. “It can be bleak in winter but it’s always beautiful… It’s a place that inspires you to be creative, and ambitious.”Einstein and Picasso: Revolutionaries in Space and Time is on from 7 to 27 July, (aldeburghbeachlookout).

The pins that were holding it together had been ripped out, tearing tendons and fracturing the bone.“In my mind I knew it was all over then, the pain was so severe I couldn’t breathe,” he recalls of the incident. “Things went downhill from there.”He attempted to continue his job, but after a few weeks Kiff’s senior officer made it clear he was in no position to function effectively in what was a war zone. He was flown back to his base in Germany where he found his problems shelved as the rest of the regiment began a move back to the UK. The injury also meant that a pending promotion was off the table because he was now considered unfit for duty. Serious injury often signals the end of a career in the armed forces but making the transition back to civilian life can be a very difficult process for both the service person affected and their family.With little external support and constant chronic pain he began to sink into severe depression, which soon had an impact on his relationship.“I knew Mike was struggling badly from the calls we had when he was in Afghanistan, but when he returned to base it began to fall apart almost from the moment he walked through the door. He was no longer the same man who had gone away,” says wife Linda. The couple had met while Mike was on leave in Bournemouth, married in 2006 and have two children.As the barracks emptied out around them, their problems were low priority. However, Mike had some good fortune when a medical officer recommended a break at Brydon House, a recently opened personnel recovery centre that had received major funding from The Royal British Legion.“I had physiotherapy, received specialist counselling and found people who were prepared to listen to my problems. It was a completely different level of support, a hundred times better,” he says.After a lengthy recovery process, Mike was medically discharged and the family returned to Bournemouth from Germany. Unfortunately, their problems worsened. They found themselves homeless and were forced to move in with Linda’s parents. Meanwhile, Mike was jobless, in severe pain and on antidepressants. Linda took a job working nights. Their relationship deteriorated rapidly.“I had no one to turn to,” says Linda. “I’m Mike’s support system, of course, so I took the brunt of it. He was jobless for a year and I was working full time. Our roles changed completely, which only added to the stress. It wasn’t a healthy situation but I discovered I could also get support from the Legion. Until then I thought they were just fundraisers.“They advised me to adapt my thought process towards him. I talked to them on a number of occasions and they were always a huge help. We had hit a wall in our marriage and their support was crucial to us getting through it.”“My issues had begun to affect our relationship and we were struggling,” agrees Mike. “The Legion were there to support us. We were both able to talk to people about what was going on. I was able to get anything from a sympathetic ear to practical financial guidance and help finding a job. Linda got advice about how to manage me because I was depressed and angry.”Slowly, with support from the Legion, the couple have rebuilt their lives. Mike now works as a civilian instructor teaching fibre optics to military personnel and Linda has a job in retail. Mike is still on medication and has good days and bad, but knows he can always pick up the phone and talk to someone.In 2017 the couple ran the London Marathon to raise funds for the organisation. “It was a way of saying thank you and having a common goal also helped reconnect us,” says Mike. “I think it’s safe to say we’d probably be orced without them and if that had happened I don’t know what would have happened to me. It would have been the final straw.”To find out more about The Royal British Legion click here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4cdcfbea381b90fcb4bc91ac04e8c731cd25133d/0_59_944_566/master/944.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=23fe65b3e9c87c0d4cf94ed833b0701e","title":"home listening mendelssohn solitude dudok quartet suk jonathan plowright natalya romaniw","story":"• The prospect of listening to music written in times of personal grief, desolation and loneliness hardly filled me with joy when I picked up the Dudok Quartet’s latest recording entitled Solitude (Resonus), but I was wrong to be so wary. The playing from these fine Amsterdam instrumentalists had me gripped right from the start of Mendelssohn’s febrile Quartet in F minor, Op 80, his desperate farewell to his beloved sister and fellow composer Fanny, who died in 1847.Much of Mendelssohn’s chamber music burns bright, driven by a brilliant, vital energy that here is turned into scurrying despair. The writing, beautifully crafted as ever, is nevertheless lost and dazed and shot through with an infinite sadness. Within a few months, Mendelssohn himself was dead, aged just 38. The Dudok Quartet get right to the heart of this piece, unsparing in the frantic opening allegro and sweetly tender in the adagio, before plunging into the abyss of the finale. It’s a very fine performance.They pair the Mendelssohn with Weinberg’s uncompromising Quartet No 3, Op 14, from 1944. Weinberg lost most of his family in the Holocaust and was imprisoned by the Soviets. Every movement of this piece speaks of his bleak existence, none more so than in the andante sostenuto, a miniature concerto for the first violin, exquisitely played by Judith van Driel.• Tragedy also struck the Czech composer Josef Suk, when his wife Otilie died prematurely in 1905, hardly a year after her father, Dvořák, his teacher. British pianist Jonathan Plowright has won praise for his recordings of composers as erse as Paderewski, Melcer, Brahms and Handel and now, in an album entitled simply Suk (Hyperion), he turns his attention to four groups of sun-filled miniatures written before that dark year. The music is quite lavishly overheated and histrionic, but there is no denying Plowright’s formidable technique and total command of this repertoire.• If you missed Radio 3’s broadcast of Scottish Opera’s Eugene Onegin, catch up on iPlayer.

The pro-independence marchers walked the two miles from King’s Park in Stirling to Bannockburn. More events are planned in Dundee and Edinburgh later in 2018.

People didn’t understand what the referendum would mean. And now, two years down the line, it’s still not clear what we were voting for.“They were sold this lie about the NHS,” said Ankle, referring to the widely discredited leavers’ claim that it would make £350m a week available for the health service. At the march with a friend who had travelled from Scotland, she also said she was concerned that the Brexit campaign had played to prejudices. “When I was listening to the campaign, it just seemed a very racially motivated campaign, and I didn’t like it.”“I’m 86 and I remember why we went into Europe: people wanted to prevent another war. During the campaign, no one pointed out the advantages of the European Union. Wherever I go, I travel all over the world, people ask me, ‘why did you vote for Brexit? What are you doing?’ I call it the biggest self-inflicted harm in British history.”“I feel absolutely devastated by Brexit, and I wanted to stand up and be counted. The signs didn’t take very long – they took about a week,” said Isabel, who didn’t want to give her full name.“I remember, before we were in the Common Market, you were lucky if you had one peach a week, because that was all you could afford, because they were imported from Italy and you had to pay the Common Market tariffs. It was the same with all vegetables.“It’s also the idea of Europe: I studied languages, I have friends in Germany and other places in Europe.”The 44-year-old software engineer dragged his two children away from their school’s summer fair to attend, the first time any of them had been to a protest.“Dad said you shouldn’t go to the fair, there are more important things,” said Magnus. His sister, Isla, said her dad’s arguments had convinced her, even though she regretted missing the fair. “I was worried that not enough people would come,” she said. Ben Moseley said: “We have big problems in this country, and we can’t ignore the fact that many people are very unhappy. But Brexit will only make things worse. Separating from the EU is a huge distraction from what’s really important in this country.”“This march is about having a people’s vote. It’s not about whether you voted leave or remain, it started with a referendum and it can only fairly finish with a people’s vote when we know what the options are. A yes or no vote didn’t go into the minutiae, and now that we are into that, what was promised is not appearing. We were sold a lie.Several of my friends voted for Brexit, and I don’t know two of them who voted for the same reason. So saying ‘the people have spoken’ is a slightly misleading statement.“Its not easy explaining to him what the European Union is, but I think he’s got some of the idea now.” Felix’s mother is German and Lee is Canadian, they met in the UK and made it their home. “As a Commonwealth citizen, I could vote in the referendum, but my wife as a European couldn’t.”“The funding for support for young people has been horrific since the Tories came to power, and Brexit is only going to make things worse.”“Really we’d like Brexit to stop, because I think it’s a disastrous, suicidal idea ... I profited from the EU by living and working in Germany, and didn’t think at the time that I needed German citizenship I now very much regret that I didn’t apply for it.“We were lied to when we voted in the Scottish independence referendum. We were told that if we voted for independence, we’d be straight out of the EU, and the only way to guarantee staying in the EU was to stay in the union. And a number of people foolishly believed that, and I think a lot of those people are very cross now.”“Its a pile of bollocks, really. I thought of a whole load of things to say (on my banner), but that sums it up.“I’m not really political,” she said. “I feel deeply ashamed and horrified about what’s happening, and I don’t feel Brexit is representative of what we are as a country.”“I think, really, we are a genuinely good-hearted, multicultural, generous people, and I think we are showing ourselves up.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5a95fb16beae6ddda99ed0b99355c3a9e7326f8f/789_174_4078_2448/master/4078.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=782abb234b3a64c3d091b2a464e0c0b8","title":"hardline tories tell theresa may get ready for no deal brexit","story":"Ex-cabinet ministers among those who say leaving EU with no trade deal must be an optionTheresa May has been urged by hardline Brexiters to speed up preparations for a “no-deal” Brexit to put pressure on Brussels during withdrawal negotiations.Sixty former cabinet ministers, MPs, economists and business figures signed a letter to the prime minister urging her to issue orders to departments to accelerate planning for Britain to operate under World Trade Organization rules if a deal cannot be done. They argue that in order to have “real leverage in the Brexit endgame” the UK must reserve the right to walk away without a trade deal “and take with it the £39bn it has offered to pay as part of a orce settlement”. Their intervention came after more than 100,000 people marched through London on the second anniversary of the EU referendum to demand a fresh vote on the terms of the Brexit deal. Politicians from across the political spectrum took part in the People’s Vote rally on Saturday as the isions over withdrawal from the European Union showed no sign of narrowing.Signatories to the letter, organised by Economists for Free Trade (EFT) and released on Saturday, include the former chancellor Lord Lawson, ex-environment secretary Owen Paterson and one-time Wales secretary John Redwood, plus Wetherspoon boss Tim Martin and Sir Rocco Forte, chairman of Rocco Forte Hotels. In it they urge May to warn her European counterparts that despite their “intransigent and punitive stance” they cannot delay or block Brexit.They go on to say: “We believe you could also make clear that your preferred outcome is a free trade deal between Britain and the EU, an arrangement that is to the mutual benefit of both parties. “Britain is a great champion of free trade and looks forward to striking free trade deals with countries beyond the shores of the continent once Brexit has taken effect.“However, in light of the reluctance of the EU swiftly to secure a free trade deal – eminently possible since we have been trading freely with the EU for more than 40 years – we suggest you make clear your belief that the UK has now to prepare urgently for the possibility that no agreement is forthcoming. “Accordingly, we believe now is the time to issue instructions to UK authorities to accelerate their preparations for ‘no deal’ and a move to a World Trade Deal under WTO rules that, after all, govern the vast majority of global trading arrangements today.” Other signatories to the letter include Conservative MPs Peter Bone, Sir Christopher Chope, Philip Davies, Richard Drax, Philip Hollobone, Andrea Jenkyns, Anne Main, Nigel Mills, Henry Smith and William Wragg. The letter insists that Britain can “flourish”, even without a free trade deal, because of the benefits of leaving the EU, adding: “This would give the chancellor ample scope to increase spending on priority public services such as the NHS while reducing the too high UK tax burden.” A Downing Street source said: “We are confident of getting a good deal that delivers for every part of the UK and allows us to take back control of our money, rules and borders.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b77809a67d02f46aa4c56171968bf02c3533915d/0_92_5116_3070/master/5116.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7a02813be6c1b328f3f151a06e42a51b","title":"social housing no longer option young families","story":"Struggling young families have seen their access to social housing fall as fast as their chances of buying a home, according to new analysis of the housing crisis.The shrinking stock of social housing has seen the share of young families who live in it fall by around a third over the past 20 years, with 400,000 fewer living in council and housing association homes. It comes despite the rising need for low-cost homes.The latest research, carried out by the Resolution Foundation, highlights another aspect of the intergenerational ide. It found that the decline in social renting by young families has coincided with rising levels of “housing stress”, as the proportion of families spending more than a third of their disposable income on housing costs rises across the population.About one in 10 low and middle-income families now face housing stress. However, younger families in the bottom half of the income distribution have been hit with the sharpest increases, with one in five households headed by an under 35-year-old being forced to pay what many regard as an unaffordable amount for their home.The fall in access to home ownership for the young – as a result of rising prices and stagnant wages – has become a major issue for the government, with senior Tories desperate to see purchasing a house become a possibility once again for new families.The research shows that poorer young families also lack the option of social housing. The share of young people in the bottom half of the income distribution living in social rented accommodation has fallen as fast as home ownership. Both fell by more than 10 percentage points between 1996 and 2016.This is partly as a result of the Right to Buy policy, which saw those in council houses allowed to buy their home at a discount. It has meant that older occupiers of social housing had access to properties and were helped into home ownership. A depleted stock of social housing has never been replenished, leaving the young increasingly reliant on private rentals that come with high costs and insecure tenancies.In fact, the research finds that for many young adults their best hope of living in social housing is to stay in their parents’ home, as part of the so-called “boomerang generation”.There are hopes that a long-term decline in social housing is beginning to turn around. Last year ministers vowed to build more homes for social rent, backed by the promise of £2bn of support.Lindsay Judge, senior policy analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said: “Britain has a proud history of providing social housing. But the sector has been in decline for decades and is too often ignored in national debates about housing.“It’s welcome that the government has finally recognised the need for social housing and that we are talking about the sector again after the tragedy of Grenfell last year. But there needs to be a lasting shift that sees Britain’s social housing providers rise to the challenge of providing the homes that so many young families in particular need.”Prime minister Theresa May has made housing a priority of her domestic agenda, but there are concerns on Tory benches that Brexit has led to a lack of action in other areas.A government-backed commission has concluded that action is needed to speed up the rate of housebuilding. The review by former cabinet minister Oliver Letwin, to be published tomorrow, finds that thousands more British bricklayers need to be trained to help meet building targets.It suggests that a shortage of British bricklayers will have a “significant biting constraint” on government plans to boost the number of new homes built from 220,000 a year to 300,000.It also concludes that housebuilders are limiting the number of newly-built homes released to prevent a glut on the market hitting prices. Letwin says developers could increase the choice of design, size and tenure of new homes without impacting on the local market and therefore speed up the rate at which houses are built and sold."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ccf2550dfb7029d7eb1cf0f351697433de9f85b7/422_60_1381_829/master/1381.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4610d163adaa12701f6ff69e54cb4f1e","title":"england australia fifth odi preview","story":"Never before have England inflicted a 5-0 whitewash on Australia in any format. But with the weather in Manchester set fair, the pitch looking flat and the opposition flatter, they could well be reaching for the paintbrushes on Sunday.Indeed, such has been the one‑way nature of this series that Ashton Agar, among Tim Paine’s beleaguered tourists, was positively drooling with envy when asked for his take on the cricket being played right now by Eoin Morgan’s No 1-ranked side.“It’s just their confidence, their self-belief ... they ooze it out there,” he said. “They are playing like a team where everyone knows their role. They back themselves and each other to go out and do it. They have set the benchmark, no doubt.”Agar’s analysis is hard to take issue with – and refreshing to hear from an Australian spinner given Nathan Lyon’s public pronouncements before last winter’s Ashes – with it difficult to escape the notion that unless the home side’s performance at Old Trafford dips like the sell-out crowd is expected to when England versus Panama is broadcast, 5-0 looks on.England’s batting is firing in such a way that 263 runs are needed to break their own world record of 1,617 in a five-match series. It is allowing some experimentation in the bowling too, with Sam Curran potentially making his debut – Mark Wood missed voluntary training – and Liam Plunkett a chance to return for Craig Overton.It is worth remembering, however, that this side were in the same situation against Pakistan two years ago, one game away from the clean sweep. The visitors pinched a win in Cardiff (one they would repeat in the next summer’s Champions Trophy), leaving the Test side that beat India in 1959 and the 50-over one that toured Zimbabwe in 2001 as the only England men’s teams to win a series 5-0.Sure enough, Adil Rashid, the leading wicket-taker with 11 scalps and fresh from having passed Graeme Swann’s 104 career wickets to become England’s all-time leading 50-over spinner, offered a professional opinion on the prospects of such a feat, albeit after initially allowing himself to dream a touch.“It would mean quite a lot, whitewashing anybody, South Africa or India or whoever,” he said. “It would be credit to the team and coaches, all that hard work of the past couple of years. But we’re taking it a game at a time, it’s just another game.“We’re not talking about that right now, we’re just concentrating on the game. Once it’s done and if you have the whitewash, then you have things to talk about. But we’re not.”While the chat around the England team has more surrounded which players make way when Ben Stokes and Chris Woakes return – they are hoping to face India next month in what should be a serious increase in intensity – Australia’s plight has been couched by the suspensions of Steve Smith and David Warner and injuries to Mitchell Starc, Pat Cummins and Josh Hazlewood.Rashid does not think this quintet would have made a difference. “Them players were still playing in Australia Smith, Warner, Cummins, Hazelwood and whoever else. We won 4-1 there and here’s 4-0. So it’s very similar.”The two sides last met at Old Trafford in 2015 when England were still coming to terms with their collective 50-over epiphany and lost a series decider by eight wickets. Starc and Cummins steamed in that day, the latter forcing Morgan to retire with concussion, and Mitchell Marsh, whose absence is also felt now, claimed four victims.Five days earlier, on the same ground, Rashid and Moeen Ali spun England to a win by sharing five scalps after a fine James Taylor hundred. A similar hold is in place now – they have 19 Australian wickets between them at 20 runs apiece – such that as far as the tourists are concerned, they are not so much the Chuckle Brothers (as per Jos Buttler in the match-day programme) but more the Brothers Grimm.England remain in similar shape personnel-wise – the cruel retirement of Taylor notwithstanding – but, as Agar noted, their confidence has sky-rocketed.Australia’s survivors are Agar, Aaron Finch and Glenn Maxwell, although the latter looks set to miss out again with the shoulder injury suffered in Nottingham still restricting him.It is hard not to feel sorry for their captain. Paine’s task has been an unenviable combination of peace envoy and leader of a callow squad (the team that lost at Chester-le-Street was their least capped since 1986). Little wonder basic errors have slipped into his usually velvet wicketkeeping – see the drop off Alex Hales on Thursday – while the right-hander badly needs a score with the bat.Is Paine, 35 runs from four innings, to be rewarded for dutifully picking up the pieces after the ball-tampering scandal by earning the dubious title of the first Australian captain to be whitewashed 5-0 by England? He seems a champion bloke, as they say Down Under, but this game is a sod sometimes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5a9d3d2bd8eefa20670ccd58fe21db1d1ba18227/0_134_4096_2457/master/4096.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0cdcb17b4afb5ae3a600e1a514ccca49","title":"lewis hamilton pole french grand prix f1 mercedes","story":"A tale of two teams defined qualifying for the French Grand Prix and while for Mercedes the storyline was one they might have written themselves, for the once mighty McLaren, Paul Ricard is proving to be a pot-boiler they would rather was pulped.Lewis Hamilton took pole, the first driver to claim the top spot at the race on its return after a 10-year absence. He was pushed to the limit by his Mercedes team-mate, Valtteri Bottas, but the Briton nailed an exceptional final lap to deny the Finn, securing a one-two for the team. Better still, they were well clear of Sebastian Vettel in the Ferrari who was in third, in front of the Red Bull of Max Verstappen.For Hamilton it is his third pole of the season and his first since Spain. “I am happy with it but I am always trying for perfection,” he said. “There was time left on the track but I am really happy with pole. It is great to be back there.”McLaren, however, have now not won since Brazil in 2012 and have spent the weekend defending themselves against reports of dissatisfaction within the team, with no reprieve on the track.That they are in desperate need of improvement was clear when Fernando Alonso and Stoffel Vandoorne both went out in Q1, in 16th and 18th places. They were 1.4 seconds down on Verstappen’s Red Bull, powered by the same Renault engine, their worst qualifying performance of the year.The racing director, Eric Boullier, insisted on Friday that he would not be resigning but as things stand they appear to have no answers on their lacklustre performance. “This is Formula 1. You need the right package and the right place,” said Alonso. “These last races have not been good for us but amid all this disaster we are seventh in the championship, so we must be doing something right.”The scale of their task was illustrated by Charles Leclerc making a superb run to put his Sauber into eighth on the grid.For Mercedes this was the comeback they wanted. With a fifth place to Sebastian Vettel’s win in Canada, Hamilton suffered a 15-point swing against him in the championship fight and now trails the German by a point. Crucially, the team were able to employ their upgraded engine here and it delivered, and Hamilton is in the best possible position to once again wrest the title lead from Vettel.Hamilton had looked in fine form throughout the session and pulled it together during Q3 with some clinical finishing. He had gone quickest on his first hot run in Q3, a tenth up on Bottas and two-tenths clear of Vettel. However when they ran again, Bottas threw down the gauntlet with an exceptionally sharp lap on his final run. Hamilton responded, nailed the final sector and finished with a time of 1min 30.029sec, one-tenth up on the Finn and with Vettel scruffy on his final lap, unable to improve, he was left floundering four-tenths back.Hamilton’s third pole of the season is his first at the French Grand Prix, having taken part in the race twice before when it was held at Magny-Cours in 2007 and 2008. This 75th career pole comes on the first time he has competed at Paul Ricard, which hosted the race 14 times between 1971 and 1990 and was last won by Alain Prost for Ferrari.If they can carry their pace into the race, and their long runs had looked good, Hamilton will once again be in a position to exploit it from the front of the grid and dictate strategy, likely to be a one-stop.Although open in his concern by the threat he expected from Ferrari, Hamilton proved to have the car he required when it mattered. Once again finding the correct temperature tyre operating window was a key ingredient and over the single lap Hamilton and Mercedes had their rubber and car working in harmony.The final runs were interrupted after Romain Grosjean, at his home grand prix, lost the back end of his Haas going through turn three, suspending the session and he will start in 10th place. Daniel Ricciardo was in fifth with Kimi Raikkonen in sixth. Renault’s Carlos Sainz Jr was in seventh and the Haas’s of Kevin Magnussen in ninth. The Force Indias of Esteban Ocon and Sergio Pérez were in 11th and 13th place Renault’s Nico Hülkenberg in 12th in fornt of the Toro Roso of Pierre Gasly and the Sauber of Marcus Ericsson.Williams, another once mighty British team, also continued to struggle, with Sergey Sirotkin and Lance Stroll in 19th and 20th. Brendon Hartley in the Toro Rosso, qualified in 17th but will start from the back of the grid having taken a 35-place penalty for using a full new set of power unit components."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/97174f49f05ce4e75a5e5c8b88ae32f174b671c9/0_31_4114_2469/master/4114.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ee45c7ad021369e7c04f3272df0bb6fb","title":"england danny cipriani south africa newlands","story":"The venue for Danny Cipriani’s first Test start for a decade was fitting. Newlands was hosting what may turn out to be its final international and the England fly-half had a last opportunity to salvage his Test career. The conditions were ideal for England, a saturated pitch ensuring a slow game in which Chris Robshaw could act as a mop, but not for Cipriani, who could have been forgiven for trying too hard in an attempt to impress Eddie Jones. He did not touch the ball for the first eight minutes and only received it 14 times in the match, compared to his half-back partner Ben Youngs’s 91, but it was an evening about quality rather than quantity.Barry John’s guiding principle was a fly-half should wait for the moment and not get impatient the longer it took to come. It arrived for Cipriani nine minutes from the end when England were five points ahead, an advantage that the evidence of the previous two weeks indicated needed to be improved. England had won a turnover when, not for the first time, South Africa failed to deal with one of Youngs’s box kicks.England had been far better on the floor than they had in Johannesburg and Bloemfontein, more comfortable with the relative lack of continuity and system-straining pace. Robshaw and Tom Curry dominated, backed up by Joe Launchbury, but until the 72nd minute the most disappointing feature of England’s performance had been their failure to make more of turnovers, too often kicking without scanning first.When Cipriani received the ball 40 metres out going from left to right, he looked for the support outside him but it was too far away. Handré Pollard was bearing down on him but Cipriani was seized by inspiration rather than his opposite number, scenting space in front of Jonny May.Cipriani’s running angle favoured a kick with his weaker right foot, so he checked inside and struck the ball with the outside of his left boot as he ducked into Pollard’s challenge, knowing that he could not avoid contact. It ensured he could not only get sufficient weight on the ball but that it would land well infield.It would probably not have worked for Mike Brown on the other wing, but May is one of the quickest players in the game and he reached the ball with a metre of the in-goal area to spare. Cipriani’s reaction was to hug the wing and hold on: he had come in from the cold.He had been chosen for that moment. Until then his performance had been more notable for defence than attack: he made five tackles, performed a neat wraparound in the opening half after Owen Farrell had played first receiver to free Brown, cursed two short passes to Curry and Robshaw that failed and was surprisingly overlooked for a penalty‑kick to touch that Elliot Daly kicked out on the full.Before this tour, Cipriani had been overlooked by Jones, who felt that if the fly-half were not first choice, there were more ideal players to make up the quota of 10s in the squad. The England head coach did not say so but it was as if Jones was judging Cipriani on his reputation for not holding back to coaches. He proved too much for the Martin Johnson regime to handle and was never more than a peripheral figure under Stuart Lancaster.Cipriani has never seen his role as a pupil in a classroom receiving instruction and it is an indictment of the game that it struggles to cope with players who are too often dismissed as mavericks. Jones may have a reputation as a martinet but he has never been someone who thinks he has all the answers and he needed Cipriani in a team that was happier carrying out a gameplan than reacting.Cipriani was left out of the first Test 23. It seemed then that it was perhaps a test to see whether he would react petulantly. His presence on the bench the next week was evidence he passed the test and when he was interviewed after yesterday’s match, the player bound for Gloucester and a head coach who encourages his players to question him, Johan Ackermann, wanted to talk about the team rather than\u0026nbsphimself.Cipriani has been through too much in the last decade to take anything for granted but at 30 and more olden than golden, he has learned to count to 10, delivering the crowning moment in a match he had spent largely in the background."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b12cc0192d393bb102059442a139afa09d9ddc9a/0_1283_8424_5054/master/8424.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4da247fa1b4039f7df3f0d34ec15b844","title":"picture resort from sandy beaches to stunning art galleries in st ives","story":"The Tate St Ives extension gives art lovers a perfect excuse to revisit this beguiling townSt Ives is a British seaside resort like no other. It has sandy beaches, the paradisal kind Brits dream of all winter and habitually get on aeroplanes for. This old fishing town in western Cornwall has not one, but five of them, and on these pebble-free playgrounds you will find retro cafes and chi-chi, cocktail-shaking restaurants. It has utilitarian shops, too, selling buckets and spades and Tupperware, and fancy ones. You can buy jewellery and in one lifestyle boutique you can pick up anything from a nature book to a designer beanie.There is something for everyone on the food front, too. There are more than 110 places to eat in this far-flung spot. You’ve got seaside staples, including fish and chips, ice-cream, burgers and pasty outlets, some with a modern twist. Take the pasty, the miners’ lunchbox staple. The Cornish Bakery does a cosmopolitan Travelling Empanada and even a sweet potato and feta version. But thin-crust traditionalists can default to a cheese and onion from SH Ferell \u0026amp Son, the tiny family-run bakery on the corner of historic Fore Street.Ice-cream lovers can get a timeless 99 or organic clotted-cream concoctions from Moomaid of Zennor. Be warned, though. The seagulls are on to Moomaid. When I came out of the ice-cream shack with a double cone of Shipwreck (dulce de leche caramel and honeycomb, oh the bliss) one swooped down and had its beak in it before I could cry Daphne du Maurier. Kids, meanwhile, can go to a children’s theatre show, take a boat to see seals or a drop-in art workshop, or go on a ghost trail.Appealing, you might say, but no different to any other British seaside resort that combines nostalgia and stylish consumerism. I’m thinking of Rock, further east along the north Cornish coast, Southwold in Suffolk or Whitstable in Kent – just without the sandy beaches.But what no other seaside destination can match is the range of artistic and cultural offerings of St Ives, which is not a shrine to art but a dynamic, creative hub. We spotted real live artists drinking in the 16th-century Sloop Inn on the harbour after a hard day in the studio. Sand, surf and culture, that’s St Ives’s unique offering. Kids can get their bucket and spade fix and teenagers can sunbathe or surf.The curious or creative can throw a pot at the famous Leach Pottery or drop into a life-drawing class at the St Ives School of Painting. Or do what we did, and admire the work of St Ives artists, from Ben Nicholson to Naum Gabo and Patrick Heron their work is now on permanent display in the new Tate St Ives extension. Our trip was prompted by the Patrick Heron retrospective showing there. Heron is a sort of God in this westerly artists’ colony, and during our short visit my husband and I encountered him in all kinds of ways.Heron was all about intensity, sometimes joy and always colour. His paintings are an invitation to engage. “The picture is not the vehicle of meaning,” he once said, “the picture is the meaning.” Heron’s work is not hung chronologically in Tate St Ives, because, according to the curator Andrew Wilson, it was formally consistent. For the visitor, this is liberating: there is no pressure to be clever, or to spot the development of his artistic practice. Just enjoy the work, experience it, Wilson seems to be saying.There are many locals who seem touched by Heron’s zest for life. One of them, Tamsin Thompson, runs the SILCo Sea Rooms, an all-day tapas and cocktail and gastrobar that feels like a ship’s cabin. Sit up at the window seats overlooking the harbour, and you feel like you are on the prow of a ship. Thompson’s three sons are the local producers of the first-rate St Ives gin, served with a slice of grapefruit as a counterpoint to the sweet botanicals, including Bladderwrack, a local seaweed and a splendid word. Thompson is a contemporary of Heron’s daughters, who I met at the exhibition, and she used to play at Eagle’s Nest, Heron’s home for 40 years in the village of Zennor further along the West Penwith peninsula, as a child. He was always laughing, she tells me, and wore purple shirts.There was more colour in work by local artists hanging on the walls at Pedn Olva hotel, a retro gem with modern flourishes that presides from a granite rockface over St Ives Bay. It’s the place to go for a fresh lobster and prawn roll, or a sundowner in either the rooftop bar or the terrace bar. The views have fused into a single memory of diffused light and strips of sea-sky-sand. The views got me in a pickle. Our shower had a big window, also overlooking the Celtic sea which, each afternoon, was choppy. In the morning, it was crashing against the rocks. I spent a long time staring out of that window, which I could have spent eating more scones and Cornish clotted cream. It’s true what they say about the light here: it is soft, and mesmerising. It makes you yearn for something, and made me wish I could paint.But then we went to Barbara Hepworth’s studio, and I wished I could sculpt. There is a permanent installation of her monumental sculptures in the subtropical garden. One of the Heron daughters told me there is a new head gardener there, and that he has revived Hepworth’s original planting plans. The space is meditative and energising.It is impossible to get your fill of light and sky and sea in St Ives. The trick is to find different ways to experience it. One way is to ride the St Ives Bay Line that hugs the craggy coast. We took the broad gauge train for all of three-minutes from St Ives up the track to Carbis Bay, where we disembarked for the airy and stylish Boskerris Hotel. We toasted more light and sky and sea with a glass of wine on the luxe deck overlooking the Bay. Fortified, we walked back across the beach and down a winding, shaded path that hugged the coast to take those scones and clotted cream in the café overlooking Porthmeor beach. Surfers love it here. Sand-averse sybarites can repair to the buzzing Porthmeor beach café, which does interesting tapas and seafood and – a glam touch this – boasts heated eating pods complete with blanket for chilly knees.Walk on this beach, and you’ll want to keep walking, as we did, setting off on the South West Coast Path. It was a five-mile, reputedly demanding, walk to Zennor, where Heron lived until his death in 1999. I’d heard the name Zennor so many times by now, it had cast a sort of spell. There is a pub there, the Tinners Arms, recommended by an artist we met in Helston, a rather more self-effacing artists’ hub 30 miles inland, which is home to studios and a world-class initiative called CAST (Cornubian Arts and Science Trust) featuring international artists whose work is currently on show in erse and wonderful locations throughout Cornwall.We didn’t get to Zennor, because we had a talk to get to about Patrick Heron in Mousehole, a painting-perfect harbour town that is home to the Newlyn Art School. You can do art courses here, should you fancy it. There’s a pub called the Ship Inn, where, from the deck of the garden, you can admire the light, again. Then go back to St Ives and have a look at Heron’s “Mousehole, 1946”. His daughters told me that he only went to Mousehole once, and the fishing village didn’t have happy memories for him. But it made an impression, for personal reasons, as St Ives, and Heron, will on you. Accommodation provided by Pedn Olva (doubles from £215 per night) and at the Boskerris hotel (doubles from £160 per night). Patrick Heron is showing at Tate St Ives until 30 September. For art classes, see St Ives School of Painting and Newlyn School of Art. Groundwork, a series of exhibitions and events featuring international artists, takes places across Cornwall until September 2018 as part of CAST. See c-a-s-t.org.uk for venues.

I like the silly significance of it all, the talking points, the jokes, the drama, the new personalities that emerge as heroes or villains from each match…I enjoy it, except when England play. And this is not because Jesse Lingard scuffs the ball, or Raheem Sterling does a lot of running around and not a lot of scoring. It’s because of the commentary. Radio 5 Live’s usually excellent pundits, with their expert analysis and informed yet exasperated soundbites, somehow magically disappear, replaced by some rabid Engerland-bots banging on about missed opportunities and shoulda-been decisions, like overly proud parents watching their offspring in the school nativity. (“Why isn’t our Marcus playing Joseph? He’d drop the baby Jesus bang in the manger.”)It’s true that its commentators – John Murray and Chris Waddle in this instance – are better than those on TV, and in our house we often watch matches with the sound down and 5 Live up. But even then, when it comes to England, it’s horrible. Every single moment is skewed by nationalism and too-high expectations. “That was never a penalty. Should have been six goals, never mind two. And, Harry’s done it! He’s done it for St George!!…” Grr. Utterly painful listening. (Plus, why does everyone on the BBC insist on calling Dele, Dele Alli, when he’s said that he doesn’t want to use his surname as he’s estranged from his parents? The name on his shirt is Dele, so what is the problem? Everyone manages to call Ronaldo, Ronaldo…)Still, other than during England games, 5 Live has been doing well. Kelly Cates has been a great host, working both afternoons and on 606, and Mark “Chappers” Chapman is as enjoyable a listen as ever. Robbie Savage slightly drives me mad, but he’s only on for half an hour at 8.30am, and to be honest, driving people mad is Savage’s USP. He has his mum on for her predictions, which I like: “How are you, mother?” “I’m fine thank you poppet, how are you? I’m giving Portugal to win 4-0.”In search of non-BBC analysis and some more fun, I’ve tried a few football podcasts this week. One of the best, and certainly one of the most popular, is The Totally Football Show with James Richardson. Richardson was presenter of the ’s football podcast for several years. (The ’s football podcast, currently daily because of the World Cup, is still excellent without him, with Max Rushden taking over the hot seat.) Richardson’s new venture is a class act, smooth and fun. The pundits are on point without showing off, and interesting facts are woven into the show. It would be nice to get a few more women on there, but this is an excellent daily World Cup\u0026nbsppodcast.On The Game, from the Times, Natalie Sawyer presents, and thus far no listener has had a heart attack because of her woman-ness. It’s straightforward and informative, but there’s not many laffs. For those, try Top Flight Time Machine: World Cup. This features middle-aged white guys Sam Delaney and Andy Dawson going through past World Cups for stats and giggles. Doesn’t sound like much, but this is a warm and very funny show. The show about Italia 90, where they came up with a new England mascot, had me properly laughing. (The mascot was called Mr Sausage, if you want to know.) This podcast is like a post-football conversation with two witty friends – you never quite know where it’s going, but it will definitely find the joke.Another upbeat pals conversation is Touchline Fracas. With much younger and mostly non-white presenters, the chat and analysis is so swift and funny you sometimes struggle to keep up. I love it. And then there’s Mission to Moscow, which has YouTube star Hugh Wizzy reporting for TalkSport, a surprisingly sweet show. On the day of the England game, he just talked to fans before and after the match. Nice.Radio 3 Breakfast: Into the ForestiPlayerOn every breakfast show last week, and in other programmes on the network, Radio 3 was busy exploring “the enchantment, escape and magical danger of forests”. (How lovely does that sound?) In the mornings, Petroc Trelawny broadcast live from five different forests across the UK: one in Northern Ireland, one in Scotland, one in Wales and two in England. There were slow radio moments that simply featured the sounds from the woodland, plus live performances from beneath the trees. No arguing politicians allowed. Gorgeous.A Mile in My ShoesAcastEmpathy seems ever more essential in these troubled times, but did you know that there is an Empathy Museum? Established by philosopher Roman Krznaric in London in 2015, the museum created an art show called A Mile In My Shoes, which toured the world and has now been turned into a podcast by ace production company Loftus Media. Best listened to while actually walking, these short pieces invite you into other people’s experiences and lives. Listen to the tale of a woman working on a lifeboat on the Thames, of a man losing his mind in hospital and others.ZigzagRadiotopiaA show with the admirable aims of changing capitalism, journalism and the lives of women in tech, this new podcast from the Radiotopia stable showcases two creaky-voiced women who used to work at the WNYC tech show: Manoush Zomorodi, the presenter, and Jen Poyant, the producer. They’re now starting their own company and this podcast tells the tale. A mixture of recorded phone conversations, snippets of real-life chats and traditional tell-the-story presenting, Zigzag seems a little self-obsessed at first, but should get more exciting as it continues."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dd84e2e39b4ac5870c61a1ab52055bd6cbfb7517/0_384_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=10472673534ba47aa11bdcedb6d38955","title":"pacific hymns the definitive hipster playlist","story":"Seattle, Portland and San Fran aren’t just cities – they’re states of mind, man. So if you’re looking for counterculture sounds, it’s here you’ll find songs that spoke for a generationImmersion in Seattle’s music scene begins minutes after disembarking at Sea-Tac, the city’s international airport, which houses a store devoted to the record company Sub Pop. In 1988, the then shoestring Sub Pop Records released Nirvana’s debut single it subsequently became as synonymous with Seattle as Motown is with Detroit. Opening our hipster playlist is Nirvana’s fourth single, Smells Like Teen Spirit, released three years later. It became a massive hit across the world, igniting the rock phenomenon that would transform Seattle, a hitherto obscure enclave in America’s far north-west, into an epicentre of cool.Previous generations of Seattle musicians took for granted that they would have to leave their hometown if they wanted a successful career. Arguably the greatest electric guitarist of all-time, Jimi Hendrix is up next – he was born and raised in Seattle, although only found fame after moving to London.Right now, Seattle’s music has never been so rich or erse. Witness the contrast of Fleet Foxes’ Sun it Rises, a yearning choral-Americana hymn to frontier spirits, with avant-hip-hop duo Shabazz Palaces. Shine a Light hails from their futuristic twin Quazarz album – released in 2017 by a certain indie record label with its own airport shop.Portland has become renowned in recent years for its ultra-progressive attitudes – as satirised by the comedy series Portlandia – but the city’s hippy roots have long attracted free-thinkers from all over America. Emerging from the city’s early 90s underground rock scene with his disarmingly catchy dark-folk confessionals was Elliott Smith. Here, we trace the Texan native’s troubled quest around Portland in Needle in the Hay.Other musicians who rocked up in Portland included feminist trio Sleater-Kinney, formed in the Washington state capital Olympia during the mid-90s, by guitarists Corin Tucker and Carrie Brownstein, alongside drummer Janet Weiss. From their 2015 comeback album, No Cities to Love confounds the adage that radical voices mellow with age – or, in the case of Portlandia co-creator Brownstein, fame.Next up, we have the Shins, who formed in New Mexico but became Portland residents following their 2002 breakthrough hit New Slang (as featured in the film Garden State). Then, Laura Veirs – who was called to the city via Colorado and the midwest to craft her contemplative modern-folk tapestries – offers a revelatory version of the Grateful Dead song Mountains of the Moon, from her latest album the Lookout.The Grateful Dead were, of course, a flagship band for 60s counterculture. From San Fran, tremors from the Summer of Love rippled up the west coast of the US – and then around the world. While the Dead were busy soundtracking Ken Kesey’s Acid Tests, the 1967 Haight-Ashbury scene’s commercial powerhouse was Jefferson Airplane, a relatively straightforward folk-rock band until the recruitment of siren vocalist Grace Slick. Her vocals on White Rabbit – with its exhortation to “feed your head” – alongside other songs, such as Somebody to Love, helped the tracks become anthems for the ages.A decade later, the punk revolution was under way, and San Francisco’s North Beach district harboured the latest manifestation of the city’s nonconformist heritage: the Dead Kennedys. They deployed caustic satire in songs like California Über Alles to debunk mainstream American culture and politics.Our penultimate track is Why Won’t You Stay, by one of San Francisco’s greatest songwriters, Mark Eitzel, chronicler of the city’s luckless and heartbroken for the past 30 years – both with legendary band American Music Club, notably on Everclear (Rolling Stone’s Best Album of 1991), and in his more recent solo work. Eitzel’s lachrymose voice is the perfect accompaniment to a Mission bar crawl.Carrying the city’s freak flag proudly into the present day to round off our playlist are Thee Oh Sees, a twin-drummer psychedelic juggernaut led by wild-eyed John Dwyer – proof that San Fran isn’t merely a place, it’s also a state of mind.For more inspiration and to book your trip to the US, visit bausa"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/68108e93bbebe259ff0afab54bba744bff548de2/49_54_6231_3738/master/6231.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=faebb9c6d1be7bddbf2737d2f674bbf2","title":"england cathedrals back to middle ages mystery plays pageants chester st albans","story":"Pilgrimages, pageants and a revival of the Mystery Plays aim to attract interest and precious fundsFor centuries they have been places of quiet reflection, highbrow music and greyish stone. But now cathedrals are transforming their genteel image with bright colour, noisy processions and drama, reviving long-abandoned practices from the middle ages and drawing in the crowds.Leading the pack in this medieval comeback is St Albans Cathedral in Hertfordshire which on Saturday attracted thousands to its pilgrimage to mark the feast day of Saint Alban, the first Christian martyred in Britain. And on Wednesday the Chester Mystery Plays will be performed in the nave of Chester Cathedral, the original cycle of 24 plays condensed into one by old soap-opera hands for an 18-day run.Jeffrey John, the dean of St Albans who created the modern-day pilgrimage, said: “We have returned to a very visual culture today and medieval practices suit that. And if you have strong medieval roots as so many cathedrals do, you are bound to probe them and revive that heritage.”Medieval pilgrims flocked to St Albans Cathedral (the site of a Benedictine monastery founded by King Offa of Mercia in AD793) because it housed the bones of Saint Alban until the shrine was dismantled after the Reformation. Now the cathedral has revived the pilgrimage, which winds its way through the town to tell the 1,700-year-old story of the martyr using 12-foot-high puppets, made by a company that creates floats for the Notting Hill Carnival.The puppets include not only Saint Alban himself but also Roman soldiers, lions and charioteers. As well as hundreds of local people taking part, the pilgrimage of drama and prayers attracts thousands from across Britain.The revival of practices abandoned because of the Reformation and Puritan influence is highly appealing to many Anglican cathedral deans facing huge costs to keep their ancient buildings in good order. At next month’s General Synod, the Church of England will discuss a report from the Cathedrals Working Group about financial management of cathedrals and to urge the government to establish a cathedral fabric fund to support conservation and restoration programmes.The acting dean of Chester Cathedral, Jane Brooke, agrees with John that medieval practices work in the 21st century because of the dominance of visual culture. Created for a mostly illiterate population, the Mystery Plays were first revived for the Festival of Britain and have been performed at intervals since – but have only just been welcomed into the cathedral.“During the middle ages very few people, apart from the priests, knew the Bible story so it was a mystery, hence Mystery Plays,” said Brooke.“Now they are a way in for people who do not know the Christian story so well today. It is a very big thing for us to have the plays in the cathedral and we are moving times of services to accommodate them.”The Chester Mystery Plays is being brought to the public by director Peter Leslie Wild, who has directed episodes of The Archers, and playwright Deborah McAndrew, who was a regular in Coronation Street for eight years.“We have to assume no prior knowledge of Christianity,” said Wild. “This is an interpretation for a modern audience, rooted in contemporary life and performed by local people, just as they would have been in the middle ages”.One new twist in this year’s plays is the focus on the destruction of God’s creation by humanity, with the stage awash with plastic following the flood, when Noah saves animals in his ark.Other cathedrals and their cities are also seeking inspiration from the medieval era. At Lincoln Cathedral, which is dedicated to the Virgin Mary, Catholic practices have been revived that were abandoned during the Reformation, with processions to Mary’s statue on her feast days. In Canterbury, a medieval pageant is planned for 7 July to commemorate the penitential pilgrimage of Henry II in 1174 when he made reparation for inciting the murder of Thomas Becket, the archbishop of Canterbury. Chocolate medallions are given to young pilgrims if they visit five sites in the city – sugary replicas of the badges awarded to weary medieval travellers when they reached Canterbury."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3540405.1529684917!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"turkey election can anyone stop erdogan","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTurkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan  greets supporters: his victory would usher in a new executive presidency in which the role of prime minister would be abolished. Photograph:  Srdjan SukiEPAAnyone driving the streets, highways and byways of Istanbul in recent days would be led to believe there’s just one candidate standing in Turkey’s presidential election on Sunday: the incumbent Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Erdogan’s face appears on posters hanging from bridges, on the sides of five-storey buildings and, most commonly, on almost every inch of available billboard space. “Turkey wants a big, strong leader,” goes the caption accompanying his posters.On a 45-minute drive through the Anatolian districts of this metropolis of 15 million people, the only sign that there are others in the race is a single billboard for Muharrem Ince, the opposition CHP presidential candidate. Switch on television, and there Erdogan is again: relaying in detail to a pair of meek interviewers how life was desperate for Turks in the 1990s, before the AK Party he leads came to power.With five elections and referendum campaigns held over the past five years, Turks are no strangers to going to the polls. But what’s different ahead of presidential and parliamentary elections on Sunday is that Turkey’s future is now clearly about one man. Never mind that Erdogan’s opponents don’t get a look-in there are almost no references to the AK Party itself, a party that has transformed socio-economic life across the country, nor its candidates standing for election in these very localities.In its 15 years in power, the AK Party under Erdogan has overcome an attempted military coup, a basket case economy and waves of Islamic State and Kurdish terrorist attacks. It has also transformed countless cities, towns and districts, improving the day-to-day lives of tens of millions of people.The residential district of Uskudar on Istanbul’s Asian shore has perhaps benefited more than others. For a long time, it represented the worst of modern city life: clogged, narrow streets, poor electricity and water access, and endless blocks of dreary apartment buildings.“Uskudar has changed a lot since the 1990s, both physically and demographically. For example, we use natural gas now, it wasn’t there in the 1990s,” says Aylin Ornek, a resident. “Besides the construction facilities, it has become the main transporting point of Istanbul, and this made Uskudar more attractive for people to live here. As I see it, the population is not as conservative as before.”The building of an €80 million mosque – Turkey’s largest – a state-of-the-art driverless metro line and a soon-to-be-opened 365m-high TV tower complete with restaurants and viewing deck have turned Uskudar into a thriving hub.But on Sunday Erdogan faces major challenges. For the first time, Turkey’s opposition is united. Two new faces in Muharrem Ince and IYI Party leader Meral Aksener are out to halt the president’s increasingly vice-like grip on the country. The parties and others have formed the so-called “Nation Alliance”, which hopes to take away the AK Party’s parliamentary majority and reinstate a system in which Turkey’s 600 MPs debate over and make laws.An Erdogan victory would usher in a new executive presidency in which the role of prime minister would be abolished.It is Ince in particular who stands as Erdogan’s main threat. The fiery former physics teacher has courted Kurds by campaigning in Diyarbakir, the largest Kurdish-inhabited city in Turkey, and visiting Selahattin Demirtas, the imprisoned former co-leader of the Kurdish-focussed HDP (and who is also running for president) – previously unthinkable moves for a staunchly nationalist party. Ince drew hundreds of thousands of supporters to a rally in Izmir on Thursday, which was reported to be one of the biggest opposition gatherings in years. He has also repeatedly challenged Erdogan to a TV debate but the president has always refused.How the election plays out for the HDP is of particular concern to the AK Party as it tries to maintain its parliamentary majority. Only parties that win 10 per cent or more of the popular vote can enter parliament, and should the HDP reach this threshold, the AK Party’s majority would almost certainly end.Tellingly, the long-standing notion that Erdogan represents for the West a crucial partner in a neighbourhood where countries such as Syria and Iraq have been traumatised by conflict is beginning to slip.“Should Erdogan emerge electorally victorious but politically weaker with a narrow electoral margin – a real possibility – tensions with the West would put him at greater risk of Russian manipulation against Nato, ” wrote Marc Pierini of Carnegie Europe, a think tank, this week.“Most polls predict that Erdogan will carry the presidency. In that event, liberties and tolerance in Turkey’s erse society would fall even further, followed by Turkey’s alliance with the West.”There has never been a better chance for Turkey’s opposition. Under the AK Party, unemployment and inflation have languished in double figures for several years. The opposition CHP, long considered out of touch with people, has been revitalised since a “justice march” from Ankara to Istanbul last summer drew together millions of Erdogan opponents.If the opposition Nation Alliance can deny the AK Party and its nationalist backers, the MHP, a majority in parliament, and if Erdogan is forced into a run-off vote (if he fails to win more than 50 per cent of the vote), the aura of invincibility that has surrounded him may begin to recede.And yet, when the AK Party has been troubled in the past, it has come back stronger. When it lost its parliamentary majority in an election in June 2015, it was able to pivot its stance from conservative Islamism to a fervent anti-Kurdish nationalism that saw it regain control of parliament.What’s different this time, however, is that by many accounts the Turkish economy appears headed for a period of crisis – a fact many link to Erdogan’s decision to call this election a year and a half ahead of schedule."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3541864.1529822133!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"turks head to the polls in crucial test for erdogan","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA man casts his ballot for Turkey’s presidential and parliamentary elections at a polling station in Ankara. Photograph: Stoyan NenovReuters  Turks began voting on Sunday for a new president and parliament in elections that pose the biggest challenge to Tayyip Erdogan and his Islamist-rooted AK Party since they swept to power more than a decade and a half ago.The elections will also usher in a powerful new executive presidency long sought by Mr Erdogan and backed by a small majority of Turks in a 2017 referendum. Critics say it will further erode democracy in the Nato member state and entrench one-man rule.More than 56 million people were registered to vote at 180,000 ballot boxes across Turkey. Voting began at 8 am (5am GMT) and will end at 5pm (2pm GMT).Mr Erdogan, the most popular but also isive leader in modern Turkish history, moved the elections forward from November 2019, arguing the new powers would better enable him to tackle the nation’s mounting economic problems - the lira has lost 20 per cent against the dollar this year - and deal with Kurdish rebels in southeast Turkey and in neighbouring Iraq and Syria. But he reckoned without Muharrem Ince, the presidential candidate of the secularist Republican People’s Party (CHP), whose feisty performance at campaign rallies has galvanised Turkey’s long-demoralised and ided opposition.Addressing a rally in Istanbul on Saturday attended by hundreds of thousands of people, Mr Ince promised to reverse what he and opposition parties see as a swing towards authoritarian rule under Mr Erdogan in the country of 81 million people.“If Erdogan wins, your phones will continue to be listened to ... Fear will continue to reign ... If Ince wins, the courts will be independent,” said Mr Ince, adding he would lift Turkey’s state of emergency within 48 hours of being elected.Turkey has been under emergency rule - which restricts some personal freedoms and allows the government to bypass parliament with emergency decrees - for nearly two years following an abortive military coup in July 2016.Erdogan blamed the coup on his former ally, US-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen, and has waged a sweeping crackdown on the preacher’s followers in Turkey. The United Nations say some 160,000 people have been detained and nearly as many more, including teachers, judges and soldiers, sacked.The president’s critics, including the European Union which Turkey still nominally aspires to join, say Mr Erdogan has used the crackdown to stifle dissent. Few newspapers or other media openly criticise the government and he has received far more election coverage than other presidential candidates.Mr Erdogan, who defends his tough measures as essential for national security, told his supporters at rallies on Saturday that if re-elected he would press ahead with more of the big infrastructure projects that have helped turn Turkey into one of the world’s fastest-growing economies during his time in office.“If he wins, I think the obstacles before us will disappear and we will have control,” said Nesrin Cuha (37) a call centre worker, who wore a headscarf. Religiously observant Muslims form the bedrock of Mr Erdogan’s support.“The opposition will not be a nuisance anymore with the new presidential system,” said another Erdogan supporter, retired sailor Engin Ozmen (60).Polls show Mr Erdogan falling short of a first-round victory in the presidential race but he would be expected to win a run-off on July 8th, while his AK Party could lose its parliamentary majority, possibly heralding increased tensions between president and parliament.Other presidential candidates include Selahattin Demirtas, leader of the pro-Kurdish Peoples Democratic Party (HDP), who is now in jail on terrorism-related charges that he denies. If the HDP exceeds the 10 percent threshold of votes needed to enter parliament, it will be harder for the AKP to get a majority.In a final appeal for votes in a video clip from his high security prison, Demirtas said: “If the HDP fails to get into parliament, all Turkey will lose. Backing the HDP means supporting democracy.”–Reuters "},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"Many of the activists who campaigned on issue jailed after crackdown on dissentUN agency UNRWA says it is \u0026lsquoweeks away from painful cuts\u0026rsquo due to lack of fundsJustice ministry alleges misuse of \u0026euro83,000 in official funds for catering servicesEscalation in fighting has wounded civilians, forcing many to flee and hampering aid agenciesStartling contrast between reactions to austerity in Jordan and EgyptGeneral Vincent Brooks warns against complacency after Pentagon cancels war gameCountry\u0026rsquos security agency Shin Bet alleges Gonen Segev \u0026lsquorecruited and served as agent\u0026rsquoUN human rights chief concerned that onslaught could endanger millions of civiliansThousands of Taliban fighters welcomed into cities during three--day truceHodeidah port is the main distribution point for commercial and humanitarian supplies into YemenProposal would make filming \u0026lsquowith intent to harm morale\u0026rsquo punishable by up to five years in jailAirport encircled by Saudi-led coalition but Iran-aligned Houthi defenders vow resistanceRussia and Saudi Arabia have co-operated on crude oil supplies since 2016Mullah Fazlullah was Pakistan\u0026rsquos most-wanted militant, notorious for shooting of Malala YousafzaiSaudi and UAE-led coalition seeks to avoid famine in freeing Yemen city from HouthisHodeidah is the main entry port for food into a country already on the brink of famineIran remains in US crosshairs despite the North Korean threat being far greaterGeneral Assembly seeks \u0026lsquointernational protection mechanism\u0026rsquo for occupied territoryUN among those warning move on Houthi rebels may kill and maim 250,000 civiliansRed Sea port of Hodeidah, held by Houthi rebels, is aid lifeline for millions of Yemenis"},{"url":null,"title":"summer solstice 2018 longest day pictures","story":"The spectacular moment the sun begins to rise over Stonehenge, Wiltshire this morning as Britain welcomes the longest day of the year. The monument is built along the solstice alignment of the summer sunrise and the winter sunset. Read more about the summer solstice here.Compulsory calorie counts in restaurants and mile-long runs for primary pupils as Government plans to halve childhood obesityPrince Harry hails a new generation of \u0026#39incredible\u0026#39 young leaders We will look on with huge pride as our young Commonwealth Leaders of today become the Global Leaders of tomorrowNew hope in mystery of James Bond\u0026#39s missing Aston MartinComment: As urban spaces grow, Toryism is fading away with privacy, cars and garden frogsRevealed: The NHS working mother-of-two in Freud painting set to break record15-year-old boy stabbed to death after birthday party in RomfordNew Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern introduces baby Neve te Aroha to the worldPlague of green iguanas wreaks havoc in FloridaStars of Westeros out in force as Game of Thrones\u0026#39 Kit Harington and Rose Leslie tie the knot in AberdeenshireCritics mock Emmanuel Macron as unpresidential for posing with risqué dance troupe at Elysée palaceSaudi women take to the roads after ban lifts, without the feminist pioneers who drove reformsRestaurant owner who asked Sarah Sanders to leave says she was taking moral stand against Donald TrumpGosport inquiry panel accused of \u0026#34NHS cover up\u0026#34 over faulty syringe driversChaos at US border as illegal immigrant parents plead to be reunited with their childrenPresident of Zimbabwe survives \u0026#39assassination attempt\u0026#39 in BulawayoMurder investigation launched after middle-aged woman found dead with stab wounds in gardenRecord number of British female wildcards at Wimbledon as coach says their friendship helped their rise to success  We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/06/17/TELEMMGLPICT000166660081_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"england should nation proud flag wavers","story":"digitalservices@telegraphWales Street in Oldham is temporarily renamed by its residents as England Street as they festoon the street with St George\u0026#39s Cross England flags and bunting, in Oldham, Britain, June 17, 2018. I come from a nation of enthusiastic flag-wavers.

Analysts suggested the culprits could come from among the armed forces - as they seek to create the condition for a security clampdown - or from elements within the ruling Zanu-PF that were sidelined with the ousting of Mr Mugabe.Chipo Dendere, a Zimbabwean professor of political science at Amherst College in the US, said the incident would change the tone of the election campaign.This is going to make everyone a little bit tense... this is the first time we have seen such a blatant attack, she said blaming isions inside the ruling Zanu-PF for the attack.Whatever internal fissures existed within Zanu-PF before (the coup in) November, those fissures didn\u0027t go away.The United States condemned the attack.The US Embassy said on Twitter that political violence in any form is unacceptable and contrary to the progress needed to move the country forward and take its place on the global stage.Although Mr Mnangagwa was not hurt, state media reported that Vice-President Kembo Mohadi suffered a leg injury.Compulsory calorie counts in restaurants and mile-long runs for primary pupils as Government plans to halve childhood obesityPrince Harry hails a new generation of \u0026#39incredible\u0026#39 young leaders We will look on with huge pride as our young Commonwealth Leaders of today become the Global Leaders of tomorrowNew hope in mystery of James Bond\u0026#39s missing Aston MartinComment: As urban spaces grow, Toryism is fading away with privacy, cars and garden frogsRevealed: The NHS working mother-of-two in Freud painting set to break record15-year-old boy stabbed to death after birthday party in RomfordNew Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern introduces baby Neve te Aroha to the worldPlague of green iguanas wreaks havoc in FloridaStars of Westeros out in force as Game of Thrones\u0026#39 Kit Harington and Rose Leslie tie the knot in AberdeenshireCritics mock Emmanuel Macron as unpresidential for posing with risqué dance troupe at Elysée palaceSaudi women take to the roads after ban lifts, without the feminist pioneers who drove reformsRestaurant owner who asked Sarah Sanders to leave says she was taking moral stand against Donald TrumpGosport inquiry panel accused of \u0026#34NHS cover up\u0026#34 over faulty syringe driversChaos at US border as illegal immigrant parents plead to be reunited with their childrenMurder investigation launched after middle-aged woman found dead with stab wounds in gardenRecord number of British female wildcards at Wimbledon as coach says their friendship helped their rise to success  Gosport nurses first raised alarm over use of painkillers 30 years agoWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/06/23/TELEMMGLPICT000167246124_1_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=4","title":"saudi women take roads ban lifts without feminist pioneers drove","story":"digitalservices@telegraphSaudi woman uses a driving simulator at an event to promote the lifting of Saudi Arabia\u0026#39s women\u0026#39s driving ban this coming Sunday, in Jeddah“Men have made it sound like this is so complicated,” laughed Abla Hasan al-Sabban as she jerked the wheel of the car simulator. ”But it’s really not.”The 44-year-old cardiovascular technician is getting some practice in the parking lot of the Red Sea Mall in the Saudi Arabian city of Jeddah before the big day.For as long as most in the kingdom can remember, the roads have been an exclusively male domain.But from Sunday that changes, as a decades-long ban on women driving is lifted and the country becomes the last on earth to grant them the basic right.The restriction had left women, even doctors like Mrs Sabban, entirely dependent on men -

Mr Macron made a late appearance with his wife and even did a few dance steps himself.DJ Chloe performs during the music day celebration in the courtyard of the Elysée PalaceThe “Son of immigrants, black, and queer” T-shirt was worn by Kiddy Smile, who earlier said it was to show his opposition to the asylum and migration bill being pushed through by Mr Macron’s government.Compulsory calorie counts in restaurants and mile-long runs for primary pupils as Government plans to halve childhood obesityPrince Harry hails a new generation of \u0026#39incredible\u0026#39 young leaders We will look on with huge pride as our young Commonwealth Leaders of today become the Global Leaders of tomorrowNew hope in mystery of James Bond\u0026#39s missing Aston MartinComment: As urban spaces grow, Toryism is fading away with privacy, cars and garden frogsRevealed: The NHS working mother-of-two in Freud painting set to break record15-year-old boy stabbed to death after birthday party in RomfordNew Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern introduces baby Neve te Aroha to the worldPlague of green iguanas wreaks havoc in FloridaStars of Westeros out in force as Game of Thrones\u0026#39 Kit Harington and Rose Leslie tie the knot in AberdeenshireSaudi women take to the roads after ban lifts, without the feminist pioneers who drove reformsRestaurant owner who asked Sarah Sanders to leave says she was taking moral stand against Donald TrumpGosport inquiry panel accused of \u0026#34NHS cover up\u0026#34 over faulty syringe driversChaos at US border as illegal immigrant parents plead to be reunited with their childrenPresident of Zimbabwe survives \u0026#39assassination attempt\u0026#39 in BulawayoMurder investigation launched after middle-aged woman found dead with stab wounds in gardenRecord number of British female wildcards at Wimbledon as coach says their friendship helped their rise to success  Gosport nurses first raised alarm over use of painkillers 30 years agoWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/06/24/TELEMMGLPICT000167380041_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqwa5Jnl6ZbmW0SCmJ33EhWJ6sbWUxKJa4c3yj6Zo3vyg.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"new zealand prime minister jacindaardern introduces baby neve","story":"digitalservices@telegraphNew Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern and partner Clarke Gayford pose with their baby daugther Neve Te ArohaJacinda Ardern, prime minister of New Zealand, announced on Sunday she had named her new-born daughter Neve Te Aroha as she prepared to leave hospital amidst an outpouring of public excitement.Ms Ardern appeared before dozens of reporters and a flurry of camera flashes at Auckland City Hospital in her first appearance since giving birth, thanking the public for their support as her three-day-old daughter slept in her arms.We really just wanted to say thank you and that we\u0027re all doing really well. Sleep deprived, but really well, she said.Ms Ardern, 37, became New Zealand\u0027s youngest prime minister when she took office through a coalition deal last year after an inconclusive election. She has now become the first woman in the country\u0027s history to give birth while in office.She delivered her 3.31 kg (7.3 lb) daughter in the country\u0027s largest public hospital on Thursday afternoon with her partner, television presenter Clarke Gayford, at her side.Baby Neve sleeps through all the fussThe couple had settled on the baby\u0027s first name, Neve, after she was born, he mother said, explaining that it means bright and radiant and snow, which reflected that she was born in the middle of winter during the nation\u0027s indigenous Maori new year and the shortest day of the year.Her second name, Te Aroha, which means love in Te Reo Maori, one of the country\u0027s national languages, was a nod to the many Maori iwi, or tribes, that had offered names as a gift to Ms Ardern while she was pregnant.\u0027Te Aroha\u0027 was our way of reflecting the amount of love this baby has been shown even before she arrived, Ms Ardern said.The island nation, with a population of 4.5 million, was in the grips of a baby-induced glow of optimism in recent days with many social media users dubbing the baby the Prime Miniature while they waited for her name to be announced.It\u0027s just something really lovely in a world where so much is unfair that we\u0027re all very excited about it, said Frances Gerbic, a music teacher living in Auckland.Proud mum and dad speak to the mediaThe New Zealand Symphony Orchestra recorded a version of Brahm\u0027s lullaby Cradle Song translated into Te Reo Maori, and Auckland\u0027s tallest building, the Sky Tower, was lit up pink for three nights in honour of the occasion.Support also flooded in from around the world, with Britain\u0027s Queen Elizabeth, whom Ms Ardern met in London in April, sending an emailed message of congratulations and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau tweeting at Ms Ardern: Pro tip, Jacinda: Briefing notes make excellent bed time stories.Ms Ardern will take the next six weeks off, leaving her deputy Winston Peters in charge, and return to work in early August when Mr Gayford will care for the baby full-time.Meet New Zealand\u0026#039s \u0026#039First Bloke\u0026#039: Clarke Gayford, the man who\u0026#039ll become a stay-at-home dadMany in New Zealand and around the world had held up her pregnancy -

But the number would be gigantic.“You could put any number of zeros behind a number, and I would believe it.”Close up of a juvenile green iguanaMale animals can grow up to five feet in length and weigh as much as 17lb.At that sort of size they can be prodigious burrowers, building tunnels and underground sanctuaries for the females to hatch their eggs. Problems come when their excavations erode over time, causing pavements to collapse, damaging electricity supplies and phone lines.Grace DeVita, of Hollywood, saw the damage first hand when an iguana chewed through power lines at her office.Hunters wage war on Burmese pythons in Florida Everglades“There was an iguana with a piece of wire hanging out of his mouth,” she told the newspaper. It took two days for power to be restored the first time, and then it happened again two days later.”Damage to levees, seawalls and patios have all been blamed on the invasive species.Cold weather once kept the population in check but numbers have rebounded in recent years without an extended wintry spell since 2009, according to experts. This year\u0027s explosion seems to be unaffected by a cold spell when frozen iguanas dropped from trees in January.Thomas Portuallo, the owner of Fort Lauderdale-based company called Iguana Control, told The Sun-Sentinel that many hundreds of thousands of iguanas had taken over a string of counties.“This year is the most iguanas I’ve seen and I’ve been in business for nine years,” he said.While the population explosion is good business for exterminators, householders are legally able to take things into their own hands.Florida state law allows anyone to kill iguanas so long as it is done humanely, with a single blow from a shovel, a shot from a pellet gun, decapitation or other instantaneous methods.Compulsory calorie counts in restaurants and mile-long runs for primary pupils as Government plans to halve childhood obesityPrince Harry hails a new generation of \u0026#39incredible\u0026#39 young leaders We will look on with huge pride as our young Commonwealth Leaders of today become the Global Leaders of tomorrowNew hope in mystery of James Bond\u0026#39s missing Aston MartinComment: As urban spaces grow, Toryism is fading away with privacy, cars and garden frogsRevealed: The NHS working mother-of-two in Freud painting set to break record15-year-old boy stabbed to death after birthday party in RomfordNew Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern introduces baby Neve te Aroha to the worldStars of Westeros out in force as Game of Thrones\u0026#39 Kit Harington and Rose Leslie tie the knot in AberdeenshireCritics mock Emmanuel Macron as unpresidential for posing with risqué dance troupe at Elysée palaceSaudi women take to the roads after ban lifts, without the feminist pioneers who drove reformsRestaurant owner who asked Sarah Sanders to leave says she was taking moral stand against Donald TrumpGosport inquiry panel accused of \u0026#34NHS cover up\u0026#34 over faulty syringe driversChaos at US border as illegal immigrant parents plead to be reunited with their childrenPresident of Zimbabwe survives \u0026#39assassination attempt\u0026#39 in BulawayoMurder investigation launched after middle-aged woman found dead with stab wounds in gardenRecord number of British female wildcards at Wimbledon as coach says their friendship helped their rise to success  Gosport nurses first raised alarm over use of painkillers 30 years agoWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/06/23/TELEMMGLPICT000167376373_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqDA4v0SlJpjrzxwtdCeKJm1oknq8TsbnuNfSqM5nLkGI.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"roses selfies women take roads saudi arabia first time","story":"digitalservices@telegraphA Saudi woman celebrates as she drives her car in her neighborhood, in Al Khobar, Saudi Arabia,Female drivers took to the roads in Saudi Arabia on Sunday after a decades-long ban was lifted, making it the last country in the world to allow women behind the wheel.Thousands went out for their first legal drive, marking a momentous day that many in the deeply conservative kingdom did not think they would see in their lifetime.Some went out at the stroke of midnight - when the law was officially overturned - and cruised along Jeddah’s seaside road. For others it was a more mundane affair of ferrying their children to school.I\u0027m overwhelmed, I don\u0027t feel like this is really happening, Sara al-Haji, 35, told the . I get to live like a normal person now.On social media, women across the country posted pictures of themselves in the driving seat of their new cars.Others responded with tweets of support, using the hashtag #You_Will_Drive_and_the_ People_Are_With_You.Policemen handed out roses to the first-time drivers, breaking social norms for the gender-segregated society.Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, a billionaire businessman who until recently was locked up in the Carlton Ritz Hotel after being swept up in the government’s anti-corruption drive, posted a video of his daughter’s first ride: “Finally, out for a ride with my daughter Reem as she drives me and my granddaughters in Riyadh!”The overwhelming majority of Saudi Arabia’s some 16 million women, however, still do not have driving licenses and could not get behind the wheel today.Many have not had a chance to take the driving courses that were first offered to women only a few months ago.There is also a waiting list of several months for courses at Princess Nora University in Riyadh and Effat University in Jeddah, the two main centres for learners. And the classes can be costly, running to several hundred pounds.That did not stop some, who risked a potential fine of up to £200 and drove without a licence.“I’ve waited too long to wait any more,” said Asma, a nurse from the Red Sea city of Jeddah, “if I keep to the speed limit maybe they won’t see me.”Hannan Iskandar is kissed by her parents, after she drove her car in her neighborhood, in Al KhobarEven traffic police seemed not to want to dampen the mood of the historic day by stopping cars to check drivers’ IDs.A handful of female taxi drivers were also out. Careem, a ride-hailing app, had “Captinahs” taking fares.Careem, which already has 80,000 drivers in Saudi Arabia, said it hoped women would be among the 20,000 or so it is planning to recruit there over the next four years.The lifting of the ban - the most visible symbol of women\u0027s repression in Saudi Arabia - will be a life-changing experience for many, freeing them from the dependence on male chauffeurs or relatives.An estimated six million - or 65 per cent of the female driving-age population - are expected to apply for a licence now the ban has been lifted, according to the London-based consulting firm Facts Global Energy.Hannan Iskandar drives her car in her neighborhood, in Al KhobarBut others told the  they were in no rush.“After a lifetime of having a chauffeur, I can’t imagine my life without one,” said Joumana, a professor at King Abdulaziz University. “I am aware not all women in Saudi have this luxury, but a great many middle-class families do.“I believe it’s the right of every human to drive and I want to have the ability to make such a basic decision, but I don’t necessarily want to practice it.Even the most conservative women said they thought the right to drive was important, but fewer said they were willing to be among the first to take to the road. Saudi woman uses a driving simulator at an event to promote the lifting of Saudi Arabia\u0026#39s women\u0026#39s driving banFor decades, hardliners cited austere Islamic interpretations to justify the driving ban, with some asserting that women lacked the intelligence to drive and that lifting it would promote promiscuity.Tribal tradition and religious decrees often trump state law in Saudi Arabia, and men can be protective of the modesty of their wives, daughters and sisters.Most women in the kingdom have never driven here, at least not legally.The only women Saudis have ever seen behind the wheel in their country were female American soldiers in their jeeps during the first Gulf War in the early 1990s, the sight of which prompted protests by activists demanding the same right.It would be 28 years before their demands would be met, though Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman would make sure they were not out on the roads on Sunday to claim any of the credit.Eman Joharjy, a designer with a boutique in Jeddah, told the  women had been so excited for the 24th that pre-orders have been flooding in for her custom driving abayas.Mrs Joharjy had specialised in athletic abayas for running and cycling, but was not sure she would ever see the day she would be creating some for motorists.The sleeves are made of tight elastic, so as not to get caught on the indicators, and the bottom half tails into loose trousers to allow freer movement on the pedals.“At first people laughed at me, because I was doing something no one had before,” she said, speaking from her store Stitches in an upmarket neighbourhood of the city. “But they are modest and very practical, a combination which is hard to find in Saudi.”While she does not yet have her licence, she is excited that some of her customers will be out on the roads.“We may not be like America, or the UK, but we are a modern society now with women driving and it works for us,” Mrs Joharjy smiled.Please review our commenting policyCompulsory calorie counts in restaurants and mile-long runs for

may","story":"Created with Sketch.Cabinet unity will be stretched to breaking point. Resignations seem inevitable as Theresa May\u0026nbspis forced to do what she has so far refused to do -\u0026nbspmake a binding choiceClick to followThe Independent OnlineTwo years on from the referendum and we still have no earthly clue how Brexit will play outA week, as they say, is a long time in politics. Little wonder that the last couple of years felt like an eternity.So, two years after the referendum what, if anything, have we learned about Brexit, and indeed about ourselves? \u0026nbspWell, first and foremost, we’ve discovered that leaving the EU is unbelievably difficult.Untangling 40-plus years of membership was never going to be easy. Doing so under the ridiculous time constraints imposed by Article 50 doubly so. A senior civil servant recalled one of his EU colleagues remarking that Article 50 was written in such a way that only the British civil service would have a chance of getting it done in time.Which points to another lesson. Whoever was in charge of this process, whatever the size of their majority, doing Brexit would have been difficult, all-consuming and messy.And this is so not least because of the choice the EU has presented us with. Michel Barnier’s infamous steps of doom\u0026nbspmean there simply isn’t the room to arrive at the kind of ambitious free trade agreement of which the Prime Minister long dreamed. Rather, the Government must choose between three unpalatable options, or rather two unpalatable ones and an inconceivable one.Whether the Dominic Grieve amendment had passed last week or not, the Prime Minister now realises that no deal is not an option at all.Leaving us with two: a Brexit that is economically ruinous and one that, essentially, equates to membership without the perks.We must, in other words, choose between something that looks like the EU’s deal with Canada (though in all probability a Canada minus rather than a Canada plus) or something resembling continued membership of the single market and customs union.There isn’t much of a half-way house. All the clever talk of a partial single market for goods\u0026nbspis unrealistic. It would be complicated to manage, and does not really help even manufacturers. Rolls Royce, to use the most cited example, make a fair amount of their money from service\u0026nbspcontracts on their goods. Moreover, and not incidentally, the EU has not indicated it would accept anything along these lines.So back to the binary choice. Neither is perfect. Far from it. “Canada”\u0026nbsppresents economic problems. It would mean hardly any agreement over services – the bulk of our economy and the area where we enjoy a healthy surplus with the EU. And it will imply the need for customs checks at Dover. The Prime Minister herself implicitly recognised that such an outcome would be nowhere near good enough in her Mansion House speech.Equally, however, a straightforward “Norway”\u0026nbspsolution, with the UK unambiguously within the European Economic Area, is not one that would work politically here. So the question is whether something substantively similar can be dressed up as something sufficiently different – perhaps with registrations for EU nationals, a hyping up of the emergency brake on migration that the EEA treaty allows and stricter application of EU rules on free movement.This is where the debate now is. Find a clever way of selling the status quo, or adopt a model that impacts severely on trade and hence our economy, and deal with the political consequences.I, for one, have no earthly clue how this will play out. But as this stark choice becomes clearer, and as we approach squeaky bum time, the choice has to be made. Cabinet unity will be stretched to breaking point. Resignations seem inevitable as the PM is forced to do what she has so far refused to do: make a binding choice.And remember this is only a part of the story that has played out since 23 June 2016. The other is not about the EU, but about ourselves.Brexit is happening against the backdrop of a politics changing radically before our eyes. The traditional class bases of support for both major parties seem to be shifting. Hardly surprising then that neither the Tories nor Labour seem sure what post-Brexit offer to make to voters: neither is wholly certain which voters it is trying to attract.This political churn, combined with the all-consuming impact of Brexit on Whitehall, means that little if anything has been done to address the substantive domestic implications of the referendum. And this matters because it is here, rather than in Brussels, that the domestic political battle over Brexit will be won or lost.Whatever her subsequent errors as Prime Minister, Mrs May adeptly captured the mood of the country when she made that striking address from the doorstep of her new residence in Downing Street in July 2016.Brexit represented many things, not least a profound dissatisfaction with the political and economic status quo. Hence the real measure of its impact will not directly be what happens in negotiations with the EU, but how our Government decides to tackle this dissatisfaction. And of course the EU will no longer be there to provide cover for domestic policy failures.Certainly, something more substantive and less dishonest than the “Brexit idend”\u0026nbspfor the NHS is required. What that will be offered, as both major parties flounder, is anyone’s guess.And so, to the final lesson. There is a long, long way to go. We have reached the Brexit foothills. But the real mountains – sorting trade, then, more importantly, sorting ourselves – still await us.

I sure caught the gist of why these folks happened upon me to offer prayer.My introduction to Christianity was in evangelical churches. For years, I navigated conservative religious spaces, where I encountered bigotry and attempts to shame LGBT+\u0026nbsppeople and women as often as I found warmhearted people eager to serve others.There was more than a little racism, too. I’ve heard the statement “I’ll pray for you” said with love, and with judgment and scorn. I know the difference, and the folks who confronted me outside the cafe were making their judgement clear.Instead of a theological debate that usually goes nowhere for lack of good faith in discussion, I wanted them to feel what it’s like to have someone supposedly approach in love but inflict pain and discomfort. Perhaps that’s what it takes. A forced perspective in empathy. Why not try that approach?I could have ignored them but I’ve had it with some evangelicals giving a bad name to their community by insisting on defining people’s humanity for them. These three assumed I was broken because of my gender identity. They saw the constellation of my personhood through a backward telescope.It angered me that the whole of my being could be reduced to their flawed understanding of LGBT+\u0026nbsppeople, a view that could easily be revised if only they would take the time to get to know me instead of assuming they already did.So I would be damned if I would let them interrupt my Sunday afternoon coffee when I certainly wasn’t bothering them.I asked their spokeswoman if she understood how it might look to be searching for “broken” people to pray for, and specifically pick out a random transgender person. And they looked more than taken aback.I stood up, smiling but internally annoyed, and asked them what the Book of Matthew says about prayer. Their eyes went wide. One guy stammered nervously, clearly having trouble answering the question.The other two were just as flummoxed, ambushed by the idea that the “broken” transgender person was asking a simple question about a common verse on prayer in Matthew.For those who don’t know, Matthew is the first book in the New Testament and one of the three Synoptic Gospels, each of which are narratives of the life of Christ, frequently using the same stories, often with identical wording.While all three contain instruction on prayer, I reached for Matthew 18:20 because of its strong presence in the evangelical community and its common misapplication by members. In short, it reads: “For where two or three are gathered in my name, there am I with them.”Those up on their biblical knowledge might wonder why I didn’t turn to Matthew 6:5-7, scathing verses that call out hypocrites who are performative in their Christianity, telling them to pray in private rather than out on the streets so that they might be seen by others.It’s a good one that, unsurprisingly, is ignored in evangelical circles. They know it’s there, but it’s inconvenient.The verse I selected hits hard instead because it’s so commonly heard before a group prayer in evangelical churches. There, it tends to be inaccurately interpreted as a numbers game, one that’s about bringing to fruition what is requested of God in prayer.Evangelicals think of it as a call to bring more people into the church or, more cynically, personal prosperity through the Gospel.In reality, it’s a verse on accountability before God and about how God may work that accountability through humans. As Leisa Baysinger notes on the blog Our Ancient Paths, it references earlier Jewish tradition that at least three witnesses must agree to bring judgement on someone.In the moment I was unaware of its exact roots, which were surprisingly apt given the attempt of this small band to sit in judgement of me, but I still understood what was at stake in the line, and I loved the idea of using a verse on accountability that they had probably misunderstood numerous times.I was the judged who understands the law better than those attempting to judge, and on that day I sought to bring accountability.These aren’t issues I take lightly, and the passive-aggressive condescension of these three was anything but harmless. This wasn’t the time to be polite.Not when the Trump-Pence White House is trying to ban transgender people from the military. Not when transgender students with stories of discrimination are turned away by the US\u0026nbspDepartment of Education.Not when President Donald Trump and vice president\u0026nbspMike Pence\u0026nbspare seeking to implement a Health and Human Services Department regulation allowing healthcare workers to deny potentially lifesaving treatment to LGBT+\u0026nbsppeople.Not when the Human Rights Campaign reports that in the US, eight transgender people have been killed in 2018 and 28 in 2017 –\u0026nbspthe most ever annually. I wasn’t going to be silent.Instead, I spoke.“You know how Matthew says that where two or three are gathered in Jesus’ name, there he is with us?”They stared at me blankly. I had no intention of going easy on them.“That is what Matthew says, is it not?”At last, one spoke up: “Yes, that’s right.”And they nervously stepped forward into a circle.I said to one:\u0026nbsp“You start us off.” And she did, going through the motions quickly and antiseptically because they clearly wanted to get as far as they could from this awkward situation. And then I picked it up when it was clear she was done.“Lord Jesus, thank you for the benefit of these friends,” I began, wholly honest with God about how I hoped she would bless my new friends, encouraging them to affirm and be inclusive of others. I was hopeful that their community would honour all as God made them and value the strength of ersity.I mentioned the natural beauty of the LGBT+\u0026nbspcommunity and thanked God again for making us as we are, throwing in a genuine wish that their trip back home would be a safe one.Then, knowing my audience, I wrapped up with the usual evangelical banal phraseology –\u0026nbsp“no weapons shall be formed against them”,\u0026nbsp“put God on their hearts” –\u0026nbspto let them know I was just as familiar with their community’s vernacular as they were, maybe more so.As I finished, having returned their “let us pray for you” to them tenfold, they murmured their thank you’s and scuttled away.I don’t know whether my words made it through, but I hope they have a sense of what it feels like to have a stranger impose self-righteous venom on them. I also hope that they’ll realise how much actions such as these diminish the power of prayer and enable so much harm to LGBT+\u0026nbsppeople.A prayer that one might change their sexuality or gender identity is egregious encouragement to those who would seek to discriminate against LGBT+\u0026nbsppeople in our laws and to do violence against them in our communities. My own prayer’s acidity served to make them aware of their own by way of spiritual inoculation.The Genderquake debate did more harm than good for transgender peopleWhy has Caitlyn Jenner been chosen to speak about ‘ersity’?These people did not want to know more about me. They wanted to talk at me and pray at me. And I’m confident that’s not how Jesus would go about it.There are many in the evangelical community who love and affirm their LGBT+\u0026nbspfamily, friends and fellow human beings.It’s unfortunate, then, that others in the community still must be told a simple truth: They are not doing the Lord’s work by politicising prayer at the expense of others or by dumping their misplaced condescension on strangers they believe to be broken.Prayer should be a loving act, not a weapon of marginalisation.Clymer ia a transgender woman,\u0026nbspUS\u0026nbspArmy veteran and\u0026nbsppress secretary at the Human Rights Campaign\u0026nbspEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Opponents said it would also unfairly penalise people in social housing, as only they would be liable to be evicted.UK news in picturesDemonstrators at the People\u0027s March demanding a People\u0027s Vote on the final Brexit deal, in London, on the second anniversary of the 2016 referendum.Andria Marsh, 63, holds up photographs of her parents and her original British passport, following a Windrush service at Westminster Abbey in London.

Killing others is a defeat. To those who tried to ide us, I want to tell you that you have not succeeded\u0027Mattha Busby and agenciesClick to followThe Independent OnlineEthiopians at a rally in Addis Ababa in support of the new prime minister, Abiy AhmedAt least two people have been killed\u0026nbspand others injured following an explosion at a political rally in support of Ethiopia’s new reformist leader.In a televised address after the blast on Saturday, which eyewitnesses said was caused by a grenade, Abiy Ahmed described the incident as “an unsuccessful attempt by forces who do not want to see Ethiopia united”.He said “a few people have lost their lives” and others were injured in the attack, that came shortly after he spoke to a crowd of tens of thousands of supporters on Meskel Square in the capital, Addis Ababa. Mr Ahmed has not yet blamed anyone for the blast, nor has anyone claimed responsibility, and police are investigating.“Love always wins,” he said. “Killing others is a defeat. To those who tried to ide us, I want to tell you that you have not succeeded.” An Associated Press reporter said they saw more than a dozen injured people. Ethiopians have been heartened by a slew of reforms under Mr\u0026nbspAhmed and had come together in a show of support in numbers unseen in recent years in the east African nation. The rally has now broken up with people singing, chanting and going back to their homes. In a cowboy hat and T-shirt, Mr\u0026nbspAhmed had addressed the crowd in Meskel Square as supporters wore clothes displaying his image and carried signs saying “One Love, One Ethiopia”.Mr\u0026nbspAhmed told the tens of thousands of supporters that change was coming after years of anti-government tensions and there was no turning back. “For the past 100 years hate has done a great deal of damage to us,” he said, stressing the need for even more reforms. The 42-year-old entered office in April and went about introducing a swift package of liberalising reforms which surprised Africa’s second most populous country.He announced the release of tens of thousands of prisoners, the opening of state-owned companies to private investment and the unconditional embrace of a peace deal with rival Eritrea. “I’ve never thought this day will come in Ethiopia. I’m very emotional right now,” said Mulugeta Sema, a supporter of Mr\u0026nbspAhmed who wore a T-shirt with the new leader’s image. “We should never get back to dictatorship. This is time for change.” British man held on death row in Ethiopia for four years releasedEthiopia demands Britain return all country’s artefacts held by V\u0026ampAHowever, not everyone has supported the reforms. Some Ethiopians near the border with Eritrea have protested the embrace of the peace deal. Meanwhile, the Tigrayan People’s Liberation Front, the dominant force in Ethiopian government for much of the past 27 years, said the peace deal had been made before the ruling coalition’s congress met to discuss it.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

He urged Indians to be proud of their culture and history.“The gems of India’s unique heritage, such as yoga, will be respected by the world at large only when we ourselves respect our culture and traditions,” he said.Around the world, public yoga events were held in Afghanistan, Japan and Peru, while Australia and South Africa celebrated on Monday.“From Tokyo to Toronto, from Stockholm to Sao Paulo, yoga has become a positive influence in the lives of millions,” Mr Modi told participants on the lush green lawns.“In a world where non-communicable diseases, stress and lifestyle related ailments are rising, yoga can play a central role in mitigating these diseases to create a healthy mind and body.”In the buildup to Thursday’s event, Mr Modi took part in a social media campaign, begun by his BJP party ministers, to get people to share videos of their fitness workouts on Twitter.Celebrities\u0026nbspfrom Bollywood actors to sports superstars\u0026nbspgot involved, and Mr Modi’s own video showed him performing yoga on a boulder in his prime ministerial gardens.Social media was again awash with videos emulating Mr Modi’s on Thursday, including from staff at Delhi airport, pupils at thousands of schools and members of India’s armed forces.Amid questions over his appeal, PM Modi’s party sweeps to key victoryPlea to Indian PM in London for ‘tortured’ captive elephants Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi accused of spying on citizens India PM makes point of visiting Palestinians after meeting NetanyahuThe Indian navy released pictures of sailors doing yoga on board the world’s oldest aircraft carrier, the INS Viraat, decommissioned last year, and soldiers guarding the world’s highest battleground, the Siachen glacier in northern Jammu and Kashmir state, did yoga routines at an altitude of around 18,000 feet.The events clearly mustered a huge amount of public support. For some, however, there was a sinister edge to having public institutions take part in a scheme closely associated with the prime minister’s messaging. Even prisons were involved, with 15,000 inmates due to take part in yoga events on Thursday in the capital alone.Sagarika Ghose, a prominent journalist and political commentator, wrote on Twitter: “Believer in yoga, try every morning, immense benefits. But concerned: why does a GOVERNMENT need to promote yoga? Yoga’s an inidual choice, a personal option.”Mr Modi’s rule, she said, was “fast becoming an escapist Bollywood film where song and dance attempt to distract from hard realities”. One of the most liked responses to Ms Ghose’s tweet told her to “go to Pakistan” if she couldn’t show loyalty to India.For Ajay Mehra, a political scientist at Delhi University, the International Day of Yoga “has become an imposition”, forced on the people by government.“Something like yoga should not be part of a political project,” he told The Independent, adding that there were certain yogic practices – chanting mantras for instance – that could be offensive to some groups in a plural society, “Muslims in particular”.Mr Mehra noted that Jawaharlal Nehru, the first prime minister of India, stressed the importance of secular, pluralist leadership while also being a devoted practitioner of yoga – “but he didn’t publicise it”.International Day of YogaEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

When the downpour finally came, it was worse than anyone feared.In just four days, Cox’s Bazar received two-thirds of the average rainfall expected in the month of June. More than 100 landslides have been reported, several people have died and hundreds of families have been made homeless, forced to sleep in mosques or crowd into shelters with their relatives.Ahead of World Refugee Day\u0026nbspon Wednesday, the UN released a report showing that the number of displaced people in the world has risen to a new record high of 68.5 million, and highlighting the plight of the Rohingya fleeing persecution in Myanmar as one of the biggest drivers pushing up that number.But speaking from Cox’s Bazar in a break in the weather that has coincided with the end of the Ramadan fast, Caroline Gluck, a senior official with the UN’s refugee agency, said their message this year was to “celebrate” World Refugee Day as a tribute to those struggling through such hardship, and the charities fighting to help them.As is the case with the wider refugee crisis across the globe, the population of those displaced in Bangladesh is made up mostly of women and children. Aid workers have found that creating women-only centres for healthcare, counselling and childcare is having a dramatic impact on the Rohingya’s quality of life.Rohingya women and girls are taught sewing, play games, receive medical care and are offered counselling at women-only centres run by charities like IRC in Cox\u0027s Bazar (Jessica Wanless)“In any crisis, women and children are the most vulnerable,” Ms Gluck told The Independent - a problem only exacerbated as flooding and landslides cripple camp infrastructure. “Night-time can be a worrying time, particularly if you have to travel to use toilets. The camp is quite sprawled, and instead of living alongside people you know, you are living with strangers.”One of the charities providing women-only centres is the International Rescue Committee (IRC). Dalia Al-Awqati, IRC’s emergency director in Bangladesh, said up to 80 per cent of the refugees are women and children and in need of “specialised support”.“Many Rohingya women and girls have been raped, seen their husbands and children killed before their eyes and lots of them are facing raising their children alone,” she told The Independent. “They live in a situation that is exacerbated by the presence of stigma and discrimination.”IRC\u0027s women-only centres (Jessica Wanless)For 12-year-old Azara, the centre is an oasis of normalcy in a situation that is anything but, and a welcome break from the boredom that comes with living in a refugee camp.She said she came to the centre every day, finding a safe space where she can make friends, play games and engage in her favourite pastime - henna.“It feels like home,” she said. “We come straight after we have been to school. Every week there is at least one day for sewing. Every week we learn something new. We love to learn.”Ex-UN ambassador says \u0027destroying Rohingya exceeds costs\u0027 for MyanmarRohingya facing \u0027crisis on top of crisis\u0027 as world looks other wayRohingya say Myanmar singled out the educated in genocideArmed Rohingya group massacred Hindus in Myanmar, report alleges\u0027Bittersweet\u0027 Ramadan for Rohingya Muslims forced to flee their homesMs Gluck said centres like those run by the IRC were vital to encourage women “carrying the burden” of what happened to them in Myanmar to come forward and seek counselling and support, in what is traditionally a very culturally conservative society.Media reports have previously highlighted a spike in births nine months after the alleged brutal crackdown by Myanmar’s army in Rakhine state that forced the Rohingya to flee. The danger, Ms Gluck said, is that all pregnancies in the camp become stigmatised as potentially being the result of rape.And one of the biggest positives to come out of the creation of the centres has been the number of female volunteers working to foster new communities in their makeshift home.A lot of women are taking on jobs as safety volunteers or in counselling their fellow refugees directly, having received training from NGOs. “It has helped women to develop roles that they didn’t have back home,” Ms Gluck said.Senwara stands in the Kutupalong refugee camp in Cox\u0027s Bazar (Timothy NesmithIRC)Senwara, a 35-year-old mother of four, is a volunteer who helps spread word about the centre to other refugees. She became the only female “Majhi” or community leader in her area of the camp after helping distribute food aid, and sees promoting the centre as part of her responsibility.“Women come here to this centre because there are no men,” she said. “If there were men, families would not let teenagers or women giving birth come here because they would feel shy. They are serious about this matter.”Ms Gluck said the few days of good weather, plus celebrations around Eid, had brought “joy to many faces” in the camps. There is an upbeat mood also to coincide with World Refugee Day, with singing, volleyball and other competitions put on to showcase the best of life in the camps.Rohingya Crisis in Photos Rohingya

He added that the dossier would involve a “census of Roma in Italy” which would “see who, how, how many”. He added: “Unfortunately, you need to keep Italian Roma in Italy.”The country\u0026nbspis estimated to be home to between 100,000 and 180,000 Roma.The minister’s actions drew criticism from human rights groups and opposition politicians.“The way is short from a census to a concentration camp. Salvini apparently decided to celebrate the 80th anniversary of the racial laws,” Chiara Gribaudo, a deputy from the centre-left Democratic Party said, referencing the Mussolini era.The way is short from a census to a concentration camp“The interior minister does not seem to know that a census on the basis of ethnicity is not permitted by law,” said Carlo Stasolla, president of\u0026nbspAssociazione 21 Luglio, a group that\u0026nbspcampaigns for\u0026nbspRoma\u0026nbsprights.Responding to anger at his comments, the minister tweeted: “Someone is talking about being shocked.

They thought nothing of \u0026lsquobuying\u0026rsquo women and abusing them... to fund their love of luxury cars and property.DC Eddy said the Met had decided to charge Nastase for reasons of continuity.He explained: \u0026ldquoBecause we led the prosecution, it was decided we should also prosecute him, rather than a new one start in Romania, even though his alleged offence was committed over there.Asked about Constantin Mihai\u0026rsquos conviction for attempted murder, a Home Office spokesman said: \u0026ldquoWe will always seek to deport any foreign national with a history of serious or persistent convictions overseas."},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/1/590x/978734_1.jpg","title":"meghan markle thomas markle suit royal ascot royal wedding","story":"ITVThomas Markle did not attend his daughter Meghan\u0027s Wedding Mr Markle was unable to travel to Windsor to walk his daughter, now the Duchess of Sussex, down the aisle.Mr Spence, who is well-known in the horse racing world, was seen wearing the suit at Royal Ascot on Tuesday.The Duke and Duchess of Sussex were also in attendance on the same day.The Duchess did see the suit in person, but sadly it was not worn by her father as she originally expected.

They’ve far too much to discuss among themselves.”Migration is plunging European politics into crisis again. German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s coalition is threatening to break apart over the issue.While in Italy, the new government is threatening to close its southern border — blocking migrant rescue ships from landing — and open its northern border, encouraging illegal migrants and asylum seekers to head north to Germany and Sweden.So worried is European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker that he is hosting a mini-summit tomorrow to try to find a solution to the migrant crisis which can help save Merkel’s political career.It is tempting to look at the EU in crisis and say that is why the UK is leaving. But this crisis is making it more difficult for Britain to get a reasonable Brexit deal.The European Commission is running the Brexit negotiations.Its priority is in defending the theology of the European Union, rather than finding practical solutions. As one leading figure in the Government laments to me, Brussels’ chief negotiator Michel Barnier “won’t budge off CETA (Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement) with Northern Ireland stuck in the customs union”.This kind of Canada-style free trade deal is regarded by the Government as inadequate.Mrs May and co have long hoped that the member states, nearly all of whose economies would be hurt by such a limited agreement, would intervene at some point and tell the Commission to engage more constructively with the UK. But this is happening all too rarely.One of the reasons is, in the words of one member of the Brexit inner Cabinet: “Only four national capitals are fully across Brexit.”Many of the countries that are most sympathetic to the UK don’t have the capacity to follow all of the issues concerned.Over the past few years, the key to any deal in Europe has been Merkel. She is not now going to ride to Britain’s rescue— as David Cameron found to his cost in the renegotiation.But the German Chancellor could push the Commission towards a slightly more pragmatic approach.However, she is now trying to keep her own governing coalition together, as well as come up with a deal with the French for eurozone reform, leaving next to no time for Brexit.I am told that when Brexit is discussed in meetings she is “visibly distracted”, turning to aides for advice far more frequently than she does on other issues.This situation is one of the many reasons why the Government should have prepared vigorously for no deal: A credible threat to walk away from the table if the Commission didn’t behave in a reasonable fashion would have got the member states’ attention.But Mrs May now must hope the EU can patch together some deal on migration and that the member states begin thinking seriously about what kind of post-Brexit relationship they want with this country.WHEN the Cabinet gathers at Chequers next month to thrash out the UK’s offer to the EU, one of the most contentious issues will be customs.The Brexit inner Cabinet is split between those who favour a so-called “new customs partnership” (NCP) with the EU – which would see the UK continue to apply EU tariffs after Brexit, with companies receiving a rebate if their goods stayed in Britain rather than heading to the continent – and those who advocate Max Fac, which would use technology to minimise border checks.Two Cabinet working groups are trying to find a way to make these ideas work. Neither group has had a decisive breakthrough yet. But I am told the Max Fac one is “not a million miles away” from a solution.The challenge for the PM is to make these plans acceptable to her own side, including David Davis and Liam Fox. One Brexit inner Cabinet member tells me: “She’s got to have David and Liam. If she doesn’t have them, then she has no solution.”Both Davis and Fox support the Max Fac option. But there are influential figures in No10 who remain convinced that NCP is the option to go for. They argue only NCP can help deal with the Irish border issue and get the Government through next month’s crucial Commons votes on the customs union. They warn: “No NCP, no Brexit.”The fear among Brexiteers is Mrs May will use this Chequers meeting to try to push through a modified version of NCP. They fear the reason the whole Cabinet will be present on the second day is to give Mrs May the numbers to do this if the Brexit inner Cabinet remains split on the issue.Doing this, though, would be extremely risky. It would leave Mrs May with a policy that neither her Brexit Secretary nor her International Trade Secretary support.THE Chancellor and the Defence Secretary aren’t just split over how much money the military should get, but what it should be spent on, too.One Cabinet ally of Philip Hammond’s complains that Gavin Williamson wants to “spend the money on uniformed officers when he should be spending it on robotics and the like”.Their view is that this would be a better response to the 21st-century security challenges Britain faces.But in truth, Britain needs both conventional and new, hi-tech forces if it is to respond to the variety of threats now out of there. That is why we MUST spend more on defence.Those close to Williamson point out that if the Government doesn’t increase the defence budget, our status as the leading military spender in Europe – upon which so much of our influence in the world depends – will be under threat as the French and the Germans increase their military budgets.NEXT week, Theresa May will give a speech setting out the Government’s post-Brexit industrial strategy.Key to this must be artificial intelligence, an area where we are one of the leading nations in the world.I understand that the importance of maintaining the UK’s edge in AI is what led to Mrs May accepting Home Secretary Sajid Javid and Digital Secretary Matt Hancock’s argument that visa rules for tech entrepreneurs must be relaxed.The countries that succeed at AI will end up defining this century.So any deal with the EU must preserve the UK’s ability to regulate these industries of the future in a way decided by us, not Brussels.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

TV’s Richard Madeley spoke for them recently when he said we now had a duty to see it through in full by leaving the single market and customs union.He was right. To pretend that Brexit can be “softened” to honour the substantial Remain vote — a nightmarish fudge which Boris Johnson warns of today — is simply dishonest. There is leaving and there is remaining. That’s it.Brussels has revelled in Britain tearing itself apart. Now it is sidetracked by its own problems. A deal looks miles off.Theresa May has only one path forward.

I’m out of here.”Former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith has told Mrs May to turn the tables on “bullying” Eurocrats when she returns to Brussels this week.He believes she is in her strongest ­position yet to get them to discuss their relationship with Britain when we leave on March 29 next year.In the 15 months since Article 50 was triggered, they have refused to discuss trade while our own MPs argued among themselves.But Mrs May’s hand was strengthened last week after she saw off the rebels to get the EU Withdrawal Bill through ­Parliament.Tory MP Mr Duncan Smith warned she must show her mettle as she faces the biggest test of any PM in peacetime at next week’s Brussels showdown.He told The Sun on Sunday: “Theresa May now has the upper hand in these talks.They have been watching us fight among ourselves over Brexit for months and didn’t have to do anything because her position was so weak.“They knew there was an outside chance it wouldn’t happen, so they’ve dug in on all the practical stuff such as trade and bogged us down with other details.“But now it has been voted through. We are leaving. They cannot stop it.“I’ve advised Theresa to tell them bluntly to agree to talk about trade or she is leaving.“If they refuse to engage, she must have the resolve to get up and leave the table — making clear she will take our ­£40billion contribution with her.“Theresa must put her cards on the table and tell them she wants to talk about trade now.“If they tell her they don’t want to, she should put her business card on the table and say ‘Tell you what.There’s my ­number. Give me a buzz if you change your minds.Meanwhile, we’ve got nothing more to say to you’.“Then she should turn to her aides and say, ‘We can catch the ten past six if we hurry now.Can you get some cars because we’re on our way.We’ve got work to do. Nice to see you all. OK, guys. Take care. Goodbye!’“That will bring them to their senses rather quickly.“The 27 other EU countries are desperate for a deal so they can sell us their cars, cheeses and potato products.“They’ve tried to push us around for the past couple of years but Theresa has the upper hand now and she must show them who’s boss.”Slamming the way EU officials have treated Britain as “disgusting”, Mr Duncan Smith said: “Undiplomatic doesn’t begin to cover it.“They’ve done their level best to ­humiliate and be rude to us. They are meant to be our friends and allies.”Singling out chief negotiator Michel Barnier, European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker and ­European Parliament co-ordinator Guy Verhofstadt, he added: “Come this week, we can tell them their days of behaving like ­playground bullies are over.”He said Wednesday’s flagship vote was THE most significant bill passed in the Commons since the treaty to join the fledgling ­European Economic Community in 1973.Crucially, it removes any chance of Brexit being derailed and the clock really has begun ticking towards our departure in 278 days.Brexiteers now warn that the PM must finalise a deal by November, to leave time to clear it all by February.Mr Duncan Smith said: “She is in a stronger position than she’s been in for some months.Getting the most critical bit of legislation through last week means she goes to the European Council knowing our departure is now settled.“That means she is back in charge of the negotiation and there is no way they can stop Brexit.“Now it’s down to raw negotiation, and the question facing the EU is how much they want to have a good relationship.“We do, and the Prime Minister has been open about that. But she has to be ready to walk away.“I’ve done negotiations in business and that’s what you do. You say, ‘There’s nothing on the table that I can agree to here. Sorry, I’m off’.“Never buy a car until you’ve attempted to walk out of the showroom at least twice.There is no better way to get the price down than to say, ‘I’m off, it’s too expensive, I’ll go somewhere else.’It’s not so much calling their bluff. It’s calling them out.“It’s kind of like poker — and Theresa has to force them to show their hand.”Last week’s decision to pump an extra £20billion into the NHS — partly funded by savings from EU contributions — will also send a clear message to Brussels that Britain is leaving.Mr Duncan Smith said: “It’s a down-payment that says we have to leave.“It shows she knows we’re leaving and we won’t be paying them any more money after a set time.”But has Mrs May got what it takes to face down the Brussels bully boys?Mr Duncan Smith said: “I think she has the steel to surprise them.“We’ve seen before what she’s like when she really digs her heels in.

BoJo declared: “We don’t want some bog roll Brexit – soft, yielding and seemingly infinitely long.”But Dr Fox said he’d be happy to let the process roll on a little longer, if it means making a clean break.He said: “What I wanted was that we were outside of the single market, the customs union and the European Court of Justice. That’s where I think we’re going to end up.“If we do it slightly more slowly in order to minimise any disruption, that’s fine by me. Having waited 40-odd years to leave the European Union, a few extra months doesn’t bother me if we‘re getting it right.”Dr Fox insists an extension to Article 50 to keep Britain in the EU beyond March 29 would be “politically unacceptable”. But on the second anniversary of the historic referendum, he said prolonging the implementation period beyond 2020 would not be a problem.The minister told Sky’s Sophy Ridge on Sunday: “If the transition period had to be extended for technical reasons with the backstop…and we already had the withdrawal agreement and future economic partnership agreed, I wouldn’t have a major problem with that.”He stressed that any extension must be “very time limited” and there must be a mechanism for Britain to pull out if we thought we were being kept in the EU against our will.The clash comes ahead of Theresa May’s trip to Brussels this week for her first showdown with EU chiefs since she saw off Brexit rebels to get the Withdrawal Bill through Parliament.Senior ministers have urged her to show she is prepared to play hardball and insist that talks no turn to our future trade relationship. Dr Fox warned EU negotiators would be unwise to think the PM is “bluffing” about the possibility of walking out without a deal.He told the BBC: “The Prime Minister has always said that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed and that no deal would be better than a bad deal.I think it’s essential, as we enter the next phase of the negotiations, that the European Union understands and believes it.Our negotiating partners would not be wise if they believed that the Prime Minister was bluffing.”The minister warned that the economic impact on EU countries would be severe if they failed to strike a deal.But he said staying in the single market would be unacceptable because it would imply continuation of free movement of people and staying under the jurisdiction of the European Court.Former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith today urges Mrs May to leave her business card on the table and walk away if EU chief rebuff he demands to talk trade.He told The Sun on Sunday: “She should say ‘Here’s my number. Give me a call if you change your mind’ and catch the next train back to London.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Im so excited its actually happening.She had a US drivers license before obtaining a Saudi one and appeared comfortable at the wheel as she pulled up and parked.As for the male drivers on the road, she said: They were really supportive and cheering and smiling.In a few hours, she says shell drive herself to work for the first time in Saudi Arabia.Samira al-Ghamdi, 47, one of the first Saudi women to be issued with a driving licence, said: We are ready, and it will totally change our life.Saudi women with foreign licences only began converting them earlier this month, so the number of new drivers is expected to remain low at first.It will be some time before others learning to drive at new state-run schools are road ready, while some women still face resistance from conservative relatives.Many accustomed to using a private driver say they are reluctant to take on the Muslim kingdoms busy highways.Fayza al-Shammary, a 22-year-old saleswoman, said: I definitely wont like to drive.I like to be a princess with someone opening the car door for me and driving me anywhere.The change is part of sweeping reforms by the kings son Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who aims to transform the economy of the worlds top oil exporter.The lifting of the ban, which for years drew international condemnation, has been welcomed by Western allies as proof of a new progressive trend in Saudi Arabia.For nearly three decades, outspoken Saudi women and the men who supported them had called for women to have the right to drive.They faced arrest for defying the ban as women in other Muslim countries drove freely.In 1990, during the first driving campaign by activists, women who got behind the wheels of their cars in the capital, Riyadh, lost their jobs, faced severe stigmatisation and were barred from travel abroad for a year.Ultraconservatives in Saudi Arabia had long warned that allowing women to drive would lead to sin and expose women to harassment.Ahead of allowing women to drive, the kingdom passed a law against sexual harassment with up to five years prison for the most severe cases.Criticism against women driving has largely been muted since since King Salman announced last year that they would be allowed to drive.Simultaneously, however, at least 10 of the most outspoken supporters of womens rights were arrested just weeks before the ban was lifted."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NINTCHDBPICT000414180986.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"royal wedding thomas markle morning suit pr meghan","story":"Thomas Markle, 73, had been set to walk his daughter down the aisle at Windsor Castle for her big day but was unable to attend after suffering a heart attack.Instead the suit was left on the peg at upmarket Chelsea outfitters Oliver Brown.That is until Johnno Spence visited the shop and picked up the semi-bespoke morning suit at a knock-down price of £2,000.Meghan, now the Duchess of Sussex, is said to have personally commissioned the company’s owner Kristian Robson to make several outfits for her father, not just the suit for the wedding.The list included three shirts with size 18 collars and double cuffs, in blue, yellow and white a navy blue weekend suit a single-breasted waistcoat and a set of tails.A source told The Daily : When Johnno walked in, the tailor said: We’ve got the perfect morning suit for you as well as a summer suit and three shirts for you if you want them.Spence is said to have paid £2,000 for the items, around half the normal price and proudly wore the morning suit to Ascot.Oliver Brown, established 35 years ago, is the official tailor of Royal Ascot, where a top hat and tails are compulsory for Royal Enclosure guests.Spences PR firm, JSC Communications counts jockey Ryan Moore, National Hunt rider Nico de Boinville and Champion Apprentice jockey Josephine Gordon as clients."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NINTCHDBPICT000415655113.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"tory mp nusrat ghani inspirational muslims","story":"But we live in a fantastic country where you are not limited by the expectations set upon you at birth and where tolerance runs deep.We should be proud our society has remained open.My own example shows what we have achieved.In one generation of setting foot in this great country, I am helping lay foundations for future generations.The Sun on Sunday’s super coverage of Inspirational Muslims will no doubt challenge misconceptions but most of all will inspire readers to live to their full potential.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We know that over three-quarters of them find offers for sugary sweets and snacks at checkouts annoying.“It’s our job to give power to parents to make healthier choices and to make their life easier in doing so.”Last night the obesity plan received broad support.Alison Tedstone, chief nutritionist at Public Health England, said: “Having a takeaway or eating out is no longer a treat, it’s a regular part of everyday life, yet too often menus are information free zones.“Clear and consistent information on menus at the point of choice is the bold commitment needed to help families make healthier choices and avoid obesity-related health problems.”Some supermarkets already restrict sales to under-16s after calls from teachers and experts.Ministers must decide on a 16 or 18 age limit. Research shows the drinks can trigger unruly and dangerous behaviour.Caroline Cerny, of the Obesity Health Alliance, added: “The plan crucially addresses the issue of children being continually exposed to junk food adverts when they watch their favourite TV shows and when they go online.”Chris Askew, of Diabetes UK, said: “With one in three children either overweight or obese before they leave primary school, it’s clear that bold, decisive action needs to be taken. Being overweight as a child can significantly increase your risk of developing serious conditions like Type 2 diabetes in the future.”But Advertising Association chief Stephen Woodford said: “UK advertising rules are already among the strictest in the world.“International experience and independent research has shown advertising bans have little impact on the wider societal issues that drive obesity, which is caused by the interaction of many complex factors and requires a multi-faceted solution.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Today they do their socialising online – and like junk food, it’s highly addictive.“We’ve got to do something about this. That’s why we want schools to play a part in getting pupils in the habit of exercising regularly.”Mr Hunt who runs up to six miles, three times a week, said he wants to help parents to help their kids.“We’re not going to halve childhood obesity through government action alone.

Open Britain is a limited company formerly known as the In Campaign, which was designated by the Electoral Commission as an official lead campaign group in the referendum along with Vote Leave.Lord Mandelson, Tony Blair\u0027s former director of communications, is listed a current director.The march saw politicians, citizens and campaigners from across the UK walk from Pall Mall to Parliament Square, calling on the government to listen to their voices and give them a say.Among those taking part were farmers, doctors, teachers, delivery drivers, students, fishermen and veterans from the Armed Forces - as well as former supporters of Brexit.Another accused the government of being incompetent.They said: \"When the vote took place, we could not have anticipated how incompetent this government would be on negotiating.\"It\u0027s not good enough to say \u0027the people said this at one point\u0027\u0026#8230\"Matthew Mann, originally from south Gloucestershire, who moved to the Netherlands in 2016 for work, said: \"I\u0027m here to show what a European looks like.\"I\u0027m married to a French wife, I have two children who are dual national, and we live in Holland and are caught up in this administrative mess.\"I have lived and worked across Europe, it\u0027s home.\" There was a cross-party presence at the march, with members of the Conservatives, Labour, Greens and Lib Dems all calling on the government to allow a vote on the final deal that is reached with the EU."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/06/2048x1152/skynews-cedella-roman-facebook_4343473.jpg?20180623132459 ","title":"final rallies in turkey ahead of crucial election","story":"A coalition of parties have teamed up to challenge the hold that Mr Erdogan\u0027s AK party has on parliament - and the president risks losing his majority.\"We want change,\" one opposition supporter told Sky News. \"We can win, yes we can win.\" The president has arrested and jailed many of his opponents and critics since the attempted coup in 2016.From his prison cell, he told Sky News that he doesn\u0027t think the elections will be free and fair: \"A fair election would mean AKP cannot win.\"If Erdogan and AKP finally decide to think about the welfare of the country and decide to respect the will of the voters, then voters will be able to vote in a fair and free atmosphere.The results of the elections should be known by late evening."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/06/2048x1152/skynews-kit-harington-rose-leslie_4343878.jpg?20180623182559 ","title":"game of thrones stars kit harington and rose leslie marry at family castle","story":"The actors met in 2012 while filming the long-running saga in Iceland, where they were playing Jon Snow and Ygritte.

The Health Secretary is appalled at new figures which show a quarter of youngsters aged six to nine knock back the fizzy products, which are laden with sugar and caffeine. So today he will announce a consultation on plans to stop shops selling them to under-18s in a bid to halve childhood obesity by 2030. Mr Hunt will say: “It is near impossible to shield children from exposure to unhealthy foods. Parents are asking for help.  “It’s our job to give them power to make healthier choices and make their lives easier in doing so.” Supermarkets Asda, Waitrose, Tesco and the Co-op introduced a voluntary ban on selling energy drinks with over 150mg of caffeine a litre earlier this year. Red Bull and similar drinks can contain as much caffeine as a strong coffee and up to a dozen teaspoonfuls of sugar. Shops will also be stopped from putting sweets at checkouts or offering them in buy-one-get-one-free deals.  TV ads promoting foods high in fat, sugar or salt are likely to be banned before the 9pm watershed and there will be mandatory calorie labelling in restaurants, cafes and takeaways. Public Health England boss Duncan Selbie welcomed what he called “bold steps” in the war on rising childhood obesity. Cancer Research UK and Diabetes UK also backed Mr Hunt’s plans. But Shadow Health Secretary Jonathan Ashworth said: “We need bold action not another watered-down, lame duck strategy.”  “It’s our job to give them power to make healthier choices and to make their life easier in doing so. “The cost of obesity – both on individual lives and to our NHS – is too great to ignore.” Supermarkets Asda, Waitrose, Tesco and the Co-op introduced a voluntary ban on selling energy drinks with more than 150mg of caffeine per litre earlier this year. Mr Hunt will go further and make it illegal for all shops to sell the drinks to kids, and is considering putting them on a par with alcohol so only over 18s can buy them. Stores will also be stopped from putting tempting sweets at check-outs where children pester their parents for them, or including them in buy-one-get-one-free offers. TV ads promoting high fat, sugar or salt foods are likely to be banned before the 9pm watershed and there will be mandatory calorie labelling in restaurants, cafes and takeaways.

So-called County Lines bosses groom kids as young as 11 and force them to deliver cocaine and heroin ordered via special hotlines. But the level of violence is soaring and youngsters are handed weapons in case rivals try to steal their stash. We can also reveal that exploited children are even being “traded in” as gangsters sell off lucrative hotlines. Dealers build up a client base of drug users before selling the list for tens of thousands of pounds – and throwing in their child workforce.  The National Crime Agency believes more than 1,000 gangs are operating hotlines. The NCA has at least 200 live operations in place to smash the rings. Each line can make \u0026pound5,000 a day – \u0026pound1.8million a year. The grim trade sees:  Children having drugs forced inside their bodies – known as “plugging” – and trafficked nationwide. Horrific videos of attacks and revenge beatings shared on social media to intimidate rivals and warn gang members wanting to break free. Recruits subjected to sexual abuse or forced into prostitution. Social media sites like Periscope used by gangsters “like CCTV” to keep tabs on youngsters out on the streets.   Junior Smart, who leads the SOS Project with the St Giles Trust, said: “People are saying this is happening in deprived areas with specific demographics. People expect it to be \u0026shytypically a black youth, hoodie up and wearing a manbag. “That’s not how it works. It can start with simply being offered drugs and within days they have debt bondage and are stuck in the criminal world. “Even middle class children are getting involved because their families have the means to pay off debts and gang leaders can earn cash. “People have been recruited from primary school age. Others have mental health problems, learning difficulties. Gangs hang around school gates and see those who are being bullied, alone and are easy targets. “They target youth hostels, referral units. It’s an immediate workforce for them. One of the biggest problems is children – thousands of them – not being reported when they go missing.” The revelations come just days after police seized a 10in hunting knife as they smashed a gang supplying heroin and crack cocaine from London’s East End to Ipswich, Suffolk. And in April gang leaders Mahad Yusuf, 21, and Fesal Mahamud, 20, were jailed for a total of 19 years for trafficking a teen from Enfield, North London, to Wales.  Kids are promised cash, a flashy lifestyle, friendship and respect. But once sucked in they are invited to share drugs – only to be landed with massive debts that they must work off. It is understood 5,000 children were picked up by authorities last year over fears they were forced into slavery. That was 35 per cent up in a year. The NCA has revealed grim details of sexual abuse, while politicians have told of their fears for trapped kids. Labour’s Ann Coffey, who chairs the All Party Parliamentary Group for Runaway and Missing Children and Adults, said: “The extent of the violence is new – and it’s reaching into almost every small town in the UK.” "},{"url":null,"title":"11 best spots uk watch","story":"Advertorial11 best spots in the UK to watch an amazing sunset this summerThis week marks the summer solstice – and is also the official start of summer.

June 21, the summer solstice in the Northern Hemisphere, is the longest day in the year - affording us approximately 17 hours of daylight. Technically, this also means that the nights will start drawing in again now - so there\u0027s really no time like the present to get out and explore the great outdoors on some of the country’s most breathtaking bike rides. We\u0027ve taken a look around the UK to find the best places to watch the sun setting. 1. Museum of Scottish Lighthouses, Fraserburgh, Scotland  A small village called Maud in Aberdeenshire offers a starting place for a traffic-free cycle to the coast. If you\u0027re in the mood to learn then head to the Museum of Scottish Lighthouses in Fraserburgh. The sun will set at around 10.12pm this week in this part of Scotland, so you\u0027ve got loads of time to enjoy the start of the summer. Bike need replacing?   If your existing bike needs replacing, you\u0027ll want something efficient and speedy for the roads - like the Carrera Parva Hybrid bike , which comes in versions for both men and women and is now just \u0026pound210 (a saving of \u0026pound90). And if you don\u0027t need a new bike, why not have yours checked over before setting off. Like any mode of transport your bike needs to be looked after and regularly checked for wear and tear. Halfords offers a 32-point Free Bike Check which includes:  Frame, saddle and handlebar Wheels including tyres, rims, spokes and hubs Brake system including levers, calipers, pads and cables / hoses Drivetrain including gears, levers, chain, bottom bracket, cranks and cables  2. The Eden Project, Cornwall   Why not spend the day enjoying the amazing sights at the Eden Project? Best of all, if you arrive by bike you\u0027ll get a discount on entry. The sun sets on Eden at around 9:30pm on the solstice. Bear in mind though that the Eden Project shuts at 6pm, so you\u0027ll need to watch the sun go down somewhere nearby.  Get there in style on the Carrera Subway 1 Hybrid Bike , \u0026pound300. With easy to use 24 speed Shimano gearing, your effort for building speed will be minimised on all terrains, while its lightweight aluminium frame means you can quickly and efficiently ride to your destination. Camping out?   Planning to camp? Be sure you book in advance as you won\u0027t want to be without a pitch. Croft Farm Holiday Park is just a mile from the Eden Project and three miles from the beach. Pentewan Sands is also nearby and boasts amazing family facilities - as well as the nearby Pentewan Cycle Trail. Consider taking a Halfords Vis A Vis 4 Person Tent with you, which is currently reduced to just \u0026pound60, (was \u0026pound150, save \u0026pound90). The simple tunnel design is easy to pitch in approximately 20 minutes. With two separate bedrooms and a living area, it\u0027s perfect for families or groups of friends. For additional comfort pack an Urban Escape Folding Table And Bench Set , \u0026pound40 (was \u0026pound50, save \u0026pound10) which folds down into a single carry case to make it easy to transport and store.  3. Pembrokeshire Coast National Park, Wales  The Pembrokeshire Coast Path is an absolutely beautiful part of Wales and a stunning place to watch the sun go down. There are loads of campsites in the area, including some unique places to stay. There are plenty of bike routes too, with some offering traffic-free options if you want a more peaceful ride. In Pembrokeshire you can expect the sun to set around 9:39pm. Why not try..   The Boardman ADV 8.8 Adventure Bike , \u0026pound750, is a bike truly made to help you explore new possibilities. This bike is adept at riding in comfort on roads but really excels when you want to get off the beaten track.   4. White Nancy, Cheshire   Located on Kerridge Hill, White Nancy is a local landmark from which you can see all around the area, from Wales to the west and the Pennines to the north. From time to time White Nancy is painted to look like other things, like a Christmas pudding or with Olympic rings when London hosted in 2012. The sun will set over White Nancy at around 9:36 this week. Need to drive?  Heading further afield to enjoy the sunny days? If you\u0027re packing up the whole family into the car for a camping trip, make sure it\u0027s in good running order first. A Free Car Check performed by Halfords experts will put your mind at rest. Book online or just pop in to your local Halfords store and trained colleagues will carry out a free car bulb check and check your battery, wiper blades, engine oil level and air conditioning, and check for any windscreen chips.

With lifetime map updates you\u0027re never going to find yourself driving down a newly-closed street or down a disused road. 5. Edinburgh Castle, Scotland  There are few places that are as stunning as Edinburgh Castle, located atop Castle Rock. The views of Edinburgh from the castle are amazing, and a great place to watch the end of the day roll around. Sunset here will take place at 9:58pm. 6. Hampstead Heath, London  The scenery on Hampstead Heath always pleases the eye. This amazing part of London has views of every landmark you could hope for and it\u0027s a wonderful place to watch the sun go down. This will happen at around 9:18pm in the capital.   7. Osborne House, Isle of Wight   The home of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert is quite a sight to see. Accessible by bike (and ferry, if you\u0027re not an island resident), it\u0027s the ideal place to see during the day before you settle down somewhere to watch the sunset. If you\u0027re up for the cycle, Shanklin Chine on the west of the island is well worth an evening visit.  Do it with ease - and classic style - on the Pendleton Somerby Electric Hybrid Bike , \u0026pound750. With added electrically powered pedal assistance, it delivers 40 - 50 miles of range through a rear hub motor with speed sensor. This extra power is enough to guarantee effortless rides, taking the strain out of hills and making moving off from a standstill much easier. If you prefer, this bike is also available in a non electric version and in a range of colours - we love the mint green ! The sunset starts at 9:18pm near Osborne House and 9:17pm in Shanklin Chine.  8. Ness Point, Lowestoft    Ness Point is the UK\u0027s most easterly point. This makes it a great place to ride to on National Cycle Route 1. Make yourself comfortable on the Halfords XL Waterproof Picnic Blanket , \u0026pound10 (half price) and watch the waves crash in as the sun goes down. Sunset is 9:16 at the UK\u0027s most easterly point.  9. Blackpool Pleasure Beach, Lancashire   With plenty of places to cycle in the area you could have an amazing day out in Blackpool. Start with a ride to the Pleasure Beach, and have some fun with the kids (or without them!) on the roller coasters. When all that\u0027s done you can have fish and chips while the sun sets on another day. The sun will go set at around 9:43 in Blackpool.  10. Cotswolds, England  Spread over six counties there\u0027s a lot to see in the Cotswolds. Consider taking a ride through the picturesque Castle Combe to take in the amazing houses and the stunning market square. The sun sets on this beautiful village at 9:26pm  Find your way by car - and beat the traffic   If you\u0027re driving to somewhere new then why not add a sat nav to your car? The TomTom GO 6200 , \u0026pound270, (was \u0026pound339.99, save \u0026pound69.99) adds real-time traffic information to the navigational benefits of a sat nav (smartphone required for this feature).   11.

We surveyed every local authority to compile the list of shame – the streets that drew the most complaints. Our research was carried out after a study showed roads in Britain are worse than in Chile, Oman and Peru. And they are deadly. Between 2007 and 2016, 22 cyclists were killed and 368 were \u0026shyseriously injured due to crumbling roads, with the victim toll rising. Last year an inquest heard Roger Hamer, 83, died from severe brain \u0026shyinjuries after being flung off his bike when it hit a pothole in Ramsbottom, Greater Manchester.  We found the country’s worst road is Mellor Brook Bypass near Balderstone, Lancs. Motorists and cyclists reported it to the council 545 times in one year. Freedom of Information requests show Seven Hills Road in Elmbridge, Surrey, caused the second highest number of complaints, with 216 reported. Hundreds of drivers signed a petition demanding that the county council resurfaced it. One resident said they had seen FIVE different cars changing tyres at the \u0026shyroadside, adding: “I will be avoiding this road until it is repaired.”  Another motorist said: “Incredibly dangerous trying to avoid huge, deep potholes, having to veer into oncoming traffic. Fed up with damage to my car. “Are they waiting for another needless death? Stop treating us with contempt.” Shocked drivers are hitting potholes and ruining tyres and their cars’ \u0026shysuspensions, steering and underbodies, or losing control and having crashes. Edmund King, the president of the AA, said our investigation shows that right across the country, “our potholed roads are a national disgrace”, and are “fast becoming a national emergency”.  He said: “We are rescuing record numbers of drivers whose vehicles are damaged by potholes. Insurance claims for damage caused by potholes is soaring. “The lack of \u0026shyinvestment on local roads means highway authorities are doing little more than papering over cracks, with drivers picking up the pieces.” He said February’s Beast from the East had made it worse – but was simply exposing years of \u0026shyunderinvestment by cash-strapped councils.  In the first four months of 2018, AA Insurance received more pothole claims than in the  whole of 2017.   Our probe comes after the Asphalt Industry Alliance revealed 24,500 miles of local roads will need to be shut for repairs in the next year – and it would take at least 14years to clear the backlog, costing \u0026pound9.3billion. A separate report by Cycling UK found local authorities have forked out \u0026pound43.4million in compensation and legal costs due to potholes over the past five years. Sam Jones, of Cycling UK, said: “Before spending \u0026pound15billion on new motorways and trunk roads, let’s fix the roads we use every day and are essential for us to get to work and drop the kids off at school.” National roads are to get 52 times more government funding by 2020 compared to local roads. Councillor Martin Tett, of the LocalGovernment \u0026shyAssociation, said: “Only long-term, consistent and fairer investment in local roads can let councils embark on the improvements so desperately needed.” "},{"url":null,"title":"campaigning mum reveals how talked","story":"NewsCampaigning mum reveals how she talked cops round after being arrested for medical cannabisCallie Blackwell says she told police she\u0027ll keep breaking the law as lives depend on it\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByKaren Rockett21:30, 23 JUN 2018NewsCallie gave cannabis oil to son Deryn\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA campaigning mum talked her way out of a cell after convincing police cannabis should be legal for medical use. Callie Blackwell, 38, was arrested after being seen holding a cannabis plant at a Westminster protest. She has been lobbying for the Class B drug to be allowed as a medicine since her son made a miracle recovery after she gave him liquid cannabis.  Today she continues to break the law by helping parents of sick children get access to medical cannabis through Bud Buddies UK.   Callie revealed she was arrested in February by three officers on suspicion of cultivating cannabis and held at London’s Charing Cross police station for six hours. She said: “I was like: ‘If you’re going to keep me here, I’ll tell you everything I know about cannabis’. “By the end of it they were like: ‘Just go, this is ridiculous’. They didn\u0027t even caution me. “I said to them: ‘Well what happens when I do this again?’ and they said I’d probably get a caution. “I told them I’m going to keep breaking the law because lives depend on it.”   Callie’s son Deryn was 14 when he was given days to live after four bone marrow transplants failed to halt his leukaemia . Two months after the final op, Callie risked jail by secretly giving Deryn liquid cannabis.  After five days his new bone marrow finally started to make blood cells. His immune system recovered and Deryn is now a healthy 18-year-old trainee chef. His mum was speaking in the wake of the row over Billy Caldwell, 12, of Co Tyrone, Ulster – who has cannabis oil to control seizures.

Former school pal and footie team-mate Luke Robinson has \u0026shyrevealed the England skipper – at the time sporting a David Beckham mohican – told him he was going to win the World Cup one day.  Speaking of Harry’s dream ahead of tomorrow’s Panama clash, Luke said: “He loved England and even then one of his biggest dreams was to play for England and win the World Cup. We’d watch the World Cup together and he was always a very proud England fan. “During the 2002 World Cup, Harry had his England shirt with Beckham on the back and the Beckham mohican. “He was so passionate, he was devastated when we went out.”  Luke, 24, was with Harry when he lifted the Essex \u0026amp Waltham Forest District Cup as a 12-year-old in 2006. Now he, like the rest of the \u0026shynation, hopes Harry will lift the coveted FIFA World Cup Trophy on July 15. And teacher Luke said if Harry does win the \u0026shyultimate prize, it will be his proudest \u0026shymoment. He said: “I remember once when Brazil were playing and they had the likes of Ronaldinho, Ronaldo and Roberto Carlos – some of my \u0026shyfavourite players. “I was saying, ‘I’d love to play for Brazil!’. But Harry was like, ‘No, it’s got to be England! I’d love to play for England. That’s the country! That’s the thing!’. He’s that type of guy, England and proud.”  On Harry’s dedication, he said: “Everything was football. If he wasn’t watching football, he was speaking about football, playing football in the park or playing it on the computer. He did well at school and was good at other sports, like cricket, but it was football all day, every day. “In catering class, we had to bring a recipe and make a meal. He’d get a recipe from his chef at Tottenham and cook that so it was healthy. “He’s massive now but at school he was five foot eight or nine, and podgy. He shot up at 16 or 17. He did running and trained three or four times a week. By 16 or 17 he was fit as a fiddle. He put in years of dedication.”  Harry got England off to a flying start last Monday, scoring both goals in a dramatic 2-1 win against Tunisia – and Luke said the display was classic Kane. He said: “Back in school we knew if we needed a goal Harry could always get it. He’s still that sort of player now and the way he popped up with the winner against Tunisia was like back in his schooldays. I don’t see why he can’t win the golden boot.” Harry, 24, leads the line again today against minnows Panama. England’s second Group G game kicks off in Nizhny Novgorod, western Russia, at 1pm our time.  And someone else tipping him to go all the way is Ian Marshall, the chairman of Harry’s first team, Ridgeway Rovers – where Beckham also started out. And he said: “I bet if Harry won the World Cup he’d come back and see us with it. He’s a class act and we’re so proud. For a club like us to have two England captains in Harry and David, it’s something to shout about.” Meanwhile, England is set for a \u0026pound382million party as it cheers on Harry and his boys today.  Retail experts reckon \u0026pound65million will be spent in pubs, cafes and restaurants and \u0026pound151million will go on food and drink at home. Some \u0026pound20million will go on flags and souvenirs, \u0026pound68million on shirts and \u0026pound67million on TVs, website VoucherCodes and the Centre for Retail Research said.  Tesco expects to sell 140 million bottles and cans of beer. The chain’s booze boss Rob Cooke said: “There’s a real party atmosphere.”  Big brother\u0027s watching you Harry Kane has his biggest fan cheering him on in Russia – his lookalike older brother Charlie.

Our thoughts must be with the families of those 450 patients whose lives were shortened. What have learned this week has been quite simply devastating, shocking and heartbreaking. I pay tribute to my Liberal Democrat parliamentary colleague Norman Lamb for establishing the inquiry as minister and I thank the inquiry panel who has shown extraordinary dedication, under the calm, compassionate, relentless, determined leadership of the former Bishop of Liverpool James Jones in uncovering an injustice and revealing the truth about a shameful episode in our nation’s recent history. The Report is clear, concerns were first raised in 1991 but the hospital chose not to rectify the practise of prescribing the drugs involved. An inquiry was conduced which found an “almost routine use of opiates” since 1998, which “almost certainly shortened the lives of some patients”. But inexcusably this report was left to gather dust on a shelf for ten years. As the Rt Reverend Jones says, handing over a loved one to a hospital, to doctors and nurses, is an act of trust. That trust was betrayed. He goes on: “a large number of patients and their relatives understood that their admission to the hospital was for either rehabilitation or respite, they were, in effect, put on a terminal care pathway.” Others will come to their own judgement but for me that is unforgivable.

Police investigating the clip served three men with notices under the 1989 Football Spectators Act. Michael Herbert, 57, appeared at Leicester Magistrates\u0027 Court on Saturday, where he was handed a five-year football banning order, the National Police Chiefs\u0027 Council (NPCC) said. Two other men, aged 52 and 58, appeared at Leeds Magistrates\u0027 Court, where the case was adjourned until Tuesday. Last week, the Football Association condemned the video, which appeared to show two men giving Nazi salutes in a Russian bar in Volgograd.  The southern Russian city, which was the venue of England\u0027s 2-1 win over Tunisia, was formerly known as Stalingrad - the site of one of the bloodiest battles in history when Soviet soldiers repelled Hitler\u0027s army during the Second World War. Last Wednesday, a spokesman for the FA said: We strongly condemn the actions of the people in this video. We are working with the relevant authorities, including the UK police investigations team, who are making inquiries to identify the individuals involved and take appropriate action. The disgraceful conduct of the individuals in this video does not represent the values of the majority of English football fans supporting the team in Russia.

Chris Cook, 27, wanted to get a trim so he would look smart for work but instead says he was left looking like an absolute idiot. He said the cut along with a beard trim cost \u0026pound10 and called it garbage in video ranting about his new Jim Carey-inspired style. When Chris\u0027 usual salon was busy last Friday lunchtime, he instead decided to visit Smart Cuts in Cleckheaton, West Yorkshire, for a \u0027short back and sides\u0027. The former infantry soldier claimed he left looking like his hair had been cut using a bowl. However salon owner Faz, who declined to give his surname, said they are experienced barbers. Faz said any unstyled hair \u0027is going to look horrible\u0027 and that if Chris was unhappy he should have returned to the salon to get the \u0026pound5 cut rectified.  Chris, from Cleckheaton, said: I woke up cranky on the Saturday morning and when I caught sight of myself in the mirror I couldn\u0027t believe what I was seeing. I had a really long fringe and looked like Lloyd out of Dumb and Dumber. I just thought \u0027what the hell have they done to my hair? I can\u0027t go out looking like this\u0027. It looked like a bowl cut. Once my mum stopped laughing at me I said to her \u0027you might as well have put a bowl round my head and saved me \u0026pound10\u0027. Cleaner Chris filmed a video raging about his barnet and posted it on social media. In the video he can be seen holding his phone to his face and lamenting his locks.  Chris can be heard saying: Right guys, went down [to] Cleckheaton yesterday for my hair cutting. I went down to Smart Cuts, [it] cost me a tenner, look at the state of this. Give me a little shave on the beard as well that\u0027s why it was a tenner. Short back and sides and a trim on the top, that\u0027s all I asked for. Now you can see it there, look at the state of that. So if you want to look like Lloyd off Dumb and Dumber and pay a tenner for it, get yourself down to Smart Cuts, absolutely garbage.  Two days later his trained hairdresser aunty Janene Crossley, 47, spent 20 minutes blending the style and Chris said he is now starting to see the funny side of it. Chris said: When I first shared the video there was no funny intention, it was just to show people. Next thing I know people are commenting and liking it and phone wouldn\u0027t stop pinging for two days, everybody was laughing at it. Chris said the hair cut fiasco started when he tried a different barbers for the first time. The dad of two said: I normally go to a different hairdressers but the one I usually go to was busy and there weren\u0027t a lot of people there. I tried this barbershop instead and went in for a short, back and sides. I don\u0027t tend to style my hair, I only do that when I go out. I just keep it kept cut short and neat so that it looks good at work and brush it to the side. I was in there for about 15 minutes and as he was cutting and shaving round the side of my head he kept brushing it into the style I have, it looked nice and neat. When I got home later that day I had a shower and the following day got up early and that\u0027s when I saw what it looked like. I just couldn\u0027t believe my hair, they\u0027d messed it up. My mum\u0027s not a professional but she could have done a better job with a bowl. I looked an absolute idiot.

Mark Tewdwr-Jones has sparked a furious debate about where the north-south divide really lies in the UK. The academic has drawn a new map which lumps the northern cities in with London and the Home Counties. Prof Tewdwr-Jones, a professor of town planning, says Manchester, Leeds and Sheffield can’t be classed as northern because they are influenced so much by the capital, the Manchester Evening News reports.   “There are several ways you could define a northern region - but perhaps the most pertinent question is where does London end?” he asks. “My map is a northern area defined as ‘not London,’ where London’s sphere of influence extends over most of the country - determined by two-hour commuting patterns which is becoming the norm.” Professor Tewdwr-Jones, who is chair of town planning at Newcastle University and has advised ministers on planning, land use and housing issues, argues that policymakers should adopt a more ‘nuanced’ view of what constitutes the North.

Monalisa Perez, then 19 and pregnant with her second child, was advised by Pedro Ruiz, 22, he would be shielded by a thick book as she took aim from close range. But the stunt went horribly wrong and the bullet went straight through the 1.5-inch book and into Ruiz\u0027s chest, fatally wounding him. Dramatic footage newly released shows him encouraging his terrified girlfriend to pull the trigger, with a bullet inside he says can travel the length of three football pitches. In a transcript of the moments leading up to the shooting, Perez says: “Babe, I’m not doing this, I can’t.” “I don’t want to be responsible,” she adds.   But according to local reports , Pedro tells her: “You won’t as long as you hit the book, as long as you hit the book you’ll be fine. Come on. The batteries gonna die on it. Come closer.”  Before she pulled the trigger, transcripts showed she said: I can\u0027t do it babe. I\u0027m so scared.  Babe, if I kill you what\u0027s gonna happen to my life. Like, no this isn\u0027t okay, she continued, the Daily Mail reports.  Eventually Perez pulled the trigger that ended Ruiz\u0027s life. Ruiz had introduced the video by saying his YouTube channel would have crazy stuff in it. Here I have my girlfriend Monalisa to help me out with my first video, a video shows him saying. So babe, let\u0027s go ahead and show them what we have in store, he said as she showed off a 50 caliber desert eagle gun placed on a red cushion.  He explains in the clip that he\u0027s going to ask Perez to \u0027clip the button\u0027 and she looks at him nervously asking is it hard to which he replies no, it\u0027s a button. It\u0027s basically a canon in your hand going off, he describes. Ruiz shows off how big both the gun and the bullet are in the footage. He says if he snaps his fingers the bullet could travel more than three football fields in length.  The point of this video is I really want to see if a 50 caliber bullet can go through a book, he says. I\u0027m going to stand behind it, and Monalisa is going to shoot it, hoping she hits the book. Hoping she hits the book and not me, but the most trustworthy person that I trust in this world is my girlfriend, Monalisa, so if I\u0027m going to die, I\u0027m pretty much ready to go to heaven right now. If I die I\u0027ll be ready for Jesus. He probably won\u0027t accept me into the gates because of how stupid this is but I have confidence my girlfriend will hit the book and not me.

It was, of course, ever thus when predicting what may be in store for a football club.On the pitch, however good the squad may look, successful results can never be taken for granted.The season just ended is an example of that. While it would not be realistic to expect Dundee to finish in the top four, there was reason to believe the players should have been good enough to have mounted a serious challenge to make the Premiership’s top six.That they didn’t was disappointing but, despite some complaint about that, the reality of a club the size of Dundee is that any campaign that ends with them still in the top division has to be acceptable.The hope has to be that, with the right additions, next term will see that top-six challenge materialise.If it does, it can become a regular occurrence.As for the new stadium, it goes back to that phrase – seeing will be believing.The plans are impressive and the feeling the best bet for the future is to move away from Dens, home for the last 119 years but now ageing and in many ways impractical, is a sensible one.But the aim was the first spade would be in the ground at what’s been dubbed “Nou Campy” just north of the Kingsway and adjacent to Camperdown Park at some point this summer.Yes, there’s another couple of months to go before that becomes a false promise but, with no final planning permission in place as yet, time is running out.Of course, even if that’s what comes to pass, it doesn’t mean the stadium won’t be built.As we’ve seen up the coast at Aberdeen, such projects can be delayed, delayed and delayed again.If Nou Campy never gets off the ground, it doesn’t have to follow the club will be plunged into the latest of what down the years have been many crises.For many fans, wherever the team is playing, so long as it continues to be backed by the Keyes cash and is riding high in the Premiership, that bright future will have arrived.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b2a29b42d531-435x564.jpg ","title":"125 years of dundee fc four of the very best to have pulled on dark blue","story":"\t\t\t\t\tFor what is a mid-sized club by Scottish standards, over their history it’s fair to say Dundee have punched well above their weight when it comes to producing and attracting top talent.In today\u0026#8217s look down memory lane, as we celebrate their 125th birthday, we highlight the very best of what has been a quality crop.Billy Steel: However long there is a Dundee FC, no list of the club’s greatest performers will ever be complete without the name Billy Steel.When director/manager George Anderson snapped the Scottish international inside-forward up from Derby County for a record £22,500 in September 1950, it went down as one of the transfer coups of the decade.Regarded as world class but known for being difficult to manage, Steel repaid the faith Anderson had shown in him and, in the next four years, would inspire Dundee to two League Cups.Steel left Dens in 1954 when he quit the senior game aged just 31. He moved to America where he died in 1982 but, 36 years later, remains regarded as one of Scotland’s greatest players.Claudio Caniggia: It was a case of 1950 and Billy Steel all over again when, in October 2000, Dundee sent tremors through the football world by announcing the signing of Argentine World Cup star Claudio Caniggia.In desperate need of a replacement for injured striker Fabian Caballero, the Dee’s Italian manager Ivano Bonetti used his Serie A connections and fixed up Caniggia, a former Roma team-mate of his brother and assistant Dario.In the end, the man who was Diego Maradona’s favourite strike partner for Argentina did not stay long at Dens Park, making just 21 league appearances and scoring seven goals, before heading for Rangers at the end of the 2000/01 campaign.Both for his performances and the gentlemanly way he conducted himself off the park, the impact he had on Dundee was considerably greater than the time he spent at Dens Park.Alan Gilzean: If there’s a debate over who the best-ever Dundee player is, when to comes to putting the ball in the net there can be no argument.Although down the years the club can boast some prolific scorers, there never has been, and is never likely to be, anyone who could match the ability of the legendary Alan Gilzean.Over 40 years after his playing career with the Dark Blues and then Spurs came to an end, those who saw him or played with or against him still regard him as being a world class centre-forward.Born in Coupar Angus, Dundee were his first senior club. He score an unequalled total of 169 goals for them and won the league in 1961/62 before being transferred to Spurs, where he enjoys similar legendary status, in 1964.Doug Cowie: The sands of time mean in some ways he is the forgotten man of Dundee greats but never to those who saw or played alongside Doug Cowie.Signed by George Anderson in 1945, over the next 16 years the Aberdonian would make a record 446 appearances, win two League Cups and also appear in two World Cups for Scotland.Cowie left Dens at the end of the season before the club won the championship but many of those who played in the side that clinched the title have often referred to the influence he had over their development on the pitch.As well as nurture it, Cowie would go on to show himself as an adept talent spotter. Once his playing days were over he worked for Dundee United and, along with fellow-scout Davie Small, was credited by Jim McLean as being instrumental in unearthing many of the local players who went on to bring the league flag to Tannadice in 1983.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2015/06/image.jpg1_.741936.jpg ","title":"125 years of dundee fc humble claudio caniggia was even better off pitch barry smith","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA Dundee legend in his own right, Barry Smith captained the club for nine years before returning as manager in 2010.During that time he saw some of the best and some of the worst times in the history of the club.Among the best, however, was playing alongside some top-quality team-mates.And one name that stands out is Claudio Caniggia.Barry said: “I grew up watching guys like him play in World Cups, so I feel really fortunate to have played with Caniggia.“What made him stand out is, no matter how much he had done in the game before, he was so humble and had great humility.“What stood out for me is how he took time to help out the younger lads in training. Guys like Steven Milne and Graham Bayne owe a lot to him.“That was just the type of guy he is, very humble, no airs and graces and he took a lot of time with younger players that a lot of other players wouldn’t.“The first time he came in, he immediately made sure he was part of the team.“He didn’t just stand around, he got involved straight away.“Claudio didn’t want to be a superstar or anything, just wanted to be part of a team. His attitude was superb.“A lot of players could take a lesson from him. Every day he knew he still had to work hard.“I remember him as much off the park as on it because he was so good on the training ground.”Barry had another name he’d stick into the mix from his time at Dundee.“Georgi Nemsadze was the most technically gifted player I played with,” he added.“I knew when I won the ball, I could give it to him no problem.“I was very lucky to play alongside him.“I have to say, those guys did what they did because there were other guys in the team doing their jobs.“Guys like Lee Wilkie, Gavin Rae and me were the workhorses for the team and we allowed the players with all the flair to go and do their stuff.”As manager, Barry had to deal with some of the darkest times at Dens as the club headed into a second administration – the people at the club, however, managed to turn that time into one of the best at Dundee with the ‘Deefiant’ season.He added: “I do believe if the team hadn’t stayed up someone would have shut the doors at Dens.“Collectively everyone responded, the coaching staff, office staff, players and definitely the fans rallied around the club.“Though it was a really negative time, we turned it into a positive one which then led to promotion the following year.“I don’t like to single anybody out but Robert Douglas played a massive part.“It’s difficult to say just how much he helped gelling the players together.“All the players and their wives and families were invited round to his all the time and that really generated the team spirit.“He really made sure the team was a real team and that’s not even talking about what he did on the park.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b2b7163e9578-397x564.jpg ","title":"125 years of dundee fc jocky scott recalls winning league cup against celtic","story":"\t\t\t\t\tIn their 125 years, Dundee have five major trophies in their cabinet and, with almost 45 years since they last lifted silverware, it shows just how difficult it is to be top dog.Just like today, back in 1973, when the Dark Blues lifted their last trophy, managing to battle past the Old Firm was one of the biggest hurdles.Dundee legend Jocky Scott was part of the 1973 League Cup-winning side and says meeting Celtic in the final, rather than the semi, gave the side a completely different mindset going into the game at Hampden.Between 1969 and 1977, Dundee lost five Scottish Cup semi-finals to the Hoops. However, the one time they met them in a final they ran out 1-0 winners in December 1973.Jocky said: “The team that won the League Cup was a very good side.“Unfortunately, we couldn’t do more in the Scottish Cup because we kept meeting Celtic in the semi-final – we just couldn’t beat them.“When Rangers and Celtic are dominant, it’s very difficult. You’ve got to catch them on a bad day or get them in a final where you are on a hiding to nothing and just go out and play.“A semi-final is the worst game of all.“You’re within touching distance of the final but you’re not there yet.“Some players don’t handle that too well but then can handle a final.“Around 1973, we’d played Celtic in a few semi-finals and they were all very close games.“We were never really hammered in any of them but they just had that wee bit more experience of playing in semi-finals and winning them.“We had experience of losing semi-finals.“Psychologically that’s a big thing, whereas when you get to a final it’s different.“We were, obviously, the underdogs – with that there’s nothing to lose, just go out and play, do your best and hope it’s good enough.“You need wee breaks, too, and we got them.”In the midst of the miner’s strike, the 1973 final was an eerie affair with just 27,974 spectators braving the snowy conditions.Striker Gordon Wallace got the all-important goal late on to secure the trophy for the Dark Blues.Scott added: “Rab Wilson played it up to Gordon Wallace.“He had Pat McCluskey at his back but he took it down on his chest and in one movement hit it low into the corner.“The goalie was taken by surprise with the quickness Gordon hit it.“It was a typical striker’s goal, instinctive, didn’t think – bang.“We scored and went ahead – I don’t think we did that in any of the semi-finals we played, we were always having to fight back. We scored first and had something to build on.“It wasn’t like we scored and sat back and defended for 60 minutes or we were fortunate or anything.“We’d had a go at them, played well in defence and attack. It wasn’t a smash-and-grab win, we deserved it.“We were good enough to go on and win more trophies but, unfortunately, we didn’t. It was a good side with good players, individually and collectively.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b2b715bb7ee0-788x564.jpg ","title":"125 years of dundee fc the big days in dark blues history books","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAs is the case with most provincial clubs, for Dundee, trophies are a welcome bonus, not a given.In their 125-year history, the Dark Blues have lifted major domestic silverware on five occasions, though not since their League Cup win of 1973.Their first success came 17 years after the club was formed, in the shape of the 1910 Scottish Cup – the only time they’ve lifted the country’s most prestigious knockout trophy.In typical fashion, the one time Dundee did win it, it was the hard way.The first round saw them held by Beith, technically away from home but actually at Dens Park after the opposition surrendered home advantage, before winning the replay 1-0.A crowd of 20,000 then saw them take care of Falkirk at the first time of asking and it was the same with Motherwell in the third round.In the semi-finals they needed three games before beating Hibs by the only goal of the entire tie at Parkhead.That set up what was to be an epic final against Clyde, the side who would finish just above them in the First Division that season.Game one of an Ibrox triple header ended in a 2-2 draw on April 9 and, when the teams met again seven days later, there was no scoring.Dundee were finally able to kiss silver for the first time on April 20, 1910, when goals from Jimmy Bellamy and John ‘Sailor’ Hunter saw them edge out the Bully Wee by 2-1.That sparked off wild celebrations and although that second replay was a midweek game, the team were mobbed when they arrived back home by train late in the evening.Despite a few near things, it was to be 41 years before the fans were able to welcome another trophy to the city.That was when the side put together by director/manager George Anderson, and that was inspired by Scotland inside- forward Billy Steel, went all the way in the League Cup.Having edged out Hearts in the group stage, they beat Falkirk 2-1 over the two legs of the quarter-finals. A one-sided 5-1 success over Motherwell at Ibrox in the last four set up a clash with Rangers at Hampden. The Gers were favourites but this was a Dundee side that feared no one. They showed that with a 3-2 victory.After failing to live up to being favourites when they faced Motherwell in the Scottish Cup Final later that season, the next campaign saw them again win the League Cup.This time they cruised a group made up of Clyde, Raith and Airdrie and, although they lost the first leg in the quarters against Stirling Albion 3-1, back at Dens a 5-0 success saw them through.Hibs were then taken care of in the semis and the final against Kilmarnock was a fairly routine affair, a Bobby Flavell double being enough retain the trophy.Nine years later came Dundee’s most glorious day when, under the guidance of Bob Shankly, a fantastic season was crowned by clinching the club’s only league title.It came at Muirton Park, where a 3-0 win over St Johnstone – who were relegated – saw them beat off the challenge of Rangers in what, until that final day, had been a nip-and-tuck race.The league was won with the use of just 15 players, though with the likes of Alan Gilzean, Alex Hamilton, Ian Ure, Andy Penman and skipper Bobby Cox in the line-up, it was a special team.It was back to the League Cup for the last major success and, if the 1973 triumph is not the most talked about of the five, it was a laudable achievement. It came during the time of the three-day week and power cuts, meaning the final had an early kick-off to save power, so attracted a crowd of just 27,974.The game was decided by a solitary late goal from the prolific Gordon Wallace and if many reports make it sound forgettable, it should be remembered victory was over a Hoops side that would go on to reach the European Cup semi-finals.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/976302492.jpg-279x180.jpg ","title":"argentina cant expect messi to carry them says dundee hero caniggia","story":"\t\t\t\t\tFormer Dundee star Claudio Caniggia has urged the current Argentina side not to be a one-man team in Russia this summer.The Argentines got their World Cup campaign under way on Saturday against Iceland but could only manage a draw.Today they face Croatia and will hope to kick-start their campaign.Caniggia went to three World Cups – almost returning for a fourth at the age of 42 in 2010 – and arrived to much fanfare at Dundee in 2000.He says his country’s best chance of winning it all for the first time since 1986 is if Lionel Messi’s supporting cast step up to the plate.The 51-year-old rose to international prominence during the 1990 World Cup in Italy alongside Argentina great Diego Maradona and insists the difference between that side and today’s is the expectation on the other players.Caniggia said: “Messi doesn’t get the same support from his team-mates Maradona did.“I knew Maradona was the complete footballing genius but I didn’t think about keeping up with him. Never.“Every player has a responsibility, even those who don’t play much.“You can’t give all the responsibility to Messi, because then what’s the point of you being there?“Imagine if I’d thought in 1990 the world champions had to carry me through. No! Carry us? We’re in it together.“I’m Argentina’s striker and I have to drag them through it, too.“That was my responsibility. You’ve got to have character, determination, ambition and impulse.”Argentina are fifth in the betting to lift the trophy and Caniggia believes they can do it, particularly with the talent they have up top.With Messi, Gonzalo Higuain – who has come under fire for his performances for his country – Sergio Aguero, Paulo Dybala and Angel Di Maria to choose from, goals shouldn’t be a problem. Defensively, however, they could come unstuck.“What’s in our favour is the best attacking players can put fear into anyone,” added Caniggia.“Their names alone unsettle the opposition. The other teams don’t think ‘Higuain is being criticised in Argentina’. They think: ‘he’s Juventus’ top goalscorer’.”“Our weak point is we’re still not solid at the back, and there are still a couple of places up for grabs.”Caniggia was in his early thirties by the time he arrived at Dens Park in 2000 and remarkably had the chance to play at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.“We’ll never know now but to play 30 minutes would have been perfect. I was in good shape and I hadn’t lost my pace. But I couldn’t decide, and later I regretted it. It would’ve been unbelievable to play.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"convincing players to come to dundee united has not been easy admits csaba","story":"\t\t\t\t\tCsaba Laszlo admits getting the players he wants to rebuild Dundee United this summer has not been easy.But he’s revealed the more quality signings that have been made, the less difficult the process has become.With other clubs, often from top divisions, also keen on players like Callum Booth, Craig Curran and Frederic Frans, the Tangerines had to pull out the stops to persuade them to sign up at Tannadice.That saw Csaba making a point of speaking to every potential target individually, rather than doing business through their agents.“If we are in the Premiership it is easier to attract staff and players, but we are not,” he said.“I have talked to every single player we have signed to convince them to come to Dundee United.“It was not an agent calling them to tell them Dundee United were interested, it was the manager calling to say you are important.“I think this was a reason why we’ve got players. It’s a lot of work and it’s not finished.“Frans and Booth both had offers from Premiership clubs here, Frans also from the top division in Belgium.“They have come here and, when other players see that, it made it better for us to get others to come as well.”Csaba has also revealed not one of the new faces had a problem with the new 25-miles rule he’s introduced.From now on, every player will have to stay no further away from Tannadice than that and, contrary to what some predicted, it’s not been a problem.“Before it could be Willo Flood, myself and some directors travelling on the team

Every second day he sends me a message saying I want to be training,” added Csaba.Still on the injury list are goalkeeper Deniz Mehmet and defender Lewis Toshney.Deniz will be out for several more months after his recent knee operation that followed the freak injury he suffered in the play-off win over Dunfermline last month, while Toshney’s condition will be assessed in the next week or so.He has yet to play under Csaba because of a knee problem that’s ruled him out since last October.“The one we don’t know how far on he is and is still in the recovery process is Toshney.“He’s made good steps forward but we have to see how the knee will react.”With eight new players and four fresh appointments to the coaching staff, there will be plenty new faces when the squad reports to their St Andrews training base tomorrow morning.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b2cf82a90d53-374x564.jpg ","title":"end of an era as iconic dundee chip shop to close after 64 years","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAn iconic chip shop is set for the “last supper” as it closes for the final time after 64 years.Dora’s Fish and Chip shop on Dura Street, which has served thousands of customers since opening its doors in 1954, will close for the last time on Saturday June 30.Owner Giulio Dora, 65, said his parents Peter and Matilde bought the shop after a “gentleman’s agreement” with Mr Forte, then proprietor of Forte’s Cafe.But now Giulio, who grew up in Stobswell, is retiring after first entering the chipper at the age of one.He served his first customer when he was nine and learned the trade from his parents, who also had premises in St Mary’s, Broughty Ferry and Barnhill.In his time he has served the great and good both living in the city and passing through – from jute mill workers to Dundee FC legend Bobby Cox, wrestler George Kidd and pop idol Donny Osmond.After a brief spell as a mechanic, Giulio returned to the family business in 1979, before buying the premises in 1981.He said: “This hasn’t been a sudden decision.“We will be sad to leave the customers after all their years of business, as well as the delivery drivers who have come in and out with our supplies over the years.“The Dora family has been associated with fish and chips for about 130 years since the family moved here from a village in Italy called Rovinaglia.“We have so many great memories of our time here.“The former Dundee United manager Jim McLean used to come in and check the players weren’t eating fish and chips after training.”Giulio added: “I’ve been amazed at the reaction from customers to us closing.“We had some Brownies come in recently and they told me I couldn’t retire – I was welling up. I’ve worked 14 to 15-hour days as far back as I can remember and must have cut up thousands of tonnes of spuds in that time.

applications.RNIB Scotland campaigns manager Dr Catriona Burness said: \"For too many people our streets remain a daily obstacle course.\"We believe a Street Charter would help to enhance the quality of life for residents and, vitally, boost the reputation of Inverness as an open and welcoming tourist destination.\"As \u0026lsquoThe Gateway to the Highlands\u0026rsquo Inverness plays a pivotal role in promoting the region as an attractive place to live, work and visit.\"But a vital element for any successful 21st century Scottish city must be inclusivity \u0026ndash a city that is open and welcoming to everyone \u0026ndash and the key to inclusivity is physical accessibility.\"She added: \"A Street Charter would help to avoid entrenching flawed designs that could blemish Inverness for a generation or more.\"Brian MacKenzie of the Highland Cycle Campaign said\u0026nbsp the drive to get things right first time made good financial sense for cash-strapped local authorities.\"For example, a 2015 House of Lords report on \u0026lsquoshared spaces\u0026rsquo (where roads and pavements are levelled allowing vehicles and pedestrians to use the same area) warns that \u0026lsquocouncils are risking public safety with fashionable simplified street design\u0026rsquo and notes that \u0026lsquomore and more local authorities are forced into expensive remedial work, often restoring crossings they have themselves removed\u0026rsquo,\" he said.The manifesto states: \"A Street Charter would offer planners and consultants a template for inclusive design, potentially saving the council money by cutting down on objections to plans or completed developments.\"And it adds: \"A Street Charter would also make for a more pleasant environment for people who don\u0026rsquot have disabilities as clutter-free streets and logical street layouts would make getting around easier and more appealing.\"Highland Council introduced a new policy in April, requiring trade waste bins to be kept off city

Leadership and direction of the school needs to be well supported through a strong emphasis on professional development.”Referring to the nursery, Ms Gow said: “Staff were unaware of the health conditions and wellbeing needs of some children.”This, said Ms Gow, meant children would be at risk as staff would not know how to react in an emergency.Inspectors had previously expressed concerns the playground was in a poor state and the boundary gate was insecure and, though the gate had been temporarily mended, it still was not adequate to keep children safe.“The provider had advised the area was to be made safe during the summer break,” said Ms Gow.“The design of the toilet cubicles and mirrors and their proximity to the play room and the cloakroom meant children’s dignity and privacy was not respected,” said the report.It added: “A glass panel on the door meant children’s dignity and privacy was compromised during nappy changing. The provider has advised a partition wall would be erected during the summer break.”The council’s head of education Andrew Griffiths: “We have been working with Fraserburgh North over a period of months to provide guidance and support with the aim of improving standards, and this report highlights there is still much work to do. We know parents, carers and staff may be concerned by the issues raised and we will be keeping them informed of the action being taken.”It is understood the head teacher at the time of the inspection is no longer in the post and an acting head is in place.An Aberdeenshire Council spokesman said: “During their visit, the inspection team identified a ‘caring environment and positive relationships between staff and children’ and ‘happy children who are eager to learn’, along with good teamworking and good quality teaching.“But the team also identified major weaknesses in the leadership and have called for improvements to self-evaluation and to the school’s approaches to equality and diversity.“A timeline for improvements has been identified, and we have developed an action plan to ensure these are all met by the end of August.”He added: “Work has been undertaken to ensure staff are fully informed about children’s medical history, that appropriate plans are in place in case of emergency and that staff are fully aware of how to implement these plans. A new management approach has also been established.“By August, the council will ensure the security of boundaries, improve the design and layout of the toilet cubicles, and make sure all staff have necessary training.

As with other gull species which are opportunist in diet, junk food and bits of plastic provided by us humans can be inadvertently consumed.Over many years the Gleaner oil depot, which has a concrete bund in case of oil spillage, has provided a safe nesting site for around 20 pairs. The suggestion that this colony could easily find an alternative site is perhaps wishful thinking as suitable sites nearby in Mid Argyll are already occupied by other gull species or don’t have the required habitat features.Thankfully, however, this should not prove necessary. Following a productive on-site meeting last week with the Scottish Canals\u0026#8217 environmental scientist, the project architect and TSL contractors we noted 10-15 birds sitting on eggs and unaffected by the work going on around them.Planned works over the coming weeks should not affect these gulls, Oystercatchers or Black Guillemots from nesting and will also not impede the building work which is scheduled to be completed by next spring.The Mid Argyll hub project and new canal museum will largely reflect the social and cultural heritage of the Crinan Canal, but should also encompass the important and often decreasing natural history of the Crinan Canal corridor. These breeding birds are also a part of this and should not just be something to ‘chase off’ to somewhere else.Excellent viewing and educational opportunities from the new build will be possible to watch this colony raise their chicks as well as providing a point to lookout for other wildlife on the loch.Nearby, the tidal estuary of Loch Gilp provides us with an often highly under-valued unofficial nature reserve that links Ardrishaig with Lochgilphead, which in winter hosts important numbers of duck and waders, in summer includes breeding Eider ducks and Common Terns and during migration is a vital stopping off point during adverse weather for passage Whooper swans, Brent geese and Black-tailed Godwits to name a few.Increasingly good work is being undertaken by locals and the Phoenix Trust to help clear up some of the increasing amounts of shoreline rubbish.Keep up the good work!Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,I have been out and about Islay the past week speaking to my constituents, visiting local businesses and monitoring the roads department\u0026#8217s progress with road repairs.Unfortunately CalMac management\u0026#8217s shocking handling of our local ferry service is really taking it\u0026#8217s toll on many local businesses that depend heavily of Islay\u0026#8217s growing tourist trade.

This scattershot approach to pothole repairs is as random as it is ineffective.In the future we will need to see a more long term resurfacing solution to our local roads with less short term, random and piecemeal patchwork.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,In the run up to National Volunteering Week (June 1- 7), Cats Protection would like to extend our thanks to the many thousands of volunteers throughout the country who offer their time and expertise to help cats and kittens across the UK.In 2017, our 10,200-strong volunteer network contributed an incredible 5.5 million hours, each volunteer gifting a wealth of expertise and immeasurable passion to the charity. Their dedication enabled Cats Protection to help around 200,000 cats and kittens nationwide.Cats Protection is always on the lookout for new volunteers to join the UK’s biggest cat community. Though a large part of our work is helping cats, through fostering and rehoming, our volunteers have the opportunity to become involved with a range of interesting activities such as organising fundraising events, helping with publicity or managing funds and resources to benefit the greatest amount of cats.Volunteering can offer the chance to develop skills such as time management, interpersonal skills and teamwork, making CVs much more attractive and, of course, helping cats.Anyone who is interested in becoming a volunteer can go to our website www.cats.org.uk/get- involved/volunteering  to find out more.Julie Meredith, head of volunteering development, Cats Protection,Sir,I really love being active, especially the feeling after and that’s why I’m supporting Bowel Cancer UK and Beating Bowel Cancer’s latest fundraising campaign to get sponsored to do 30 minutes of physical activity for 30 days in June.Step up for 30 is a fantastic way for you to be more physically active to reduce your risk of bowel cancer – the UK’s second biggest cancer killer. This can be anything from yoga, walking in the sunshine (I walk everywhere) or taking your favourite class at the gym.While you’re getting fitter and feeling healthier, you’ll be raising money to fund the highest quality research and essential information and support services that will save lives from bowel cancer.Take on the challenge and sign up at bowelcanceruk.org.uk/stepupfor30.Gaby Roslin, TV and radio presenterPICS:The common gull has been seen nesting at the disused oil depot. no_a21Gleanergull01Gulls at the former Gleaner site. no_a21Gleanergull02\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week june 1 2018","story":"\t\tHannah O\u0027HanlonUpdated: 30/05/18, 11:35 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThere are certain moments that just simply enchant us.One such moment happened this week when we were holidaying in Dunkeld.Almost every day we visited the wildlife centre at the Loch of the Lowes and delighted in our times watching the osprey.From the webcam we could see every detail.We watched with great anticipation to see when the chicks would emerge from their eggs, of which there were three.One of the days we went to the centre there was great excitement as one of the eggs was about to hatch.The staff there are dedicated volunteers who love sharing their knowledge of these wonderful birds.To our total delight we witnessed the birth first-hand as the shell cracked open and out struggled a tiny little chick as the mother bird looked on anxiously.I could hardly believe that this tiny scrap of life would be strong enough to fly to Africa in just a few months.Shortly, the father bird arrived with a very large fish and I was amazed at the tenderness of this great strong bird as he gently fed his baby.Since then we have been \u0026#8216hooked\u0026#8217 as we follow this wee family at the beginning of their journey of life.Soon the chicks will be given flying and fishing lessons and will leave the safety of the nest.My prayer is that they will all safely complete their long journey to Africa and that they will come back next year to enchant people once again.When they go, sometime in September, I fear that I will suffer from \u0026#8217empty nest syndrome\u0026#8217 till they come back again next spring.Scripture tells us: \u0026#8216Seek information from the birds of the air.\u0026#8217\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 22","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 31/05/18, 11:50 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.CalMac management’s shocking handling of our ferry service is taking its toll on local businesses which depend on Islay’s growing tourist trade.We simply cannot allow CalMac to continue to make the same errors every year without consequences.Also, I have been unimpressed with our roads department management’s sluggish response to a large number of complaints from residents and myself about the potholes across Islay.Councillor Alastair Redman, IslaySir,I\u0026#8217m inviting your readers to get their walking boots or trainers on for the Stroke Association and sign up to the summer marathon challenge, Walk Your Way.In April 2013, a year after my own stroke, I took on​ the London Marathon. It was a huge step in my recovery and helped to draw attention to this devastating condition while raising money for a wonderful charity that I\u0026#8217m proud to be an ambassador for.Walk Your Way takes place between 17 June and 1 July to raise money to support stroke survivors and their families.  You can walk the whole 26.2 miles in one go, do it over a few days or spread the distance over the two-week period and get sponsored to do it. It’s your chance to take on the distance of a marathon on your own terms.For many stroke survivors like me, getting your life back means overcoming life-changing disabilities and emotional difficulties. By taking part in Walk Your Way you’ll be helping to reduce your own risk of stroke, and the vital funds you’ll raise will help the charity to support more stroke survivors to regain their independence.Sign up to Walk Your Way now: stroke.org.uk/WalkYourWayMichael Lynagh, former Australian rugby union internationalSir,What is it with people who drive cars while doing other things?As a driver I often see people behind the wheel talking on mobile phones, sending texts, touching up make-up in the mirror and, on a few occasions recently, the same man has been shaving while bowling merrily along the A83 trunk road \u0026#8211 while in a van belonging to an Argyll and Bute public agency.It just takes a split second for an accident to happen through losing concentration behind the wheel.Put down your smartphone, make-up bag and electric razor before either the police catch you or an accident happens.Name and address supplied\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 26","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 02/06/18, 3:08 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.What a spell of weather we have had over the past week and more.Knowing the Argyll climate, by the time you read this you might be sitting in a blizzard in front of the fire enjoying your paper but it was good while it lasted.Welcome as it is, warm weather brings its own problems.

After a pit stop in the Royal Burgh it was on to Fort William, then Inverness and back home again- all to raise money for Cancer Research UK and Target Ovarian Cancer.Spokesperson for Breast Way Round, Laura White, said: ‘This year was full of fun, laughter, meeting new family members and although the daily miles are hard going, the weather and the beauty of the Scottish scenery made it that little bit easier.’As well as the sponsored trek, the bikers raised money in more traditional ways, such as bucket shaking (the men wearing bras) and hosting a raffle and auction in Caol Community Centre. The most coveted item, a patchwork quilt made by rider Cathy Anderson, went for a whopping £700.The annual trip was started in 2008 by Shirley-Ann McKnight as a last tour of Scotland for fellow biker and close friend, Alyson Porter, who was suffering from cancer. Sadly, Alyson never made it to her trip and now each year the journey is retraced in celebration of her life and all those affected by cancer.Since 2008, more than 600 riders have participated, each clad with a pink mohawk courtesy of Hairy-RS, and the team has raised £347,000 for Macmillan Cancer Support.

The pair were seeded car 30 in the two wheel drive section, run first on the day in a new schedule being piloted by the rally, the two wheel drive cars covering the stages before the four wheel drive cars followed in the afternoon.With the dry conditions in the weeks running up to the event dust would be the main problem for those running further down the field. Douglas attacked the first stage, Twiglees, and was catching the car in front when, unfortunately due to the dust being created by that car, came out of a 90 degree corner with zero visibility and connected heavily with a rock, damaging the suspension and forcing his early retirement.The car, and the driver, are noticeably quicker  each event they compete in and it\u0026#8217s only a matter of time before the results are there.The other Argyll car out on the stages was Ally Currie from Mull and Grant McNiven in the Ford Fiesta ST picking up 9th overall and 1st in Class 6.The next round of the Scottish Championship is Argyll Rally, based in Dunoon on June 23 \u0026#8211 the closest round for most Argyll rally enthusiasts and one not to be missed. The stages look absolutely breathtaking this year and well worth a watch.The Scottish Tarmac Rally Championship continues as well with round three being the Granite at Leuchars Stages hosted by Aberdeen and District Motor Club at the MOD base in Leuchars, Fife.Argyll was well represented both in the drivers seat and the co-drivers. All Argyll crew Willie and Steven Beattie were out in the newly finished and beautifully finished Escort MkII. They were absolutely flying and really getting to grips with the car when a sixth gear lock-up threw them into a spin and off the stage, clouting a fairly substantial fence post in the process.The navigators side now looks decidedly second hand, but nothing a few hours in the workshop won\u0026#8217t sort. A bent bottom suspension arm put paid to them re-joining but they will take the positives and the blistering pace into the next round for sure.Willie Beattie Snr in his equally exquisite Escort was also beginning to get the hang of the car, with some more seat time this year, not to mention experienced co-driver, Phil Sandham, pushing him on. He, after making sure his boys were okay when they didn\u0026#8217t show up at service after their spin, continued on to secure 12th overall and second in class: his first honours since building the car.The next round may see some family ties severely stretched, at least until the final results are announced.Ian Parker was also out in familiar machinery, co-driving for Fraser Smith in his Canal Garage-prepared Honda Civic. The pair were also making good progress up the class rankings until the diff decided to implode and finished their rally on Stage six.The drive of the day was not in question. Alan Kirkaldy led from start to finish despite some interesting issues in the first test. His door came loose after about a third of stage and he continued, holding the door shut by the open window whilst steering, changing gear and waving with the other.Astonishingly he still managed quickest stage time by five seconds. His co-driver for the day could forgive himself for being a little green about the gills after that.Eoghan Anderson from Cairnbaan was lucky enough to win the seat in a charity auction at the Annual STRC Dinner earlier in the year. An experience he is unlikely to forget in a hurry, although some of the memories may be a little bit blurry and perhaps just a little sideways. The top three were rounded out by Ian Forgan, ably guided round in his Subaru by his daughter in her first rally and the final position on the podium went to Ian and Allan Paterson, also in a Subaru.The next round is this weekend at Crail where the Beattie boys will be back out, Ian Parker swaps a Civic for an Escort MKII and Donald Bowness is set to get back out in the Nova.PICS:Photos: Gavin Brown, West Coast PhotosRed Escort (Car 1) Alan Kirkaldy/Eoghan Anderson (first overall) no_a24rally01\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"high tech preparation for mid argyll art show","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 14/06/18, 7:45 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThis year has seen a lot of preparatory work ahead of the 2018 Mid Argyll Art Society exhibition in August.The popular show will again be held in the Drill Hall, Lochgilphead and will run from August 6-11.As in the last few years, the Mid Argyll Camera Club will have photos on display.The society is harnessing modern technology in a campaign to raise the profile of this year\u0026#8217s event.There is now a Mid Argyll Art Society Facebook page that can be used to get updates on what is happening.There will shortly be a website giving details about the art society, its history, information on the exhibition and how to participate, and photos of past exhibits to give a flavour of what the event is like.A lot of work has been done on modernising the entry process. There will be the option of pre-registration for exhibits the automatic production of labelling for the paintings and photos instant printing of receipts and immediate production of a list of entries to guide visitors.As in past years, people who come to view the exhibition will have free entry, with the option of making a suitable donation to the funds of the society. There is also a small fee to be paid by each exhibitor for every painting or photo that is hung, and this goes to help to cover running expenses.With over 500 people having visited the exhibition in 2017, organisers hope this excellent support from the community will continue. Both professional and amateur artists in the area are encouraged to make use of the exhibition to display their work.The overriding aim of the exhibition, since its beginning in 1967, has always been to foster interest in locally-produced art and to give people from the community the opportunity to let others see, appreciate, and maybe buy their works.Organisers wish to thank the Army Cadet Force for permission to use their building.Details about how to enter exhibits will appear in adverts in the Argyllshire Advertiser, Facebook and on the exhibition website.

These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

We simply don\u0026#8217t have enough children playing shinty in each school to make up separate clubs.Surely, in 2018, this shouldn\u0026#8217t be allowed to happen?It is only three clubs that are being affected by this, and they\u0026#8217re all in the south of Scotland,  half way through a season, leaving all our kids devastated at the though of losing their chosen sport.My son has been playing shinty since Primary One. He is now heading into Primary Four and is even more passionate about the sport. He enjoys quality team time, striving to be the best he can and just loving playing the game.It\u0026#8217s very difficult to explain something like this to an eight-year-old child, never mind the Primary One children we have in our club.One quote from a child was: \u0026#8216Everyone is going to be so sad if we don\u0026#8217t have shinty. Why would shinty people do this to us?\u0026#8217It\u0026#8217s a very sad day indeed for the children of Argyll and Bute who are simply being punished for what school they go to and where they live. We have to stand together and fight for our club and our children.The Camanachd Association needs to step up and find a solution to allow all children to compete nationally and stand as one united shinty community.Ailsa and Alastair Crawford, LochgilpheadSir,The Camanachd Association has put politics before the needs of the children and the development of the sport in Argyll.The kids are disappointed and the coaches who have worked tirelessly to set the club up are deflated. Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards. So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"a poignant prizegiving for tarbert afc","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 20/06/18, 6:08 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowTarbert AFC’s annual football dance was held on Saturday June 16 in the Islay Frigate Hotel.Players and their partners were joined by the wider circle of people who are involved with the club.This annual dinner dance is also the end of season awards presentation.Nikki MacDougall took home awards for Top Goal Scorer and Referees\u0026#8217 Player of the Year.

This could threaten future trade deals, environmental standards and food safety.The Tories think they can do whatever they want to Scotland and get away with it.The SNP tabled amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill to safeguard the Scottish Parliament from the threat of constraints on existing powers.This is something which Holyrood refused consent for last month by an overwhelming majority including all parties, except the Scottish Conservatives.It would simply be a democratic outrage and it would fly in the face of the fundamental principles of devolution. This Conservative government seems determined to destroy the founding principles of devolution and Labour and the Lib Dems must join us in defending it.Brendan O’Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,It seems that almost every day I\u0026#8217m contacted by farmers in my constituency with concerns about their future.This is hardly surprising as farmers are borrowing more and having to pay staff less, according to figures released by the Scottish Government.According to ‘Agricultural Facts and Figures’ published recently, agricultural borrowing has doubled in the last 10 years, capital investment has stayed the same and agricultural workers are earning £1,560 less on average compared to last year.The figures show farm borrowing has almost doubled from £1.38 billion to £2.28 billion between 2007 to 2017, while capital investment has stayed the same at £210 million.This demonstrates that farmers are investing much less in their machinery and equipment while still having to borrow ever-increasing sums to remain viable.This is on top of the fact farmers are still struggling with debts they incurred as a result the CAP payment fiasco caused by the SNP Government several years ago.Time and time again the separatists have shown complete disregard to the plight that our hard pressed farmers are facing. It seems our agricultural industry is just one more sector that is ignored by the separatists in their relentless push for a second independence referendum.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Claims by Theresa May that a so-called ‘Brexit dividend’ will help pay for a boost to NHS spending in England worth £20 billion a year within five years are highly disingenuous.The UK will continue to pay into the EU through the transition until the end of 2020 and will pay £20 billion of the \u0026#8216divorce bill\u0026#8217 through to 2028. In addition, the UK Government has committed to keep EU funding for agricultural subsidies, research and development and other key areas at the same level in the short-term.These are set figures so it will be at least 10 years before any so-called ‘Brexit dividend’, if it were ever to materialise, is to be realised. Add to that, if the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts are accurate, public finances are set to be £15 billion a year worse off by 2021, equivalent to £300 million a week.Interestingly, if taxes are set to rise, which they will clearly have to, it is staggering hypocrisy for the Tories to have attacked the Scottish Government’s boosting of the NHS in Scotland through progressive tax changes and then look to hike taxes themselves.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,Local government spending cuts have left councils in Scotland unable to meet the needs of local communities and, in some cases, are putting the public at risk.A survey of more than 2,000 local government employees working across all services reveals almost eight in 10 council workers have no confidence in the future of local services and half are thinking of leaving their jobs for less stressful work elsewhere.While local authorities have protected spending on statutory service areas such as adult and children’s social care, the amount they spend on other areas including parks and libraries has fallen sharply.Local authorities have had to cut so many vital services that they have now reached a point where vulnerable children and the elderly struggle to get the help that they need, entire communities are suffering and the public is being put at risk.There have been cuts to road and bridge maintenance, potholes in roads are left unfilled and bridges are at risk of crumbling. Crematoriums are not maintained, streetlights stay broken and parks are in disrepair as councils don’t have the equipment or the staff to adequately maintain them.There are now more than one million people with an unmet need for social care because councils do not have the resources to support them. Now is the time to reverse these cuts and invest in local government once more or the fabric of our society will come unstuck.Mark Ferguson, chairman, UNISON Scotland local government committee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"cygnets disappear from tarbert harbour","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 24/06/18, 7:31 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowTarbert residents are worried about the family of swans living in the harbour.Six cygnets were seen in late May, shortly after hatching, but reports on social media have them slowly dwindling.

It is the latest diversification at Corton Farm, just outside Ayr. Customers can buy a litre glass bottle for \u0026pound2 and use it again and again at the milk machine. And farmer Alison Kerr said: “You cannot get any fresher. “We’re really hoping it catches on so we can sell more and more directly to local people.” The Kerrs – five generations at Corton since 1925 – have constructed The Milk Hoose and the Milkbot vending machines providing “untampered, non-homogenised” milk from the Corton herd.  Customers on Friday gushed praise on the creamy taste, saying it is nothing like mass-produced products. The Kerrs are charging \u0026pound1.50 per litre and say it cuts out plastic waste from supermarket bottles. Although it is more expensive than supermarket pricing, they say their milk compares favourably to speciality gold top products. Willie and Alison, both 46, have been joined working the farm by son David,19, and are being helped by daughter Joanne,16, when she is not at Belmont Academy. Willie said: “It would be a dream to sell every litre we produce right here. “But we have had a great start and it has been so well received.” The farm produces between 5000 and 6000 litres of milk a day, depending on the time of year.  That is courtesy of the 220 Friesian-Holstein milkers. The Kerrs own 260 acres and rent another 250. Fourteen years ago they expanded into the Corton Plants nursery and 14 months ago the Coo Shed coffee shop. But Alison said: “The Milkbot really completes the story of selling your own product. “We siphon off what we need into churns to be pasteurised and it is put into the Milkbot. “I guarantee it tastes completely different as all the fats and proteins have not been stripped out. “It is non-homogenised and the cream settles on top like the the old-fashioned milk.” At the moment it is thought only three farms in Scotland are selling direct via a vending machine.  Alison added: “People now are so detached from where the food comes from and I think supermarkets are to blame for that. “Some kids think milk comes from a bottle in a supermarket. “Plastic has just become a huge issue and it has been good timing for us. “People are loving our branded glass bottles.” Peak time for the new vended milk is between 5pm and 7pm and there can be 20 cars in the car park at a time with people leaving work keen to top up their supply. Alison added: “Hopefully this continues to grow. Milk is sold too cheaply in supermarkets and farmers have been down-trodden for a long time. “We have just had to take what we can get and be paid sub-30p a litre. At the moment the Milkbot is doing a couple of hundred litres a day so we have a long way to go to reach 5000 a day.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"girl 4 stuck playpark equipment","story":"NewsGirl, 4, gets stuck in playpark equipment and needs fire brigade to rescue herPetrified Lily-Mags Rodman ended up wedging her wee leg in a metal car in Belleisle near Ayr.\u0026nbspShareBySarah Hilley16:44, 20 JUN 2018Updated19:45, 20 JUN 2018NewsLittle Lily-Mags had her leg stuck in the toy car for 40 minutes\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA four-year-old girl got stuck in playpark equipment for 40 minutes as firefighters struggled to get access to her. Petrified Lily-Mags Rodman ended up wedging her wee leg in a metal car in Belleisle. Her father David and other parents were unable to free her, sparking an emergency services rescue. But crews faced a major delay as access to the park through the main entrance was blocked off due to fencing at the Belleisle Hotel. The crew had to abandon their fire engine some distance away and run across the grass to reach Lily-Mags. After assessing the situation, they were forced to backtrack their appliance through the main exit and find another way in.  Mum Clare said: “Luckily my daughter wasn’t badly hurt, but if it was a life-or-death situation and a child had fallen from equipment it may have been too late.” Clare, who was working from home outside Ayr, rushed to the park after her husband phoned. Clare, 33, said: “I drove in a panic. “Her leg was wedged in the car at a funny angle. “I could hear her screaming over the phone. My husband and others tried to get her out but it hurt so they called the fire brigade.” Firefighters calmly cut off the side of the car to free the tot.  She emerged unscathed but with bad pins and needles during the incident a week past last Wednesday. Now Clare and Lily-Mag’s gran Anita O’Connor are calling for an emergency services route to the wooded park. Clare said: “The fire service were really fantastic but it took them 10 minutes to figure out how to get the fire engine in.” Anita said: “She was stuck for well over 40 minutes as the fire engine couldn’t find a route through to the park because of the fencing. “Fortunately she has not sustained any injuries, but she is extremely traumatised. “This issue regarding access needs to be addressed ASAP and not sat on for days until the council have their next meeting.”  Belleisle Hotel owner Campbell Inns erected more fencing on June 6, which has blocked off access to the playpark through the main driveway. The alternative entrance is now through Greenfield Avenue. Anita said emergency services should have been notified of the issue. A council spokesman said: Due to layout changes affecting the main access road at Belleisle, emergency services had to enter via an alternate route. “We are contacting the emergency services to advise them to use the alternative entrance for the time being.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"pair young lads saved squirrel","story":"NewsPair of young lads saved squirrel that was lying in agonyNow the caring boys - Max Bryson and Ben Edwards - have been praised for their caring capers.\u0026nbspShareByStephen Houston10:10, 21 JUN 2018NewsMax Bryson, left and Ben Edwards (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA squirrel lay in agony after plunging from a tree in a park ... only to be protected and saved by two young lads. Now the caring boys - Max Bryson and Ben Edwards - have been praised for their caring capers. And Ben’s dad James said: “I am immensely proud of them both. “Too often people these days would just walk past and, although concerned, would not intervene. “Ben and Max got stuck in and worked out a rescue plan.” The 12-year-olds, who have just started second year at Kyle Academy, had been out cycling in Rozelle Park last Tuesday.  They came across the bashed-up critter at the side of the duck pond and sprang into action. Onlooker Lorna Barclay said the boys deserve recognition. She said: “The squirrel was obviously hurt and fretting on the path. “We approached to see if we could help but were pleasantly surprised they had the situation under control.” They had already called the SSPCA and protected the frightened furry animal from dogs. When the charity said they’d be an hour the boys went home and got a strong bag filled with straw - leaving Lorna on guard.  And Max’s mum Liz and dad Douglas, who own the Inverlea Guest House in Ayr, said: “He loves animals so wanted to help. “I am so happy both boys decided to intervene. “They did it all on their own and I knew nothing about it. “What the lady said about the boys was amazing.” The lads returned to the squirrel within 15 minutes with their custom-made bed all ready for the SSPCA inspector. Lorna added: “It was lovely to see how concerned and compassionate the boys as well as using their problem- solving skills.  “Many other people would have walked on by without any interest in helping.” Ben already has a busy household with dad James, mum Sarah, sisters Lizzie and Emily, two cats, a tortoise and a fish. Scottish SPCA Chief Superintendent Mike Flynn said: “At this time of year we receive a lot of calls about people concerned about wildlife. “We all have a responsibility to look after and care for the wildlife in Scotland and these two boys went above and beyond on this occasion to help this poor squirrel. “They should be very proud.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12713526.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/emp_ayp_070618ecrepont_10JPG.jpg","title":"talented youngster finn ecrepont walking","story":"NewsTalented youngster Finn Ecrepont is walking on AyrDubbed a hot prospect with a bright future, the local Ayr lad kicked off his footballing career with a knock back from Grange Academy’s Performance School of Football.\u0026nbspShareByLochlin Highet12:00, 18 JUN 2018NewsAyr United\u0027s Finn Ecrepont (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMost success stories in football start with a rejection somewhere along the line. And 15-year-old Ayr United starlet Finn Ecrepont is no different. Dubbed a hot prospect with a bright future, the local Ayr lad kicked off his footballing career with a knock back from Grange Academy’s Performance School of Football. The Kilmarnock school has dedicated facilities for bright talents in the footballing world. And after leaving Alloway Primary, Ecrepont’s aim was to join the set-up at the Grange - but he was told he wasn’t good enough at his trial for the performance school. But the left-back, who also went to Glenburn Primary, refused to give up on his dream. Ecrepont, who has played with Ayr United since he was nine, said: “Getting that knock back is key to where I am today, because that has made me realise it’s not as easy as just walking into a team. “I didn’t get through the first trial so that made me focus and I knew I had to work hard. “I guess there was choices to make and sacrifices to make, but I was willing to make these changes for my football.  “I had training at Ayr the night after I got my knock back so I went to ask my coach Ross Armour for advice, so that’s when the work began. “I went away and worked on my game and a year later I got into the performance school at the Grange, which is one of the best things that has ever happened to me.” Ecrepont worked his way up through the ranks at Ayr and has now signed a three year deal with the first team. Just last season he was training with the under 17s, but his progress has been off the scale and he is now training with the senior side. He has been getting day release from school on a Thursday to train with the first team, but after signing his new deal he will train four mornings a week with Ian McCall’s side. And despite most schools refusing to take him in due to his football commitments, Ayr Academy were good enough to take him in. And dad Eddy, who runs Cafe Ginger in Ayr, claims teachers from Ayr Academy have offered to work overtime to help Ecrepont through his studies. Ecrepont is delighted to get his chance so early with Ayr.  He said: “The coaches thought I was playing well so I got more of a chance through my training and playing more with the under 20s last season. “I just love being in and around the first team, and the boys have been great with me so I am happy to be where I’m at at the moment. “Everyone at the club has been brilliant with me, through all the age groups. All the senior players and coaches have been really accepting of me and I couldn’t have asked for anything more. “Ian McCall and all of the other coaches are great because they always give me feedback. “Whether it’s positive or negative they are always keeping me right. That has been key to my progression. “If I was to ask anyone a question at Ayr they would answer it no problem, and that’s exactly what I look for and it’s why I’m here.” Despite the gruelling schedule of being a footballer, Ecrepont claims he is still fully focused on his school work.  He said: “Adapting to be a footballer hasn’t been much different as I enjoy it and it’s more like a hobby. I play football for fun and that’s what’s most important to me, so I guess it’s just normal. “It can take a lot out of me, but again because I enjoy football so much I don’t really realise how much I am doing. “I don’t think it’s had an effect on my school and I think it’s going good. Hopefully I have done well in my exams which I’ll find out in August. “I’ll get a Wednesday off from training so I can hopefully work towards getting my highers. “This year I’m studying higher English and PE, next year I’ll do something like Chemistry and Biology. And despite his age, Ecrepont has already been involved in a number of big games. He scored for Scotland under 16s against England, but for Ayr under 20s he was involved in a league decider last season against Morton. He said: “Unfortunately we lost the game 1-0 from a penalty, but I played the full game and it was a great experience and the boys played really well.  “There was quite a few Ayr United fans there so they gave us a great support.” But Ecrepont refuses to forget where he came from, he is sure to consistently help his dad Eddy in Cafe Ginger. Ecrepont said: “I signed for Ayr on the Tuesday, I was washing dishes for my dad on the Friday and on the Monday I was training with Scotland. “I work with my dad at the cafe which has been key to keeping me grounded. I know for a fact he wouldn’t let me get big-headed so I couldn’t thank him enough for that. “I’ve been asked before where I see myself in five years, but the honest answer is I don’t know. “For all I know I could get injured tomorrow and break my leg. “I have been told many times that I haven’t made it, and I know that. “My hard work starts now, so I just need to take everything as it comes and take each day on its own.” "},{"url":null,"title":"WATCH  Riders fording the River Ettrick at Selkirk Common Riding","story":"WE\u0027VE been out to soak up the Common Riding Celebrations in Selkirk

old Scotland flag in his garage in Toronto.\nBut casting the colours is in his blood - the 39-year-old was following in the footsteps of his father, Drew, and grandfather, Archie, by casting the colours.\nAnd the 2018 Colonial Standard Bearer was perfect in every way as he cast the striking yellow banner above his head.\nFollowing the ceremony Alisdair revealed: \u0026ldquoI watched the

InChorus subsequently performed with Dougie at the Amber Festival in Perth.\nThe trip to New York was hugely memorable with the choir singing on the Red Steps in Times Square, at the annual NYPD concert, at various September Concerts in the city, and, most poignantly, at the British Memorial Garden to the relatives of the British people who had died on 9/11.\nMoira Pearson, who is one of the founding members and choir manager from 2009 to 2012, told us: \" When the advert for a New Peebles Choir was placed in the Peeblesshire News in September 2008 no-one could have imagined just how important InChorus would become to so many people.\n\"It was a great privilege to be the choir manager for three years, during which time we travelled to New York to support and sing at commemorative events for the 10th Anniversary of 9/11.\n\"The fundraising effort to enable the journey was immense but made much easier by the unstinting support of the Peebles community.\"\nAlthough the 9/11 concert will remain a highlight of the InChorus story, the successes and landmark achievements continued after they came home.\nThe next year, 2012, saw the choir performing to another full house at the Festival Theatre, this time raising funds for other charities which is what InChorus likes to do.\nThe following year they embarked upon their \u0026lsquoChoirathon\u0026rsquo in aid of Comic Relief, when they sang from 9.30am to 9.30pm in the sleet, but raised \u0026pound3,500 in the process.\nIn 2013 they also had their first foray to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in what was to be come a biennial venture, winning the covered sell-out laurels in 2013, 2015 and 2017.\nIn 2014 the choir decided to try its hand at competition winning themselves a \u0026lsquoChoir of the Day\u0026rsquo award at the Scottish auditions of Choir of the Year, proving that even a very large choir can be sufficiently disciplined in all the nuances of choral singing to make a good impression.\nOver the years InChorus members discovered they rather liked performing at music festivals and have sung at T in the Park, Meadows Festival, Fringe by the Sea at North Berwick, Big Burns Supper in Dumfries, Eden Festival, Lindisfarne, and last year on the main stage between Texas and the Manic Street Preachers, at the BBC Children in Need\u0026rsquos Carfest in front of an audience of 20,000 people. How do they top that?\nThey also love weddings and travelled to Dublin in 2016 to sing at the wedding of a choir member\u0026rsquos son. While there, they performed on the bandstand in St Stephen\u0026rsquos Green and at the famous Cobblestone pub, as well as appearing as a flash mob all over the city.\nAly Skidmore, herself a long serving choir member, took over as Musical Director in 2014. Aly was responsible for the huge flash mob \u0026lsquoDancing in the Street\u0026rsquo event last year, involving the whole community.\nShe told us: \"Whilst singing is at the heart of everything that InChorus has achieved over the last 10 years, it\u0026rsquos never been only that.\n\"Through this organisation we have seen people\u0026rsquos friendships, confidence, skills, self-esteem and both emotional and physical health all flourish and grow over the years.\n\"In return the members give their time freely and generously to learn, rehearse and perform music for the benefit of others.\n\"In its time InChorus has achieved and given so much more than any of us really ever anticipated at the outset and I think every member feels so proud about that.\nIt\u0026rsquos amazing what a community can achieve when they group together, take a collective breath and burst into song.\"\nThey say that into every life a little rain must fall, and InChorus has not escaped, losing three much loved ladies to cancer.\nIn 2016 it was founder members Kitty Lyle and Celia Hayton and, just a few weeks ago, Bernice Brown - all are missed greatly.\nThroughout its 10 years the choir has raised over \u0026pound60,000 for other charities, both through its own concerts and through specific charity events.\nThis is something that is at the core of InChorus, something of which they are proud, and something which will continue in the years to come.\nAt one charity dinner they even put up an InChorus performance as an auction prize and were \u0026lsquosold\u0026rsquo for over \u0026pound1100. This, in turn, led to a performance at a very prestigious charity dinner in aid of breast cancer.\nTo celebrate its 10th birthday, the choir will be travelling to Barcelona in October for a long weekend of performances.\nBut before that they have a bit of a party planned in Peebles.\nOn September 1, the actual birthday weekend, they have organised their \u0026lsquoTen out of Ten\u0026rsquo day - when they will sing throughout the day from a list of at least ten different favourite songs, at ten different locations in Peebles.\nAlthough the earlier locations have yet to be revealed the finale will take place at the Eastgate Theatre, where it all started ten years ago, for an evening concert.\nThis will also be the final event of the 2018 Creative Peebles Festival.\nThe choir hopes you will join them or, at least, come and say hello.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"United front to boost the Borderlands","story":"HUNDREDS of stakeholders had their say on proposals to transform the Borderlands economy at a special conference in Dumfries on Monday.\nLeader of Dumfries and Galloway Council, Elaine Murray, welcomed more than 370 business representatives, public sector organisations and individuals to the first Borderlands conference.\nShe said: \u0026ldquoI am delighted that so many people attended on the day, this shows what an important project the Borderlands Inclusive Growth Deal is.\n\"One attendee described the conference as an \u0026lsquoIlluminating and fantastic event\u0026rsquo, which reflected the enthusiasm I perceived on the day, that this is a once in a generation opportunity which must be seized.\nFive local authorities from north and south of the border are working in partnership to put together a proposal that should have huge implications for those who live, work and visit the area.\nIt was the first opportunity for interested parties to hear about the themes that are being developed to underpin the Borderlands Inclusive Growth Deal \u0026ndash and to give their views on the major projects they believe would kickstart transformation.\nThe conference was held at a key time for the partnership, made up of Carlisle City, Cumbria County, Dumfries and Galloway, Northumberland County and Scottish Borders Councils.\nResponses from the conference will help the partnership to build a case to present to both the UK and Scottish Governments later this year.

The Depute Procurator Fiscal said he believed the practice of young men going at night to farms was becoming very common, farms when the men were absent being singled out for attention and the conduct of the accused on this occasion was, to say the least, pretty bad.A number of farmers had informed him that their one objection to joining the Volunteer Force was that if they left the house at night occurrences of this kind were sure to take place.Theft of rhododendron bloomsA girl residing in Campbeltown was charged with having, on May 28 in the grounds adjoining the public road from Carradale Post Office to the pier, and beside the entrance gate to Carradale Stables, stolen two rhododendron blooms.Accused admitted taking the blooms but said she did not know they were private property.She had gone to Carradale to inquire after a situation and was returning to the ferry when she spotted the flowers and climbed over a wall to get them.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"st columbas conventicle","story":"All religions have a mixture of good and bad points as do most political parties.When dealing with history, too, there are some literal truths, which both ministers at last Sunday\u0026#8217s Keil St Columba\u0026#8217s conventicle appeared to skip past.It was mentioned that the 6th century missionary based his teaching on a Bible written in Latin, but not that his name translated means \u0026#8216dove,\u0026#8217 a potent symbol of peace.In addition, at that time before the schism with Rome, St Columba, who also spoke Gaelic, offered the pagan hordes an education and health service rolled into one, with its roots in Europe.St Columba and his monks were the educated people of their time.While the medicine might well have been rudimentary, it was based on the learning of the Roman empire.

Six-year-old Maisie, who plays the main character, Libby, in the film, in what was her first ever acting role, was accompanied to the glitzy ceremony in Los Angeles by her mother Elizabeth, co-star and writer Rachel Shenton, and the short film\u0026rsquos director Chris Overton.  And while a little young to be enjoying a champagne celebration, Maisie will be returning to her Upper Stratton home as one of the youngest actors to have starred in an Oscar-winning film.      THE.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.  The film was given its first public screening in Swindon last month at the Swindon Arts Centre. Gilson, who spoke before and after the showing, said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a great pleasure to be able to finally show this in Swindon.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a film to be appreciated, and to spread a message.

The court was presented with details of the alleged anti-social behaviour of Mr Conner, including shouting, swearing and fighting within a property at Links Avenue, and disposing of items and bags of rubbish outwith a domestic bin within the communal garden.

Len Smith, 92, was conscripted at the age of 18 and was a supply lorry driver for the British Liberation Army.  He landed at Gold Beach, Normandy, where he said he was not shot at and saw little combat.  But he drove some of the first troops into Berlin in 1945 and moved supplies through a war-ravaged France, Belgium, Holland and Germany.  Despite his actions, modest Len, who went on to work in the civil service, said he had never thought of himself as veteran, never mind a hero.  He told the Courier: \u0026ldquoThere were thousands of young men like me. I never considered myself a veteran until the recent events marking the anniversary led to me looking back.  \u0026ldquoAt the time we just got on with it the real heroes are the soldiers who fought and died over there.  Mr Smith was one of eight children born in Pencaitland to local couple John and Euphemia Smith.  His sister Ellen, 97, still lives in Pencaitland and he visits the area regularly but after he was demobbed in 1947, Mr Smith moved to Longlevens, Gloucestershire, to find work.  Now a widower, Mr Smith\u0026rsquos sister sends him the Courier every week so he can keep up with local news.  His L\u0026eacutegion d\u0026rsquoHonneur medal was sent to his home in Cheltenham by post and contained a letter from Jean-Pierre Jouyet, French ambassador to the UK, which said: \u0026ldquoI offer you my warmest congratulations on this high honour, which recognises your military engagement and steadfast involvement in the liberation of France during the Second World War.  \u0026ldquoAs we contemplate this Europe of peace, we must never forget the heroes like you who came from Britain and the Commonwealth to begin the liberation of Europe by liberating France.  But Mr Smith insists he was just a young man doing a job.  He said: \u0026ldquoI didn\u0026rsquot know how the war was going, I didn\u0026rsquot read anything about the war. I was a young lad and I had no fear.  \u0026ldquoI just thought \u0026lsquoget on with it\u0026rsquo.  However, he remembers thinking about how worried his mother would be.  Len\u0026rsquos brothers James and Thomas were also in active service and James was in the D-Day landings. All three came home.  He said: \u0026ldquoWhen we came back my mum was overjoyed, she got three sons back uninjured.  Last year, Mr Smith returned to the Normandy beaches on a British Legion tour organised for veterans.

Plans to close Haddington Infant School and King\u0026rsquos Meadow Primary School were revealed last autumn.  East Lothian Council intends to create a new primary school, operating from the existing school buildings, which will cover nursery through to primary seven. The proposal was approved by East Lothian Council in April after a public consultation. It has now also been approved by the Scottish Government.  Combined, the two schools currently have a school roll of about 700 pupils. However, it remains unclear who the new headteacher for the primary school, which is yet to be named, will be.  Current headteacher Seonaid McGillivray is set to be appointed at another as yet unnamed school in the county, with the final details expected to be tied up within a matter of days.

Five retail units are planned for a site at Gateside previously earmarked for a Sainsbury\u0026rsquos supermarket and petrol station.  The site, which totals about 60,000 sq ft, could be made up of units ranging from 7,500 sq ft to 20,000 sq ft in size.  Alastair Dickie, development director with Ediston Real Estates, which now owns the site, attended the town\u0026rsquos community council meeting on Tuesday, one week before plans are unveiled to the public.  He told members the proposal was for the site to include three food retailers, with the other two units including \u0026ldquoa household-type retail business and a coffee drive-through facility.  However, he was keeping tight-lipped on the identity of the businesses until legal agreements were in place.  Mr Dickie hoped planning permission for the site, off Oak Tree Roundabout west of Haddington, could be achieved by the end of the year.  He said: \u0026ldquoIf we submit an application in August, we would hope. . . we would hopefully have a consent in December or January next year.  \u0026ldquoWe could be on site quarter one of 2019.  It is then hoped that the retailers could be trading in the lead-up to Christmas that year or early in 2020.  The development, which has been described as \u0026ldquoEast Lothian\u0026rsquos first retail park, will involve in the region of \u0026pound14 million investment, with 150 jobs potentially created, as well as those during the construction process.  It has already been revealed that talks are ongoing with \u0026ldquoa number of major retailers who will be new to East Lothian.  Concerns have been expressed by a number of retailers in the town centre that the creation of a retail park on the outskirts would be detrimental to their business.  But Mr Dickie, who previously lived in the town and continues to stay in the county, was hopeful the additional retailers would encourage people to remain in the area rather than heading further afield to retail parks in Edinburgh.  The proposals are on display to the public from 2pm to 7pm on Tuesday at the John Gray Centre.  The developer is also continuing to make progress at a second Haddington site for retail development \u0026ndashat Harperdean, between the A1 and the A199, east of Aberlady Road.

The new scheme offers people an opportunity to support Our Community Energy \u0026ndash a partnership between not-for-profit Scottish firm Our Power and Mongoose Energy, which manages community energy assets \u0026ndash and hopes to find investors in the county.  They say that the site at Pogbie Windfarm \u0026ndash already home to the turbines \u0026ndash will create enough energy to power 7,200 homes and believe that, when they combine it with a second site in Berwickshire, the scheme will raise an estimated \u0026pound1.9 million in surplus profit over 25 years.  Our Power said that profit from the wind turbines it takes over would then be used to keep energy prices down, helping people who are struggling with the costs.  They need to raise just over \u0026pound3 million for the project, which covers both sites, and community groups and individuals are being invited to invest in bonds and shares to raise the money needed to get the project up and running, with investments ranging from \u0026pound500 to \u0026pound100,000.  Andrew Smith, Our Community Energy acting chairperson, said: \u0026ldquoFuel poverty is a huge issue for Scotland and we\u0026rsquore proud to be launching such an important fundraising opportunity to directly tackle it.  \u0026ldquoInvesting with a social purpose is something close to the hearts of many Scots, and these bond and equity offers provide the chance to have a huge impact locally.  \u0026ldquoThese offers aim to support those who struggle to afford sufficiently heated homes, as well as providing investors with an exciting new option which not only targets a significant social impact but a positive environmental one too.  \u0026ldquoHowever with these types of investments there are some risks and funds are not readily realisable.  \u0026ldquoInvestors should note that capital is at risk and returns are not guaranteed.  A fuel poor household is defined as one which needs to spend more than 10 per cent of its income on all fuel use and to heat its home to an adequate standard of warmth.  Last year, the East Lothian Poverty Commission found that almost half of local pensioners were forced to spend more than 10 per cent of their income on energy bills.  Mark Kenber, CEO of Mongoose Energy, added: \u0026ldquoWith the majority of Scots recognising the critical level that fuel poverty has reached, it is now more important than ever for investors to put their money into causes that work for the social good, not just their own.  \u0026ldquoOur Community Energy not only gives investors the potential to earn competitive interest rates on their money, but also the opportunity to support the wider Scottish community.

A pressure group called \u0026lsquoBowls for Gullane\u0026rsquo was established on Facebook in the wake of concerns that the village\u0026rsquos bowling club \u0026ndash with a membership of only about 30 \u0026ndash was to be sold to developers.  Councillor Jeremy Findlay, ward member and former chairman of Gullane Area Community Council, said: \u0026ldquoAll three ward councillors are behind the campaign to save the club and we hope that the members understand the feeling in the village.  \u0026ldquoI understand that the committee own the club and it would be the members who benefit from any potential sale.  About 50 residents gathered outside the bowling club on Monday evening to show their displeasure at the possible loss of the club.  The group told the Courier they had had hundreds of offers of support.  Catherine MacKenzie said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove had people phone up, email and text us \u0026ndash and face-to-face \u0026ndash to tell us that they\u0026rsquore willing to become a member.  \u0026ldquoSome of them don\u0026rsquot live locally, or won\u0026rsquot be able to bowl, but they are willing to pay the membership fees. People do not want to see the club close.  Gordon McLelland, a local resident and member of the community council, added: \u0026ldquoThe community council want to save the club for the community.  \u0026ldquoWe have tried hard to offer the club our support to work with them but so far they have turned that down.  Billy Mellors, the county\u0026rsquos bowls development officer, said: \u0026ldquoThe overwhelming support from the local community indicates to me the future of Gullane Bowling Club can be sustained if the current members accept it.  Many locals have tried to sign up as members but have been turned away by the club, it has been claimed.  Another member of the group said: \u0026ldquoWhat has shocked us as a group is how many people have been refused membership in recent years \u0026ndash young and old have come forward with their personal experience of being turned away.  Mr Mellors added: \u0026ldquoTime will tell on the way the club want to go but we all hope a common sense approach is taken to preserve this community facility.  East Lothian MSP Iain Gray met representatives of the Bowls for Gullane group last week and is keen to find a solution to ensure the club\u0026rsquos survival.  He said: \u0026ldquoThis is an unfortunate situation Gullane has lost too many local assets recently, so every effort should be made to avoid losing another. I did meet with representatives of the campaign and have said that I will support them in trying to find a way the land, and preferably bowling too, can remain part of the village community.  Ian McMillan, CEO of Bowls Scotland, said that he was \u0026ldquodelighted to see local residents lend their support to the campaign to save the 116-year-old club.  He added: \u0026ldquoI would encourage all in the village to support their historic club, get on the green, enjoy the great game of bowls and ensure future generations can benefit from the opportunity to play an accessible, inclusive sport. Bowls Scotland fully supports the work being undertaken to keep bowls an important part of Gullane\u0026rsquos community fabric.  Les Ritchie, secretary of East Lothian Bowling Association, told the group: \u0026ldquoWe are ready to support you and the community in whatever steps might secure a future for bowling in Gullane.  Attempts by the Courier to speak to Michael Baxter, vice-president and secretary at the bowling club, were unsuccessful this week. In April, Mr Baxter told us: \u0026ldquoThere are not enough members to support the running of the club.  He had said then that the club was \u0026ldquotrying to find a solution but that it was not viable to continue with a dwindling membership.  A spokeswoman for East Lothian Council confirmed the land was earmarked for leisure and recreation use in the Local Development Plan and any deviation from that would require planning permission for a potential change of use."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7297144.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Haddington hosts world record attempt for the Slosh dance","story":"              HUNDREDS of people are set to lace up their dancing shoes in a bid to break a world record.

Doug Haig from the Bridge Centre said to do a world record attempt because it would be great for publicity and a lot of fun.  The group decided to make it an unofficial world record attempt because they were worried they would have to turn away people who were not dancing in time to the music.

The group, who meet in North Berwick\u0027s St Andrew Blackadder Church every Friday, will be performing Evan Placey\u0026rsquos powerful play Girls Like That, which explores the consequences of a naked photo being sent round a school and how this affects, not only the girl in the photo, but the way in which girls react and respond.  Indelible Arts director Linda Grant told the Courier: \"I am so delighted that our talented cast have made it to the SCDA one act festival.  \"It really is a joy to bring all these young people together who have a love of the performing arts and support each other in a very nurturing environment.

S6 pupil Ella Higgins said: \"When I first read the script, I immediately loved it and was desperate to perform it.  \"I\u0026rsquove never read or seen anything that fully demonstrates how much resilience is needed to survive in high school as a teenage girl to the extent that this play does and it covers so many issues and scenarios that many girls do experience in real life.  \"This play is such an important and well written piece. I feel so proud to be performing it at the final and I hope we do it justice and get it the recognition it deserves.\"  Holly Edwards, another S6 pupil, said: \"The play is extremely relevant and gives a taste of real life and what really goes on at schools that have such a large social media influence.  \"The competition means a lot to us as a group and the thought of getting to the final is so exciting, we want to show people what this play is all about. After all our hard work we are all so happy to be in the final!  Heather Fortune, also S6, added: \"Life today as a high school student is displayed perfectly through the contrast between the boys\u0026rsquo reaction to the photo and the girls\u0026rsquo reaction to it.\"  And S4 pupil Abbey Greenwood: \"I have really enjoyed working on this play, I think it really brings people together and opens up discussions on how we treat each other in society.\""},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7930043.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Calls to tackle Edinburgh Bypass gridlock as tram system to Musselburgh mooted","story":"              MUSSELBURGH\u0026rsquoS MSP has backed calls for improvements to the Edinburgh City Bypass \u0026ndash while suggesting extending a tram or light rail system to the Honest Toun.  Colin Beattie stressed that \u0026ldquoradical thinking needed to be done to create a solution, highlighting a possible extension of a tram or light rail system out to Musselburgh.  During a recent Holyrood debate, he said: \u0026ldquoPeople meet the queues of traffic heading on to the bypass on the main roads around my constituency before they are even near the bypass. This causes more congestion and more air pollution.  Mr Beattie later said: \u0026ldquoYou can go along the road at any time of the day and there are queues of traffic, mainly at Sheriffhall Roundabout.  \u0026ldquoIt is important that when the Government are looking at all the possible changes required to the bypass, all options are considered. The main priority should be that it is cost-efficient and done as soon as possible.  \u0026ldquoIt may be that it is more economic to extend a tram or light rail system out to the main population centres such as Musselburgh than to take on the eye-watering cost of enlarging the A720. This would also benefit the environment and be much faster than using road transport.  \u0026ldquoClearly more radical thinking needs to be done on creating a sustainable solution. I am not convinced that simply replicating a system which moves traffic speedily and efficiently into new choke points is the answer.  Miles Briggs, Lothian region MSP who led the Parliamentary debate, said: \u0026ldquoThe transport information company Inrix in late 2016 identified the bypass as the most congested trunk road outside London, with four of the UK\u0026rsquos worst bottlenecks.  \u0026ldquoI continue to be contacted by frustrated constituents and businesspeople who face frequent delays when using the bypass to commute or transport goods, especially but not exclusively at peak times or when there is an accident on the route. Many drivers tell me their experience is that these tailbacks and traffic jams are becoming more and more regular.  He said that while proposed work at Sheriffhall would be an important improvement, he added: \u0026ldquoIt is only one part of what needs to be a far broader, long-term and coordinated programme of improvements to the bypass which will ensure traffic can keep moving in the decades ahead.  \u0026ldquoThis means looking at innovative solutions, assessing whether extra lanes will be needed, looking at the possible use of hard shoulders in some situations and utilising technology so the bypass can become a smart motorway.  Mr Briggs called on the Scottish Government to take forward a feasibility study into widening the city bypass and new options to address the growing congestion.  A Transport Scotland spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe Edinburgh and South East Scotland City Region Deal includes investment of up to \u0026pound120m in the A720 city bypass for the grade separation of Sheriffhall Roundabout and \u0026pound20 million investment in public transport infrastructure in west Edinburgh.  \u0026ldquoThis investment will improve journey reliability and safety for all users and support significant planned investment in Edinburgh and South East Scotland.  \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Government remains committed to undertaking the improvements at the Sheriffhall junction at the earliest opportunity. We are continuing to progress the detailed design development and assessment of the preferred option and expect to publish draft orders in 2019."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7930076.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Haddington pub seeking new owners","story":"              A TOWN centre pub which changed its name less than a year ago is on the lookout for new people to run it.

Brave Ruth Quilietti-Bird \u0026ndash who at one point was the most ill person \u0026ldquoin the whole of the UK, according to her husband \u0026ndash moved hospital several times to receive specialist treatment for multiple organ failure, spending her 40th birthday in intensive care rather than on a planned holiday.  She has had both her feet amputated after they suffered tissue damage due to sepsis \u0026ndash a serious complication of an infection.\u0026nbsp It was also feared that Ruth, who taught art at Knox Academy in Haddington and Preston Lodge High School, Prestonpans, might also lose her hands.  She is recovering at the Astley Ainslie Hospital in Edinburgh, where she is getting used to her newly-fitted prosthetic legs with the aid of physiotherapists.  The health of her hands improved and she is keeping them busy by resuming her love of creative activities such as drawing, weaving and needlework.  Ruth is now looking forward to getting out of hospital to rejoin her family: husband Mark, 47, and their daughters, seven-year-old Lucia and Isabella, five.    But she can\u0026rsquot return to her New Street home in Musselburgh as it has an outdoor staircase and is no longer suitable, so the search for a new home is under way.  Now her friend Jacqueline Campbell has launched a crowdfunding campaign to raise \u0026pound20,000 to help fund a mobility scooter and adapt a new property.  In March, Ruth suddenly started to have breathing problems along with vomiting and diarrhoea.  Mark, a nurse at the Western General Hospital in Edinburgh, said she was rushed to the accident and emergency unit at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh by paramedics who assessed that she was suffering from sepsis, which can be triggered by an infection and affected her immune system.  He said: \u0026ldquoHer health deteriorated more and more and she was taken to the high dependency unit. They said they needed to ventilate Ruth and that was the last time I spoke to her for two-and-a-half weeks. She went into a medicalised coma.  Mark said it was still unknown what was causing the infection, so Ruth received multiple antibiotics.  \u0026ldquoThe consultant told me to prepare myself because we were losing Ruth, he said.  The medical team decided to take Ruth into theatre to connect an ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) circuit to help her breathing.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoThey managed to stabilise her but her vital organs were failing. Her respiratory had already failed and her kidneys had failed.  \u0026ldquoThere was no one as ill as Ruth in the whole of the UK at that time, receiving that amount of support to keep her alive.  Ruth was then transferred to a specialist ECMO unit at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoHer liver was failing and her heart was beginning to fail.  \u0026ldquoThey said again that they were losing Ruth and she wouldn\u0026rsquot last the in-patient stay.  \u0026ldquoThey made the decision to fit a second ECMO circuit to support her heart and this stabilised her.  \u0026ldquoI was told several times I might be potentially losing Ruth. Then things started improving and they were able to withdraw some of the support and her blood tests were showing very small improvements.  \u0026ldquoRuth was infected with group \u0026lsquoA\u0026rsquo streptococcal, a very aggressive bacteria which is around us all the time.  \u0026ldquoRuth\u0026rsquos immune system was already affected, so it was able to take over very quickly, causing failure to the vital organs. She was diagnosed with sepsis and pneumonia.  Ruth began to make progress with her breathing, her heart started to stabilise and her kidneys started to improve. Doctors felt they could remove the ECMO circuit for the heart and rescind the \u0026lsquodo not resuscitate\u0026rsquo notice.  As doctors brought Ruth out of sedation, she faced the risk of haemorrhaging throughout the body because of blood thinning and medications.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoI remember her opening her eyes and looking at me.  \u0026ldquoWe put our foreheads together and looked into each others\u0026rsquo eyes. I knew that Ruth was back.  \u0026ldquoHow close she was to dying on several occasions is still difficult to comprehend.  A special moment for Ruth was a visit by her daughters for her birthday when they took her cuddly toys and held her hand. Her mum and dad were also at her bedside.  Ruth was moved back to the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, where her ventilator was removed and she was able to start to speak.  But as she got better, she was to face a huge decision as a result of the tissue damage, caused by the lack of blood flow, which had turned her feet black.  She was told she would have to lose her right foot and possibly half of her left foot, with surgery carried out at St John\u0026rsquos Hospital in Livingston.  But Ruth, determined to get the best quality of life, made the decision to lose both feet below the knee, which would give her more choices in terms of prosthetics and improve her recovery.    Mark paid tribute to the \u0026ldquowonderful hospital staff who had \u0026ldquogiven everything for Ruth.  He highlighted the help he had received from friends and family over the past few months, including the network of \u0026lsquoSupermums\u0026rsquo who looked after Lucia and Isabella, friends, neighbours and colleagues at the Western General.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe kindness of people has been overwhelming. They want to help so much.

The move would also see a change in hours for primary schools to match the new secondary day, with proposals to extend P1 and P2 pupils\u0026rsquo week from 22.5 hours to the same 25 hours that their older school-mates follow. A failure to synchronise primary school start and finish times to match the high school changes would cost the council an estimated \u0026pound190,000 in additional transport costs.  A public consultation will now be launched with the schools to establish the best standard timetable, with options for a 27, 32 or 33-period week. A 33-period week, for instance, could see secondary students\u0026rsquo first period of the day start at 8.30am, with a finish time of 3.40pm Monday to Thursday and 12.55pm on Fridays.  The council said a common school day would lead to joint delivery, mutual support, sharing of best practice and collaborative professional development opportunities, as well as meaning greater equity of resource and opportunity for young people across East Lothian and barriers to travel would be reduced.  Councillor Shamin Akhtar, cabinet spokesperson for education, said: \u0026ldquoThese proposals are all about improving inclusion, wellbeing and equality. We\u0026rsquore always keen to look for new ways of raising attainment and improving positive destinations for our children and young people.  \u0026ldquoThere are a number of potential practical benefits associated with such changes. It\u0026rsquos important that we listen to the views of staff, pupils, parents, carers and other stakeholders. That\u0026rsquos why I\u0026rsquom pleased cabinet has agreed that the council will hold a consultation and carry out a feasibility study. This will be launched in due course.

They say they are being overlooked by customers at the supermarket car park who can see through the fence into the communal garden area in front of their ground-floor properties at Mill House on Eskmills Road, which is managed by Dunedin Canmore Housing Association.  Margaret and Keith Morris moved from a Dunedin Canmore property in Bathgate last September into the phase two of Mill House \u0026ndash an amenity housing development for residents aged 55 and over.  Mrs Morris said: \u0026ldquoThere is no privacy whatsoever.  \u0026ldquoPeople who park in the car park have been waving in.  \u0026ldquoThere were two young guys in a van and I was hanging out my washing and one was nudging the other.

Mrs Morris said that although there were some trees along the boundary, they shed their leaves in the autumn, leaving the area bare.  She claimed that she and her husband had called on the housing association for permission to fill in the gaps in the fence to allow more privacy but claimed they had been told they couldn\u0026rsquot as another resident liked it that way.  \u0026ldquoWe wanted to get these slats which are only 94p. We would pay for them and fill in the spaces, she added.  She said they also called for a fence to be installed to stop people using an area past their flats as a shortcut to Tesco, claiming they were dumping rubbish including cans and bottles en route.  Neighbour Fiona Wilson said that motorists ate and slept in their vehicles and let their dogs out of cars.  \u0026ldquoWe are entitled to some sort of privacy, she added.  \u0026ldquoWe can\u0026rsquot go out \u0026ndash everybody\u0026rsquos looking at us.  \u0026ldquoMy bedroom is also to the front.  Another resident, who declined to be named agreed, saying: \u0026ldquoWe are getting no privacy and I can\u0026rsquot even sit out in the back garden for people looking in.  Alan Glasgow, Dunedin Canmore housing director, said: \u0026ldquoWe are aware there are a small number of residents at Eskmills Road who have concerns about the garden fence.  \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquoll continue to work with the community and local partners to see what can be done to help further increase privacy when people are using the nearby car park.

The operation at the site off Edinburgh Road took place last Thursday.  Sculptor Michael Johnson\u0026rsquos work, called \u0026lsquoMemory and Reflection\u0026rsquo, is 12ft high and 6ft feet wide.  The stainless steel sculpture depicts aspects of Musselburgh\u0026rsquos history with images of agriculture, people, connections to the sea, the river and the Romans. The face of the sculpture is mirror polished and reflects whatever stands before it.  Mr Johnson, from Nottinghamshire, sees these two aspects of the shell, the memory and reflection, as metaphors for a work which interprets the history of the town and offers a reflection of how the town is viewed now.  A working group made up of community representatives selected the mussel shell for the commission. Mr Johnson undertook activities with local groups and schoolchildren to create designs for bronze inserts incorporated onto the main sculpture.  The fisherfolk stone sculpture at Murdoch Green will be moved to a seating area in front of the Shell petrol station, also off Edinburgh Road.  The mussel shell is one of two works of art funded by Tesco at a cost of \u0026pound76,000 as part of the council\u0026rsquos Percent for Art policy, which was a condition of planning consent for the company\u0026rsquos present store.  The other is an archer planned for the banks of the River Esk, with its installation expected to be next week.

It has been confirmed that the much-loved facility for older people will continue as it is in its High Street home.  Fears were raised back in 2016 that the day centre might be forced to relocate or even cease to exist in its present form because a new day centre facility could not be accommodated within the current building.  East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership needed to provide at least 18 places of registered day care for people with complex care needs in Musselburgh given that it was the largest town in East Lothian. This was in line with need identified as part of a wider review of older people\u0026rsquos day centres.  This led to the partnership and the Hollies exploring the options available, which ranged from potentially adapting the current building to accommodate 18 people through to looking at possible other buildings if the Hollies couldn\u0026rsquot be adapted.  After nearly two years of talks, and Care Inspectorate and architects\u0026rsquo input, it was found that, in order to adapt the Hollies premises, the lunch club and public cafe would be lost at the expense of more than 100 users.  A joint decision remains to be made about the eight day care places already in existence at the Hollies current premises but, at present, there is agreement that these places will continue.  The health and social care partnership is now looking for somewhere else in Musselburgh to accommodate the other 10 places.  Following a meeting this month, the Hollies trustees have confirmed that agreement has been reached with the health and social care partnership that the status quo will remain at the day centre.  In a joint statement, the trustees said: \u0026ldquoThe Hollies distributed a consultation paper to service users and had 271 responses completed in two weeks. The overwhelming consensus of the people consulted is for the Hollies to continue providing the service it does now for the people of Musselburgh and surrounding areas. We have also received positive feedback on our proposed expansion of activities in the hall in the afternoons.  \u0026ldquoWe have agreed with the health and social care partnership that the Hollies should remain as it is. We are looking forward to continuing to work as before and to embark on exciting new projects to meet the wishes of all those who attend the Hollies.  Liz Shannon, centre manager, said: \u0026ldquoFunding is a constant battle for us all at the Hollies and we have been in limbo whilst these talks were taking place and have been unable to approach funders as we were unclear what funding we were asking for.  \u0026ldquoThe health and social care partnership has assured us they will continue to give funding at the current level for this financial year which is \u0026pound82,000 to continue to fund the eight registered places which we are grateful for in this transition period. However, that is less than a third of what it costs to run all our services and maintain the building.  \u0026ldquoThings are going to be very tight for the near future while we submit funding applications to funders like the lottery however, we are very excited at the prospect of moving forward and very grateful for the support from the people of Musselburgh and beyond.  Councillor Fiona O\u0026rsquoDonnell, health and social care spokesperson, said: \u0026ldquoI am pleased that the Hollies will continue to provide a wide range of services in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoThis was a really positive meeting and the plans to provide more activities in the Hollies are good news for local people.  \u0026ldquoThe health and social care partnership will continue its work to increase the amount of day support in Musselburgh for older people with complex care needs."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7959839.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Phonebox removed from centre of Haddington","story":"              A TRADITIONAL red phonebox has been removed from the centre of Haddington after it was used just once in a year.

Colin Beattie\u0027s comments follows a \"positive meeting\" with health bosses in the wake of patients\u0027 concerns about the service at the enlarged practice in the Musselburgh Primary Care Centre.  The Musselburgh MSP met with doctors and staff at the surgery, along with representatives from East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership.  Mr Beattie said: \"There is no doubt that there are issues around patients\u0026rsquo communication with the surgery, particularly at peak times. I was pleased that the surgery has recognised this and was in a position to give me a briefing on the situation.\"  He said doctors were now up to their full staffing level of 14 and an additional four staff members to take phone calls were in the process of being recruited.  During the visit, Mr Beattie had the chance to discuss other new initiatives which were \"positively transforming the surgery\".  He said: \"While much work seems to have been done, more still has to be achieved to improve the service to patients.  \"I am confident that Riverside and East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership are seriously addressing their remaining issues and I will be keeping in close contact going forward to ensure that my constituents receive the service they should expect.\"  He added that the practice was looking at introducing an online appointment booking system, which it is anticipated would reduce phone calls to the practice.  Riverside was also looking at different options as to how to more effectively manage phone calls at the volume it was receiving, he said.  Mr Beattie said: \"I have encouraged the practice to expedite the introduction of the online appointment booking system, which I feel will have the greatest and quickest effect on the experience of patients contacting the surgery.\"  He also raised the concerns of patients who might have to speak to multiple staff over a period before they were dealt with.  \"Clearly a single point of contact who can immediately direct the patient to the correct destination would be cheaper for the surgery and more efficient and less frustrating for the patient,\" added Mr Beattie."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7963295.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Zsa Zsa  the English bulldog  wins World   s Ugliest Dog title","story":"              A nine-year-old English bulldog has been named the winner of the 2018 World\u0026rsquos Ugliest Dog contest in the San Francisco Bay Area.

It is a historic moment for women who have had to rely on their husbands, fathers, brothers and drivers to run basic errands, get to work, visit friends or even drop children off at school.  The ban had relegated women to the backseat, restricting when and how they move around.  But after midnight on Sunday, Saudi women finally joined women around the world in being able to get behind the wheel of a car and simply drive.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom speechless. I\u0026rsquom so excited it\u0026rsquos actually happening, said Hessah al-Ajaji, who drove her family\u0026rsquos Lexus down the capital Riyadh\u0026rsquos busy Tahlia Street after midnight.

As for the male drivers on the road, \u0026ldquothey were really supportive and cheering and smiling, she said.  In a few hours, she says she will drive herself to work for the first time in Saudi Arabia.  For nearly three decades, outspoken Saudi women and the men who supported them had called for women to have the right to drive.  They faced arrest for defying the ban as women in other Muslim countries drove freely.  In 1990, during the first driving campaign by activists, women who got behind the wheels of their cars in the capital, Riyadh, lost their jobs, faced severe stigmatisation and were barred from travel abroad for a year.

Ahead of allowing women to drive, the kingdom passed a law against sexual harassment with up to five years in prison for the most severe cases.  Criticism against women driving has largely been muted since since King Salman announced last year that they would be allowed to drive.  With state-backed support for the move, many Saudis now say they support the decision allowing women to drive and see it as long overdue.  Not all women are driving at once, though. The overwhelming majority of women in Saudi Arabia still do not have licences.  Many have not had a chance to take the gender-segregated driving courses that were first offered to women only three months ago.  There is also a waiting list of several months for the classes on offer in major cities."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7842387.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Port Seton Lottery winner climbs Ben Nevis for highest champagne spray","story":"              LOTTERY millionaire John Edmond has undertaken a suitably large-scale celebration to mark the creation of the National Lottery\u0026rsquos 5,000th millionaire. . . by climbing Ben Nevis to conduct the UK\u0026rsquos highest Lottery champagne spray!

Around the world people from the 32 countries taking part will already have had moments of joy and woe, of thrills and fears, all centred around a couple of dozen men running around a field kicking a ball.  We like to support our team if they\u0026rsquore taking part. Some countries\u0026rsquo involvement mean nothing to us. Others we may actively dislike because of their regime or government or historical events. Russia is the host nation. I have a friend who is not watching the tournament because Russia is hosting. He likened it to Hitler\u0026rsquos Berlin Olympics in 1936. He is Polish.  It\u0026rsquos like the Eurovision Song Contest where you can predict one country\u0026rsquos vote for another, depending on how friendly or unfriendly these two countries have been through history.  Will England fans support Argentina, with the Falklands still in people\u0026rsquos memories, and Maradona\u0026rsquos hand of God incident against England in 1986? For that matter Scots have not traditionally wanted England to do well in the World Cup.  This is all about identity. About who we deem ourselves to be, and about the mental invention of a sense of me, us, and others. So who am I, the person who is writing this? In terms of national identity my immediate thought is, I am Scottish. I was born in Cambuslang, Scotland. I was raised here and spent most of my life living in Scotland. I speak with a Scottish accent. Anyone with a passing understanding of Scotland and the Scots would immediately on meeting and hearing me think I\u0026rsquom Scottish. The fact that my name and my father are Polish doesn\u0026rsquot count. My mother, born in Scotland to parents also born in Scotland, is however one hundred percent Irish in her genes, going back to when Thomas Murphy left Ireland in the 1840s. So in terms of my DNA I don\u0026rsquot have a single atom of Scottishness in my body.  Interestingly had this been the exact same scenario but my ancestors had hailed from a country where people\u0026rsquos skins were not what we call white, people may have viewed me differently. My accent could be the same. My depth of understanding of Scottish life, culture, history, and geography could be just the same, but somehow in the minds of many, though not all, I wouldn\u0026rsquot be really Scottish, or I\u0026rsquod be Scottish but only after they had thought about it. They wouldn\u0026rsquot think I\u0026rsquom what I\u0026rsquod call Scottish Scottish or Really Scottish.  It\u0026rsquos interesting that my Polish and Irish labels are rendered invisible by an accent and the colour of my skin.  Labels are useful and necessary but we have to be careful or they start to define us in narrow, exclusive terms. Labelling others is also useful and necessary, but the same caveat applies. Just like an axe is useful, we don\u0026rsquot want to just leave it lying around because it is potentially dangerous. Treat your labels and labelling with care.  What does it actually mean to be Scottish, British, European? This is an important question but as soon as it is raised it becomes loaded with political implications and suggestions. The very fact that I raise it as a theme in this column might cause all sorts of people to think I am trying to send a political message, that I\u0026rsquom a crypto-nationalist, a narrow-minded British unionist, or a Remainer.  We are all accidents of birth and circumstances. You who are a pro-Union Brit, or a pro-independence Scot, a pro-EU European, or an anti-EU European \u0026ndash or any other label you like to attach to yourself \u0026ndash could, with a simple twist of fate, have been Canadian, Spanish, Thai. And if so, you might view yourself as none of these labels. You might not even know or care about the seemingly trivial politics of Scotland, British and Europe. Your mind and political labelling would be focused elsewhere.  You are not who you think you are. These labels are all just conditioning, and the conditioning is just the result of pure chance. You didn\u0026rsquot choose your parents but you got your genes, which are like computer programmes, some set from conception at ON, others at READY but requiring life experiences to either switch them on or keep them switched off. Among these genes are ones which seem to deeply influence our political persuasion. So your dearly held national and political labels may be the result of nothing more than a bit of chemistry triggered by a couple of passing experiences.  This is easy to understand intellectually. You just need to read a credible book, check out the research and you get it. But at an inner level it\u0026rsquos an entirely different matter. Most of us are so deeply and emotionally embedded in our understanding of our sense of self, of what we are, and what we\u0026rsquore not, that what I am writing about here represents a profound, and seemingly threatening and dangerous, challenge to your deepest views about yourself. All of our views about ourselves are just a bunch of prejudices, a set of delusions created my that fascinating and mysterious combination of genes and chance life experiences. So, keep your labels if you feel you need them, but wear them very lightly, and don\u0026rsquot let them harm you or those around you. And enjoy what\u0026rsquos left of the World Cup."},{"url":null,"title":" quot Ordinary people doing extraordinary things quot   Meet the secret life of the circus","story":"              YESTERDAY this was a patch of grass. Now, somehow, a big top has appeared. It sits proudly, scattered with red stars, guy ropes pulled tight, surrounded by the lorries and caravans that house the entertainers and their acts clowns, acrobats and aerial artists. Alongside is a little wagon selling tickets, and if you follow the red carpet \u0026ndash twinkly fairly lights winsomely strung along its length \u0026ndash and the waft of candyfloss and sawdust, you\u0027ll find the entrance. Pull back the gold braided, red velvet curtains, and there is the circus ring. Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls ... it\u0027s showtime.  This summer, circus is celebrating its 250th year, marking the anniversary of showman, entrepreneur and equestrian rider Philip Astley\u0027s circus which took place in a 42 foot ring on an abandoned patch of ground near London\u0027s Waterloo back in 1768.  Fast forward to Zippo\u0027s Circus in 21st century Glasgow and you\u0027ll find that those early days are very much at the heart of this year\u0027s show. For Martin Burton, founder and director who has lived and breathed circus for over 40 years, it was crucial to pay homage to the past and celebrate the future in equal parts. This summer\u0027s offering, which opened in Glasgow this month and will now tour Scotland taking in Falkirk, Elgin and Wick, among other towns, starts with a nod to the past.  The \u0026lsquoCourier of St Petersburg\u0026rsquo trick, in which the rider straddles two horses, picking up the traces of others as they pass below until he\u0026rsquos driving a whole \u0026lsquoteam\u0026rsquo, was invented by Andrew Ducrow, who performed in Philip Astley\u0026rsquos troupe. The show also features the young sons \u0026ndash Maxim, four, and Charlie, six \u0026ndash of internationally renowned clowns Totti and Charlotte Alexis and ends with an acrobatic act by the next generation of daredevil circus family the Garcias, including Connor, 11, and Antonia, 15. Their parents, Vikki and Paulo, open the second half in a specially made prop rocket, which soars round the top of the ring while the pair perform jaw dropping aerial stunts.  \"When we booked the rocket act people thought that of course we would finish with that,\" says Burton. \"[But] I wanted to end by making a serious point about the future of the circus and that is all about the next generation. Looking at the talent of these kids, the future is bright.\"  Running a circus is no mean feat. On its UK tour Zippos will travel up to 6,000 miles, with 24 loads required to take the circus from one location to another. It takes the 15-strong technical crew six hours to rebuild the big top each time. Then there\u0027s the job of pulling in the punters. Burton admits last year was not a particularly strong one, but this year advance ticket sales are already up 35 per cent across Scotland.  Burton started as an outsider \u0026ndash or josser, as people who aren\u0027t born into circus families are known. He took a childhood passion further as a student and joined a mime troupe (in which David Bowie was briefly a member) before becoming a clown. Despite promises to his mother he\u0027d get \u0026ldquoa real job after three years, he never looked back. After an escape trick went wrong he spent a year in a burns unit and then set up Zippos as an all-human circus. Domestic animals \u0026ndash horses and budgies \u0026ndash were introduced later, he claims due to public demand.  Animal rights campaigners disagree vehemently, and Burton claims he and his family have received death threats. This year, activists handed out leaflets outside Zippos before opening performances, warning of poor treatment of the horses. Animal rights organisation One Kind, which campaigned hard to secure Scotland\u0027s ban on wild animals introduced in May, claims the circus is no place for domestic animals, where it says they are exploited in the name of entertainment.  Yet Tamerlan Khadikov, from Kazakhstan \u0026ndash who owns all six of the horses travelling with this year\u0027s show \u0026ndash and Martin Burton are adamant that if there were any welfare concerns whatsoever they would be closed down. Restrictions are tighter in the UK than elsewhere, insists Khadilkov, who will take the horses back to their base on his farm in the Czech Republic after the tour is over.  He claims never to have slept in a house \u0026ldquoapart from a few nights in a hotel and last had a break from tour about three or four years ago. \u0026ldquoThe great thing about this life is when you want to see another country you just find a circus that tours there and get a contract, he says. \u0026ldquoIf I\u0027m more than a certain time in one place I get nervous.  Veteran ringmaster Norman Barrett, now 83, who refuses to sit down wearing his costume (it\u0027s one of many circus superstitions), explains. \u0026ldquoWhatever we do in this crazy life of ours, and it\u0027s a wonderful life, we are all doing it from our hearts. This is our life. It\u0027s not a job. Our whole day centres around what we are going to do in that ring at showtime. Cut circus people open, he says, and it\u0027s sawdust, not blood, you\u0027ll find. His father was a farmer who loved the circus so much he set up a ring in the barn, trained the horses and eventually went professional. Barrett was born in 1935 and remembers his father touring London in wartime.  So what is the future of the circus? \"It will always be there, says Barrett emphatically. Alexis hedges: \"It will change of course, it will adapt ... Barrett jumps in: \"Well, that\u0027s good, is it not? We want it to change.  \u0026ldquoCircus is evolving, agrees Pablo Garcia, who is helping his sons with their daily training. \u0026ldquoThere\u0027s different types and a lot of variety shows. But I think circus has got a bright future. We\u0027ve certainly never been short of work and hopefully they, he signals to the boys, \u0026ldquowill have the same experience.  None of this family can imagine any other life. Pablo\u0027s mother\u0027s connections go back generations while his father arrived in Scotland as a refugee from the Spanish civil war and was circus trained by an uncle. His wife, Vikki, comes from the famous Pinder family who owned both circuses and fairgrounds for more than seven generations, and are old hands at dealing with change.  John Haze, director of the Moscow State Circus and Circus of Horrors, says the galloping pace of development in recent decades has been thrilling. Yet it\u0027s not been easy in recent years, with many people constrained by austerity. \"Luckily the [film] Greatest Showman came knocking,\" he says. \"It has been a shot in the arm for the circus. And the circus just keeps on re-inventing itself. It\u0027s more diverse than ever.  Street performances, festivals, west end shows ... circus is now everywhere according to Professor Vanessa Toulmin, a researcher in circus and fairground history from Sheffield University. She tells stories of the original circus buildings \u0026ndash Hengler\u0027s Circus in Sauchiehall Street was one of the best in the UK \u0026ndash of groundbreaking women trapeze artists and of an incredible art form that soared from its illegitimate roots (it needed no planning or licence unlike stage shows) to become the darling of the establishment \u0026ndash Queen Victoria was a big fan. And 250 years later its appeal endures. \"I think it\u0027s the romance that still draws people in, says Toulmin. \"Performers travel the world, they see amazing things. But they are ordinary people. Ordinary people doing extraordinary things."},{"url":null,"title":"Former spokesman for the Defend Tommy Sheridan campaign hired by Scottish Labour","story":"              A POET who believes perjurer Tommy Sheridan was the victim of a conspiracy has been hired by Scottish Labour as one of the party\u0026rsquos new community organisers.  Jim Monaghan, who was the spokesman for the Defend Tommy Sheridan Campaign, will be paid around \u0026pound30,000 a year to help build a \u0026ldquosustainable coalition for \u0026ldquosocial change.  However, a senior party source blasted the move, saying: \u0026ldquoThis is an absolutely staggering decision that has stunned the party. Jim Monaghan is a wild conspiracy theorist who has defended convicted perjurer Tommy Sheridan. Organisers are among the most vital party staff members, in charge of local campaigning operations and responsible for speaking directly to voters. This is like the SNP putting the cybernats in charge of door knocking. It\u0026rsquos utterly bewildering.  Labour advertised for seven organiser posts in February, three of which were to be based north of the border.  The job advert stated that successful applicants should have the ability to work with a \u0026ldquovariety of stakeholders and Monaghan landed one of the jobs. However, he has had strong ties to Sheridan, who is considered to be a toxic figure on the left.  The former Glasgow MSP, who used to lead the Scottish Socialist Party, won a \u0026pound200,000 defamation case against the now-defunct News of the World in 2006 amid claims he was an adulterer and swinger.  Conflicting evidence led to a police investigation and Sheridan was charged with perjury, after which a lengthy criminal trial took place in 2010. Monaghan was a defence witness in the trial.  A jury found Sheridan guilty of perjury, part of which explicitly related to a trip Sheridan and others made to a sex club in Manchester.  BBC footage on the day of Sheridan\u0026rsquos sentencing showed Monaghan clapping the former MSP as he walked to court. He had also previously carried out paid work for Sheridan\u0026rsquos then solicitor.  Monaghan was also a volunteer on the campaign to \u0026ldquodefend the politician and planned a book - A Parcel o\u0027 Rogues: The Tommy Sheridan Conspiracy - which he later abandoned.  He also acted as \u0026ldquonational press and media spokesperson for Solidarity - the party Sheridan helped form after quitting the SSP - before joining Labour in 2010.  Monaghan wrote at the time: \u0026ldquoObviously, there is a long and hard battle within Labour and it isn\u0026rsquot one that will even take place, never mind be decided, in the context of the current leadership election. I am confident that, for at least the next few years, it is best for me and for my community that I work within the Labour party.  In December, the Sunday Herald revealed that Monaghan was one of the warm up acts at a Labour event attended by UK and Scottish leaders Jeremy Corbyn and Richard Leonard. He read poetry on the night.  Asked last year if he still believed Sheridan was the victim of a conspiracy, Monaghan said: \u0026ldquoYes, absolutely.  Monaghan\u0026rsquos Facebook page stated that he started a \u0026ldquonew job as a community organiser on June 18.  In 2016, the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission (SCCRC) - the official body that considers potential miscarriages of justice - declined to refer Sheridan\u0027s case to the High Court.  Sheridan pursued a judicial review of SCCRC decision, but it emerged last week that this latest legal bid had failed.  A Scottish Labour spokesperson said: \"We don\u0027t comment on staff.\""},{"url":null,"title":"Council workers blast degrading pay offer","story":"              COUNCIL bosses on six figure salaries are to pocket \u0026pound1,000 more than cleaners, carers and refuse workers, a new report says.  Chief executives are each to get an annual flat rate increase of \u0026pound1,600 in the pay deal for Scotland\u0027s councils.  However, lower paid workers offered a 3 per cent rise are in line for just \u0026pound600 extra, it was claimed.  The \"disparity\" was highlighted in new findings published by the GMB union.  GMB officials say finance secretary Derek Mackay told them in negotiations that the deal gave council workers equal value.  However, the Sunday Herald spoke to home helps, refuse workers and janitors, who said the offer was worth just a few pounds a week to them.  Last night, staff said the deal was an \"insult\" and \"degrading\" to them.  The GMB said the biggest cash lift goes to well paid executives rather than workers who have had a decade at the \"coal face of austerity\".  Nearly all Scotland\u0027s 32 local authority chief executives \u0026ndash all of whom are to get a \u0026pound1,600 flat rate increase - are on annual six figure salaries.  Under the pay deal, the \u0026pound1,600 flat rate is paid to all those on salaries over \u0026pound80,000.  There is a 2 per cent offer for all employees earning \u0026pound36,501 - \u0026pound80,000.  Workers earning less than \u0026pound36,500 get 3 per cent under the deal.  However, the GMB said it was worth just a few pounds a week to most of its staff in the 3 per cent bracket.  Last week, nearly 30,000 workers rejected the offer forward by local government body Cosla by a 92 per cent to 8 per cent margin.  The GMB has notified Cosla and the Scottish Government of the rejection of the deal,  Union officials say the dispute could spark a wave of summer strikes.  GMB Scotland senior organiser Drew Duffy said: \"They (workers) have been living and working at the coal face of austerity for the last decade, enduring freezes and real-terms cuts to their pay and conditions.  \"It is offensive to them when the finance secretary says this offer treats local government staff with \"equal value\".  Meanwhile, home helps, refuse workers and janitors said the 3 per cent pay offer was derisory.  Speaking on condition of anonymity, staff savaged the deal.  A female home help, who has worked in Glasgow for 20 years, said she was paid between \u0026pound17,000 and \u0026pound18,000 a year.  Under the 3 per cent offer, she said any increase would be less than \u0026pound10 a week.  She said: \"What we\u0027ve been offered is an insult and it\u0027s degrading.  \"Being a home help is such a wide ranging job and it\u0027s not simply caring for someone at home.  \"You are not just making someone a cup of tea, you are making sure that they are clean and that they are not lonely.  \"Yet what we\u0027re getting offered is just a few pounds a week.  \"It makes life difficult and a lot of the girls have to take on second jobs.\"  A rubbish collection worker in Midlothian said he had lost \u0026pound11,000 due to a decade of austerity and pay restraint.  The worker, who has been in post for 19 years and is on a salary of \u0026pound22,500, said the deal was \"blatantly unfair\".  He said a fairer deal would be for the lowest paid to get the \u0026pound1,600 flat rate, while chief executives get a capped sum of about \u0026pound250.  \"The 3 per cent increase is making no impact at all,\" he said.  He added: \"We\u0027ve lost \u0026pound11,000 in the last 10 years of austerity, so 3 per cent is nothing.  \"It\u0027s been happening year in year out. It\u0027s penny pinching by the government.\"  Another council worker said pay restraint meant she had been forced to go without holidays.  The woman, a security assistant in Aberdeen on annual pay of \u0026pound20,000, said she would be just a few pounds better off under the deal.  She said: \"For the past 10 years we\u0027ve had to accept low pay while the cost of living goes up higher than that.  \"Council rent also goes up and it\u0027s a real struggle to survive on the cash you are on.  \"With holidays if I scrimped and saved, I might get a week\u0027s holiday and I did last year, but not this year.\"  The security worker said the pay hikes for chief executives should be clawed back and redistributed among lower paid workers.  She said: \"They are not having any hardship and there is question of do they really need that.\"  A janitor who has worked in North Lanarkshire for 19 years said she would get just a few extra pounds on added to her \u0026pound21,000 salary under the deal.  She said: \"The pay gap has got ridiculously big.  \"There are a lot of people working who still can\u0027t feed their kids.\"  In response, a Scottish Government spokesman said: \u0026ldquoPay for local government employees, other than teachers, is negotiated between the unions and Cosla and the Scottish Government is not part of that process.  Cosla\u0027s resources spokeswoman Gail Macgregor added: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos the role of any trade union to seek to improve the terms and conditions of their members and I entirely get that, however, councils have to operate within the budget available to them."},{"url":null,"title":"Call to allow MSPs annual access visits to Dungavel detention centre","story":"              THE UK Government is facing a call to allow MSPs to make annual visits to the controversial Dungavel immigration centre.  Campaigners say the ban on MSPs visiting the holding centre in South Lanarkshire should be lifted, but the Home Office says that visits are generally only for MPs due to immigration being a policy area that is reserved to Westminster.  However, Glasgow MSP Pauline McNeill has said that the rule should be scrapped and MSPs should be allowed to check on the welfare of detainees.  She said that all MSPs should be able to make an annual visit in light of concerns that have been raised over the conditions and treatment of inmates.  \u0026ldquoMSP\u0026rsquos must be allowed access to witness the conditions in which people being detained in this country are being held,\" she said.  \"I\u0026rsquom calling for Members of the Scottish Parliament to be granted access to the site on an annual basis.  \"Members of the Scottish Parliament must be able to satisfy themselves that the welfare and health needs of the people being detained are being attended to.  \"By visiting the centre members would be fulfilling the normal duties and rights of elected members in any democracy.\"  Critics of UK immigration policy have expressed concerns about the length of time asylum seekers are held at Dungavel.  Reports on Dungavel have shown that dozens of detainees have been held at the facility for months at a time, and in some instances, for over a year.  The Sunday Herald previously spoke to former detainees, who claimed vulnerable people were held in prison like conditions at the site.  McNeill said Scottish Secretary David Mundell should use his influence to get the Home Office to lift the ban.  She added: \u0026ldquoI have serious concerns not only about the way the site is being run, but also by the attitude the UK Government is taking in regards to this issue.  \"I myself had to write to David Mundell on a number of occasions before receiving a response.  \"I am calling on David Mundell to support me in seeking annual visits for Members of the Scottish Parliament.  \"It is not acceptable that the concerns of Members of the Scottish Parliament about the treatment of people from the communities we represent are being ignored.  Meanwhile, SNP MPs Stuart McDonald and Joanna Cherry are to be allowed to visit Dungavel after demanding access.  McDonald, the SNP\u0026rsquos spokesman on immigration, asylum and border control, and Cherry, the party\u0027s justice and home affairs spokeswoman, wrote to the Home Office asking for permission.  McDonald said a date had yet to be set for a visit.  However, he said MSPs should also be allowed to check on the welfare of detainees, as he backed McNeill\u0027s call.  He said: \"The Home Office has a pretty bad record on this. It (Dungavel) should be open to all.\"  In response, a Home Office spokesman said: \"Individuals or organisations who do not have a statutory right of access and who wish to view an immigration removal centre are required under the provisions of the detention centre rules 2001 to obtain the permission of the Secretary of State.  \u0026ldquoRequests to visit are carefully considered to preserve the privacy and dignity of the individuals detained and to avoid a disproportionate number of visits."},{"url":null,"title":"Scotland well placed for PIP powers says minister","story":"              THIS week the MS Society launched their report \u0026lsquoPIP: A step too far\u0026rsquo which outlined the impact of the \u0026lsquo20 metre rule\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash the rule that bars anyone who can walk that distance unaided from receiving the enhanced rate of PIP \u0026ndash has had on those living with multiple sclerosis.  They found large numbers of those reassessed from DLA to PIP had lost that higher rate of support, with three quarters of those affected saying that the change had had a negative impact on their life.  This is the latest in a series of examples where people living with a debilitating health condition have been let down by the UK Government.  In February this year, the House of Commons Work and Pensions Select Committee published a damning report, along with a series of recommendations, about the assessment processes of the UK Government\u0026rsquos Personal Independent Payment (PIP) and Employment and Support Allowance (ESA).  These are recommendations for the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) to respond to by halting the roll-out of PIP to allow them to make serious changes \u0026ndash something we have called for consistently.  And, whilst ESA remains a reserved benefit the Scottish Government cannot change, I have taken a particular interest in the Committee\u0026rsquos recommendations on PIP as, by the end of this Parliamentary term in 2021, we will have taken over responsibility from the DWP for 11 benefits, including PIP. I am reassured that so many of the recommendations reflect what we are already doing in Scotland.  This government is clear that social security is a human right and one that people should be able to access in a way that treats them with dignity and respect. This principle is so important it is enshrined on the very first page of our new Social Security (Scotland) Act.  There is a noticeable common thread that runs through the House of Commons Committee\u0026rsquos recommendations, which is that the current system places significant and undue stress on people, through unclear communications, appearing to require the repeated provision of evidence and \u0026lsquohealth\u0026rsquo assessments that seem ill suited to understanding fluctuating conditions amongst others.  This is exactly what we have heard through our own engagement with our Experience Panels - 2,400 people with personal and direct experience of the current system. Our new social security agency \u0026ndash Social Security Scotland \u0026ndash is being co-designed using that experience and knowledge, and that of our stakeholder reference groups and user research. We are determined to design and build systems and processes that work for people, not against them.  For example, we have held a forum with people to understand the issues with the current DWP application process and in particular the self-assessment form so that we can make the improvements people need.  We will ensure that all information is accessible and we are also developing an online route for applications, as well as Easy-Read and other accessible formats.  We are committed to ensuring that people are offered a choice of ways to apply for disability benefits, including in person, online, paper and telephone.  We are continuing to test these with people who receive benefits to explore what other communication channels we should provide.  I understand the stress and anxiety that can accompany current DWP face-to-face assessments. And an important commitment that I am making to people in Scotland is that we will reduce these as much as possible. Our Act specifically states that face to face assessments will only be held if necessary and crucially will never be with a private contractor.  Key to this is ensuring that we gather appropriate evidence at the initial stage.  The person applying clearly knows best what they need but we are also exploring the range of health, social care and other evidence that could be used to support quality decision making, significantly reduce the need for face-to-face assessments and increase the number of lifetime and genuinely long-term awards.  We will take into account the needs of the individual to determine whether a home visit is needed, and people will be entitled to have someone with them to give support every step of the way.  And anyone who, because of a disability, finds it difficult to engage fully with us, will have the right to independent advocacy support.  Through our work we will meet all of the Work and Pension Select Committee\u0026rsquos recommendations on what should be done, where we have the powers to do so.  The chance to create something different in Scotland is there. The chance to introduce a greater level of compassion and respect into our country\u0026rsquos social security service is one we fully intend to take."},{"url":null,"title":"Citizens Advice Scotland comment  Decision-makers should experience the reality of debt before making financial policy","story":"              Earlier this month Andy Haldane, chief economist of the Bank of England, gave a talk at TedX in Glasgow entitled \"Putting the public back in public institutions\". Echoing an opinion piece he\u0026rsquod written in The Herald a few days earlier, his theme was that members of the public should have more input into the thought processes of the bank\u0026rsquos monetary committee, as he wanted to ensure that the decisions they make reflect the real experience of people across the UK.  It\u0026rsquos a fine objective, and Mr Haldane is an entertaining speaker. His address was amusing and thoughtful, and he clearly has a passion for the subject.  We were a little surprised, therefore, when he voted last week to increase interest rates \u0026ndash something that will have a harmful impact on millions of people across the country. Not least those who are in debt.  The Scottish Citizens Advice network sees people every day who are drowning in debt, and struggling to get by. Last year nearly 36,000 sought our advice, and many of these were people with multiple debts.  Nor is this just a crisis for people who come to us. A recent survey we commissioned of the general public in Scotland found that one in five Scots finds it difficult to cope financially. The same proportion say they always or almost always run out of money before payday. A further 21% say this sometimes happens.  In the last year, 15% of Scots had been turned down for credit, and for more than two-thirds of these people the reason was a poor credit rating. Nearly a third (31%) had been told they weren\u0026rsquot earning enough and 25% that they had too much debt already.  So much for the statistics. What\u0026rsquos it actually like being in debt with no realistic hope of getting out of it?  Any CAB adviser hears the same litany from their clients every day: the sleepless nights, the shame of sending your kids to school in old clothes, or standing in the supermarket waiting for the discount shelves to be filled. The stigma of the walk to the foodbank, the ever-growing piles of unpaid bills, pretending not to be in when the doorbell rings, wondering how you can ever square your debts when you\u0026rsquore already having to choose between eating and heating. These are the people who will be hit hardest by interest rate rises, and whose voices are least often heard.  Of course monetary policy should not become entirely directed by opinion polls or even focus groups. There is a reason why the Bank of England is independent of political control. These decisions must be made in the interests of the whole economy, and that means tough decisions at times made by experts with an eye towards the future and not just the present.  But we welcome Mr Haldane\u0026rsquos commitment to learning more about the lived experience of everyday people. In that spirit, I suggest he undertake a series of visits to the CAB service, starting here in Scotland where he could sit in on some debt advice sessions (with the client\u0026rsquos permission of course). His invitation is in the post.  Derek Mitchell is chief executive of Citizens Advice Scotland."},{"url":null,"title":"Former UK minister says Tory Brexit plans are a    land grab of epic proportions   ","story":"              FORMER UK Labour cabinet minister Andrew Adonis says that the Tory government\u0026rsquos Brexit bill is a \u0026ldquoland grab of epic proportions from Scotland.  Adonis, an influential Labour peer, said that \u0026ldquoBritain is appallingly economically and politically imbalanced.  After the transfer of powers from Brussels to Whitehall and Westminster, London will take charge of policy areas traditionally devolved to Holyrood.  The SNP has said that means demolishing the principle at the heart of the devolution settlement by giving Westminster the final say on many devolved policy areas, and Adonis warned that the UK Government\u0027s plans showed how \"centralised\" Britain would become after leaving the EU.  The former UK transport secretary said: \u0026ldquoPowers that were devolved to Holyrood and Cardiff, via the EU, are being seized by central government.  \"It is a land grab of epic proportions and demonstrates just how centralised this country will become after Brexit.  Adonis added: \"The truth is that Britain is appallingly economically and politically imbalanced.  \"This was one of the causes of the Brexit vote and, ironically, it will get worse if Brexit happens.\"  The UK wants to retain control over 24 devolved areas, most related to agriculture, fisheries and the environment, for up to seven years.  SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford welcomed the intervention from Adonis.  Blackford said: \u0027\u0027There can be no business as usual whilst the power grab is in place, powers removed from the Scottish Parliament, undermining devolution.  \"The UK Government must bring forward legislation that respects devolution, the Scottish Parliament and the people of Scotland.\u0027\u0027  However, in response a UK Government spokeswoman said: \u0026ldquoWe are committed to securing a deal that works for the entire United Kingdom.  \"The outcome of leaving the EU will be a significant increase in the decision making power of each devolved administration.\""},{"url":null,"title":"The Big Read  How Italian society lurched to the right and why it must exorcise its historical demons","story":"              The contentious decision made by the freshly-installed Italian government to deny port access to a rescue ship with 629 migrants on board created an earthquake in public opinion both in Europe and within Italy itself.  The plot developed as follows: the Italian interior and infrastructure ministers, Matteo Salvini and Danilo Toninelli - both in their first month in office - refused to allow passengers on the humanitarian vessel Aquarius to disembark on Italian land earlier this month.  The ship, run by NGO SOS M\u0026eacutediterran\u0026eacutee and charity Doctors Without Borders, had been sailing in international waters off Libya for hours after having taken in hundreds of migrants from collapsing rafts, and others previously rescued by the Italian Coast Guard and Navy. Their request to dock was eventually refused by the coast guard head office in Rome, as well as by authorities in nearby Malta.  The Italian government steadily settled on its position it called for more action from other European countries, and claimed they failed in their duties to help manage the situation, leaving southern countries alone to deal with the emergency.  After hours of uncertainty and with passengers becoming increasingly exhausted - among them were 123 minors and seven pregnant women, some with serious fuel burns according to the volunteers \u0026ndash the tug-of-war ended up when Spain\u0026rsquos new prime minister, Pedro S\u0026aacutenchez, offered a safe harbour to Aquarius in Valencia.  Despite the length of the journey, partly caused by the vessel having to combat poor weather conditions, it arrived safely in the port of Valencia last Sunday morning, after spending a week at sea. The passengers will be allowed to stay on Spanish soil for 45 days before starting legal procedures to obtain refugee status.  The docking of Aquarius was welcomed by many who gathered in the port of Valencia. Nevertheless, the event was not not immune to protests, with groups of locals rallying against the new Spanish government\u0026rsquos decision.  The episode caused international havoc, including a steep deterioration in relations between Italy and its neighbouring countries after French President Emmanuel Macron described Italy\u0026rsquos actions as \u0026ldquorevolting. However, France has also been strongly criticised for its harsh border policies, with reported violent clashes between the French patrolling forces in the focal points of Ventimiglia and Bardonecchia.  On the other hand, countries such as Austria and Hungary - both led by far-right, anti-European parties - praised the Italian stance, while German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Italy should not be left alone in handling the migratory flow.  All of this represents a turning point in Italian politics that reflects how a country known for its welcoming spirit has deeply changed in recent decades, culminating with the rise to power of the far-right.  Italy and the politics of rhetoric  The surge of widespread anti-European feeling in a country that was among the founders of what we now call the European Union, is no last-minute occurrence and was not ignited uniquely by the migratory boom.  Public sentiment has been building up in the last three decades and is strictly intertwined with the complex socio-economic and political framework the Italians have been experiencing throughout the period.  Even before the financial crisis began in 2008, there was a progressive deterioration of Italian life conditions due to strict budgetary policies which had been followed by both left wing and right wing governments.  The impact of this somewhat austere attitude has, however, to be seen in the context of the structural malfunction of the state within the country: together with an intrinsic corruption concentrated both on local and national level, this has clogged the economic system in Italy, which has had profound consequences on the welfare state. This was reflective of a worsening of life conditions, especially among the poorest tiers of the population: 29 per cent of people who lost their jobs in the aftermath of the crisis where already among the poorest fifth of the population, hitting hard working-class families particularly hard.  Employment rates, although now recovering after the crisis, weigh like a sword of Damocles on the economic revival, especially because of how badly affected young people are. Youth unemployment rates reached a peak of more than 44 per cent in August 2014 and have now settled at around 21 per cent. In this period, people between the ages of 15 and 34 have often been forced to leave the country to pursue better opportunities, creating a vicious loop that keeps preventing the expansion of the economy in Italy. Over-65s now account for over 22 per cent of the total population, the highest rate in the EU (in the UK it is 18 per cent).  Many Italians attribute much of this grim situation to the switch from local currency - the Italian Lira - to the Euro. What appeared in front of our eyes was that prices everywhere doubled, without any change to salaries. Many people in their mid-twenties or thirties who, like me, experienced the introduction of the Euro as kids in 2002, would recall that the price of the much beloved Goleador candies went from 100 Lire, which was the equivalent of \u0026euro0.05, to \u0026euro0.10, which was a hard hit to our weekly pocket money.  The switch deeply affected the Italian mindset towards Europe, even if figures later suggested that its actual impact was somewhat different to the perception: inflation annual rates kept on average at around two per cent in the period between 2002 and 2015 (with peaks of 3.5 per cent in 2008), and at the same time prices went up by about 31 per cent between 2001 and 2016. Decline was a gradual process which other global factors had contributed to, rather than a sudden twist as a result of the Euro alone.  Then came the financial crisis, which was a global earthquake but from which, given the preexisting structural problems, Italy struggled particularly hard to emerge from. A new wave of restrictive policies, emanated by the European Union, did not play in favour of the already difficult economic context in the country.  After that came the migrant crisis. Positioned right in the middle of the Mediterranean Sea, Italy had offered a pier for migrants way before the 2000s. Immigration coming from African former colonies - such as Libya and Eritrea - was already common in the 1970s, and there was a boom of migrants from Albania in 1991 after the fall of the communist bloc.  However, with the outbreak of the Arab springs in 2010 and the following conflict in Syria, more and more people started fleeing their homes, often leaving from the shores of Northern Africa. The arrivals then weighed mainly on the Mediterranean frontiers of Italy, Spain, Greece and Malta - all of which were already on their knees after the financial crisis.  The increasing numbers of people seemed to jeopardize the social fabric all over the country. In some areas, the lack of a solid integration system was exploited by organised criminality, which could suck in a huge amount of cheap, unregulated workforce into its web, as revealed by many investigations carried out in the last few years.  In any case, the problem of people entering the country without the tools to access the work market \u0026ndash which was already saturated after the crisis - created a further layer of poverty, as well as the feeling that migrants either were criminals or were there to steal jobs.  All of this was an explosive mix for a country in which, unlike Germany, part of the population still had not come to terms with its own historical past. Italy has never fully exorcised the ghosts of the fascist era: although very rarely engaging in explicit expressions, it was not rare to hear older generations praising some of Mussolini\u0026rsquos deeds \u0026ldquoback then. The lack of strong leadership in recent times has left people hungry for a strong character, which we now see in Salvini, who has reinvented himself as \u0026ldquoThe Captain, as his followers call him.  Added to this is a strong campaign against the so-called \u0026ldquoIslamic invasion, reinforced by the climate created by the many terrorist attacks in Europe in recent years, and the emergence of a battle based on the contrast of cultural values and traditions. In this picture the Italian people are good, and they are up against the bad migrants. The latter, according to far-right rhetoric, don\u0026rsquot embrace local culture and instead expect locals to adapt to their values, while creating large pools of criminality.  The left parties which led the country in the last decade appeared unable to overcome these social difficulties and to become an effective mediator between the different peoples living on Italian soil.  Now, the Northern League is reaping the rewards after years of campaigning against what they call \u0026ldquoinvasion and channelling the frustration created by the economic crisis through a communication strategy based on loudly shouted slogans - from \u0026ldquoItalians first to \u0026ldquoclose the ports.  Such hostility used to be reserved to the southern regions of the country. In fact, one of the League\u0026rsquos founding motives was the separation of northern Italy from the south: an area where the economy struggled due to a lack of attention from the state. This enabled the surge of the mafia historically, and it presented a very different landscape to the north. The latter was industrialized and attracted people from the south who would migrate in search of work and better lifestyles. Times have changed, but this division is still present and, therefore, the first battles of the League were against its own migrants.  However, in recent times it has left behind this ancestral antagonism and made national identity and a focus on Italian people\u0026rsquos needs in opposition to the needs of immigrants its new leading force.  Many voters subscribed to this new message, although it failed in the last election to prevent the Five Star Movement becoming the first party in the south.  By focusing their campaigns on easily accessible channels like social media and riding the increasing popularity of such tools as the only information sources people rely on, the parties have hit the right spot in the locals\u0026rsquo minds and gathered consent from new layers of society.  It is a largely shared opinion that Europe, too, has its own share of responsibility for the fragmentation emerging: the lack of political and legal uniformity, not only concerning migrants, has resulted in a political alienation in which Italy perceived itself to be left abandoned.  Sergio Belardinelli, professor of cultural processes sociology at University of Bologna, says the crisis in attitudes has been a long time in the making: \u0026ldquoThe immigration phenomenon was taken very lightheartedly ages ago, and this is probably due to the Italian left as well as a certain part of the Catholic world.  \u0026ldquoThis allowed the right-wing parties to fan the flames, resulting in what happens today and what we see in the roughness of the solutions proposed by the far-right parties.  \u0026ldquoThis is strongly related to the cultural crisis that has been affecting Europe for a long time and to the voiding of concepts such as identity: The European identity was characterised by an inclusive approach which embraced diversity.  This is losing importance, according to Belardinelli, whereas national identities are being politically weaponised. Furthering the European ideal of national identity being defined by openness and inclusivity is now very difficult.  CONCLUSION  On June 28 a summit will be held in Brussels to discuss the new terms under which the European Union will deal with incoming migrant arrivals, and with the possible reformulation of the Dublin agreement.  However, although Italy has tried to force other members to open up and share responsibilities, the leading forces seem even more eager to keep their frontiers shut. What European leaders are doing now is extremely dangerous as this will only further exacerbate the resentment of people living in the arrival countries and, with Poland expressing its desire for a \u0026ldquoPolexit, could be a gift for those who want to see the Union disrupted.  Nevertheless, Italy is at a crossroads at the moment. Many voices have risen on social media to oppose the government\u0026rsquos new approach on migration, and a wave of fact-checking websites have joined the choir attempting to halt widespread myths on immigration and other related topics. Public personalities from the left, such as Gomorrah writer Roberto Saviano, recently participated in a public campaign against Salvini.  However, it has had little effect on moving public opinion one way or the other. There is a general mistrust towards the left. Besides being extremely divided in its opposition, it seems to have failed to connect with people, and it underestimated the magnitude of public dissatisfaction. It follows a similar storyline to Brexit and Trump: it looked like they were miles away from happening, but eventually they arrived.  Euroscepticism does not look like it will exhaust its arguments soon, and it finds itself now in a popularity peak phase. Before this widespread rage passes, Italy will have to overcome its internal issues and get out of its economic impasse - which is, at the moment, an enormous task.  On the other hand, this wave of hatred and anger could one day be looked back on as a phase, a swansong after a mountain of issues had been building. However, it has not to be underestimated nor ridiculed, as it represents the present we are living at the moment.  Main parties after general elections on March 4  Right  ? The Northern League (Lega Nord) - Leader: Matteo Salvini (17%)  The League is a far-right party with strong nationalist, anti-immigration views and independence aspirations (first from the rest of Italy and, now, from Europe). With Salvini and his strong, aggressive attitude, the party went from a minority to being the leading voice in the new government.  ? Forza Italia \u0026ndash Leader: Silvio Berlusconi (14%)  The party led by former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi went from being the leader within the Italian right to a strong, yet subordinate, voice to Salvini\u0026rsquos. Far more moderate in tone, it represents the conservatives in the country.  ? Five Star Movement (M5S) \u0026ndash Leader: Luigi di Maio (32%)  The movement founded by comedian Beppe Grillo was conceived as a protest against the main arty system in Italy and aimed to be an independent voice in direct connection with Italian citizens (the main decisions are taken through a web portal by popular vote).  Left  ? Partito Democratico (Democratic Party) \u0026ndash Leader: Matteo Renzi (18%)  The majority party in the last few years, it progressively lost consensus in favour of the right wing coalition led by Salvini and Berlusconi. It represents the moderate left wing.  After the Election  As none of the parties or coalitions went over the threshold of 40 per cent, the majority required to form the government, and weeks passed with the winning parties unable to conclude a deal, Italian President Sergio Mattarella assigned the role of prime minister to Giuseppe Conte, an independent, with a government formed by Northern League and Five Star Movement representatives. Salvini was appointed Home Secretary whereas Di Maio has become the new Minister for Economic Development."},{"url":null,"title":"SNP says UK economy lagging behind other EU nations","story":"              THE UK\u0027s economy is lagging behind smaller independent nations such as Austria, Ireland, Norway and Denmark, the SNP says.  Scotland\u0027s GDP would surge if Holyrood had the same powers as parliaments in other small independent countries, the party said.  The SNP highlighted analysis published by the independent Scottish Parliament Information Centre (SPICE).  Figures from SPICE researchers showed Scottish GDP could match countries such as Austria, Ireland, Norway and Denmark, the SNP said.  Matching Irish growth over the same period would result in a \u0026pound30 billion economic boom, while keeping pace with Norway would boost Scotland\u0026rsquos economy by up to \u0026pound12 billion \u0026ndash with a \u0026pound10.4 billion increase by matching Denmark, and \u0026pound9.7 billion by matching Austria, the party claimed.  The findings were published after the SNP\u0027s Growth Commission stated that small independent countries have consistently outperformed larger economies by 0.7 per cent on average.  SNP MSP Ivan McKee said the SPICE research backed up the commission\u0027s findings.  He said: \u0026ldquoThis new independent analysis is incredibly revealing \u0026ndash it is clearer than ever that Westminster is holding back Scotland\u0026rsquos economic potential.  \u0026ldquoJust by matching the modest growth forecasts of small independent countries such as Norway, Denmark and Austria, Scotland could receive a significantly greater economic boost compared to continuing to follow the UK\u0026rsquos failed London centric economic model.  \u0026ldquoScotland must show the ambition and innovation that other independent countries have if we are to catch up with them and grow our own economy \u0026ndash and the Sustainable Growth Commission\u0026rsquos report makes a clear case for how we can achieve this over the coming decades.  \u0026ldquoIt is increasingly clear that only with the powers of independence can Scotland do what is needed to boost our economy, improve living standards and create the kind of nation we all want to live in.  However, Scottish Labour\u0027s economy spokeswoman Jackie Baillie blasted the SNP\u0027s blueprint for the economy as a recipe for continued austerity.  Baillie said: \u0026ldquoUnder the SNP, growth is struggling behind the rest of the UK and other small European countries, wages are stagnant and productivity is flat lining.  \u0026ldquoThis month\u0026rsquos Institute for Fiscal Studies report delivered a damming critique of the Nationalists\u0026rsquo blueprint for separation and confirmed that the SNP\u0026rsquos cuts commission would mean a \u0026lsquocontinuation of austerity\u0026rsquo.  \"It is increasingly clear that the SNP government remains in denial about its mismanagement of our economy and is also content simply to try and blame Westminster for all of Scotland\u0026rsquos economic woes.  \u0026ldquoThat is simply not good enough.  \u0026ldquoIn contrast, Labour\u0026rsquos plans would mean a decade of investment for Scotland.  \"We are the only party with an industrial strategy that sets out a plan to create decent jobs and grow the economy so it works for the many, not the few.  Scottish Conservative finance spokesman Murdo Fraser added: \u0026ldquoThis is the utter nonsense we\u0026rsquove come to expect from the SNP.  \u0026ldquoAs we know from their own blueprint for independence, a separate Scotland would be forced to instigate austerity max just to get the economy on an even keel.  \u0026ldquoAnd under their stewardship the Scottish economy has continued to lag behind the rest of the UK.  \u0026ldquoHolyrood already has a number of levers at their disposal to grow the economy \u0026ndash the fact is that this SNP Government is not using them."},{"url":null,"title":"Nicola Sturgeon poised to unveil dramatic cabinet reshuffle this Tuesday","story":"              SPECULATION is mounting that Nicola Sturgeon will carry out a reshuffle this week amid reports that a number of senior ministers are leaving the government.  Last night, three SNP insiders told the Sunday Herald that Sturgeon is poised to unveil drastic changes to her cabinet on Tuesday.  Sources close to the First Minister\u0027s office suggested that Sturgeon has no plans to change her ministerial team, but stopped short of a denial.  The Scottish Government refused to issue a formal statement, when asked about the reports.  However, there was growing speculation at Holyrood that a number of long serving ministers will be sacked, quit or moved sideways this Tuesday.  Sturgeon is said to want to inject new blood into her frontbench team, with promotions for rising stars from the intake of SNP MSPs elected for the first time in 2016.  The First Minister is expected to promote more women MSPs in a bid to improve gender balance in her government.  There were reports that Sturgeon will create new ministerial posts in a shake-up that a source said would \"extend her empire\".  However, a number of senior cabinet secretaries are understood to be vulnerable.  Fiona Hyslop, the Cabinet Secretary for Culture, Tourism and External Affairs, was mentioned by an SNP source as a figure who \"could be at risk\" after over 11 years in government.  Health Secretary Shona Robison is also facing the prospect of a \"sideways move\" another senior party insider predicted.  Sturgeon has faced repeated calls to sack Robison over her performance in a key brief.  NHS Tayside, which serves Robison\u0027s local patch in Dundee, is in crisis, and she is also dealing with criticism over GP recruitment and waiting times for ambulances.  Social Security Minister Jeane Freeman, who is well regarded by SNP backbenchers and is thought to have fared well as a junior minister, has been touted as a possible replacement for Robison in health.  A source said Freeman was \"within reach of a significant promotion\".  However, another senior SNP source said that Justice Secretary Michael Matheson may be moved to health after \"doing a shift\" in his current role.  There was also speculation that Transport Minister Humza Yousaf could be elevated to the cabinet.  A source said that Rural Economy Secretary Fergus Ewing, is ready to \"go to the backbenches\" after over 11 years in the government.  Another long serving minister, who may voluntarily leave the government, is Environment Secretary Roseanna Cunningham.  However, Sturgeon is understood to be ready to use her first reshuffle in over two years to promote \"high flyers\" from Holyrood\u0027s backbenches.  SNP MSPs Kate Forbes, Mairi Gougeon, Clare Haughey, Jenny Gilruth and Ivan McKee - all of whom were first elected to parliament 2016 - are reportedly in line for promotion to the ministerial ranks.  Sturgeon would need to secure parliamentary approval for any ministerial changes before Holyrood\u0027s summer recess, which begins after Thursday\u0027s business.  Senior SNP sources told the Sunday Herald that Sturgeon will use Tuesday, the day her cabinet meets, to make the changes public.  The SNP still has nearly three years before the next Holyrood election.  However, Sturgeon may seek to use the reshuffle as a chance to refresh the SNP government, which has been in power since May 2007."},{"url":null,"title":"Marchers demand vote on final Brexit deal","story":"              TENS of thousands of people marched through central London to demand a final vote on any UK exit deal, on the second anniversary of the Brexit vote.  Organisers of the People\u0027s Vote march say Brexit is \"not a done deal\" and people must \"make their voices heard\".  The protests were held as senior Cabinet ministers, including Liam Fox and David Davis, insist the UK is prepared to walk away from talks without an agreement.  World War Two veteran Stephen Goodall, 96, led the pro-EU protesters as they headed from Pall Mall to Parliament Square.  Among those addressing the demonstrators was Gina Miller, who successfully campaigned to ensure the UK could not trigger talks on leaving without the approval of Parliament.  She said: \"Together we must stand up, demand our voices are heard, demand a people\u0027s vote so that future generations can hear us say we did our bit we stood up and shouted for a country that\u0027s together, kinder, tolerant.  \"This is not a time to be silent.\"  Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable said Brexit was \"not a done deal\" and could be reversed, while Green Party co-leader Caroline Lucas told the crowd that Brexit \"will be a disaster for this country\".  Meanwhile, thousands of Scottish independence supporters staged a march to Bannockburn.  The latest All Under One Banner event near Stirling follows large marches in Glasgow and Dumfries earlier this year.  An estimated 8,000 people took part in Saturday\u0027s march which centred on Bannockburn, where Robert the Bruce claimed victory over Edward II\u0027s English army in 1314.  The march started at Kings Park in Stirling and continued for around two miles to Bannockburn.  Further marches are planned for Dundee and Edinburgh later in 2018."},{"url":null,"title":"Future shock    39 Incorruptible  39  corpses of saints are the McDonald  39 s hamburgers of religious delusion","story":"              A FRIEND recently confided that he\u0026rsquod discovered an uneaten McDonald\u0026rsquos meal of indeterminate age under the bed while decontaminating his disgusting hovel. This particular room had been subject to historic disregard \u0026ndash and perhaps somewhere deep within that dusty pit also lie the bones of Shergar and Lord Lucan. Pecked dry by the last surviving dodo.  Apparently this \u0026ldquohappy meal had festered under my pal\u0026rsquos stinking crypt for at least a year. It\u0026rsquos likely the clatty b***er even braved a bite \u0026ndash because, remarkably, this burger still looked exactly the same as it did on the day of purchase. If he had been inclined towards religious fervour, my friend may have chosen to place this \u0026ldquoincorruptible meat in a glass display case and pronounce it a miracle.  Although it is indeed miraculous that a happy meal\u0026rsquos free plastic toy may rot away before anything else in the box, there is little likelihood of any supernatural deity\u0026rsquos involvement. Neither was this burger made from some sort of magical \u0026ldquoholy cow \u0026ndash McDonald\u0026rsquos has admitted that each single pate is formed from the remains of around 100 doe-eyed bovine. That\u0026rsquos nearly a whole field \u0026ndash a super-value meal indeed if you get a thrill from counting how much death it\u0026rsquos taken to keep your belly full over the years.  So, if God wasn\u0026rsquot involved in this burger\u0026rsquos immortality, then what caused it? A recent US scientific study into fast food\u0026rsquos mysterious ambivalence to nature concluded that the key to its durable physicality wasn\u0026rsquot any Judeo-Christian sky spy, creepy chemical or powdered preservative \u0026ndash but simply a lack of moisture and specific atmospheric conditions.  This brings us smoothly segueing into religious perceptions of such \u0026ldquoincorruptibility \u0026ndash once a prominent, earnest and profitable subdivision of Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox lore. This phenomenon was fuelled by the once popular practice of exhuming bodies to check if they had decayed in a \u0026ldquonormal manner. Signs of unnatural preservation were often believed to be the work of an interventionist God, justifying the macabre yet still popular practice of putting beef jerky on display in glass tombs. These exploited corpses are no sleeping beauties waiting on a kiss, however.  WOULD THEY LIE TO YOU?  THE Roman Catholic Church has put hundreds of \u0026ldquoincorruptible corpses on public display, making up for this indignity by promoting these bodies\u0026rsquo previous owners to sainthood. Discovering these demigods often meant macabre Burke and Hare-style exhumations of individuals rumoured to have committed acts of miraculous endeavour. One day, Charles and Eddie of \u0026ldquoWould I Lie To You? fame may be dug up to check if Eddie\u0026rsquos glossy mane is still intact. Perhaps Charles will have retained the twinkle in his eye.  Yet, even if the soul-pop duo are found in good enough nick to perform their hit again, the Catholic Church of 2018 might not be interested \u0026ndash as incorruptibility is no longer a miracle. Even the Vatican authorities now admit that pious folk of past eras had clearly tried to help God along with the whole process. It seems many former Popes and saints currently rotting under the Vatican were subjected to the indignity of having oil and herbs inserted into their muscle cavities to aid preservation. Some were even dead at the time. Such saintly \u0026ldquoincorruptibles have even been reported to exude a sweet odour upon exhumation \u0026ndash yes, embalming fluids and exotic ointments can be particularly potent.  Historically, those thought to have performed miraculous deeds in life were quickly buried in multiple airtight caskets after death, such was the fervour for their inevitable sainthood. These were built of zinc and lead and kept above ground in crypts \u0026ndash environmental circumstances suspiciously favourable to preservation. They were later exhumed to much fanfare and fired into garish glass displays for the faithful to gawp at in holy reverence.  These bodies remained attached to their blackened skin and calcified muscle structure, but not their dignity. Now that the Vatican itself has denounced \u0026ldquoincorruptibility as evidence for sainthood, perhaps it\u0026rsquos time to end these voyeuristic horror shows once and for all. Such abused corpses have surely now earned the right to a dignified burial rather than simply serving as a grim public testament to less enlightened times.  WHEN THE ROT SETS IN  THERE are countless natural processes which aid \u0026ldquoincorruptibility in those who did not benefit of from casual DIY mummification by the early Catholic Church. For instance, long before the 20th century\u0026rsquos cretinous, ruinous adherence to gluttony, most Europeans either died from starvation or disease. Wasting was also accelerated by religious penance. Such a grim death relieved bodies of the moist fat reserves that will accelerate the current generation\u0026rsquos decomposition, but more importantly, it also wipes out colonies of gut bacteria which largely propel putrefaction.  Truth, as always, is more interesting than the myth. The cyclical reality of death is so simple and beautiful that Elton John even sang a song about it, Circle of Life. Of course, the lyric about humans being so wonderfully recyclable didn\u0026rsquot make the final cut as nothing rhymed with biodisposable. The verse about how we disintegrate in a manner that saturates the soil with a wealth of life juices and minerals to seed new life in joyous abundance made the 12 remix though. Limited edition release in Slovakia.  With such wonder evident, corpse deification seems an insult to mother nature, denying her built-in reincarnation process simply to prolong the vampiric myth-making of monotheism. The humiliating afterlife of bodily preservation is surely only ever acceptable when natural conditions such as alkaline soil or ice have played their part.  Somewhat exotically, some human corpses have even been found \u0026ldquosaponified \u0026ndash buried in lime-enriched soil that converts body fat into hard soap. A clean death indeed. Others are preserved forever, ironically it may turn out, thanks to past eras of seismic climate change \u0026ndash such as the famous iceman Otzi of Bolzano. Otzi is the only guy on Earth cooler then the Fonz. And, remarkably, even older than Henry Winkler was when playing the alleged teenager.  NO HURRY TO DISPEL THE ILLUSION  FEW would deny there is clear historical \u0026ndash and present \u0026ndash precedent of society\u0026rsquos most powerful, privileged and influential echelons bending the mindsets of the masses to keep their illusion of hierarchic superiority flickering.  However, when it comes to the generations of the past passing off \u0026ldquoincorruptible corpses as the work of God, the benefit of the doubt might be warranted. Bodily decay is a complex and unpredictable process and was likely often misunderstood.  Still, folk then could surely have asked themselves a logical question as relevant then as it is now: if God is behind such preservation \u0026ndash and is, assumedly, all-powerful \u0026ndash then why do \u0026ldquoincorruptibles cover such a wide spectrum of decay? Why don\u0026rsquot they all stay as fresh as Ant McPartlin after a shave?  It\u0026rsquos likely folk always wondered the same thing. Using the Ant of their time as the analogy. Or perhaps their tongues were tied by the knowledge of what happened to Galileo and others for questioning God\u0026rsquos mysterious ways in public.  As science now understands, bodies don\u0026rsquot all decompose at the same rate. This fact has clearly led to seismic misunderstandings throughout history \u0026ndash and is the likely origin of all European vampire myths and Haitian zombie culture. We didn\u0026rsquot always fire folk underground then forget about them. Sometimes, we\u0026rsquod check to make sure they were still dead.  The fact that \u0026ldquoincorruptible corpses can now be rather easily explained leaves a greater mystery, however \u0026ndash the endurance of belief in the phenomenon. Perhaps the answer lies in how the Catholic Church continues to propagate the myth. In 1975, Monsignor Gianfranco Nolli, director of the Vatican\u0026rsquos Egyptian Museum, put together a team of mummification researchers to preserve all their popes, saints and \u0026ldquorelics \u0026ndash sacred body parts dating way back as far as the third century.  This team was also responsible for one of the Vatican\u0026rsquos top tourist attractions under the city: the body of John XXIII, who looks in fine nick despite dying in 1963. The airless glass coffin helps, but so do the realistic wax hands and death mask. More than 25,000 people visit St Peter\u0026rsquos Basilica to see him every day, and many of these faithful servants truly believe the beautific state of his body is a miracle. Understandably, the church is hesitant to clarify the truth that he\u0026rsquod be better suited to Madame Tussauds.  Ironically, only one of the specialist embalming team which treated Pope John and countless other \u0026ldquoholy corpses is still alive. The others tragically succumbed to various cancers, with side-effects of toxic chemicals they worked with during their macabre efforts immortalising the dead speculated to be responsible.  The most famous instance of incorruptibility, which many believe to be the real McCoy, is that of Bernadette Soubirous who died in 1879. She\u0026rsquos the one responsible for a booming tourist economy in Lourdes \u0026ndash five million people a year \u0026ndash after claiming she was visited by the Virgin Mary. In death, Bernadette\u0026rsquos body was exhumed three times \u0026ndash but kept above ground after the third and final indignity before being \u0026ldquotreated and placed inside, yes, an airtight glass tomb. It couldn\u0026rsquot have worked very well as what most people think of as the word\u0026rsquos more remarkably life-like corpse is actually, like John XXIII, a wax cocoon \u0026ndash the real Bernadette lies festering somewhere inside. Perhaps she should join John in Madame Tussauds. It certainly couldn\u0026rsquot be any less garish a display than the gold and crystal reliquary in the Chapel of Saint Bernadette where she currently resides, her vulgar afterlife helping maintain the hypnotic spell enslaving the faithful. And, of course, keeping the coffers full."},{"url":null,"title":"inverurie menswear firm toasts 100k whisky contract","story":"\t\tPernod Ricard, owners of several prestigious spirit brands, has awarded a \u0026#163100k retail contract to menswear outfitters Gibbs Inverurie.\t\t\t\tA contingent of 875 Chinese are heading across the globe for a 4-day whisky extravaganza in July.

Hanging baskets, banners and bunting are also covered by the new rules, as well as attachments to street lighting columns, such as signs.Councillors heard the use of festive lighting, bunting, banners and hanging baskets can help encourage commercial activity in towns, add seasonal colour and help promote community events.ISC previously considered proposals which would have seen community groups covering electricity costs for festive lights, hearing there was strong opposition to this from local councillors and groups.Members asked officers to revisit the plans, setting up a working group to further investigate the potential impacts of the proposals.

It will provide on-board workshops, spare parts storage, crane and office facilities but will get supplies from another large vessel. By contrast the BOWL project will use smaller crew transfer vessels on a daily basis to provide crew and supplies.\u0026ldquoIt is just a different strategy being used at MORL and we could not accommodate that size of vessel at Wick as we do not have the shelter and water depth required, he said. \u0026ldquoIf we had our new quay at Shaltigoe we would have been able to accommodate it.But Mr Watt is confident the harbour will still play a part in servicing the MORL project and in other renewable projects in the Moray Firth basin. He pointed out that Wick is 33 kilometres from the wind farm while Fraserburgh is 70km away.\u0026ldquoWe wish Fraserburgh and Moray East well and will continue to develop Wick harbour, Mr Watt said. \u0026ldquoWe will move forward on a strong footing in the renewables market as well as in the fishing and cargo sectors.He added that work on the BOWL base is progressing well and will create upwards of 150 jobs.Caithness civic leader Willie Mackay said: \u0026ldquoIt is very disappointing news. Hopes were high this project could come to Wick. There have been a lot of improvements going on at the harbour which has the potential for a positive future.\u0026ldquoI hope other projects can come to Wick and I look forward to seeing improvements on the platform the BOWL project creates for the town and the community in general. I hope we can bring lots of jobs and apprenticeships to the area.Trudy Morris, chief executive of Caithness Chamber of Commerce, was \u0026ldquovery disappointed by the decision as the Wick harbour team has worked \u0026ldquoextremely hard to make the port an attractive base.\u0026ldquoAs the larger of the two offshore wind projects proposed for this area, it would have been a significant boost to the harbour and the region to have MORL based here, she said.But she added: \u0026ldquoIt has been fantastic to see the progress made at Wick harbour this year in preparing for the Beatrice Offshore Windfarm Ltd operations and maintenance contract, and we look forward to the benefits this will bring to the area.Eann Sinclair, programme manager for the Caithness and North Sutherland Regeneration Partnership, was also disappointed by the decision. However, he is confident there will still be opportunities for Wick harbour to get work in the Moray Firth area.MORL spokesman Craig Milroy said Wick was in the running for the O\u0026ampM base along with Buckie and Fraserburgh. A memorandum of understanding had been signed with Wick.\u0026ldquoAll three were strongly engaged with us but we chose Fraserburgh, he said. \u0026ldquoThere was not a single reason for choosing Fraserburgh but a combination of circumstances.

That simply makes it a must-attend event for Orkney’s premium food and drink firms, giving them the chance to showcase their products to a very wide audience of potential customers. It’s a very busy few days for our producers, but always worth the effort and it also gives us an opportunity to tell the wider story about Orkney and all its other attractions.”Amongst the Orkney businesses travelling to the show will be newcomers, J. Gow Rum, makers of the county’s first locally produced rum.Collin van Schayk of rum producers, VS Distillers, said: “We’re very much looking forward to introducing J. Gow Rum to the visitors at this year’s Royal Highland Show. The reception it’s had since its launch late last year has been fantastic, so we’re really excited about bringing it to a much wider audience, and sharing our story.“One of the strengths of Orkney’s approach to marketing food and drink is the fact local businesses present a united front at these major events.

The plans represent an investment of £125 million for investors and would create 385 new jobs.According to the hotel chain, the letter it has sent to OIC sets out how it has supported 12 local authorities in England and Wales, supporting local regeneration, creating jobs and boosting local economies.With similar letters being sent to 19 other councils in Scotland, including Shetland Islands Council, the hotel chain is attempting to show how it could similarly support local communities around the country.These agreements offer a funding structure which the hotel chain says enables local authorities to utilise their existing assets, create jobs, generate income, and help to regenerate land in strategically important locations.Hotels in the programme are built on surplus local authority land, with the funding provided either through the local authority’s internal resource or via low-cost funding from the Public Works Loan Board or third party resources.Upon completion of the hotel development, local authorities would either have the choice of either retaining ownership of the hotel and receive an annual rent into the council’s revenue budget or selling the hotel with Travelodge as its operator.Brian Wallace, Travelodge chairman said: “Many local authorities are in possession of large amounts of property and assets that are not being utilised. Investing in a low-cost hotel like Travelodge is an increasingly attractive choice, as it draws visitors, creates jobs and helps boost the local economy.”“We operate 44 hotels across Scotland. However, the country is growing at pace and attracting visitors from all corners of the globe but there still remains a huge shortage of good quality and great value hotels. To fill this gap, we want to extend our Scottish network with a further 20 hotels and this includes our first hotel in Kirkwall.
