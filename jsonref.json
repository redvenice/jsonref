It’s the way older homeowners can boost their finances and help turn their lives around in retirement. It’s called equity release. And if you’re over 55 then it could work for you. Here are the SEVEN key facts every homeowner aged 55 and over should know... ONE: It’s all about releasing tax-free cash tied up in the value of your home While some people choose to downsize, many are retiring and finding their homes are worth more than their pension funds. Equity release lets you access the money in your home, just like turning 55 lets you access the cash in your pension. The money you release from your home is tax-free and you can spend it however you like.  Even if you have an outstanding mortgage, you can still take out equity release, as long as you pay off any debt secured against your property.  You can use some or all of the funds released to do this.          If you retire and find your home is worth more than your pension fund, equity release can helpTWO: It’s a simple process The most common way is to take out a lifetime mortgage which is a loan secured against your home, but unlike a traditional mortgage there are typically no monthly payments, allowing you to get on with enjoying your retirement.The loan plus roll-up interest is repaid when your equity release plan ends. This is normally when you or your surviving spouse pass away or go into long term care.As straightforward as it sounds, seeking the advice of a leading independent broker like Key Equity Release is crucial to help find a plan that meets your needs. They will also encourage you to involve your closest family so that everyone understands and is involved in the decision. They will explain how it will reduce the value of your estate and may affect your entitlement to means tested benefits – your expert equity release adviser will help you understand any implications specific to your inidual circumstances.            Organising equity release is a simple process, but talk it through with your grown up childrenTHREE: You will still own your homeWith a lifetime mortgage you always own your own home. Plans approved by the Equity Release Council, which Key recommends, offer a cast iron guarantee that you can stay in your home until the plan comes to an end and you can never owe more than your home is worth – so there’s no need to worry about house prices or how much interest builds up.          With a lifetime mortgage you will still own your home - all you\u0027ve done is take out a new loan on itFOUR: The amount you can raise will varyHow much cash you can release with an equity release plan will depend on things such as the value of your home, your age and health. At the time of writing an example from industry expert Key says a 65-year-old in good health could release up to 36 per cent of the value of his or her home. A healthy 80-year-old could release up to 52 per cent. In fact, last year Key enabled their customers to access an average of £86k of tax-free cash from their home. FIVE: You can use the money for anything you wantMany people use the money they release to clear outstanding credit card debts or interest only mortgages – but equally, lots of people use it for life\u0027s luxuries, such as holidays or new cars. A large percentage of people alternatively use it for home improvements, often \u0027future proofing\u0027 their family home with a new en-suite or a downstairs bathroom for the years ahead. Some use the money to help their children or grandchildren pay for homes or education. It\u0027s entirely up to you.Of course, it is always important to remember when releasing equity that you balance current needs with future wants and you should always think carefully before securing a loan against your home.       "},{"url":null,"title":"Zoe Ball 1 6m BBC Radio 2 paid predecessor Chris Evans says father","story":"    Zoe Ball, 48, outside Wogan House in London after her first morning hosting the BBC 2 Breakfast Show on Monday  Chris Evans (left) was paid a £1.6m salary when he was hosting Radio 2\u0027s Breakfast Show, Johnny Ball (right) says that his daughter deserves parity\u0027She\u0027s had 15 years of greedy vase-owners... and now she\u0027s...\u0027Show two is like the second tricky album\u0027: Zoe Ball thanks...Share this articleHe told the paper his daughter was superb value for money, saying that if some people thought her salary was too great they should complain to the BBC.The BBC has faced a raft of criticism for its male dominated salaries.The heavy-hitters for 2017-18 were Gary Lineker (£1.75m), Chris Evans (£1.6m) and Graham Norton (£600,000).The highest paid woman for that year was Claudia Winkleman (£370,000) who placed 13th in the male dominated list.Miss Ball became Radio 2\u0027s first female weekday breakfast show host on Monday.

But following the decisive rejection of the government\u0027s deal by MPs on Tuesday, those cannot be on the basis of your existing red lines. \u0027It is clear that no tweaks or further assurances are going to win support for the government\u0027s Brexit deal in Parliament.\u0027We have set out an alternative framework for a better deal: based upon a new comprehensive UK-EU customs union a strong Single Market deal and guarantees that there can be no race to the bottom on rights and standards. \u0027That is the consistent position that Labour has outlined over the past year.    Theresa May (pictured in Downing Street last night) has offered to hold Brexit talks with the Labour leader - but he has sparked fury by snubbing her offer\u0027I am disappointed that there have already been several briefings in which you continue to rule out a customs union. \u0027A new customs union is part of a solution favoured by most businesses and trade unions, and one that I believe could command a majority of the House of Commons.\u0027  Mr Corbyn has faced a storm of criticism from MPs - including Labour backbenchers - for refusing the PM\u0027s offer of talks.And this morning Tony Blair also attacked his decision, saying it is wrong to make the snub at a \u0027moment of national crisis\u0027. The Labour former PM accused Mr Corbyn of deliberately avoiding engagement on Brexit.  \u0027If, in a moment of national crisis, the Prime Minister asks the Leader of the Opposition to come and talk, of course he should,\u0027 he told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme.  He added: \u0027At some point he is going to have to make his position clear.\u0027It is quite hard to read the runes sometimes in Labour policy right now, but, as I understand, our position is that if the no confidence motion fails, as it has, then there is an overwhelming majority for supporting putting this back to the people.\u0027Corbyn could face string of resignations if he backs \u0027people\u0027s vote\u0027 | Politics | The Guardian"},{"url":null,"title":"Andy Serkis brings Theresa Gollum Bohemian Rhapsody parody","story":"    The Lord of the Rings star reprised his most famous character in a skit that parodies the Queen 1975 song Bohemian Rhapsody          Serkis won a host of awards for his portrayal of Gollum (pictured), a cowering, deformed creature with a split personality who obsesses over his \u0027precious\u0027 ringPosting the new clip to his Twitter page, the 54-year-old wrote: \u0027The latest leak from 10 Downing Street.

Strangely for an event calling for peace in the Middle East, it did not involve Israel.Corbyn also attended a meeting in the Houses of Parliament, in 2015, just six months before he became Labour leader, organised by pro-Palestinian pressure group Middle East Monitor.He sat with Daud Abdullah, a Hamas-linked figure who signed a letter calling for the Royal Navy to be attacked if it attempted to stop weapons being smuggled into Gaza. Abdullah also said he was prepared to blow himself up in a suicide attack, telling the BBC: ‘Sacrificing myself for Palestine is a noble cause.’Corbyn’s explanation: Initially, he denied being involved with the wreath-laying in Tunisia, but when challenged, he came up with the much-ridiculed reason: ‘I was present when it was laid. I don’t think I was actually involved in it.’ Photos then emerged showing him holding a wreath. As for the meeting with Hamas in the Houses of Parliament, he later said he regretted calling them his ‘friends’.

Indeed, the former Westminster University student seems to have been someone Corbyn wanted to be able to walk Britain’s streets, judging by an interview he gave in 2015 with Arab TV station LuaLua.Corbyn’s explanation: He said moves to ban jihadis from returning to Britain were ‘strange’ and ‘legally very questionable’. At a Stop the War rally (before becoming Labour leader), he said that the ISIS beheading of Alan Henning, a British aid worker, was ‘the price of jingoism’.PAID £20,000 TO HELP IRA SUSPECTAs a newly elected MP in 1983, Corbyn invited IRA apologist Gerry Adams to the Houses of Parliament. The two men met on other occasions during the Eighties, when the IRA was at the height of its terror campaign. Corbyn even put up £20,000 of his own money to stand bail for an IRA terror suspect facing extradition to Germany.He also invited two convicted IRA volunteers to tea at Westminster in 1984, just two weeks after the Brighton bomb, which killed five people staying at the Grand Hotel for the Conservative Party conference.          Labour MP Jeremy Corbyn with Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein political party of Northern Ireland at the House of Commons in 1996In 1986, Corbyn was arrested outside the Old Bailey during the trial of Patrick Magee — later convicted for the Brighton bombing — in a protest against the strip-search of his co-defendants. After the Brighton attack, London Labour Briefing (a far-Left monthly journal Corbyn helped run), published a reader’s letter stating: ‘What do you call four dead Tories? A start!’The Labour leader also attended the annual gathering of the Wolfe Tone Society, which honours dead and imprisoned IRA members.In 1986, the event programme said: ‘Force of arms is the only method capable of bringing about a free and united socialist Ireland.’ In 1987 Corbyn was at a commemoration for eight IRA men shot by the SAS as they attempted to attack a police station in Armagh.In 1996, the year of the Docklands and Manchester bombings, Corbyn again invited several suspected IRA terrorists to Parliament and tried to host a book-signing by Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams — although this was stopped after Tony Blair threatened to eject Corbyn from the Labour Party. All these meetings were long before the Good Friday Agreement of 1998, when the IRA called an end to its armed struggle.Talks?

I obviously did meet people from Sinn Fein, as indeed I met people from other organisations, and I always made the point that there had to be a dialogue and a peace process.’He was later forced to retract his claim he’d never met the IRA after Labour MP and former lover Diane Abbott said he’d shared a platform with IRA members Raymond McCartney and Brendan McKenna, the latter having been jailed for bombing a British Legion hall.At no point did it appear that Corbyn asked Sinn Fein to renounce violence as a condition for meeting its leaders. Even when the IRA said it was downing arms, Corbyn struggled to condemn its murderous activities during The Troubles without equating them with the British Army’s role in defending Northern Ireland from paramilitary groups. He infuriated British soldiers by saying: ‘I condemn all bombing. I condemn what was done by the British Army as well as by the other sides.’          The Labour leader also attended the annual gathering of the Wolfe Tone Society, which honours dead and imprisoned IRA members.

I’ve also invited our friends from Hamas to come and speak.’Corbyn’s explanation: Asked during a hearing into claims of anti-Semitism in the Labour Party, in 2016, why he’d called the terror groups ‘friends’, he said: ‘It was inclusive language which, with hindsight, I would rather not have used. I regret using those words.’ However, he hasn’t used the phrase ‘inclusive language’ this week when defending his refusal to join Mrs May for Brexit talks.HIS OTHER LINKS TO EXTREMISTS...Corbyn travelled to Syria to meet its brutal president Bashar al-Assad in 2009. Millions have been killed and made homeless during the country’s civil war, and Assad has been accused of launching more than 100 chemical attacks against his own people.Corbyn’s trip was hosted by London-based lobby group the Palestinian Return Centre, which was later embroiled in controversy for holding a meeting at the House of Lords, where a speaker claimed a ‘heretic’ rabbi had ‘antagonised’ Hitler to ‘systematically kill Jews’.Corbyn recorded his trip in the Members’ Register of Interests, saying it was worth £1,300.          Corbyn travelled to Syria to meet its brutal president Bashar al-Assad in 2009. The trip was hosted by the controversial London-based lobby group the Palestinian Return CentreInstead of explicitly condemning Assad, he says he abhors violence on all sides. Corbyn has equated the power of Assad’s police state with the country’s rebels.He also joined a group to welcome Abdallah Djaballah — a controversial Algerian politician and leader of the radical Islamic party the Movement For National Reform who has called on his countrymen to ‘wage holy Muslim war’ against Britain and the U.S.This was at a 2014 event at Finsbury Park Mosque, North London, where Islamist rabble-rouser Abu Hamza once preached.Corbyn was also photographed at the mosque making the Rabbi’ah, the four-fingered salute of the Muslim Brotherhood, the theocratic group which was involved in the ‘Arab Spring’ uprising in Egypt in 2011, but which is regarded as a terror organisation in some Middle East countries.Corbyn’s spokesman said that in making the salute, the Labour leader was ‘standing up for democracy, justice and the right to protest in Egypt . . . the four-fingered gesture is a well-known symbol of solidarity with the victims of the 2013 Rabaa massacre in Cairo.In 1984, Corbyn lobbied a variety of ‘Latin American cultural organisations’ on behalf of what he called ‘comrades’ in the Colombian revolutionary socialist group M-19.These ‘comrades’, according to the Sunday Times, have car-bombed, shot, tortured and killed their way across the country in recent years.Corbyn also criticised the Colombian government’s crackdown on M-19, accusing it of ‘repressing’ them. At the time, M-19 was little more than a glorified drugs gang behind a series of cocaine laboratories. It was also known for funding its activities with kidnappings and ransom demands.Corbyn also helped the men accused of being the 1988 Lockerbie bombers, who killed 270.In 1992 he signed a letter supporting their bid to avoid trial in either the UK or the U.S. ‘One has to ask whether they would receive a fair trial in a British or U.S. court,’ he said.And after Al-Qaeda’s 911 outrage, Corbyn wrote in the Socialist Campaign Group News, a paper for Left-wing MPs, that the West was responsible with its ‘blanket support for Israel’s occupation of Palestine’.He was only willing to concede the 911 attacks were a tragedy in the context of what he regards as other, equal tragedies — including Osama bin Laden’s death, the Iraq War, the ‘attack on Afghanistan’, as well as the treatment by Western soldiers of Iraqi and other prisoners in Guantanamo Bay and the Bagram military prison."},{"url":null,"title":"Historical dictionary containing 4 000 words Yorkshire dialect released","story":"    Dr George Redmonds spent more than 60 years collecting words for his dictionary of Yorkshire dialect.

It’s a nostalgic image, with a touch of magic from those disembodied feet and hands’I took the picture in the summer of 2013, in a rural part of northern Austria. I grew up in Holland. I went back there in 2012 to try to recapture my own childhood, but the farm where I was born no longer existed and the people I knew as a child no longer lived there. And then I found my childhood – or what I wished it had been – here, in the Austrian countryside.I was asked to do a documentary project about the Waldviertel region, which is how I came to meet these two local little girls, Hannah and Alena. Their mother, Sonja, asked if I would take some pictures of them.That summer, I travelled to their grandmother’s farm in a village called Waldberg, between Vienna and the Czech Republic. It’s where they always spend their holidays. We became friends and I’ve been going back ever since to photograph them.The two boys – Martin, who is on the swing with the girls, and his brother Christian, whose hands and feet peek out from behind them – are their friends who spend their summers at the farm, too. When I first met Christian, all he wanted to talk about was my camera. But, from the outset, the girls simply did their own thing. I would start our sessions with a few posted portraits, but soon they would get bored and ignore me. And that’s when I would begin to work.I think I was lying on the ground to get this shot, with my 35mm. It’s a camera I love because it allows me to be right inside the image, and I want my viewers to feel the same thing.I don’t know if I purposefully avoided showing their full faces. It wasn’t to anonymise them. Rather, it was to capture something more universal. Instead of looking into their eyes, you follow their inidual gazes, and you see the social dynamics at play between them. But I’m not really interested in what they’re playing with. Here, I hate those metal pipes, they spoil my picture. And without the children, there is no picture.Alena, the older girl, is at the centre of the image, and that’s true in how they play together. It’s a role that naturally falls to her – she is in charge, she decides what they’re going to do, and where they’re going to play. The others are happy to follow her lead. And while any other adult – a parent or a grandparent – might be tempted to intervene (“Don’t do that” or “That’s too rough”), I don’t judge, I don’t comment, or direct anything. I might be present, but the kids are on their own. Wherever they go, I go. They don’t see me. They’re in their own world.It’s a nostalgic image, with a touch of magic from those disembodied feet and hands of Christian’s. The longer I live, the more I long to be a child again. This project has perhaps been more about looking not for my actual childhood, but one I might have had.When I was two, my father and older sister Anita were in a car accident. Anita was killed, and my father was left with the mental age of a child of seven. So the only father I knew, growing up, was someone who was aggressive, and of whom I was ashamed. He wasn’t a normal father. Perhaps this is why I look for the idyllic, or the romantic in the stories I shoot – to balance things out, as a coping mechanism. I think that the most important things that happen to you, in life, happen between the ages of two and 12.When I see these four children here, in their own world, what I love is that they’re in charge. They are powerful. And that’s how I choose not only to depict children in my work, but also how I want to relate to them in everyday life: as human beings, as equals. Respected, empowered, not patronised. They inspire me.• Carla Kogelman’s I Am Waldviertel is at Schilt Gallery, Amsterdam, until 9 March.

A gift to Tokyo?”The government has since removed the door, which is designed to prevent flooding during high tides, and placed it in storage to prevent damage to the work. Reports said it was unclear exactly when the drawing had appeared, but the city’s public safety bureau has reportedly known about it for a long time. Other publicly circulated photos of the image date back several years.Officials were not aware that Banksy may have been behind the drawing until they were contacted by residents in December.Sugiyama said the government hoped to establish the artist’s identity, but conceded that Japan suffered from a shortage of Banksy experts.Banksy recently hit the headlines when one of his artworks shredded itself soon after selling for £1.04m auction.

He supposed that genes must take the form of a “huge molecule” containing a “miniature code” to direct the subsequent development of the organism. Francis Crick and James Watson, inspired by Schrödinger’s work, later proved him right when they, along with Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins, discovered the structure of DNA.But Schrödinger’s central question remains unanswered. There is still no agreed-on definition of what life is, let alone how it started. Maybe, some suggest, there are biology-specific laws of nature that we have yet to identify. Indeed, Schrödinger himself argued that “living matter, while not eluding the ‘laws of physics’ as established up to date, is likely to involve ‘other laws of physics’ hitherto unknown”.One fashionable approach now in biology is to suppose that these laws have something to do with “information”. In the age of mechanical inventions, it was thought that animals were like marvellous clockwork machines, and the entire universe was a sort of fabulous Meccano construction designed by God. Now we are in the information age, it seems obvious to us that the human brain – even, in some theorists’ view, the cosmos as a whole – must be a computer, and that information itself somehow underlies reality. The conceptual problem here is that the idea of “information” makes sense only in the context of an observer for whom something out there, in the indiscriminate jumble of the world, counts as information. Before life exists, there cannot be any such thing as information.It is to the credit of the physicist Paul Davies, then, that in this brilliantly vivid little book he is careful to remind the reader that such uses of “information” should be bracketed with provisos, even as he shows what we can do with them. It seems irresistible to say, to begin with, that cells “signal” to one another chemically, or that flocking birds and shoaling fish are exchanging “information” with their neighbours about speed and direction. But things get a lot weirder when Davies applies to biology ideas from thermodynamics and the mathematical theory of information.The “demon” of the title is Maxwell’s Demon, named after a thought experiment by the 19th-century Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell. Imagine a box of gas with a partition containing a tiny door. A supernatural intelligence could open the door to let fast-moving particles go one way and slow-moving particles the other. This would eventually result in two different temperatures of gas either side of the partition, reversing entropy and enabling work to get done free.The big idea is that nature itself might take advantage of the superefficiency of a demonic approach to information, and understanding the information flow in organisms might be the missing part of our scientific jigsaw puzzle. Davies proceeds to explain the maths of cellular autonoma, the ridiculously fine-tuned machinery of the cell and the workings of the “hive mind” in social insects.The information flow in genetics, too, is far more complex than once thought, a point piquantly illustrated by some perverted worm-botherers. These researchers discovered that by cutting the head and tail off a worm and applying electricity – which disrupts the information flow in regrowth – you can get a worm with a head at both ends. If you then cut that worm in half, just for lolz, you get two new two-headed worms, even though they have exactly the same DNA as the original one-headed worm.The informational approach, in Davies’s elegant and lucid exposition, is extremely promising, but it remains highly speculative, as he himself laudably emphasises while offering his own final thoughts on consciousness (as “integrated information”), and the possibility that “laws of nature” themselves evolve through time. Perhaps, he adds, these laws might, in some way not yet understood, be inherently “bio-friendly”.This is a maverick idea, but not a new one. The philosopher Thomas Nagel was widely ridiculed by scientists a few years ago when, in his book Mind and Cosmos, he suggested that there might be “teleological” laws ensuring that consciousness would arise in the universe. Teleology – the ancient idea that things strive towards a purpose – is not now respectable, and Davies himself refers to it as a “problem” to be avoided. And yet right at the end of this book, he suggests that “the emergence of life, and perhaps mind, are etched into the underlying lawfulness of nature”. That idea is nothing if not teleological – which is no good reason, by itself, to think it untrue.• The Demon in the Machine: How Hidden Webs of Information Are Solving the Mystery of Life is published by Allen Lane.

Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week.granitadicaffe has just “entered the gates of Purgatory” with Dante:In Il Purgatorio it takes 9 cantos before you reach Purgatory itself. On the way they meet and chat to various historical personages. The gates are a little hard to find and when you get there there are 3 large steps of marble outside: the first is white, smooth and polished, the second dark rough and cracked, and the third red like blood spurting from a vein. On these stands a big angel with a sword, who only opened the door after Virgil explained their mission. He used 2 keys, a silver and a gold one. If the latter, which is difficult to turn, won’t open then you can’t get in. It is hard to enter Purgatory but once you are inside you mustn’t look back!“I’m not a slow reader,” says kinson1964, but “I’ve been reading the same book since last year.” That book is Jerusalem by Alan Moore:A huge book (page numbers reach four figures) and it’s an amazing read. It deals with Northampton rather like Joyce deals with Dublin or Gray does with Glasgow - all human life (and death) is there together with a wealth of historical facts, trivia and metaphysical speculation.

Again le Carré lets his readers know Britain is a police state in all but name. A rewarding read.A quick tip from Dennis89:Just finished Night Flight by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry. A short novella and the ideal read for one sitting.... Beautiful prose and quite atmospheric for such a short book.And a fine idea from nkenny:I’ve been listening to the audiobook of Boswell’s Life of Samuel Johnson. It’s extremely funny and perfect for dipping in and out of during spare moments.Van Gogh’s letters have impressed marosc:They’re really good. The main element of his personality that’s coming out is commitment to authenticity - he’s determined to be himself even in the face of severe family pressure to conform and to be true to his artistic vision even when it means only selling a handful of pieces because he refuses to compromise to make his art more saleable. And his brother Theo must be the greatest art benefactor in history - pretty much single handedly supporting Vincent so he can dedicate himself to art - and what a legacy we’ve got because of that. The way Vincent writes about his art and comparing it with other artists (it’s not true that he was a loner - he was friends with Toulouse-Lautrec \u0026amp Seurat and, of course, began a failed attempt at an artists’ community with Gauguin) is totally engaging - you can really feel his excitement about what he’s doing.Emily Wilson’s translation of Homer’s Odyssey is, according to FrogC, “excellent”:It was not at all what I expected. The voyaging adventures are mostly told in flashback and take up a smaller part of the book than Odysseus’s return home and revenge upon the suitors who’ve been pestering his wife and eating him out of house and home. (I kept thinking, impertinently, that that was not how I would have written it.) And it’s a surprisingly cruel book - I ended up not liking Odysseus very much.Finally, Tom Mooney recommends A Different Drummer by William Melvin Kelley:In 1957, a young black farmer shoots his livestock, salts his fields and burns down his house. He then walks away from his fictional southern state. Every other black citizen follows his lead.From this brilliant set-up, Kelley tells the story of young Tucker Caliban, his ancestors and their masters, owners and bosses, entirely through the eyes of the white people left behind in town.There are a lot of moving parts in this novel but they tie together beautifully come the end. It’s at times hopeful and cynical, moral and immoral, simple and complex. Almost 60 years after it was first published it feels incredibly fresh and would sit happily alongside the works of Ellison, Baldwin and other great writers on civil rights in the US.If you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

While locals may worry about the growing number of empty stores in their town centre, the other side of the coin is the devastating impact on retail property values.When it opened in 1981 the Postings, which cost £4.25m to build, promised to be a magnet for shoppers. Each store opening prompted local news, with 1980s TV celebrity and Generation Game presenter Isla St Clair even dropping in to cut the ribbon at the William Low store (a supermarket chain bought by Tesco in 1994) when it opened.But the now dated precinct, in what is Gordon Brown’s former constituency, has fallen on hard times. It was dealt a big blow in 2015 when Tesco – despite personal protestations from Brown – closed the superstore which anchored the mall and also doubled as the town’s post office.But the cost of the annual upkeep of the Postings is now thought to be higher than the £152,000 it brings in from rent, making its ultimate parent Columbia Threadneedle Investments eager to offload it after more than 15 years of ownership.Columbia Threadneedle said the Postings had been acquired for its rental income stream but that it had now been repositioned as a development opportunity that “does not fit the holding fund’s investment strategy”.Quite who would see it as a development opportunity is another matter.Famed as the birthplace of the 18th-century economist Adam Smith, Kirkcaldy once had coal, textiles, linoleum and electronics. Today the biggest employers in the town of 49,000 people are the NHS and the council (which incidentally is the Postings’ most lucrative tenant, renting the car park for £70,000 a year). It has estates that are the most deprived in Scotland outside of Glasgow and in a recent interview with the , Brown revealed the number of families turning to its food banks had soared.“What the price tag tells you is the relevance or rather the irrelevance of these dated shopping centres in challenged towns,” said Matthew Hopkinson, co-founder of retail advisory firm Didobi. “This is a very difficult time to be a property investor because the retail sector is going though major structural changes.”Last year was a difficult year for the retail sector with a long list of high street failures, including House of Fraser, Evans Cycles, Maplin and Poundworld, while other chains including Mothercare and Carpetright, together closed hundreds of underperforming stores.There is some hope for the Postings, with Columbia Threadneedle reporting that the eye-catching price tag had created a lot of interest. “The reserve price of £1 is generating significant attention and we expect to get a considerable amount at the auction,” the company added in a statement.

However, their share of the mix has been gradually shrinking as renewables have grown and energy demand has fallen.More significantly, seven of the eight nuclear sites will have shut by the end of the 2020s as they reach the end of their lifetime, with only Sizewell B in Suffolk continuing to operate. The government has also committed to shutting the country’s last seven coal plants by 2025 at the latest.So far the only nuclear project to be given the go-ahead is EDF Energy’s Hinkley Point C, a 3.2GW plant in Somerset, which will power about 6m homes when complete.The power station is officially due to begin supplying electricity to the grid in 2025 but similar projects in Finland and France have run many years over schedule. EDF has already warned the plant may not be generating until 2027.Originally there were concrete plans for five nuclear plants in the running to meet the UK’s new nuclear ambitions. But three of those – Moorside, Wylfa and Oldbury – have been shelved. That leaves the 3.2GW Sizewell C in Suffolk, led by EDF and backed by the Chinese state firm China General Nuclear Power (CGN), and the 2.3GW, Chinese-led Bradwell B in Essex, which EDF has a one-third stake in.The government negotiated a guaranteed price for power for 35 years with EDF for Hinkley. Hitachi was trying to do the same, with the additional support of the government taking a multibillion-pound stake, but could not make the numbers work.Attention will turn to a new method of financing known as the regulated asset base (RAB) model, which the government plans to give more details on this summer. The RAB approach would mean a regulator setting fixed costs and fixed returns for a nuclear developer, to overcome the huge upfront cost of nuclear plants and years-long delay for investors reaping a return.If new nuclear plants do not materialise it will pose a challenge to tough carbon targets for 2030. It is unlikely to threaten energy supplies, given the speed with which gas plants and windfarms could be built.The main technology that has the scale to fill the nuclear gap is offshore wind power. More inshore windfarms and solar power would also help. The intermittent nature of those technologies could be addressed to a degree by more batteries and other storage, imports and technologies such as demand side reduction. That results in big energy users – and maybe one day homes – reducing their electricity consumption at peak times in return for a financial incentive."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8df5173251773317795112f0d013a7abfc46136a/0_0_2064_1238/master/2064.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0b09a5375476eb8d7a2f6a11c919b344","title":"neither north nor south nottingham by carol adlam an urban cartoon","story":"Author-illustrator Carol Adlam looks at liminal spaces caught between this Midlands city’s industrial past and its drive towards the futureSituated at the very centre of England, Nottingham is neither a traditional “northern” or “southern” city. With a a significant working class and industrial legacy that has left its traces on the cityscape in the lace-market, the extensive network of caves that run under the city, the canal, and derelict industrial-era mill buildings, it is also. Socially it is ided: on the one hand it is a thriving city with two universities on the other, there remains significant social deprivation in areas such as Nottingham north, with very low literacy levels.Radford Mill is on the canal edge, a vast textile-manufacturing mill building that is undergoing regeneration after years of neglect.From here the dramatic cliff edge of the sandstone outcrop on which the city centre sits can be seen. Sneinton Hermitage refers to a set of caves that were once inhabited by a religious order, and the 15-foot steel dragon that is partially hidden in the trees nearby is the work of local artist Robert Stubley.Nottingham sits on a vast sandstone escarpment in which there are extensive networks of manmade caves, some of which were in use for work and even habitation until the second world war. The tunnel is evidence of the historical ide between rich and poor in Nottingham: it was designed by 19th century architect TC Hine as a route for horse-drawn carriages to travel from the prestigious Park area to the west of the city centre, through to Derby Road. It is now used as pedestrian access from the Park to through to Derby road, an area recently regenerated by EU funding.The building opened in 1925 as the Palais de Dance, and sits at the junction of Glasshouse Street and Lower Parliament Street, a key thoroughfare into the city from the East side.This is the point at which the train lines and the tram network meet, bringing together the mid-nineteenth-century Midlands railway structures with modern-day infrastructureThis building housed the Nottingham  (1918-1953), known for its radical and non-conformist leanings. The building is one of hundreds designed by Watson Fothergill in Nottingham, whose neo-Gothic style characterises much of central Nottingham. The building is now offices, but its portico often offers unofficial shelter for Nottingham’s homeless people.The eighteenth-century building is the crossing point for central Nottingham’s pedestrians, who criss-cross the old market place as they go about their business.One of a small number of alleys that are woven through Nottingham’s centre, creating a set of hidden spaces next to the central shopping zones. Honeycomb alley houses an independent bookshop.The glass walls and industrial-style escalators move people from one zone to another, while the revealed mechanisms of the escalators reference Nottingham’s industrial past. The cut-through joins two transitional points together: the Old Market Square area, and the Lace Market.Carol Adlam is an author-illustrator and senior lecturer in illustration at Nottingham Trent University.

This is the day, in theory, when the country turns remain. Even if not a single person has changed their mind since the referendum, the demographic shift alone will have done the heavy lifting. Enough old leavers will have died and enough young remainers will have come on to the electoral register to turn the dial on what the country thinks about Brexit.The psephologist and founding YouGov president, Peter Kellner, calculates that the leave vote has been declining by about 1,350 a day, taking into account the differential turnout: the young turn out to vote much less often than the old. By using exactly the same proportion of every age group turning out to vote exactly as they did in 2016, demographics alone will have transformed the UK into a remainer nation.The true “will of the people” looks considerably more questionable if it turns out to be the will of dead people – not the will of those who have the most life ahead of them to face the consequences. Does this guarantee remain would win a referendum this year? Of course not. People are changing their minds, though polls show predominant movement in the pro-remain direction. But once a ferocious campaign gets under way there’s no knowing what might swing opinion. No one expected the leavers’ two toxic lies to spring out of the wicked imagination of the likes of Dominic Cummings and Michael Gove – £350m a week extra for the NHS and 70 million Turks destined for our shores.It’s right to fear how much further they might go in the case of a second referendum, always wrong-footing a painfully fact-based gentler remain campaign. I like the remain campaigners’ self-mocking and unshrill homemade placards on their upbeat Ode to Joy demonstrations: “Brexit – is it worth it?”, “This doesn’t seem very well thought through”, “Let’s call the whole thing off”, “CakeNotHate”,”I want to have my gateau and share it”, “I want my continent back”. Will the remainers be up to the bare-knuckle bloody fistfight of a bitter second round? Factual rebuttals are so much harder to explain than crude bare-faced lies. Can they ensure young fresh faces lead, and muzzle Tony Blair, whose Today programme contribution this morning was singularly unhelpful.One placard outside Westminster on Tuesday night read: “Who’s afraid of a people’s vote?” The answer, of course, is the leavers. Why would it anger them so much if they didn’t fear losing? They say another vote would “disrespect” democracy. But what a curious argument to suggest that when all else fails in parliament, asking the people to decide between options not available last time is somehow undemocratic.The long-time Eurosceptic Charles Moore writes in the  that Brexiters should boycott any such referendum: that can only be because they fear remain is on the rise. As for the first result being fixed in the firmament for all time, they never say for how long exactly. It will be three years since the last, so should it be five, 10, or “never, never, never!”, as old Ian Paisley Sr would be bellowing? Democracy is kinetic, on the move, as mercifully people do change their minds with changing circumstances – and populations change.A backstop is required to ensure there is no hard border in Ireland if a comprehensive free trade deal cannot be signed before the end of 2020. Theresa May has proposed to the EU that the whole of the UK would remain in the customs union after Brexit, but Brussels has said it needs more time to evaluate the proposal. As a result, the EU insists on having its own backstop - the backstop to the backstop - which would mean Northern Ireland would remain in the single market and customs union in the absence of a free trade deal, prompting fierce objections from Conservative hard Brexiters and the DUP, which props up her government. That prompted May to propose a country-wide alternative in which the whole of the UK would remain in parts of the customs union after Brexit. “The EU still requires a ‘backstop to the backstop’ – effectively an insurance policy for the insurance policy. And they want this to be the Northern Ireland-only solution that they had previously proposed,” May told MPs. Raising the stakes, the prime minister said the EU’s insistence amounted to a threat to the constitution of the UK: “We have been clear that we cannot agree to anything that threatens the integrity of our United Kingdom,” she added.Theresa May’s inexplicable intransigence makes a referendum more likely as the only resolution left available. Reaching out? With her Paisleyite steel-trap mentality, she refuses to cross any of the fatal red lines that set her on the wrong course from the start: no customs union, no free movement, no European court to oversee agreements. She cleaves to her hard Brexiters, more afraid of splitting her party than sinking her country.Jeremy Corbyn has rightly laid down just one essential red line: no no-deal Brexit. That’s the only fixed point that parliament agrees is the disaster to be averted at all costs, cabinet ministers ready to resign to stop it. But a soft Brexit where Britain obeys all rules but loses its voice and its veto over them doesn’t have his party’s support. The will of his party will before long oblige him to opt for a vote: his members overwhelmingly back one, including Momentum’s great heft. His voters are in favour, and they are mainly remainers.Labour is caught between a small number of Labour leave voters, who are often swing voters in certain seats, and the overwhelming number of Labour remainers. Kellner warns that “it would be suicidal if Labour were to facilitate Brexit”, causing a stampede against it in all the metropolitan and university seats that are also Labour heartlands. Labour needs to win in both the Mansfields and its new turf in the Kensingtons and Canterburys. Brexit is an entirely Tory project: Labour must always be internationalist remainers. Corbyn and his close circle will find the only way out of the conundrum is to ask the people. Parliament will need to force this on May – and secretly, even if she doesn’t know it, it will be a relief to her, solving her dilemma too.No one sensible bets on what happens next. Parliament must seize control in parliament when there is, in effect, no government. But logic – if logic were to prevail – suggests the only answer that will rescue both party leaders is to have a great national consultation and a referendum imposed upon them."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29dd82dc3a35da15b338ab2a4a6b113f3fb74958/0_119_3414_2048/master/3414.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=264effa75db19c9feedeff185092026c","title":"theresa may survival conservatives brexit labour power","story":"Conservative MPs sustain her not because she will deliver a good Brexit, but because she can keep Labour out of powerBack in 2017, when “strong and stable” was still a campaign slogan and not a laugh line, I sat in on a focus group of undecided voters in Harrow – home to two marginal seats in north-west London. Even then they didn’t like Theresa May much. Assuming she would be an effective negotiator, they appreciated her steeliness – the word “strong” came up twice, as did “Thatcher” and “clever”. But overall they found her unreliable and unrelatable. They described her, among other things, as a “liar”, “headmistress”, “busybody”, “uncaring” and “untrustworthy”.Comparing her to Jeremy Corbyn, one said: “He’d buy a round, Theresa wouldn’t.” When asked if they would trust her to look after their home while they were on holiday, the consensus was: “The house, yes. But not the pets.” This is Britain. If she can’t be trusted to get a round in or look after pets, I doubt May would have passed one of her own Home Office “British values” tests.Then came the dementia tax, the loss of her majority, mass resignations, the Windrush scandal, the votes of no confidence both from her party and parliament, and the deal that was dead on arrival.Indeed, to dwell on her shortcomings as prime minister, at this point, feels unnecessary. Nobody seriously denies them. She lacks a plan, a prayer, a mandate, a majority, a message or a clue. To channel Rob Fleming, the protagonist of Nick Hornby’s High Fidelity, she has lost “the plot, the subplot, the script, the soundtrack, the intermission, her popcorn, the credits, and the exit sign”.“This is now the time to put self-interest aside,” she told the nation on Wednesday night. “It’s time for us to come together, put the national interest first – and deliver on the referendum.” With 71 days to go, after a series of predictable if damning results, this is not only her best idea but apparently her only idea. It makes you wonder what she thought she was doing during the previous two years and six months.So when Westminster expresses confidence in May, it says more about Westminster than it does about her. MPs’ decision – that this is the person to lead in uncertain times through an intractable crisis to a destination as yet unknown – demands interrogation.The primary logic is of course crudely partisan. May has spent her premiership not trying to unite the country but her party. She has failed, but her party appreciates the effort. It wasn’t Westminster who backed her on Wednesday but the Tories and the Democratic Unionist party, who were paid £1bn for their trouble. Last month a third of Tory MPs said they would rather have another party leader. But having failed in that bid, they would rather have May than Corbyn as leader of their country. So more than 100 Tories voted first to get rid of her, and then to keep her.It’s not difficult to see why. Corbyn is a socialist and has proved himself to be an effective campaigner. The last 10 polls show the parties are close, with the Tories leading in four, Labour ahead in four and two tied. Given that Labour managed to close a 21-point gap during the last election campaign, May has vowed not to lead the party into another election and any successor would deepen already infected wounds, the Tories would rather muddle through than double down. So the last few months have illustrated less confidence in her than a lack of confidence in their own party to find a viable successor or prevail before the electorate.As such, May is being sustained by Conservatives not for her ability to lead, but for her capacity to persist as a combination of placeholder, blocker, piñata, instrumental cipher and lesser of all evils. Like a dancing, coughing metaphor for her failed EU deal, she remains inadequate yet more popular and less isive than any alternative they can think of thus far. They support her in precisely the same fashion Lenin advised communists to support the Labour party – “as a rope supports a hanged man”.In the coming weeks we may well see the degree to which her own party holds her less in confidence than contempt. With her standing so low and her grip on events so tenuous, those in her party keen on a solution consider her at best unhelpful and at worst an active impediment to progress. According to the Times, one “senior Tory figure” says the push for dialogue will be easier without her. “While the prime minister has huge strengths, she is not a person to have a consensus discussion with,” he said. An unnamed cabinet minister was more blunt: “She’ll suck out of the room any goodwill there is.” Meanwhile the amendment suggested by Tory MP Nick Boles, giving MPs the power to work out a cross-party agreement and put it to the vote, reduces the government to just a bit-part player.This has been a long time coming. On the night of the general election, watching her gamble fail and her majority disappear, she read the bland, prepared words she had been given. Back at Conservative party headquarters, according to Tim Shipman’s book Fall Out, one of her communications team tried to enthuse crestfallen staffers. “If there’s one thing we can do here,” he told a colleague, “it’s when she finishes we just have to clap.” In a precursor to the hollow rejoicing in the Commons after the no-confidence motion was defeated on Wednesday night, they clapped alone.The only confidence the Conservatives have in Theresa May is that she is the best person to fail at this task. They are happy to keep her there on that basis. In so far as it keeps them in power, it’s clear what it does for them. In so far as it makes an acceptable agreement more elusive, it’s not obvious what it does for the rest of us."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c22fce8bdb3bd8409311073ec9562ba8477c79f/0_41_3492_2095/master/3492.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=05fbe09e4e9776df36742771653637d3","title":"celebrity conscious uncoupling anna faris","story":"Actor Anna Faris has volunteered to officiate at her ex’s wedding. Isn’t that going a bit far?As if it’s not enough for famous people to have better skin, better bodies and better houses than the rest of us, it seems these days they are also liable to demonstrate how much better they are at getting in and out of relationships. “Conscious uncoupling” is a celebrity-endorsed attitude towards separation, made famous by Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin. The aim is to be as generous and reasonable as possible about the end of the affair, in both public and private.The current queen of gracious orcees is Anna Faris, who poured out her happiness about ex-husband Chris Pratt’s engagement to Katherine Schwarzenegger on Instagram this week, saying, “I’m so happy for you both!!” before offering to perform the wedding ceremony herself (ostensibly a genuine proposition, given that she is an ordained minister).This perhaps takes things one step beyond even the hypercivilised efforts of Paltrow and Martin, who recently revealed that things had gone so well post-breakup that he had accompanied Paltrow on her honeymoon with new love, Brad Falchuck. Are there no heights of internal and external perfection that people in the public eye won’t aim to scale?“Conscious uncoupling”, and its counterpart “conscious coupling”, are phrases that suggest the possibility of a certain level of control over the emotionally volatile matters of love, sex and attachment. At its worst, the implication is that, if you are a clever, decent person, you should be able to manage your relationships in such a way as neither to cause, nor suffer, extremes of pain, and to preserve the dignity of both parties at every point in the romantic or sexual encounter.A brief flick through literary history might suggest that this is a tall order, but Shakespeare, Stendhal and the Brontës didn’t know what it was like to contend with the constant, baleful gaze of social media. In the old days people could have tantrums, wreak revenge and die of heartbreak when their love stories didn’t go according to plan. Now it is de rigueur to retain a consistent appearance of sentimental hygiene given that everything you do or say needs to be fed into the like-machine. It’s become a competitive sport. What would people think of you if they knew you felt hurt, rejected, brimming with envy or rage? Perhaps it would seem at odds with your job as guarantor of the possibility of the charmed life.Still, is conscious uncoupling simply another unrealistic, persecutory ideal? (If Paltrow can do it, why can’t I?) Or might there be things you can do on the journey in and out of love that can truly make life easier for everyone? The term itself was coined by the American writer and psychotherapist Katherine Woodward Thomas, and the process she describes is one of radical generosity coupled with fearless introspection. In practice, this means refraining from doing most of the things people are liable to do in the aftermath of a serious emotional letdown.For instance, don’t blame the other person and badmouth them around town. Even if they really did do something terrible to you, don’t be deflected from thinking about your own role in the situation. The point isn’t to “win”, but to learn. Allow yourself truly to mourn and recover. Don’t pay heed to that hideous old adage, “happiness is the best revenge” if you want to feel better in real life, the best way is to be honest with yourself about what you’ve lost, and to be frank about any hopes you have for the future. In short, Woodward Thomas is describing an authentic grieving process, some of which is liable to be very painful, and might not look nice from the outside.The problem, it would seem, isn’t in the phrase itself, but in the cheesy public enactment of “good” behaviour. Of course it may be the case that Anna Faris is truly and unreservedly delighted at her ex-husband’s good fortune – although, to a cynic, the offer to get among the actual moment of knot-tying smacks a little of hyperbole – but one can’t help wondering about the unspoken sadomasochistic pacts between celebrities and audiences.We hold them to impossible standards, which they then attempt to demonstrate for us at goodness knows what cost to themselves, and we punish them when they let us down. We, in turn, risk finding ourselves feeling terrible when we are unable to adhere to the ideals of perfect social grace we see constantly enacted in front of us. In this alienating hall of mirrors, one must attempt to look good at all times.Losing love, and being replaced, can be terrible narcissistic blows.

The savage parliamentary mauling of Britain’s withdrawal agreement with the European Union allowed Rupert Murdoch’s pet tabloid to unveil on Wednesday morning a front page of grandly gleeful malevolence. Under the headline Brextinct, it conjured a creepy chimera of Theresa May’s head pasted on to the body of a dodo. But the thing about such surreal pictures is that it is not easy to control their interpretation. From the outside, this one seemed to suggest much more than the immediately intended message that both May and her deal are politically dead. When, it prompted one to ask, did Brextinction really happen? Was this strange creature ever really alive or was it not always a grotesquely photoshopped image of something else, a crisis of belonging that has attached itself to the wrong union? Do the events of this week point us, not towards the EU, but to the travails of a radically disunited kingdom?The dodo, after all, may be proverbially dead but it has a vivid afterlife in that great trawl of the English unconscious, Lewis Carroll’s Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland. It is the Dodo, when various characters have fallen into a pool of tears, who suggests how they might dry themselves – the Caucus-race. “There was no ‘One, two, three, and away’, but they began running when they liked, and left off when they liked, so that it was not easy to know when the race was over. However, when they had been running half an hour or so, and were quite dry again, the Dodo suddenly called out, ‘The race is over!’ and they all crowded round it, panting, and asking, ‘But who has won?’”This seems, this week more than ever, a perfect description of the state to which British politics has been reduced – a lot of frantically anarchic running overseen by a defunct creature, the Brextinct dodo. And who has won? Carroll’s Dodo, of course, decrees: “Everybody has won, and all must have prizes.” Having emptied Alice’s pockets to provide rewards for everyone else, the Dodo solemnly presents her with the only thing that’s left: her own thimble. “We beg your acceptance of this elegant thimble.”The Brexit game is patently not worth the thimble to be presented at the end of it. Yet in Theresa May’s humiliation on Tuesday, there were prizes for almost everybody else: a glimpse of opportunity for her rivals in cabinet a revival of their sadomasochistic no-deal fantasies for the zealots the hope of a second referendum for remainers proof of the near-collapse of the Westminster order for nationalists the hope of a general election for Jeremy Corbyn. But in truth nobody has won anything – it is a losing game all round.For all of this is the afterlife of dead things. One of them is Brexit itself. When did Brextinction occur? On 24 June 2016. The project was driven by decades of camped-up mendacity about the tyranny of the EU, and sold in the referendum as a fantasy of national liberation. It simply could not survive contact with reality. It died the moment it became real. You cannot free yourself from imaginary oppression. Even if May were a political genius – and let us concede that she is not – Brexit was always going to come down to a choice between two evils: the heroic but catastrophic failure of crashing out or the unheroic but less damaging failure of swapping first-class for second-class EU membership. These are the real afterlives of a departed reverie.If the choice between shooting oneself in the head or in the foot is the answer to Britain’s long-term problems, surely the wrong question is being asked. It is becoming ever clearer that Brexit is not about its ostensible subject: Britain’s relationship with the EU. The very word Brexit contains a literally unspoken truth. It does not include or even allude to Europe. It is British exit that is the point, not what it is exiting from. The tautologous slogan Leave Means Leave is similarly (if unintentionally) honest: the meaning is in the leaving, not in what is being left or how.Paradoxically, this drama of departure has really served only to displace a crisis of belonging. Brexit plays out a conflict between Them and Us, but it is surely obvious after this week that the problem is not with Them on the continent. It’s with the British Us, the unravelling of an imagined community. The visible collapse of the Westminster polity this week may be a result of Brexit, but Brexit itself is the result of the invisible subsidence of the political order over recent decades.It may seem strange to call this slow collapse invisible since so much of it is obvious: the deep uncertainties about the union after the Good Friday agreement of 1998 and the establishment of the Scottish parliament the following year the consequent rise of English nationalism the profound regional inequalities within England itself the generational ergence of values and aspirations the undermining of the welfare state and its promise of shared citizenship the contempt for the poor and vulnerable expressed through austerity the rise of a sensationally self-indulgent and clownish ruling class. But the collective effects of these interrelated developments do seem to have been barely visible within the political mainstream until David Cameron accidentally took the lid off by calling a referendum and asking people to endorse the status quo.What we see with the lid off and the fog of fantasies at last beginning to dissipate is the truth that Brexit is much less about Britain’s relationship with the EU than it is about Britain’s relationship with itself. It is the projection outwards of an inner turmoil. An archaic political system had carried on even while its foundations in a collective sense of belonging were crumbling. Brexit in one way alone has done a real service: it has forced the old system to play out its death throes in public. The spectacle is ugly, but at least it shows that a fissiparous four-nation state cannot be governed without radical social and constitutional change.European leaders have continually expressed exasperation that the British have really been negotiating not with them, but with each other. But perhaps it is time to recognise that there is a useful truth in this: Brexit is really just the vehicle that has delivered a fraught state to a place where it can no longer pretend to be a settled and functioning democracy. Brexit’s work is done – everyone can now see that the Westminster dodo is dead. It is time to move on from the pretence that the problem with British democracy is the EU and to recognise that it is with itself. After Brextinction there must be a whole new political ecosystem. Drop the dead dodo, end the mad race for a meaningless prize, and start talking about who you want to be.• Fintan O’Toole is a columnist at the  and author of Heroic Failure: Brexit and the Politics of Pain"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/22acf43ab986579a771357ca0ba3a19bc97bbf06/0_352_5400_3241/master/5400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3eb5bdf2fccdbe52b509c15153b3a457","title":"more trees are the answer to cool down our cities","story":"Leaving trees in the ground and planting new ones could help future proof new development sites against extreme heatUrban life can be an insulated existence, consisting of circling between one temperature-controlled space after another. But cities are not invulnerable to climatic changes. Indeed, when it comes to heat, they can fare worse. They are also far from homogenous. Counter to the images of “domed cities” that Buckminster Fuller proposed for Manhattan in the 1960s and that Dubai is touted to be pursuing, cities do not have equally distributed temperatures. Even if they do, the risk those temperatures represent are far from equally perceived or experienced.Australians typically pride themselves on being pretty sanguine about the nation’s extreme weather, at least when it comes to spectacular events like Dorothea Mackellar-esque “flooding rains” or disasters playing out elsewhere on our vast continent. But this week even our assumed role as the world’s most variable climate took a turn for the worse, as Australia hosted the planet’s 15 hottest sites. Many of these extreme temperatures were recorded inland in small settlements. Port Augusta, for example, with 15,000 residents, was number two on the list at 49C. Nonetheless, the heat wave rolled across the continent affecting major urban settlements such as Canberra and Western Sydney.Just as it is not merely an issue for “the inland”, heat is also far from external to cities. Heat is produced unevenly by cities themselves, especially given the way many urban settlements have been developed to date. As detailed in the well-understood “urban heat island” effect, dense building materials like concrete take longer to heat up and cool down. Metals reflect heat back into city environments. Buildings block the wind and stop the city from cooling down. Vehicles and other machinery all produce heat, including the air-conditioning that many of us rely on to cool our internal retreats. All this means that in general the outdoor environment of a city is several degrees warmer than the surrounding countryside.Australia’s cities complicate this classical view of the heat island model to the extent that city centres are close to the coast and heat is ameliorated by the immense heat-absorbing capacities of the ocean and associated breezes. But the size of Australia’s cities and in many places, their lack of greenery produces large contiguous patches of heat-absorbing and -emitting materials. Many of our cities’ heat islands are therefore better termed “heat continents” reflecting their size and inland location.For those who need or want to move around the city on foot or by bike, people are advised to stay in the shade. For this reason, the City of Greater Bendigo is working with RMIT and Spatial Vision to develop an app that enables people to find “shadeways”. But much more could be done. In some places, shady routes simply do not exist, nor do safe pedestrian or cycling routes. Increasingly cities are working to make cities more walkable in recognition of the multiple benefits that come from doing so. But these efforts need to go hand in hand with shading. In hotter cities, walkability and rideability is increasingly not only about access but about the physical qualities of those routes. Are unshaded footpaths and cycling lanes alongside busy roads really walkable or rideable? More broadly, the shading and transpiration of tree canopies can ameliorate the temperature of any space, even indoor spaces that otherwise rely on expensive and maladaptive air-conditioning.“Leafy suburbs” have a head start when it comes to seizing the temperature controlling properties of trees. They also tend to be the older, more expensive and better built suburbs and thus inaccessible to the majority of city residents who live in hotter, more air-conditioning-dependent areas and buildings. In growing recognition of trees as an important form of public infrastructure, numerous initiatives are seeking to increase tree cover.But trees take a long time to grow. They are also themselves vulnerable to heat and other climatic conditions, particularly in areas where urban development means the basics of good soil and water are hard to find. Besides tree planting and maintenance, therefore, protecting existing trees is paramount. At present, development for new housing tends to occur on greenfield sites where one of the first steps is to remove existing trees to enable the movement of building equipment and later cars. While some of this tree removal is compensated by later plantings, the net loss, uncertainty and lag time in accessing the ecological services of trees can be immense.The development industry needs to rethink the term “greenfield” towards “treefields”. This would be a rediscovery of well-known landscape ecological principles put forward by Ian McHarg and others in the Woodlands development more than 50 years ago. Designing new housing leaving the trees in the ground and the existing ecosystem in place, augmented with new strategically placed plantings, would help future proof new development sites against extreme heat by reducing the amount of heat the site itself produces. Combined with the role of trees in holding carbon and absorbing carbon dioxide and thus reducing the global warming that is worsening heat extremes, protecting existing trees in treefields and further afield is ever-more essential. The “bubble” we need to live in is not a glass air-conditioned dome, it is a tree canopy.• Marco Amati and Lauren Rickards are associate professors at the Centre for Urban Research in the School of Global, Urban and Social Studies at RMIT University, Melbourne"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/593852119748c9de0e026888a78dfc1ac28fa3d1/0_0_2800_1680/master/2800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f9163b69f530e34470c22071c04eb0fd","title":"adam curtis and vice director adam mckay on how dick cheney masterminded a rightwing revolution","story":"We asked the British journalist and film-maker to talk to the director of Vice, the new biopic of the former vice-president, about the naked rightwing power grab that he orchestratedAdam McKay’s Vice is a screwball biopic of Dick Cheney, the man widely reckoned to be the most powerful vice-president in US history. It traces his rise from beer-brained dropout to an intern during the Nixon administration, then covers his tenure as secretary of defense during the Gulf war, and his time as George W Bush’s official deputy from 2001-2009.McKay, after establishing his career with comedies such as Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy and Step Brothers, moved into freewheeling, lightly fictionalised accounts of real-life events. His previous film was the financial-crash comedy The Big Short.McKay’s kaleidoscopic approach – the narrative chopped up, and peppered with asides and data breaks – recalls the larky yet hard-hitting style of the British journalist and film-maker Adam Curtis, the person behind films such as The Power of Nightmares and Bitter Lake.The two men also share an interest in unpicking political narratives and in examining how the structure of society can be insidiously shifted by iniduals – and, of course, they share a first name. So, we asked them to sit down together for a cup of tea with Paul MacInnes at the Soho hotel in London.They began by discussing Vice’s key sequences, set in the late 1970s, when Cheney (Christian Bale) and Donald Rumsfeld (Steve Carell) orchestrated a rightwing stealth-revolution that ushered in a sustained era of Republican power and idealism.AC: The very interesting question is why the opposition let it happen. They bought into inidualism. I think the left gave up on mass politics and power sometime in the early 70s, and went for a much more inidualistic way of being radical, through art and self-expression. It became a nice way of being. But what you chart in Vice is a ruthless power grab. The really interesting thing about our time is that no one talks about power. The left don’t talk about it the liberals don’t talk about it.AM: The entire reason I made the movie was because of what you just said. Nobody talks about power any more. Honest to God. There was the whole movement of taking power that we just ignored.AC: We didn’t see it.AM: And the Democrats just rolled over. They betrayed the unions, and really started to believe in this idea of free trade, markets, banks and a load of gibberish.AC: I think you’re spot on. It’s the fundamental problem of why the left and liberals can’t find a way of challenging what’s rising up now. They gave in, and have given up talking about power. I think that’s because power is quite frightening.AC: Suddenly, you realise that you can make the world the way you want it to be. I think what you show Cheney beginning to realise is: if I get this, I can do anything.AM: Information warfare is where we’re living now. More specifically, it’s story warfare. There’s this battle in the US where our oligarchs are claiming they are the Joseph Campbell heroes. That they’re the ones who are going through the three-act structure of going into the unknown. Charles Koch is taking on the world. There’s this weird thing going on where these traditional story structures really play bogus now.AC: That’s because they have been appropriated by those people who really do have power. But that’s also because politicians have given up telling stories. They have nothing to say any longer.AM: I met with some of these Democratic leaders, and they talk about polling and market testing like they’re bad network executives. I have to tell them: the second you do that, you’re dead. That’s why the Democratic party is not tackling global warming – because it polls terribly. And why wouldn’t it? It’s about the end of human life.AC: That’s because they present it as a doom-laden dystopia, and not an opportunity to do something to change the world in an extraordinary way.AC: Exactly. Because that allows you to combine it with attacking austerity and the badness of the present day, and saying we can produce a better world, for now and for the future. But global warming is not presented as an opportunity to change the planet in an extraordinary and better way, is it? It’s a dark force that we’re being sucked into, and can do nothing about. The politicians and the thinktankers, say: “Oh my God! It’s all going to die.” My theory is that they’re late baby boomers projecting their own fear of mortality on to the planet. They’re trapping us in the depressed mind of a dying hippy. That’s my theory.AM: So what’s in the movie you’re working on?AC: Its working title is What Is It That Is Coming? At the moment, I’m on the seventh episode I think there are going to be nine episodes.AM: I can’t wait.AC: I don’t know. Yesterday was not very good.AM: I’ve been in those spots as well. A few times on this movie, we had that. I needed a “What the hell are you making?” friend. We had some screenings early on where audiences we aghast, and I was like: “Hey, we’re just starting off … relax. It’s a process!”AC: Were they aghast because they couldn’t understand the narrative or because they thought you were going too far?AM: They were aghast because the narrative was tough, and a lot of it was upsetting. People get very nervous, you know.AC: I don’t show my stuff publicly like that. I show it to my executives. I just think it’s incredibly risky to show stuff early on when you’re trying to combine, say, two or three different narratives together to make a bigger point. It’s so easy to get it wrong. Because you can see it in your brain, but they don’t know your brain.AM: You’re naked. You’re really naked. It’s like you’re going out to dinner and, before your date has arrived, you’ve opened up the door of the bathroom, and you’re completely naked and still combing your hair. That’s really what you’re doing, and it’s almost always disastrous, but I find the pain very helpful. I can take the punch in the mouth. It just keeps us honest.AC: What I find is that, increasingly, audiences are happy if you make big jumps. They don’t mind that at all, whereas five years ago, say, they would have been more wary. You did it in this film. You made this big jump in time and in subject area.AC: I think it’s because they spend their time online nowadays, making jumps.AM: I couldn’t agree more. On this movie, at a point early on, we go with Cheney to his mother-in-law’s funeral, and then we jump to him later as Dick Cheney in the modern era ordering the extraordinary rendition of a cleric. It was a 25-year time leap and the audience was, exactly like you were saying, thrilled by it. They loved the adjustment they had to make.AC: Yes. And they also feel quite flattered that you’re saying to them: “OK, catch up.” Rather than: “I’m patronising you.” They work at it and they like it. Like being a collaborator with you.AM: I’ve been trying to work on a utopian movie.AC: That would be good.AM: The idea is that nine people from our time are frozen in some accident and come back 200 years from now. And they’ve solved everything. You come out, and all the architecture has plants growing through it. There’s moss on the walls because it insulates, and they’re using light to remove trauma from people. People are just wonderful. They are playing stringed instruments, meditating and exploring space – and your plumber can paint like Picasso. And our souls are just opening up. But I want the whole movie to be done from a paranoid point of view. That the nine people are like …AC: “… there must be something wrong …”AM: “… don’t you get what they’re doing to us?”AC: “There must be a conspiracy somewhere!” Have you noticed that everyone believes in conspiracy theories nowadays? I mean everyone. I wonder if it is not just a defence mechanism against actually doing something to change the world for the better.AM: I think so. It’s more fun to pretend, and people love to think that they have the answer that no one else does. I have a relative who, I just found out, believes that the Sandy Hook shooting in the US was made up. I’m like: “Oh my God. I don’t know if I can be in a room with him.” But then we started talking about why you would ever believe this. And I think the idea is: “I know, I know.”AC: It’s an empowerment thing, I think. It goes back to politicians not telling you stories any longer. If they don’t tell you stories any longer, you’re left in this dark world by yourself where all these frightening things come rushing in.AM: We’ve been in a war of storytelling and mythology, and we have been slaughtered.AC: I think there is a great capacity among those on the left to tell good stories, but that they’re frightened of doing it. The reason is because, they say, the last time you told powerful stories you got Hitler and you got Stalin. The left has always been frightened by what they call populism.AM: I love that point – that the left is afraid of the power of power. Of powerful stories, of mythologies.AC: But you can see why it is, because this is what happened the last time you released the power of the mob, the really big crowd. There was a really interesting thing in the 1950s, after the second world war the Americans did an exhibition called the Family of Man, which was a collection of photographic portraits of people from all over the world. It was a complete sensation. It was funded by the State Department, not as a great conspiracy, but because of this idea that what you have to show people now is that we’re just a world of iniduals. Because what Hitler and Stalin had done was show us as mass crowds – and that went badly out of control and led to horror.I think that went very deep into the liberal psyche, that the mob is frightening. It’s dangerous. And that’s why, when we get to this point – where someone like Cheney and the anti-democratic forces around him have taken power away. To challenge that, you’re going to have to bring people together with a very powerful story. But that’s frightening – potentially dangerous. So the left retreat into that mantra which you find everywhere online, that we are all self-contained iniduals who all have our own little story. And we’re all going to tell each other those personal stories on Instagram and Twitter, and it’s going to be a nice, stable balance. Well, it’s too late for that now. The have-nots are fed up with that system – and are turning to powerful nationalist stories coming from the far right. But unless the left comes up with its own dramatic narratives, which offer an equally powerful vision of a better future, the right are going to win. And in a much bigger way than they’ve won so far.As told to Paul MacInnes.

This is an earnest, uneven project – an anthology of struggle in the city – that at its best shows erse London as it’s rarely seen in the movies, shot in crappy flats with stories about the migrant experience, loneliness and being broke. What struck me watching it was the uncomfortable truth in that “melting pot” comment – Londoners pride themselves on openness but plenty are guilty of barely tiptoeing outside their own postcodes and friendship networks.Only a few of the shorts are successful. In Unchosen, a young Iranian woman is told she has no grounds to appeal her rejected asylum claim. Her lawyer correctly suspects she’s hiding something – a secret that carries a death sentence in Iran. The storyline thoughtfully reverses the stereotype of “bogus” asylum-seekers. In my favourite, a rosy-cheeked toddler cheerfully takes herself off for a solo day trip to Tate Modern after her mum is distracted by a work email. This piece has no social message and is entirely unrealistic – and including a happy ending that doesn’t involve A\u0026ampE or social services – but it tickled me.Inevitably, a good chunk of the shorts are underdeveloped or let down by amateur acting. But it is an impressive achievement on a next-to-nothing budget. And how refreshing to see London without its makeup on. This is a film devoid of Richard Curtis-like fairytale – with the exception of one scene in which a woman gazes out of her window at the stars. Stars! The only place my two-year-old has seen stars in London is in books."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8602959988f49ae911fcb415fcd840e02eaa14f6/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2f4f7e1d832c86268a1c7bf1833bf160","title":"premier league 10 things to look out for this weekend","story":"Who will Pochettino turn to up front? Will Lindelöf banish bad memories of Brighton? And should Sarri start Giroud? If Mauricio Pochettino could have picked one Premier League team to start playing against without his top scorer and his most in-form attacker, then he would surely have plumped for Fulham. Claudio Ranieri’s defensively chaotic side are the perfect opponents in a far-from-ideal scenario for Tottenham, who must learn to cope without Harry Kane and Son Heung-min. It will still be interesting to see how Mauricio Pochettino tries to overcome those losses. Perhaps he will ask Dele Alli or Lucas Moura to play as a shifty striker or maybe he’ll deploy Fernando Llorente, a more conventional centre-forward who netted a hat-trick in the recent annihilation of Tranmere Rovers? Or the manager might even push his faith in youth to an unprecedented extreme by giving a start to the highly promising 16-year-old Irish striker Troy Parrott, who has yet to appear for the senior team? Whatever the manager opts for, Spurs can be confident of victory given that Fulham have been so hapless this season that they even managed to concede two goals last week despite restricting Burnley to no shots on target. PDThe talk of Claude Puel being on the verge of the sack at Leicester is a nonsense, or at least it should be. The Frenchman was booed during last week’s defeat to Southampton but fans and certain journalists seem to have the blinkers on to the wider picture, hungry for the next headline. Leicester sit eighth, one place and one point off their highest realistic target of seventh. In the last month they have beaten Chelsea, Manchester City and Everton. Yes, the FA Cup defeat to Newport was poor but more lasting positives – from Puel’s immaculate conduct and poise in the aftermath of their chairman’s death to his role in the development of James Maddison and Ben Chilwell – should endear him to both the board and his fans. Moreover, who would even replace Puel? Brendan Rodgers and Chris Coleman seem to be the favourites to replace him. Whatever the result against Wolves this weekend, Leicester should stick with Claude. MBOne of the more interesting developments of Ole Gunnar Solskjær’s brief but eventful tenure at Manchester United has been Victor Lindelöf’s drastic improvement. The centre-back has completed 90 minutes in all five Premier League matches under Solskjær and been excellent positionally sound, dominant in the air and with the sort of ferocious but well-timed tackles that made Nemanja Vidic such a cult figure. The visit of Brighton shouldn’t present as stern an examination as Kane and Son at Wembley last Sunday, the Seagulls have scored nine times on the road in the league this season, but holds a degree of symbolism for the Swede. The reverse fixture last August witnessed a performance the polar opposite of his current form as United lost 3-2, while a mistake against Spurs the following week, prompted Jamie Carragher to rule: “I actually feel a bit sorry for him, he should not be playing at this level.” Lindelöf is making that assessment look increasingly rash. JPWilfried Zaha has blown hot and cold in recent months but he is still one of the last opponents a side would wish to face when shorn of their best right-backs. The injury to Trent Alexander-Arnold, on top of the absence of Joe Gomez, means that for the visit to Anfield of Crystal Palace, Jürgen Klopp will probably have to resort to the plan that he was so eager to avoid at Brighton and use James Milner at right-back. As a bona fide utility superman, Milner can be expected to do as well in the role as he did in recent wins over Wolves and Bournemouth but that will not be good enough if Zaha is on song. On the plus side for Liverpool, having to play Milner (and Fabinho) in defence practically obliges Klopp to start Xherdan Shaqiri in midfield again. The Swiss was below par at Brighton but has previously demonstrated that he has the ingenuity required to link sharply with Liverpool’s front trio. Get that connection right and Liverpool should open up a seven-point lead on Saturday before Manchester City take on Huddersfield a day later. PDNewcastle’s 4-2 victory over Championship side Blackburn in their FA Cup third round replay on Tuesday was comprehensively their biggest of the campaign (albeit inside 120 minutes) and only time the fifth time they’ve beaten an opponent by two goals or more since the start of the 2017-18 season. On just three occasions have they found the target more than once this term while Saturday’s opponents are equally as awful in the final third, Cardiff having scored one goal in their last five games in all competitions. Unsurprisingly, the two teams rank 17th and 18th in the Premier League for chances created per game (Newcastle 7.6, Cardiff 7.4) and average shots on target (Newcastle 3.2, Cardiff 3.0), which adds up to a bleak afternoon on Tyneside. That being said, if one inidual – Salomón Rondón or Ayoze Pérez for the hosts and Callum Paterson or Víctor Camarasa for the Welsh side – can produce, it’s likely to be decisive and absolutely vital in the context of the relegation battle. JPIt will be interesting to see if Maurizio Sarri deploys Olivier Giroud against the Frenchman’s former club, Arsenal, this weekend. The World Cup winner will be itching for his first start of 2019 not only is there a point to prove to Gunners fans but with possibly the last chance to remind those in blue of his undeniable quality before Gonzalo Higuaín’s probable arrival at Stamford Bridge. Barcelona have been linked with a move for the 32-year-old this week and if Sarri opts for a more mobile central striker at Arsenal – Hazard played there last week against Newcastle – one could forgive Giroud for dreaming of Catalonia. MBNathaniel Clyne was last included in an England squad in May 2017 but his subsequent time in the wilderness at Liverpool, through injury and the emergence of Alexander-Arnold and Gomez, has left him firmly out of the international picture. That undoubtedly influenced the right-back decision to move to Bournemouth on loan where he has played 90 minutes in both of the Cherries’ games since his switch south. He’s set to make his first home Premier League start for his new club against West Ham in what will be a significant test, matched up against Felipe Anderson. The Brazilian presents a unique threat whether he opts to dribble 1v1, drift inside and potentially drag his marker out of position with Aaron Cresswell overlapping, make a run behind the defence or attempt to play one of his clever inside passes. A strong performance at the Vitality Stadium can help Clyne show he deserves to still be part of the England conversation. JPWho’s the best manager outside of the top six? Eddie Howe? Nuno Espírito Santo? Manuel Pellegrini? Rafael Benítez? He’s rarely in the discussion but, on this season’s evidence, it has to be Javi Gracia. The understated Spaniard, who on Monday celebrates a year in charge of Watford, has guided his team to seventh as the “best of the rest” and, bar a run of three defeats in late Novemberearly December, two against Liverpool and Manchester City, the expected winter slump hasn’t materialised. This is following a minimal transfer spend in the summer (approximately £26m) plus the sale of their most potent attacking player in Richarlison, highlighting the weight of Gracia’s coaching ability and the methodical squad planning behind the scenes at Vicarage Road. An encounter against a resurgent Burnley, led by Watford old boy Sean Dyche, presents its own complications but Gracia’s malleable and adaptive style has, so far, shown Watford capable of playing their way around teams or winning ugly. JPThe atmosphere at the John Smith’s Stadium has been among the best in the Premier League, even during a campaign in which results and luck have gone against Huddersfield with dispiriting regularity. But the mood could be different on Sunday as there will inevitably be at least a hint of sadness at the absence from the sideline of David Wagner, who remains much loved despite the club’s position at the foot of the Premier League and his departure from the role of manager this week. Mark Hudson, temporarily promoted from his U-23 coaching job, has the mighty task of trying to pick up a team that has not won in 10 matches and getting them to stop a Manchester City side in ominous title-chasing mode. Might there still be wonders at Huddersfield after Wagner?

If so, let us know by sharing your thoughts with our panel of education experts to examine what can be done to improve education, and make systems more equal. Whether you’re a teacher, student, academic, social worker, policymaker, parent, and wherever you are in the world, we want to hear from you.This is what Alex Beard, author of Natural Born Learners, and one of our panellists for this podcast, has to say:“Most schools today are not teaching kids how to learn. We lack a common understanding of what education is and what purpose it serves. We set national targets and arrange institutions and organise people so that they can deliver on those targets. This managerial thinking has been around for 100 years. But by standardising things in this way across classrooms, you undermine the efforts of educators.”In an increasingly interdependent world, it’s vital that we strive to understand not just what it is that makes other societies tick, but how others – be they British, Japanese, German or Argentinian – endeavour to solve the same problems that we all share. In this month’s podcast, we will be focusing on the issue of education, and how we as a global community can improve standards of education for children of all nationalities, genders, ethnicities and economic backgrounds.What are the techniques and methods we can all use to reform education models? How far are they needed, and how far can they stretch? Wendy Kopp explains the extent of the issue in her article ‘It’ll take a village to reform global education’:“More than 60 percent of primary school children in low- and middle- income countries do not reach a minimum proficiency in reading and math.

But a civil war over all that money almost toppled itBy  Jonathan Clegg and  Joshua RobinsonThe Premier League offices in London’s West End are located mostly underground. This fact alone does not make them exceptional in the world of football administration – Fifa’s lair in Zurich features five subterranean levels, including a sinister conference room ripped straight out of Dr Strangelove. But the Premier League isn’t going for the futuristic bunker vibe. Nothing about it exudes Bond-villain hideout or military robotics lab. What makes the place remarkable is its modesty. Premier League HQ feels more like the offices of a mid-sized legal practice.Blending into a row of elegant Georgian buildings with white fronts and black railings, the exterior of the Premier League offices at 30 Gloucester Place is marked only by a small silver plaque. Where it publishes its address, the Premier League points out that access is “by appointment only”. The few people who ever stop to take pictures are the tabloid photographers working the pavement whenever the Premier League managers gather for their league-wide meetings – think photos of middle-aged men in ill-fitting suits emerging from black cabs.When the league moved into the space in 2005, domestic TV rights had just cleared the billion-pound mark for the second successive cycle. Ratings were through the roof. Yet for the most popular league on the planet, the offices have none of the ostentation or scale of, for instance, the NFL’s, perched high above the corner of 51st Street and Park Avenue in New York, or the NBA’s, which are in a skyscraper two avenues over. In part, that’s because the Premier League has roughly 10 times fewer employees than the NFL or NBA, with a head count hovering around 110.Visitors to the home of the world’s most popular league are led downstairs to a small waiting area where the sofas are pointed at the Premier League trophy and a tea station. The atmosphere is one of quiet, businesslike efficiency. Until his resignation this winter, the chief executive, Richard Scudamore, kept a spartan office here, as do the aides who make sure that contracts are up to date, partners are kept happy, and the league’s extensive charity operations tick over smoothly. Scudamore, the Premier League’s highest-paid executive, earned a basic salary in the low seven figures – news of the £5m “golden handshake” he received on his way out caused a brief furore in December. But compare that to the $34m that NFL commissioner Roger Goodell earned in 2016, or the roughly $20m the NBA is believed to pay commissioner Adam Silver, and you wonder why the Premier League – for all of the cash flooding into its clubs – makes its brass look so unassuming.The reason is that the Premier League is a much smaller sporting government than any of its US counterparts. It is first and foremost a media-rights-selling organisation that happens to provide 20 clubs with a platform, referees and a ball. The organisation has six league-wide sponsors – no more – in obvious categories such as official timekeeper and official snack, and a ball contract with Nike that has quietly hummed along since 2000. The NFL, by contrast, had 32 league-wide sponsors in 2015, including an official soup.The most profitable sporting organisation to come out of England isn’t in the business of peddling merchandise either. It won’t sell you a baseball cap or scarf – it leaves that entirely to the clubs. The Premier League’s website does not even have an shop. That’s why the whole operation can be happily contained in a single office that almost nobody knows is there. But ever since 2005, that humble residence at Gloucester Place has served as mission control for the Premier League’s quest for global domination.By the time Scudamore was introduced chief executive in 1999, he could tell the Premier League was already on its way to becoming a domestic juggernaut. Sky had renegotiated its contract for UK TV rights a couple of years earlier, agreeing to pay £670m over four years, more than doubling the value of its previous deal. When Scudamore looked at the international revenues, though, he saw a world of untapped potential. The league’s overseas broadcast rights had sold for just £98m in 1997, a figure Scudamore regarded not merely as disappointing but borderline disrespectful. In his mind, the Premier League was the most exciting football competition on the planet. It was time it got paid like it.His first order of business was overhauling the way the league sold itself abroad. Until then, it had auctioned off its overseas rights package en bloc for a fixed fee, with the winning bidder then free to unpackage those rights and resell them in different countries and territories as they saw fit. He wanted to cut out the middleman and negotiate with broadcasters himself. Scudamore was a man who liked to be in the room. He immediately told the club owners that they stood a better chance of finally raking in what they were worth by breaking up the overseas rights into separate territorial packages and dealing face-to-face with the TV companies. Convinced by his commercial background, the owners signed off on Scudamore’s proposal to become their ambassador to the world.Figures like those would have been inconceivable to the men who founded the Premier League in 1992. They had so underestimated the global appetite that, in the early years of their enterprise, they were the ones paying foreign broadcasters to carry their games, not the other way around. The clamour for rights packages from every corner of the planet now convinced them otherwise.As Scudamore gradually shaped his role into that of a globetrotting executive, making visits to key markets including India, Thailand, Singapore and the Middle East during each new season, he realised that the Premier League product was equipped with a host of built-in advantages. These factors, so obvious in retrospect, meant that fans around the world were predisposed to the Premier League even before they realised it. Best of all, those advantages were a total coincidence. The league had nothing to do with their existence.The first – and most forehead-slappingly simple – is that this whole show takes place in English. While Italy’s Serie A and Germany’s Bundesliga must first help viewers make sense of names like Sampdoria and Borussia Mönchengladbach, one-quarter of the world’s population can tune in to a Premier League and immediately understand what’s happening – even if it means occasionally wading into the absurdly tedious “soccer v football” debate. (For the record, soccer, like football, is an originally British term short for “association football”.) Beyond the language, the league also benefits from its location. As countless London firms have discovered, the fact that the British business day overlaps with both Asian and American daytime hours gave the league a leg up on rival sports organisations, including the NFL and the NBA.A Premier League match that kicks off in the early afternoon can be consumed both as primetime Saturday-night entertainment in Singapore and over a bowl of Cheerios on a Saturday morning in Brooklyn. On top of all of this, it was obvious to Scudamore that overseas viewers had a sort of natural Anglophilia – and were gravitating to the heritage and culture of English football, its authenticity. In short, they craved the Britishness of it all. “Being British is the essence of what we are,” Scudamore told the Times in 2013. “It’s a bit like being the Queen or the BBC.”By the end of his first decade as chief executive, Scudamore had parlayed that headstart into tenfold increase in the value of the league’s international TV rights. Now he had to add some creativity of his own. To keep global rights fees rising, it was no longer enough simply to cut out the middleman and deal with international broadcasters directly. He needed to sell them on the idea that the Premier League rights they had just paid through the nose for were indispensable to their business model. And to do that, Scudamore developed two clear strategies.The first relied on Scudamore’s own talents as a salesman – or, to be more specific, what one Premier League owner described as his talent for “creating tension” at the negotiating table, never letting buyers get too comfortable. If that gives the impression of Scudamore as a sales shark sniffing out weaknesses and exploiting them to push his product, the reality could not be more different. In fact, Scudamore created the most fiendish auction process in world sports by running the league’s sales department with the sort of folksy, homespun charm of a village post office.He purposely kept his sales team to roughly a half-dozen employees so that broadcasters felt a personal connection when they rang Gloucester Place. And the mantra they lived by was less “always be closing” and more “always be courteous”. Scudamore’s unshakeable sense of decorum taught him that politeness was the key to preserving customer relationships. At the end of every season, he personally emailed thank-you notes to the league’s 80 international broadcasters and sent special goodbye messages to those whose contracts with the league had expired. Scudamore also began to accompany the prime minister on trade missions, taking the Premier League trophy with him. “Everyone who sees the trophy will say, ‘Wow’, he explained. “Heads of state, prime ministers – they all want a photo with the trophy. It’s what we like to call soft power.”For two decades, Richard Scudamore’s professional life had been more or less smooth sailing. He promised the 20 owners of the Premier League that he would sell their game around the world, and for 20 years, that’s what he did. But after all of that peaceful coexistence between the clubs, during which English football’s biggest institutions had made money hand over fist, built towering new stadiums, attracted huge global fan bases and transformed themselves into billion-dollar businesses, the Premier League gravy train came to an unexpected standstill in 2018, just as Britain’s trains are wont to do.For the first time in a quarter of a century, it became apparent that England’s top flight – once a model of collective harmony and mutual benefit – was racked by ision of its own the Premier League had split into a morass of feuding factions that were each blaming somebody else for threatening to blow the whole thing up. The big six clubs wanted a larger slice of the pie. The other 14 felt left behind. And the original, 1992 formula for redistributing income – the very thing that underpinned the league’s wild growth – was being challenged.The simmering tensions were mostly kept behind closed doors, in club boardrooms, in executive boxes and in the conference rooms of swanky hotels. Outwardly, it appeared that the Premier League was a picture of strength. The league was resurgent on the European stage, qualifying a record five clubs for the Champions League’s last 16, while negotiations over the latest sale of domestic TV rights meant the clubs were in line for another windfall.But amid this outbreak of unseen hostility, there was one surprise. It turned out that the biggest agitator was the one club that seemingly had the least to worry about. Not content with laying waste to English football on the pitch, Manchester City and its Catalan-Emirati leadership were pushing to overturn the league’s way of doing business.In official league meetings and private discussions with other clubs, City railed against the league’s revenue-sharing model and repeatedly challenged the age-old Founder Members Agreement – a document handwritten in 1991 by Rick Parry, the first Premiership chief executive, that held the status of Premier League scripture. The reality is that when it was written up, no one paid much attention to the overseas income. In fact, the league was losing money on international broadcasts back then as it was paying foreign networks to carry its games. “Nobody envisaged that it would be as big as it is, so sharing those rights equally was a concession they thought wouldn’t matter,” Parry said.The way Manchester City saw it, the Founder Members Agreement was more like a relic that belonged in a glass case with acid-wash jeans, the Sega Mega Drive and other treasured artifacts of the 1990s. The league’s antique formula and its quaint, old-fashioned ideas about competitive balance had allowed the Premier League to become the richest purveyor of the world’s favourite sport. But for a club like Manchester City – whose modern history dated back to only 2008, when it was bought by the Emirati billionaire Sheikh Mansour – that was all in the distant past.In truth, no one should have been shocked to learn that City gave little thought to the overall strength of the league. The club’s chief executive, Ferran Soriano, had telegraphed exactly those sentiments a decade earlier in his book about running Barcelona. Midway through a meditation on the differences between professional sport in the US and football in Europe, Soriano laid out his thoughts about the concept of competitive balance.If anything, Soriano’s conviction was even stronger now. The Premier League’s top clubs – like his – needed a greater share of the wealth if they were ever to hope of luring the world’s best players back to England.That much had been made clear to Soriano during the previous summer’s transfer window. It wasn’t that City lacked the funds to compete at the top end of the transfer market, of course. No team in world football spent more in 2017 than the £221.5m of Sheikh Mansour’s fortune that Soriano plunked down on five new recruits for Pep Guardiola’s squad. They weren’t the only big spenders in the Premier League either. In sum, English clubs splurged more than £1.4bn in transfer fees. That was all well and good. The issue for Soriano was that the summer’s headline moves for the best players and the biggest fees had not involved Manchester City. Nor had they involved Manchester United, Chelsea, Liverpool or any other English club for that matter. The juiciest transfer of the summer belonged to a different superpower in a different league controlled by a different Gulf state. Paris Saint-Germain, backed by Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund, blew a world-record €222m on the fleet- footed, flamboyantly coiffed Brazilian Neymar from Barcelona.If that wasn’t bad enough, just a few weeks later, the French teenager widely tipped to be the game’s next global superstar, an 18-year-old forward named Kylian Mbappé, had moved from Monaco for the second-highest transfer fee on record. He had signed for PSG, too.For Soriano, this was a galling development. It was one thing if English clubs had to defer to Real Madrid or Barcelona when it came to signing the game’s most prized players. The two Spanish superclubs had their domestic championships on lockdown, as did Bayern Munich. Players who signed there knew they could spend most of the season beating up on the weaklings that made up the rest of the league, allowing them to conserve energy for the occasional big game, the later rounds of the Champions League, and the serious business of lifting a big trophy above their heads.By contrast, English football was a grind. So Soriano couldn’t blame the likes of Messi and Ronaldo if they chose to spend their careers somewhere more comfortable. But there are only so many world-class players to go around. If Paris Saint-Germain were getting in on the act now, too, that was a problem. And in football, there’s only one surefire way to solve a problem. Soriano knew that if he threw enough money at them, the world’s best players could be persuaded to move to Manchester. Premier League clubs were making more than enough cash for him to do so he just needed to ensure a greater share of it flowed into Manchester City’s coffers at the expense of clubs at the wrong end of the table. It made perfect sense to him. If English football wanted to attract the world’s best players, then who could argue?When Manchester City reached the midpoint of the 201718 campaign with an insurmountable lead at the top of the table, it seemed that the rest of the season might turn into one long victory lap. But if that suggested a Premier League season devoid of suspense, the reality was far different. There was still intrigue, tension and drama out there. You just had to know where to look. For example, in the dining rooms of hip Manhattan restaurants. On a warm night in the middle of October 2017, an incongruous group of diners sat down to eat among the dark wood tables and black leather banquettes at Locanda Verde, a high-end Italian eatery in Tribeca.The group of old white guys with not much hair between them didn’t turn many heads amid the usual gaggle of well-tanned, well-Botoxed VIPs. But if anyone with a keen knowledge of English football executives had passed their table on the way to the toilet, they would have recognised that this party represented the most unlikely gathering of enemies since the heads of New York’s mafia families held their regular meetings in red-sauce joints to keep the peace. Around the table that night were Joel and Avram Glazer, the owners of Manchester Utd, along with the club’s chief executive, Ed Woodward Liverpool’s principal owner John W Henry and Ivan Gazidis, then the chief executive of Arsenal.That these clubs had ended up brushing off more than a century of mutual loathing to sit down to dinner together was due to an emerging crisis that concerned all of them. Over the previous 12 months, the Premier League’s “big six” had jointly reached the conclusion that the exorbitant sums the league were now raking in from the sale of overseas TV rights – currently worth £3.3bn – should no longer be distributed equally among the league’s 20 teams as they had been since the Premier League was first founded 25 years earlier.The way the big six saw it, some clubs deserved a larger share – specifically, them. After all, they were the ones responsible for the league’s explosive global popularity, weren’t they? They were the ones criss-crossing the planet every summer to raise the profile of English football, the ones who boasted of absurd global followings in the hundreds of millions, driving international viewership from Trondheim to Tierra del Fuego. It was only right that they should be compensated accordingly. Nobody in the US or Asia was wrenching themselves out of bed early or staying up late to watch bloody Bournemouth. Unfortunately for the big six, Bournemouth disagreed. So did the likes of Huddersfield, Brighton, Watford and the rest of the league’s smaller clubs. Which is why the executives around the table were slurping their pasta slightly more sombrely than the chef intended.John Henry, seated to the right of Joel Glazer, had come down from Boston to talk things through. Woodward and Gazidis, sitting opposite them, had been called to New York to add their input. But the group around the table knew that any hope of finding the 14 votes they would need to rip up the existing revenue-sharing agreement and draft a new one was all but doomed.Beyond that, the smaller clubs were united in opposition – and their resistance appeared to be a little stiffer than what the big six were used to steamrolling every Saturday afternoon. Within minutes of the topic being broached at the meeting earlier that month, it became obvious to the big six that they didn’t have a path to the 14-vote threshold. At least half of the league’s 20 clubs were not going to budge. The consensus was so strong that Scudamore didn’t even bother asking the clubs to go through the motions of a vote. There was no point. Instead, they had agreed to revisit the issue and try again three weeks later.But now, with seven days to go, the diners at Locanda Verde had to admit there had been no meaningful change. After years of attending Premier League meetings, Woodward and Gazidis had everyone’s voting tendencies memorised as if they were political pollsters. But when Woodward and Gazidis tallied up the two camps, even if every swing vote broke their way, they couldn’t make it work. The league was still gridlocked.Which left Henry, the Glazers and the rest of the big six owners backed into a corner. The Premier League’s revenue-sharing model, the two-thirds majority required for rule changes – these had been core tenets of the league ever since Rick Parry wrote them down on a sheet of Ernst \u0026amp Young notepaper 25 years before. They were the same tenets that had allowed English football to reach its position as the world’s pre-eminent league. But now, in downtown Manhattan, those pillars began to look as if they would have to come down. If the league’s top clubs couldn’t secure a more reasonable revenue split through peaceful means, what option did they have left? Nobody at the table uttered the words “European Super League”, but then, they didn’t need to.‘They threaten it all the time: ‘We’re going to break away,’” said one Premier League owner. “Sometimes they vaguely hint at it, sometimes they outwardly threaten it. But every time they want more money, it’s ‘Well, we’ll just go and play the big European teams.’” The spectre of a breakaway by the big six had been invoked so often during the previous decade that the Premier League now operated in a constant state of high alert, leaving even the most sober observers on edge. Which is how the Times ended up publishing a juicy front-page exclusive in March 2013 outlining secret plans for a Qatar-based “Dream Football League”, a new tournament to be played every two years and featuring 24 of Europe’s elite clubs, including Manchester United and a handful of other top Premier League teams. The DFL had the potential to “change the face of world football”, the Times story noted. Doubtless that would have been true but for one minor detail: the whole thing was a hoax dreamed up by a blogger on a satirical French website.The episode was embarrassing for Britain’s paper of record, but it got one thing right: the desire from forces inside the game to blow up the existing structures and reorganise around the most powerful clubs. In 2018, Fifa president Gianni Infantino was motivated to cook up a proposal for an expanded Club World Cup by an international consortium dangling more than $20bn. At the same time, Juventus chairman Andrea Agnelli was trying to convince his fellow superclubs to back a larger Champions League that would play on the weekends and shunt domestic league play into midweek.The big six were not shy about expressing their interest. So Scudamore responded the only way he could. Two weeks after the end of the season, he gathered the clubs again at the league’s annual general meeting in Yorkshire. Scudamore had begun to think of the year-long international rights debate as a boil that needed lancing. This time, nothing was off the table.The solution they agreed on distributed roughly one-third of all future international rights fees according to each club’s finishing position, meaning that the big six were almost certainly guaranteed a raise. To assuage the other 14 teams, they agreed that the ratio between the highest earner and the lowest earner’s payments would never exceed 1.8 to 1, a minor increase on the previous ratio of 1.6 to 1. The smaller clubs could tell themselves that the Premier League was still far more equitable than La Liga or Serie A. But as far as thebig six were concerned, they were finally on their way to righting a great injustice. In the interests of peace, the 20 clubs voted for it 18-2, and left Harrogate feeling relieved. But few gave much thought to the precedent they had just set. For the first time in 26 years, they had ratified a change to the Founder Members Agreement, the document that had governed the Premier League since its creation and provided the framework for its remarkable growth. It was as if they had taken a chisel to the Ten Commandments.Scudamore didn’t think the league would need to revisit the issue any time soon, but he wasn’t about to stick around to find out. Within hours of the Premier League’s announcement about the new revenue-sharing model, it followed up with a notice that Scudamore would step down by the end of the year.His battle to quell the big six was behind him. His UK television rights were sold – he had even brought Amazon into the fold by selling them the live streaming rights to a small package of games. And his international television rights were heading for another jackpot haul. It was time to punch out before the whole edifice started to wobble. “The stronger the Premier League is, the more successful the Premier League is, the more international rights go and generate, the more the TV deals go up, the less incentive there is for any of our clubs to go ‘Well, I’m going to leave the Premier League’,” Scudamore said. “The biggest antidote to chaos is a strong Premier League, for our clubs in England. And that’s the bottom line of it.”But he knew all too well that those outside forces would keep chipping away at the Premier League’s raison d’être, that those 20 businesses had less and less in common with one another, and that they might soon wonder why they were in business together at all. Whether those outside forces were investors from the Gulf trying to reshape the game, or even Fifa and Uefa redesigning the formats of club football hardly mattered. It was now clear that the most serious existential threat to the Premier League, itself formed by a breakaway in 1992, was, improbably, another breakaway.This is an edited extract from The Club: How the Premier League Became the Richest, Most Disruptive Business in Sport, by Jonathan Clegg \u0026amp Joshua Robinson, published by Hodder \u0026amp Stoughton and available at bookshop• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ecd5387895d5c379a2b0037128832d6bdd6fcf9/0_173_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6daf115c8fab76cbfbb224493f6b9e36","title":"how brexit unravelled today in focus podcast","story":"In a disastrous week for Theresa May’s Brexit agreement, her former director of strategy, Chris Wilkins, and the ’s Daniel Boffey chart where it all went wrong.

Readers have been debating Brexit the morning after the prime minister survived a confidence vote I think the prime minister just wants to do this “reaching out” as a PR exercise at the end of which she can announce “I tried, but no one else came up with another answer that respects the referendum... So you have accept my deal.”Her notorious rigidity is a major part of the problem. She fundamentally lacks the qualities to move this forward. Although she cannot be removed, she has to be circumvented to allow other options to be explored. SnagaThe purpose of May’s little speech last night was to play to the gallery of Daily Mail readers and to set the scene for blaming Brexit on the Labour Party. At a time when she needed to speak to the nation she was as isive as ever. GiantrobotThis is possibly the most abject failure of the British political system since the civil war. It’s the very definition of a constitutional crisis. The fact that Parliament can claim to have confidence in the government says that Parliament itself is broken. The citizens of the UK need a means of dissolving Parliament. helicanIt appears that May wants to have talks but doesn’t want to concede anything. Of course a second referendum should be on the table. The talks may conclude that it shouldn’t happen, but surely that is the whole point of talks.On Jeremy Corbyn’s refusal to meet unless she ruled out no deal, she said, “the door is always open.” Well, there’s no point having an open door if she doesn’t have an open mind. BellaTheCookCorbyn and the shadow cabinet absolutely right to insist the dangerous, flailing and failing May takes no deal off the table before they engage in any talks. May is totally responsible for this disaster and in the power of the DUP whose agenda cares nothing for the well being of the whole nation.The contempt with which May and the likes of Michael Gove talk of Corbyn is disgusting considering the harm created by Tories to our declining economy. They have made us the laughing stock of Europe. SissyJupe20May has no idea how to compromise and isn’t about to start now unless her hand is forced. The opposition parties should now unite behind Corbyn’s refusal to have a dialogue until no deal is taken off the table. At the very least they could extract from her a binding vote on it in the Commons.Ultimately though, we saw yesterday that the DUP can call time on her leadership whenever they want, so I assume they’ll be telling her what to do from now on. smazakIt’s time for Theresa May to abandon her red lines. Otherwise she’s merely trying to share blame. Without some gesture from her to indicate a willingness to actually change something, “nothing has changed”. PaulB1I don’t agree with Corbyn’s stance on Brexit but his insistence on Maybot taking “no deal” off the table is absolutely right. Impossible to talk while this vile dictatorial PM arrogantly refuses to listen to anyone except her rapidly shrinking team of sycophants. darquangeI am absolutely furious, that a bunch of self important, over privileged MPs are trying to strip young people of the same opportunities that I had. Its what you expect from the Tories who have always been the party of grumpy old men and busybodies who want to control everyone else. But what with Labour? SporadicWitIt’s beyond disingenuous to claim that Labour don’t have a plan. During the transition period, Labour want to remain in the customs union and the single market, abiding by the rules of both. Longer terms they seek to negotiate a new UK-EU customs union to avoid tariffs and prevent a hard border in Ireland. That seems like a sensible approach – maintain the status quo, but leave, allowing us time to transition slowly. We would be able to leave the customs union at any time, once we’ve begun the separation process. SharkcustardWell over 500 MPs want a no deal taken off the table. For the first time in this Brexit mess May should show good faith and stop the bullying. If she doesn’t then the short to medium problems will affect those with a bit of money dissatisfied with the increased hassle and cost of travel – and all of the other problems that come with a no deal.

Later May wrote to Corbyn telling him that ruling out no-deal was “an impossible condition” and calling on him to join cross-party discussions.With no sign of the impasse being broken, pressure is growing on Labour to consider a so-called people’s vote as the UK prepares to leave the EU on 29 March.With Corbyn’s hopes of a general election fading with the prime minister’s narrow victory in the no-confidence vote, some Labour supporters are raising pressure on Corbyn to support a second referendum.A snap poll conducted after the crushing defeat of May’s Brexit plan has found a 12-point lead for remaining in the EU – the largest margin since the 2016 vote.But the  has contacted several senior shadow ministers from constituencies that voted to leave the EU who say they would consider their positions if Corbyn conceded to pressure to back a second referendum.One said: “I would be in a really difficult position if we backed a second referendum. I would have little choice but to stand down if I was to have any hope of retaining my seat and representing my constituents.”Another said they had made their views clear to Corbyn’s office and the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer.“I would feel deeply uncomfortable about going into a people’s vote at this stage. Given all the commitments that we made in the general election, we have to carry them out. This concept of blocking Brexit is wrong and would break a link with millions of our traditional voters who expect us to keep our word,” the shadow minister said.Anti-Brexit campaign group Labour for a People’s Vote published a list of 71 Labour MPs who support its cause on Wednesday, and claimed many more were privately supportive.But backbench MPs who have been canvassing opinion claim that number is matched by vehement opponents of a referendum, some of whom would be prepared to break the whip rather than support it.Several shadow cabinet ministers, including the Labour chair, Ian Lavery, and the shadow justice secretary, Richard Burgon, are also sceptical, believing the party’s first priority must be to keep up the pressure for a general election.Lavery made a passionate intervention against a new referendum at last week’s shadow cabinet meeting. Len McCluskey, the general secretary of the Unite trade union, has also said it would be a “betrayal” to seek to reverse the 2016 result.Gloria De Piero, the shadow justice minister, told the  she was not in favour of a second referendum. “I stood on a manifesto that promised to respect the referendum result,” she said.Other shadow cabinet ministers, including the deputy Labour leader, Tom Watson, and the shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, are more sympathetic towards a second referendum.Labour strategists have not ruled out a free vote on a second referendum, believing that whipping MPs either to support or oppose a referendum would open a deep rift.Lucy Powell, the MP for Manchester Central, said that with no agreed Brexit deal in place, it was unclear what options would be offered on a second referendum – and referendums were the wrong way to resolve the complex situation.“I think they’re terrible ways to make rational decisions,” she said. “And there’s a swathe of the public who would never forgive us.”At a meeting in Hastings, East Sussex, Corbyn remained uncommitted on the idea of a second referendum, saying again that it remained one of several options if an election did not happen.Explaining why he was the only opposition leader not to meet May for one-to-one talks, Corbyn dismissed the cross-party discussions as a “stunt”, adding that May appeared unable to grasp the fact that her withdrawal agreement was now “dead”.“She seems to be prepared to send the country hurtling towards a cliff-edge,” he said.But Labour’s former prime minister Tony Blair said Corbyn was wrong to refuse to meet May.“If, in a moment of national crisis, the prime minister asks the leader of the opposition to come and talk, of course he should,” Blair told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.Another former Labour prime minister, Gordon Brown, called for the Brexit deadline to be extended by a year, as he said the country was now “more ided” than at the time of Margaret Thatcher’s poll tax.MPs should force the government to extend article 50 and then give the public the final say on a renegotiated Brexit deal, he said.Speaking in Edinburgh on Thursday evening, Brown condemned the “paralysed and immobilised” parliament in Westminster and said there was rising anger from the public who wanted to be involved in the decision-making process.The remain lead was extended further when respondents were asked to compare it to May’s withdrawal agreement or the option of leaving the EU without a deal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a1d8676be420f859d08955ef7c57b2a24447956d/0_71_4368_2621/master/4368.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a53899f2800b27e21160c5f9c248ea4f","title":"just stop messing about hastings aghast at brexit impasse","story":"Whether leavers or remainers, few in the town have good things to say about feuding politiciansThere are few things connected to Brexit on which you can find an easy consensus. But if the people of Hastings are any guide, most will happily agree on one thing: the current impasse has not painted the nation’s politicians in a good light.Immediately after Jeremy Corbyn set out his latest response to the collapse of Theresa May’s Brexit plan, the most commonly used descriptive term in the East Sussex town is “a mess”.“Just blow the bloody lot up. Especially the Conservatives,” one passerby shouted at the Thursday market as he overheard the  discussing the issue with Colette Rayner, who was spending her 55th birthday running a milkfloat stall selling organic dairy products and meat.She conceded that this view had caused some tension with her sons, one of whom lives elsewhere in the EU. Rayner produced her phone and showed a long discussion on the family WhatsApp group that ended with one son urging his mother to “stop talking about politics”.Another local, identifying herself only as Nicole, 31, also saw the issue through the prism of her children, aged 11 and four, but said she worried mainly about their future prospects.“What if they want to live in the EU? I’m not convinced the people who voted leave were the ones it’s really going to impact,” she said. “Without trying to be rude, I think a lot of older people were stuck in their ways.”Simon Eaton, 51, walking nearby with his terrier, Buster, said he backed leave but was equally aghast at where things were. “It’s such a mess. I really don’t see how we get out of this,” he said. “I despise David Cameron for putting us in this situation in the first place. It’s ided people, it’s ided communities, it’s ided the country.“I voted for Brexit purely because of David Cameron and George Osborne and their scaremongering. I wasn’t going to be patronised like that. In hindsight if we’d known what was going to happen I think the result would have been very different.”Claire Kenshole, 50, said she was particularly worried about the impact of Brexit on business, even though her area of trade – helping people release equity from their homes – was booming as people were struggling to sell properties.While Corbyn remains ambivalent about the idea of a second referendum, Kenshole said this was her preferred option. “I really hope they’re now going to push for a new referendum, and people who didn’t or couldn’t vote last time will have their say.”The most pithily eloquent responses come from a man waiting for his wife outside a shop, who declined to give his name but answered a series of quickfire questions.Theresa May? “She’ll never win anything again.” Jeremy Corbyn? “He’s an arsehole.” Would there be another referendum? “No.” How was it all going to end? “A mess.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8b3bcc204d6844226c2090bc995b707944e4aa53/72_65_1571_943/master/1571.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=244d147aaa6694783b377bbf4e685513","title":"so what is david cameron really doing now","story":"The tan, the memoirs, the sheds … the former PM’s activities have become fuel for public anger“I wonder what David Cameron is doing today,” tweeted Anneka Rice on Tuesday. “Cotswold pub lunch? Golf?” The TV and radio presenter is not principally known for her political comment, but it was clear, more than 30,000 likes and 5,000 retweets later, that she had captured something of the public mood. As his successor as prime minister endured an unprecedented drubbing in parliament with the rejection of her deal with the EU, where was the man who had set the Brexit boulder careering downhill in the first place?The answer came the following morning, when Cameron, wearing shorts and warmly tanned from a recent family holiday at a £1,728-a-night resort in Costa Rica, was stopped by reporters on the doorstep of his Notting Hill home. No, he said, he didn’t regret calling the referendum, though he did regret losing it. “And obviously regret the difficulties and the problems we’ve been having trying to implement the result.” And off he went for his morning jog, his security car trailing behind him.Anger at Cameron has been widespread since the referendum, as underlined by the response to actor Danny Dyer’s dismissal of him last summer as a “twat” who had scuttled off to Europe “with his trotters up”.Cameron had promised that he would stay on as prime minister to implement the referendum result, but less than three months later, having stood down as PM, he was gone from parliament as well, saying he did not want to be a “distraction” to Theresa May.His principal pastime, in the 16 months since, has been to work on his £800,000 memoirs, as yet untitled and reportedly already topping more than 400,000 words, having purchased a £25,000 designer shed last year in which to put down his thoughts. (He has since bought another one, and a holiday house – to add to his London and Cotswolds homes – in Cornwall.)The book, heavily predicted to round on former friend Michael Gove for backing Brexit, is now more than three-quarters written, he reportedly said in December, “but there’s no great hurry – I want to get it right”. Events have undoubtedly played a part in pushing back its original publication date last year it is now pencilled in for September and friends say he is determined to stick to schedule, but a delay in article 50 could see it set back further.Tapping out his memories, however, has left the chillaxing former PM with plenty of time on his hands – and famously “bored shitless”, according to a friend. He knocked back rumours in November that he was hankering for a return to frontline politics, perhaps as foreign secretary, though he was careful to let it be known he had not ruled out a role in public service in future.But it is notable that, in contrast to his former political ally George Osborne, who edits the Evening Standard full-time as well as his several other roles, and his former deputy prime minister Nick Clegg, now head of global affairs at Facebook, Cameron has been happy so far to pursue a lower-profile portfolio career of charitable positions, business roles and lucrative speaking engagements.He is president of Alzheimer’s Research UK and chairman of the National Citizen Service, a skills programme for teenagers, for which he is unpaid – his reported £120,000 an hour fee at the Washington Speakers Bureau goes some way to covering his expenses. With John Kerry, the former US secretary of state, he will co-chair an initiative to set up protected marine areas.Last month it was confirmed that the parliamentary authorities had cleared Cameron to lead a new £750m UK-China investment fund, whose backers include Lord Chadlington, a Tory peer and close friend of the former PM."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/30ea07aa482ac8215edc70444d5536e8465ed5c4/0_0_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0ca9100836d6a04653326a849aa318aa","title":"tory remainers second referendum","story":"As May celebrated survival, a handful of her MPs launched their own second referendum self-help groupThe fightback starts here. Maybe. That could be putting it a bit strongly. On the morning after Theresa May had celebrated surviving a no confidence vote by declaring her new Brexit plan would be pretty much the same as the one that had been defeated by 230 votes on Tuesday, a handful of Tory MPs gathered in the basement room of a central London hotel to launch their own self-help group.“My name’s Philip and I’m in favour of a second referendum,” said Philip Lee. There. He’d come out and said it. Already he felt so much better about himself. He’d taken the first step by admitting his powerlessness over the Conservative party. And he knew he wasn’t alone. There were 4 million like-minded Tory voters out there who were fed up with being lied to, who recognised the prime minister’s deal was dead and wanted to take back control of their lives by having another say on leaving the EU.It was a bold claim to make when the total membership of Right to Vote seemed to be limited to the same few Tory MPs – Anna Soubry, Sarah Wollaston, Dominic Grieve, Heidi Allen, Justine Greening, Sam Gyimah and Lee – whose views on a second referendum were already well known. But small steps and all that. Right to Vote Anonymous might now be a bit too niche and too anonymous, but if you build it, people will come. Just give it time. They had been expecting one more MP to appear but he’d pulled out at the last minute.Allen was the next to share. “My name’s Heidi,” she began. It hadn’t been easy to come out in favour of a second referendum as a Conservative. But she had hit rock bottom and was ready to collect her P45 if necessary. The Tories had to realise they were in sales and that what was currently on offer was a product that no one wanted. People recognised that Brexit was an unholy mess, that the government had no coherent plans for sorting it out and that a second vote was the only realistic solution. It’s time to be less tribal, she said. To an audience made up entirely of Conservatives.“My name’s Sam,” said Gyimah. His story was the most harrowing of all. He had been a minister on the verge of a promotion to the cabinet. Life had been sweet mainlining power. But then he realised he’d been ripped off with a dirty hit. It had been May who had been orchestrating an establishment stitch-up by trying to keep parliament out of the loop over her shabby deal. Her only interest was in delivering a third-rate future so she could claim bragging rights for having delivered some kind of Brexit.Though all three were happy to offer their experience, strength and hope they were short on details of where they went from here as they hadn’t yet got round to writing steps two to 12 of their 12-step programme. There would be an extension to article 50 and more people would come along to their meetings. For now it was enough for them to have provided a safe space where no one could be harassed or bullied.They realised it was a tough call to get others on board, but if people felt shy about sharing in meetings they were welcome to just come along and listen. The second referendum could be won by spiritual osmosis. And if that was still a bit too scary there were mindfulness weekend starter packs on offer and some hot yoga – complete with Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop patented “Namaste” scented candles that were guaranteed to aid conscious uncoupling from the Tory party. Special discounts available for those taking part in Dry Second Referenduary, with key rings handed out to those who got to 30 days clean.Right to Vote Anonymous might have had the air of a People’s Front of Judaea tribute act, but it was no less of an alternative lifestyle to any of the others on show. Despite having lost his no confidence vote in parliament the previous evening, rather than chatting to May – a tough gig, but someone’s got to do it – Jeremy Corbyn had headed off to Hastings to launch a general election campaign for an election that wasn’t happening. Call it a dry run.Meanwhile back in Downing Street, the prime minister was having talks about Brexit in which nothing she didn’t want to talk about could be mentioned. We are now in a dystopia of parallel worlds in which everyone is pursuing their own personal growth programme for which there is no parliamentary majority. We’d have more chance sorting the whole thing out with tarot cards."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb3a96e3a4c82100d273e40c7e7a9bfa42a541be/0_368_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6210d7ab58c3c95c77181ee29ee3fb64","title":"asteroid strikes earth moon threefold dinosaurs","story":"Planet and moon have been hit by more asteroids in the past 290m years than at any time in previous billionThe rate at which asteroids are slamming into Earth has nearly tripled since the dinosaurs first roamed, according to a survey of the scars left behind.Researchers worked out the rate of asteroid strikes on the moon and the Earth and found that in the past 290m years the number of collisions had increased dramatically.Before that time, the planet suffered an asteroid strike about once every 3m years, but since then the rate has risen to once nearly every 1m years. The figures are based on collisions that left craters at least 10km (6.2 miles) wide.“The cratering rate changes instantaneously,” said Thomas Gernon, an Earth scientist at the University of Southampton and a fellow of the Turing Institute. “There’s an order of two to three increase in asteroid strikes from 290m years ago.”The findings suggest that the dinosaurs may have been unfortunate in evolving 240m years ago, just as the odds of being wiped out by a stray asteroid were ramping up. It was one of those impacts, on top of other factors, that did for the beasts 66m years ago.Many scientists had assumed that asteroid strikes were a rare but constant threat in Earth’s deep history, but the latest study challenges that belief. “I was surprised to see the change,” said Rebecca Ghent, a planetary scientist at the University of Toronto. “There was no reason to think that the rate would be any higher than in the past.”Writing in the journal Science, the researchers describe how they turned to the moon to examine the violent history of Earth. The Earth and moon are hit by asteroids with similar frequency, but impact craters on Earth are often erased or obscured by erosion and the shifting continents which churn up the crust. On the geologically inactive moon, impact craters are preserved almost indefinitely, making them easier to examine.Using images from Nasa’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, the scientists studied the “rockiness” of the debris surrounding craters on the moon. Rocks thrown up by asteroid impacts are steadily ground down by the constant rain of micrometeorites that pours down on the moon. This means the state of the rocks around a crater can be used to date it.“When you have a fresh impact you get a lot of large rocks that sit around the crater, but over time they get bombarded by small micrometeorites and are transformed into lunar regolith,” said Sara Mazrouei, the first author of the paper and a planetary scientist at Toronto.The dates revealed that the moon, and by extension the Earth, has suffered more intense asteroid bombardment in the past 290m years than at any time in the previous billion. On Earth there are hardly any impact craters older than 650m years, most likely because they were eroded when the planet became encased in ice in an event known as Snowball Earth.Christian Köberl, director general of the Natural History Museum in Vienna – who was not involved in the study, said that while there appeared to be a rise in asteroid strikes in the past few hundred million years, the lack of craters on Earth older than 650m years “must be homemade, as a result of terrestrial geological processes”.William Bottke, a researcher on the team at the Southwest Research Institute in Colorado, said the uptick in asteroid strikes was probably caused by one or more giant space rocks breaking up in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter about 300m years ago. When asteroids collide they produce a swarm of fragments that can find their way on to collision courses with the Earth or moon. “If the initial breakup is large enough, the increase in impacts can last for hundreds of millions of years,” he said. The question now is whether the rate of asteroid strikes is still rising, or perhaps falling back to a lower level. Either way, Ghent believes there is no cause for alarm. “Because large impacts are very rare in the first place, even if you double or triple the probability they are still very rare,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/51131c6aabbec443bb0810622121eae71432d00e/0_340_5100_3060/master/5100.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f0ff649415236799e8249e20f7f38760","title":"east of england local government agency to close brussels office","story":"Decision leaves region, which had received €450m of EU funds, with no voice in EuropeA Brussels office that acts as conduit for hundreds of millions of pounds worth of EU funds for the east of England is to shut because councillors have pulled the plug on the relatively small subsidy they give to it.The closure of the Brussels office of the East of England Local Government Association (LGA) has been described as premature and “ideological” at a time when doubts still persist about the type of Brexit that will materialise.While councils will be able to point to cost savings, supporters of the office blame political motives.“The east of England is strongly conservative in political terms and the truth is that some people have never liked us,” said one official familiar with the office, who described the closure as “cutting off your nose to spite your face”. The official added: “For 20 years they have hated us and this is just a convenient way of closing us down.”Staff at other offices representing English regions and cities fear the closure of one of the oldest and largest representations in Europe will have a domino effect, leaving England with no voice while Welsh, Scottish and Northern Irish offices remain during any post-Brexit transition period or if a soft Brexit is agreed.A management committee, including Conservative and Ukip MEPs from a region that voted overwhelmingly for Brexit, will meet on Friday to consider options for retaining the office but is expected to endorse the decision to end the annual £159,000 funding from 52 councils.A briefing document for members of the management committee, seen by the , warned that the decision of the East of England LGA to disinvest in the office will have a “major impact”. It stated that the office is no longer viable even with the continuing support of smaller subscriptions from Anglian Water, and universities and concludes it will be necessary to wind it down from the end of March.The decision contrasts with recent moves by Cornwall to keep a Brussels “embassy” open. While Cornwall benefits from EU funding as a result of being the only English local authority categorised as a less developed region (LDR), the east of England received €450m (£395m) in EU funds between 2014 and 2020 for economic development and regeneration. It got €528m for 2014-2018 to fund research and innovation, mostly at universities.Alex Mayer, Labour MEP for the East of England and a member of the management committee, said: “I’m hugely disappointed by this ideologically blinkered decision by local Conservatives.”“We are putting up a ‘closed’ sign on the east of England. This is so deeply sad for an amazing part of the world that is a global player in life sciences, communications and manufacturing.

The Turkish authorities in turn have accused him of having links with an armed group behind a failed coup in the country in 2016.Last month Kanter decided to miss the trip to London fearing he could be “killed by Turkish spies” – and his apprehension only increased on Wednesday when a Turkish state news agency revealed the country was seeking an international warrant for his arrest.When Silver was asked about the case at a press conference before the game, he made it clear where his sympathies lie. “I think it is very unfortunate Enes Kanter is not here with the New York Knicks but I absolutely understand his reasoning,” he said. “There is nothing more important to me as the commissioner in the league than security and safety of our players, even it is just on social media, so we take very seriously the threats that he received.”Silver also made it clear that the NBA had not intervened to keep Kanter away from London. “There are significant issues that he is dealing with, and I recognise that for the NBA, by virtue of the fact that we’re a global business, we have to pay a lot of attention to those issues as well,” he continued. “I support Enes as a player in this league and I support the platform that our players have to speak out on issues that are important to them.”On Wednesday Kanter admitted that he felt “trapped” in the US because of the international warrant for his arrest and reiterated that he did not feel safe coming to Britain. “Erdogan’s long arms are everywhere, so that’s why I didn’t really feel safe to go to London,” he said.“The Turkish government put a red notice under my name with Interpol when my team was on the flight, still in the air, so if I went to London, as soon as I left the plane they would send me back to Turkey.”Kanter, who supports the Turkish preacher Fethullah Gulen who Turkey blames for being behind the 2016 coup, also denied being a terrorist. “The only thing I terrorise is the rim,” he wrote on Twitter.The Knicks could have done with Kanter as they lost despite leading 89-77 going into the final quarter. At that stage the Wizards – heavy favourites beforehand – had looked as flat as the 20,000 crowd.Yet as they began a run, aided by successive three-pointers from Otto Porter Jr and Bradley Beal, they finally went ahead. The teams traded leads in the final two minutes, with the Knicks going ahead 100-99 with just 3.3 secs remaining.The match was finally settled at the death when referees ruled that Knicks’ Allonzo Trier was called for goaltending on a layup attempt by Thomas Bryant with 0.4 seconds remaining – giving the Wizards a 101-100 victory.It was the Knicks 34th loss in 44 games, while the Wizards’ record improves to 17 wins and 18 defeats.

However Russia had refused to cooperate until Wada’s executive committee controversially decided to lift the suspension of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency in September. That decision angered many athletes and other anti-doping agencies – and their frustration only increased when Russia then missed a 31 December deadline to let Wada have the data.However Wada’s president Sir Craig Reedie hailed the news as a “major breakthrough for clean sport” after Wada’s three-strong team of experts finally completed its Moscow mission on Thursday.“It shows we are continuing to make real progress that simply would not have happened without the 20 September ExCo decision,” Reedie added. “The long impasse around access to the former Moscow Laboratory has been broken and that is significantly good news.”However many in the anti-doping world remain sceptical of Russia, with rumours rife that the original data may well have been wiped by the authorities.

The Swiss remains on another level and, although stretched by Dan Evans on Wednesday, he looks up for the challenge from any of the young contenders who are increasingly making their presence felt.On Sunday, he will test himself against one of the best of the rising prospects, Stefanos Tsitsipas, who had to fight hard to get past the 19th seed, Nikoloz Basilashvili, in five sets. Tsitsipas – whose 21st birthday in August arrives four days after Federer’s 38th – had earlier joked he would be thrilled to play him next, but hoped it would be Fritz.“If I had known that Roger was 2-0 up when I said that,” he confessed later, “I probably wouldn’t have said it.“I learned a lot since my last match with him. I know the patterns that he’s using a bit better now. He’s serving really well, so I’m going to have to utilise his, and take advantage of my returns as much as possible. I’m pretty sure he’s going to be serving well, so the return games need to be aggressive and pressing a lot.“He’s a legend of our sport. It will be a great day facing him in one of the best arenas, Rod Laver. I’m really excited for that match.”Responding to the suggestion that Federer regarded him as a quiet type, Tsitsipas said: “I do all my talking in the court. Actually, I was shy when I was a kid but not anymore. I think I’m comfortable meeting new people and having a discussion with someone. But not many of the players want to be friends on the tour. That’s a problem, that’s an issue – unless you speak the same language. That’s why you see all these Spaniards, Latin Americans, hang out with each other. Then you have Asian people with each other. So that makes sense.”There will be no contempt when he and Federer become more familiar – almost certainly on Laver again – but plenty of mutual respect.“I’m happy I played against him at the Hopman Cup,” Federer said of a match in which he needed two tie-breaks to win and take Switzerland through to the final. “He played really well there. I actually did too. It was really high-quality tennis. This is obviously a different type of match, it being best of five, and the fourth round of a slam.“I like how he mixes up his game and also comes to the net. So will I. I think we will see some athletic, attacking tennis being played.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1a6e83dc022271fd851aa4bbb532d002513d4238/0_134_3740_2245/master/3740.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=622d69fc45d4efab303e97c056b79b8f","title":"australia v india third one day international live","story":"9th over: India 25-1 (Dhawan 12, Kohli 4) Richardson is enjoying his day so far, just a dozen runs from his five overs. Two singles from this one. He’s been brisk but not super fast, around the 140 mark.8th over: India 23-1 (Dhawan 11, Kohli 3) Dhawan is into his stride now, harvesting ones and twos from Siddle with relative ease. Kohli’s first shot isn’t exactly what he intended, ging the ball away in the air through cover, though it gains him three runs. Tough to time on this pitch, it seems.7th over: India 16-1 (Dhawan 7, Kohli 0) Whew, listen to the ovation as Kohli comes to the crease. Big crowd in at the MCG and they’re giving it the big ones. He sees out most of Richardson’s over without troubling the scorers.“Good afternoon Geoff,” writes Mahendra Killedar from somewhere where it’s the afternoon. “230 is vintage stuff. Can I order a hard-fought low scoring humdinger please?”You can now.6th over: India 15-1 (Dhawan 5) Siddle bowls his first bad ball, and Rohit plays the drop-kick again, over square leg with a bit more timing, and despite plugging in the slow outfield this shot trickles and ambles and meanders into the rope at last. But Siddle has the final chuckle, last ball of the over. Some seam movement again, squares him up as Rohit tries to go across the line, and it ends up in the hands of Shaun Marsh at slip.5th over: India 10-0 (Rohit 5, Dhawan 5) The field is up, and twice the batsmen find a gap and get back for three. Rohit drop-kicking one over square leg, Dhawan slashing through point. Neither shot was quite controlled as they try to adjust to this surface. 4th over: India 4-0 (Rohit 2, Dhawan 2) Siddle is looking good today. His kind of conditions. Cloudy, humid, sticky. Probably this pitch is tacky as well, if Melbourne is Melbourne. After cutting the ball in to beat the right-handed Rohit last over, he cuts the other way to beat Dhawan in this over. Past the inside edge and not far past the stumps. Just a Rohit single from the first ball for Siddle.3rd over: India 3-0 (Rohit 1, Dhawan 2) Richardson errs once in the over, on the leg stump, and Dhawan middles a glance for two. Other than that, he plays each ball to the off-side field. That’s the luxury of chasing a small total, you can take your time to get set. Dhawan likes playing in his adopted home town, made a World Cup century here in 2015 if I recall correctly. 2nd over: India 1-0 (Rohit 1, Dhawan 0) It’s a maiden for Siddle with that review in the middle. Hey diddle diddle. Siddle gets Finch to go upstairs after hitting the back pad. Good ball, it cut into Rohit and beat his inside edge. DRS says it’s smashing middle stump, but just enough of the ball is above the stump line to qualify for umpire’s call on height. Australia keep the review, India keep the batsman.1st over: India 1-0 (Rohit 1, Dhawan 0) Jhye Richardson will commence formalities with the ball, from the Great Southern Stand end. He’s on the money, and the Indian opening pair is happy to go quietly through his over.Hello friends. Australia continue to underwhelm with the bat this summer, which is nothing new. It’s a sticky dull sort of evening, still plenty of daylight, and now the bowlers in gold have to come up with something special. Fantastic bowling. India deserved to take all ten Australian wickets with all the chances they created from start to end. Only when Kohli raced through 13 overs with his part-timers at the conclusion of the power play did Australia score with ease, albeit almost exclusively in singles. Chahal was held back but when he came on in the 24th over it was the beginning of the end for the hosts as far as a big tally was concerned, both Marsh and Khawaja removed in the leggie’s first over. When Handscomb was joined by Maxwell they threatened to get on top again but that didn’t last long, the latter top-edging a bouncer that didn’t get up. The Victorian captain top collected a tidy half-century and did the best he could with the lower order (adding 45 with Richardson), but the damage was largely done.After coming so close to knocking off India to win the series in Adelaide on Tuesday, the home side only have 230 to play with after the dinner break. With the power and nous Kohli’s side have through their batting list, that should be nowhere near enough. For the chase, stick with Geoff Lemon. Bye for now! Chahal speaks! “This is an amazing feeling. I have been playing this game after so long and this is my first match in Australia. Obviously, when you contribute for your team with my second five-wicket haul, it is such a great feeling.”Shami deserved a second wicket to finish it off, his full delivery to Stanlake sneaking through and smashing into his leg stump. Australia fall eight balls short of batting out their overs, leaving India just 231 to win the series. 48th over: Australia 229-9 (Siddle 9, Stanlake 0) What a spell from Yuzvendra Chahal, 10-0-42-6 his final figures. Kohli didn’t bring him into the side until the decider and held him back today while the left handers were building. But he picked up both of those the space of four balls and that was just the start of it, finishing with the best bowling for an Indian at the MCG in an ODI. Lovely work. CHAHAL HAS SIX! Zampa danced at the spinner, trying to smash him over his head but didn’t get enough of it, Shankar taking the easy chance down at long-on. He has two balls left to make that a very rare ODI 7-for!47th over: Australia 227-8 (Zampa 8, Siddle 7) Siddle off the mark with a hit-and-run push to Kohli at cover, which would have left him several metres short had the Indian skipper nailed the direct hit. Back on strike due to the overthrow, Siddle gets low and lifts Shami over the slips for four! Clever from the veteran.  Quite superb wrist spin from Chahal, picking up his fifth with a wonderful toppie that Handscomb missed from deep in the crease, the ball on track for middle stump when it struck his back pad. He went upstairs because he had no choice as the final recognised batsman. Very, very out. 45th over: Australia 216-7 (Handscomb 58, Zampa 4) You can’t ask for more much more than that from the new man Zampa, scoring from each ball he has faced so far, Handscomb adding a couple down the ground and three in the gap to midwicket. Nine off the Bhuvi over. Will Handscomb try and take down Chahal?44th over: Australia 207-7 (Handscomb 52, Zampa 1) Zampa is off the mark with a single to square leg, keeping the strike. It is not for nothing that the South Australian does have nine professional half-centuries to his name. That’s four for the leggie! On the leg stump line, Richardson mistimes a clip in the direction of Jadhav at midwicket to completes the ing chance. The end of a productive 45-run union.43rd over: Australia 205-6 (Handscomb 51, Richardson 16) A balletic error on the rope, Jadeja leaping over the ing sub Rayudu, but they can’t keep the ball off the rope, giving Richardson his first boundary down to fine leg. The West Australian is growing in confidence, striking the final ball sweetly for two more to deep cover. The modern game is such that all of these young quicks can bat a bit.42nd over: Australia 197-6 (Handscomb 50, Richardson 9) Chahal probably won’t bowl out his ten but he is every chance to pick up five, back now for a crack from the Great Southern Stand End. Both batsmen are now hitting the sweepers well enough, Handscomb’s feet and wrists in concert, but boundaries are going to be hard to come by without a fair degree of risk. With a second single down the ground, Handscomb moves to his third ODI 50, getting there in 57 balls. It’s hard to fault the way he has played over the last week, now a big chance to go to the World Cup - even with Smith and Warner back into the mix. 41st over: Australia 193-6 (Handscomb 48, Richardson 7) It says a lot about how good India’s seam attack was during the Test series that Bhuvi could not get a start. He’s so accurate, always moving the ball around off the seam, very hard to get away. It takes Handscomb three attempts to get him down the ground, Richardson playing a nice flick to midwicket, Handscomb keeping the strike with a glide through the vacant cordon. Bhuvi’s current analysis: 7-1-19-2. 40th over: Australia 190-6 (Handscomb 46, Richardson 6) Handscomb takes Shankar on over midwicket and finds the gap, giving him his second boundary. He’s giving himself every chance to put the foot down in this final ten, provided Richardson - who is looking solid - can stuck around for the bulk of them.39th over: Australia 182-6 (Handscomb 39, Richardson 6) Bhuvi’s back and making very difficult work of it for Handscomb then Richardson, the latter beaten with a beauty that deserves to kiss his outside edge, the off stump or both.38th over: Australia 181-6 (Handscomb 38, Richardson 6) Shankar, the man on debut, is back with his accurate medium pacers. I miss the days when the ODI game had space for one seamer sending them down at this far more gentle speed. Indeed, Tim Wigmore wrote a nice piece about this. He does the trick here, going for three singles, making 015 from his five.37th over: Australia 178-6 (Handscomb 36, Richardson 5) Shami’s short balls to Maxwell varied in bounce, so he is right to have a pop at Handscomb and Richardson too, both scoring behind the wicket. A nice clip from the Victorian captain follows for two, Richardson finishing with a fine cover drive for two as well.36th over: Australia 171-6 (Handscomb 32, Richardson 2) Jadeja goes again, now into his ninth on the bounce. Handscomb continues to tick over, albeit with a boundary from the outside edge on this occasion. But he’s hitting the sweepers well and using his feet confidently. Richardson does likewise, getting his first runs.35th over: Australia 162-6 (Handscomb 25, Richardson 0) Australia’s final four batsmen average single digits in this form of the game. Uh oh. BHUVI! What a wonderful catch! Shami is back and has successfully won Maxwell’s top edge. He got away with something similar earlier in the over but the second didn’t get up, flying down to fine leg off the edge but with a lot of work to do for the fielder, a task that Bhuvi was up to with an athletic forward e. Fantastic work from Kohli as well to back in his fast bowler to make the big breakthrough. If they weren’t before, Australia are in real strife now. 34th over: Australia 153-5 (Handscomb 21, Maxwell 22) Maxwell is changing this game of cricket, flogging the full toss that comes early from Chahal then driving him superbly to finish, getting down the pitch and splitting the gap between the sweepers at deep cover. A glorious shot to push back against the man who has had the Australians’ measure from the moment he came to the bowling crease. 11 off it.“He’s got too much of a gift,” Michael Vaughan says of the flaw of Maxwell batting seven, noting that the rest of the world will be very happy he isn’t higher up.33rd over: Australia 142-5 (Handscomb 19, Maxwell 13) Maxwell smashes another half tracker, this time coming from Jadeja. Our list of ‘Do Nots’ from earlier? Do Not bowl short to Maxwell if you are a spinner. In response, Shane Warne says that Maxwell brings, before a ball is bowled, the fear factor. “They know what he is capable of, and I think when you have Khawaja, Marsh and Handscomb together you can bowl to those guys. But Maxwell brings the fear factor. Who would you rather bowl to? The guys who they can contain runs with. That’s why I think they made a mistake batting Maxwell at seven.”32nd over: Australia 135-5 (Handscomb 17, Maxwell 8) Handscomb lucky! He completely miscues Chahal, edging him high up to midwicket but Shankar, running back with the flight, cannot make it in time despite his best efforts. In response, Maxwell smashes a shorter legbreak over midwicket for four.31st over: Australia 128-5 (Handscomb 15, Maxwell 3) “They have got to bat the next ten overs these two,” says Mark Waugh on TV. “It is simple as that. It is as long a tail as I’ve seen in an Australian team.” True, that. Back to Jadeja to Maxwell, the No7 striking along the ground to cover, Handscomb then going down the ground. They then repeat the same shots for the same result to finish. “Finally Chahal helping Maxwell,” emails Mahendra Killedar. “He can bat full 20 overs today.” Too right. Geoff and I did a 60-minute aural history of Glenn Maxwell in our Final Word live podcast show last night, so I’m fairly invested in all this.30th over: Australia 124-5 (Handscomb 13, Maxwell 1) Out walks Maxwell, wearing his baggy gold baseball cap. He’s off the mark second ball to long-on. He’s done it again! Chahal gets a lot of turn on this leg break, spinning across Stoinis and collecting his edge on the way through to Rohit at slip, completing an excellent one-handed snaffle ing to his right. 29th over: Australia 122-4 (Handscomb 12, Stoinis 10) That’s a good over of consolidation for Australia, five of Jadeja’s deliveries scored off around the ground, worth seven to the hosts.28th over: Australia 115-4 (Handscomb 9, Stoinis 6) Handscomb once again is rotating the strike from the first ball but Stoinis finds a way to immediately score himself this time, crashing a drive past the bowler for four. Another four dots in a row do follow, though. It is a habit he has to break. 27th over: Australia 110-4 (Handscomb 8, Stoinis 2) Handscomb has started well, jumping at Jadeja’s first ball and stroking it carefully to long-off. But Stoinis can’t do likewise, tied to the crease for the final five balls. His strike rate early in an innings is a talking point on TV, sitting at about 65 on average for his first ten balls.26th over: Australia 109-4 (Handscomb 7, Stoinis 2) Stonis off the mark with a nicely struck drive down the ground, Handscomb also taking a single in that direction. They finished with one more each off Chahal, to the boundary riders at deep point and square leg. I’m looking forward to seeing how Stoinis goes about this task. 25th over: Australia 105-4 (Handscomb 5, Stoinis 0) Good start from Handscomb against Jadeja, advancing then clipping for two. Later, he was again using his feet before driving a couple down the ground. He has to bat for 15 overs here, given he was picked for this side mainly due to how well he plays spin.“Re Australia v Afghanistan,” tweets Geoff Foley. “I’d put firm money on Afghanistan if the game was to be at Ciderabad. Although the odds would be so short as maybe to not warrant it.” For those who don’t follow the county championship, Ciderabad  Taunton, which turns like the subcontinent. Bristol spun plenty during the Women’s World Cup a couple of years back, but I think the skill of the bowlers will be the biggest issue.Two wickets in four balls, Chahal dismissing both of the left handers! It’s a soft one too, Khawaja trying to turn a topspinner into the leg side, the leading edge ballooning straight back to the bowler instead. “Why didn’t he hit it harder?” Michael Vaughan ponders. “Why didn’t he hit it straighter?” 24th over: Australia 101-4 (Handscomb 1, Stoinis 0) Chahal finishes with an accurate wrong’un to the new man Stoinis. What a fantastic first over: 22.Chahal does it second ball! The legspinner misses down the legside but Marsh was on the advance. Once he missed the ball he was in real strife, Dhoni getting the bails off just before the No4 got his bat back. The decision was sent upstairs but Dhoni knew - he always knows. Watching the replay a couple of times, that’s very good bowling from Chahal to see Marsh coming and direct his delivery wide. 23rd over: Australia 99-2 (Khawaja 34, Marsh 39) Seven off Jadeja’s third, punctuated by a picture-perfect Khawaja reverse sweep through backward point. He’s turning into one of the best reverse sweepers in the country. 22nd over: Australia 92-2 (Khawaja 29, Marsh 38) Kohli backs Jadhav to go again despite his poor previous set, and he is rewarded for it with only four runs taken to the sweepers. He’s bowled six overs Chahal is yet to get on.21st over: Australia 88-2 (Khawaja 28, Marsh 35) As is often the case an an ODI with two spinners bowling, I’ve fallen behind a bit here, so let me just relay that eight were taken off Jadeja’s over, all to the sweepers in the smaller money. They’ve started confidently against the experienced tweaker.20th over: Australia 80-2 (Khawaja 25, Marsh 31) Marsh got the memo, taking Jadhav down for 15 off this over, by far Australia’s best of the innings. It started with a smashed boundary through midwicket off a long hop, three then cut through point before he replicated the first shot off another half-tracker. Runs came from every ball of the set, Khawaja doing his bit too. Pratik Dubey makes the very reasonable point that Jadhav’s numbers are a lot more impressive than one would expect. “He makes key breakthroughs and doesn’t give away many runs. Makes me wonder if he may be the worst looking successful part time bowler, anyone else you can think of?” I’ll put some thought into that. Any nominations from the floor to get us going?19th over: Australia 65-2 (Khawaja 22, Marsh 19) Shankar’s job is done for now, giving up just 12 runs in four overs. Form his end, Kohli turns to Jadeja to tighten the screws once more. The champion spinner is not quite on the mark to begin though, spraying a couple down the legside to Marsh after Khawaja turned another misdirected delivery to fine leg. 18th over: Australia 59-2 (Khawaja 19, Marsh 18) A fourth over for the sixth bowler Jadhav, once again just going for four singles. I understand that it is important not to lose a third wicket at this stage but Virat is taking the you know what and it is working a treat. In fairness, the offspinner has really found his range and is is giving it a rip, beating Marsh with the final ball. Per our earlier topic, Marsh is lucky he didn’t drag that back foot.17th over: Australia 55-2 (Khawaja 17, Marsh 16) That’s more like it, Marsh putting away a shorter delivery from Shankar, pulled hard through midwicket to bring up the Australian 50 as they take their first drinks break.16th over: Australia 49-2 (Khawaja 16, Marsh 12) There is room for one anchor in a successful ODI team in 2019, but two? Can Khawaja and Marsh co-exist? With Jadhav skipping through another over worth only four runs to the home side, I do wonder. There was an outside edge in there as well, Marsh lucky not to be walking off, deflecting into the end of Dhoni’s gloves rather than the webbing.15th over: Australia 45-2 (Khawaja 15, Marsh 9) There is nothing theatening about Shankar but they can’t get him away. Nor are they trying to for that matter, happy to take a few risk-free singles. “It feels like we are watching a game from 1986,” says Andrew Wu, my press box colleague, of current score.

I’m sure there’ll be more reaction and further AO goodness shortly when the Nadal vs De Minaur liveblog fires up. Until then, thank you for your company, and goodnight!Former British number one and Eurosport UK tennis expert Annabel Croft has had her say, and I agree with every word.“It was a huge win for Maria Sharapova and a thoroughly deserved one. She was the better player today, particularly in the latter stages of that final set - she had more firepower, more weaponry. She was braver, those second serves were quite outstanding and she took more risks. The fact she was able to push Wozniacki right behind the baseline on those second serves said it all. Maria went after it and it paid off today.“This really was a cracker of a match. In many ways, the ball striking between the two of them between Konta and Muguruza was even more mesmerising whereas this had dips and flows. I thought it was interesting to hear Sharapova say she hasn’t had much opportunity to play the top players in the last 2-3 years, but that it was she had trained for and it was rewarding to get that job done on the last point today. Maria had to work hard for that win today but I thought she was the better player.”That’s a result that has major ramifications for the WTA Rankings. Wozniacki left Melbourne last year as world number one, began this tournament ranked three, but falling so early this time around will see her plummet to no better than ninth when the next standings are published. Sharapova looked up for that victory from the opening serve, and probably would have won more convincingly had she been able to curb her enthusiasm early in a number of rallies curtailed by unnecessary errors. Her power game - especially on her forehand - was awesome, and even Wozniacki’s famed defensive prowess was no match over the two and a half hours.Phew! That was gripping. Wozniacki becomes the highest seed in either singles draw to leave this Australian Open.Next up for Sharapova, Australia’s Ash Barty.Sharapova on court with Brett Philips:I knew I was going to get a tough match. I haven’t played many matches in the past year so it was really rewarding to win that last point.Experience is priceless but you still have to work for it because the girl on the other side has just as much.”Third set: *Sharapova 5-3, 4-6, 6-4 Wozniacki (*denotes server) Wozniacki serving to stay in the championship but Sharapova is now in to gear, hammering ball after ball back at the Dane, some winners, some provoking errors. At 30-40 Sharapova engineers her first match point but Wozniacki holds her nerve in a gutsy 18-shot rally. More brute force from Sharapova at deuce creates a second match point, and this time she sees it home, monstering another poor second serve before pounding away until the dam broke. Awesome hitting, huge result, superb match. Third set: *Sharapova 5-3, 4-6, 6-4 Wozniacki (*denotes server) Vintage Sharapova, consolidating the break with a love hold. Power turned up to 11 from the Russian from the back of the court. One game from upsetting the defending champ. It’s worth remembering Sharapova’s seeded 30 this AO, Serena 16, Muguruza 18, while Venus and Azarenka were both unseeded. The women’s draw is wild right now. Third set: Sharapova 4-3, 4-6, 6-4 Wozniacki* (*denotes server) Bosh! Wozniacki’s early-set vim has evaporated but Sharapova’s relentless hitting hasn’t. Two ferocious returns set up the game at 0-30, then a clean return winner at 15-30 lands two break points. The first is squandered with yet another unforced error searching for a winner wasn’t there before Wozniacki defends the second with some trademark court coverage. A 179kph ace at deuce shifts the momentum Wozniacki’s way but then Sharapova plays arguably her point of the match, drilling line after line, working Wozniacki ragged until the error materialises. From the second deuce Sharapova forces a third break point and this time she takes it! She climbs into a weak second serve, sending Wozniacki wide then pulverising the forehand into the open court. Massive moment in this battle. Third set: *Sharapova 3-3, 4-6, 6-4 Wozniacki (*denotes server) Sharapova has crafted so many beautiful points without finding the winner and the opening point of this game is a case in point, pulling Wozniacki one way then the other but drilling the knockout blow into the net with the open court at her mercy. She earns the next two points with more controlled aggression but a double fault and another unnecessarily long forehand sends the game to deuce. Wozniacki cannot capitalise though, and this deciding set remains on serve. Third set: Sharapova 2-3, 4-6, 6-4 Wozniacki* (*denotes server) Four unforced errors in a row from Sharapova give Wozniacki some breathing space as the match ticks over into two-hours duration. The unforced error count now 40-19 in Wozniacki’s favour. Third set: *Sharapova 2-2, 4-6, 6-4 Wozniacki (*denotes server) Sharapova matches Wozniacki’s confident hold with one of her own. Perhaps also a dip in intensity from Wozniacki following her aggressive start to the set. Grigor Dimitrov is now two sets up over Thomas Fabbiano and on his way to the fourth round you’d think. Seeded 20 the hardcourt specialist is a dangerous sleeper. Third set: Sharapova 1-2, 4-6, 6-4 Wozniacki* (*denotes server) Another confident hold for Wozniacki who maintains her attacking intent in this final set. Third set: *Sharapova 1-1, 4-6, 6-4 Wozniacki (*denotes server) Wozniacki must have given herself a talking-to between sets because she has come out firing in this decider. From nowhere she is setting the tempo in attack and hustling down every ball in defence. Sharapova has to battle hard to 30-30 despite landing four first serves before Wozniacki lets her off the hook with a couple of cheap points to concede the game and induce a huge roar from her opponent. This one is coming to the boil nicely. Third set: Sharapova 0-1, 4-6, 6-4 Wozniacki* (*denotes server) Woah! The most assertive and clinical game of the match from Wozniacki. For the first time today she looked the aggressor, serving powerfully, looking to open the court and strike winners on every point, cruising to a confidence-boosting hold. What has Sharapova got in response? Slight delay to the third set while Sharapova takes a comfort break. Elsewhere, Sloane Stephens and Grigor Dimitrov are both up a set in their third round matches. Here we go then, a one set shootout for the right to take on Ash Barty in round four. Second set: *Sharapova 4-6, 6-4 Wozniacki (*denotes server) Serving to stay in the set Sharapova slips to 15-30 but a superb serve wide to Wozniacki’s backhand levels the score. A double fault then hands Wozniacki a set point that the Dane accepts simply by keeping the ballin play and waiting for Sharapova to make a mistake, which she does, overhitting for the umpteenth time trying to hurry-up a straightforward rally. Huge moment in this contest and a let-off for the third seed. Second set: Sharapova 4-5, 6-4 Wozniacki* (*denotes server) It’s not just by using too much power that Sharapova is keeping Wozniacki alive. At 0-15 she wastes a golden opportunity with an unnecessary drop shot into the net after setting up the point beautifully from the baseline. At 30-30 Sharapova commits another unforced error allowing Wozniacki to serve out for a vital hold. A reminder this is round three! The quality and intensity of this contest is worthy of a much grander stage. Second set: *Sharapova 4-4, 6-4 Wozniacki (*denotes server) Sharapova’s unforced errors are really keeping Wozniacki in this match. Time after time she throws away promising situations with loose swings of the racquet with little need to shorten the points. Such sloppiness leads to 30-30 in a service game she appears to be dominating, at which point Wozniacki unloads from the baseline to hammer a backhand down to the line to force a break point. Under pressure, Sharapova ups the ante, pulling out the fastest serve of the match (183kph) to steer her back to safety. Second set: Sharapova 3-4, 6-4 Wozniacki* (*denotes server) Two sets in a row now that Wozniacki has seen an early break erased and Sharapova once again puts her serve under pressure, firing deep and flat returns to take it to 30-30. Sharapova then hands Wozniacki the game with two loose low-percentage hits where safer options were on offer. 25 winners, 26 unforced errors for Sharapova tells the story of this match so far. Second set: *Sharapova 3-3, 6-4 Wozniacki (*denotes server) Sharapova backs up that break with a hold. Again her monster forehand is to the fore but she turns 15-0 to 30-0 with a deft backhand crosscourt that finds the tightest of angles then drills a stinger of a backhand down the line to seal the game. Momentum once again all with the Russian. Second set: Sharapova 2-3, 6-4 Wozniacki* (*denotes server) Sharapova is not leaving anything in the locker room, smashing anything in her arc with brute force. Inevitably there are winners and errors, a pair of each setting up 30-30 without Wozniacki contributing greatly to the game. The Dane eventually features but it’s to overhit a crosscourt forehand to concede a break point. Sharapova then monsters a second serve return to set up an easy point. You get the sense that if Sharapova can channel her power game this match is hers for the taking.

Vegan Miranda Larbi shares her tips for creating an indulgent Veganuary feastThere really is nothing quite as wonderful as logging off at 5pm on a Friday knowing that you’ve got no plans or dates with anyone except your sofa and Netflix.Back in the day, you may have thought that anything short of spending Saturday with a banging hangover was an abject failure but, in these busy times of hyper-connectivity, having a little down time during peak socialising hours can be seen as the ultimate luxury.And it’s especially welcome if you’re taking part in Veganuary. After all, the best way to kick a habit is to simply not engage. So rather than dining out and being tempted by a plate of ribs or raclette, you’re much better off staying in with a truckload of vegan treats.For me, that tends to involve a three-course feast of simple but delicious goodies.First up, non-dairy cheese (just because you’re a vegan, it doesn’t mean you can’t still have a cheese-fest).Cicioni cheese is incredible. It’s made from cashews, almonds, salt and water and tastes like goat’s cheese. Slice some up, stick it on a plate of Kallo rice cakes with some spicy chutney on top and you’re golden.And if that’s not enough cheese for you, there are always more options.A classic wintry pass-the-elasticated-joggers dish is mac and cheese, and I have a vegan version that will send you into the most glorious of carb comas. My recipe is both delicious and nutritious. It’s rich in vitamin B12 (notoriously hard to get from a plant-based diet) and has good fats. Here’s what you’ll need …Mac and cheeseSoak your cashews for a couple of hours (I tend to leave them soaking when I go to work) and, once swollen, throw into your food processor along with a glug of olive oil, a pinch of salt, the lemon juice, garlic and a generous dose of the nutritional yeast. The more yeast, the stronger the cheese flavour.Next, cook your pasta.In a separate pan, fry your onion and garlic before adding your chopped chestnut mushrooms and kale. Give the mushrooms a chance to brown a little and then once they look done, add your torn-up spinach and mix into your drained pasta. Drench in the sauce and sprinkle extra yeast on top. If you have any of the Cicioni cheese left, crumble some over.Obviously it’s not an indulgent night in without pudding …Nothing beats a tub of Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s to kick back with on a Friday night. Vegan Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s is the only plant-based ice-cream I’ve tried that tastes as decadent as the dairy version – in fact, I don’t think I’d be able to tell the difference.Want to make it even more indulgent? Then I suggest throwing a packet of Livia’s Kitchen Nugglets Raw Cookie Dough into the mix (this is especially good with Chocolate Fudge Brownie ice-cream).Livia has some fantastically simple recipes (all vegan, gluten-free) on its website that are worth giving a go. I made an indulgent chocolate pie a couple of weekends ago, which was perfection personified with a dollop of ice-cream on top. I did have to lie down afterwards to deal with the sugar rush, but it was more than worth it.If you do Friday nights in right (more food, less boozing), you may even find that you’re curiously light on your feet and awake enough to make it to your 9am yoga class the next morning.See, Veganuary could be just the beginning."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e8bc71bface7ef6903bde9854f48c8988b922630/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f948dcdbaf8026e4e43892e7df17b71a","title":"theres never been a better time to be vegan","story":"With restaurants, chefs and well-known brands introducing more vegan options than ever, sticking to a plant-based diet is now both simple and indulgent, says Club Mexicana’s Meriel Armitage A decade ago, when I decided to go vegan for ethical reasons, the word “decadent” was one you’d never have used to describe the food available. More often than not, it fitted the joyless stereotype of lentils, quinoa and tofu, with the occasional Linda McCartney vegan sausage to liven things up. Now, though, ask a vegan what they ate last night and they’re likely to say anything from pizza topped with gooey melted “cheese” to crispy fried “chicken” or pulled jackfruit burritos. The vegan scene has truly exploded, introducing food that’s exciting, colourful and indulgent, whether you’re vegan or not.When I launched my pop-up, Club Mexicana, in 2012 I wanted to challenge the boringly virtuous chickpea and chia seed perception of veganism. Inspired by my travels in the US, where vegan food is innovative and delicious, I wanted to prove that being vegan doesn’t mean missing out.I realised the joy of Mexican food doesn’t stem from the meat, but the bold, punchy flavours created by salsas and pickles – the meat is just a carrier for those flavours. We try to be as creative as possible with our dishes, which include tacos with baja “tofish” – tofu fish – and roasted cornbread with pecan mole, smoked soya yoghurt, pickled pear and smoked tomato. When we first started holding supper clubs, a lot of people didn’t even notice the food was vegan, which is what I wanted.Over the past few years, vegan ingredients have evolved rapidly, which has helped vegan cooking to become as exciting as it is. Vegan cheese used to be terrible, but now you can buy everything from vegan blue cheese and camembert to cheddar and ricotta – all tasting as piquant and decadently creamy as the real thing. At Club Mexicana, we serve deep-fried “mozzarella” sticks made with coconut oil, which are crispy on the outside and oozingly melty in the middle.People also often wrongly assume that going vegan will mean depriving themselves of indulgent desserts and treats, but that’s no longer the case either. The naughtiest dish we offer is deep-fried ice-cream doused in chocolate sauce – it really doesn’t get more indulgent than that.More and more restaurants are offering innovative vegan menus. Supermarkets now stock an amazing range of vegan food that’s expanding all the time. Brands, such as Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s, are constantly bringing out new vegan products that are causing a buzz outside, as well as inside, the vegan world.There’s never been a better time to be vegan, or just to introduce more plant-based alternatives into your everyday diet. With so many amazing colours, textures and flavours on offer, you never need to feel you’re depriving yourself of the food you love."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/45c72d5042cf63ee2c720d714238911f247a7e26/0_373_5597_3358/master/5597.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b4b8aac52d5ac3a0c96c1d44a7f8009e","title":"the ultimate vegan baked alaska recipe","story":"This indulgent, retro dessert just got a vegan makeover, thanks to non-dairy ice-cream and aquafaba meringueServes 8Prep: 1 hour 20 minutes, plus 4-5 hours for freezingCook: 25-30 minutesFor the cake:125g dairy-free baking spread150ml dairy-free milk2 tsp white wine vinegar125g caster sugar1 tsp vanilla extract175g self-raising flour1 tsp baking powderFor the filling:500ml tub Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s non-dairy ice-cream3 tbsp jamFor the meringue:1 x 400g can chickpeas1⁄4 tsp xanthan gum1⁄4 tsp cream of tartar1 tsp vanilla extract100g caster sugarPreheat the oven to 180C (160C fan)gas 4.

Sitting close to where Europe ends and Africa begins, Palermo bears the scars – and echoes the glories – of centuries of domination. Once Roman, Byzantine, Arab, Norman and ultimately Italian – unified with the mainland only in 1861 – it has a relatively recent “made in Italy” identity. And in 2018 it basked under the banner of Italian Capital of Culture, hosting the prestigious Manifesta contemporary art biennale and helping regenerate its waterfront.Palermo is proud of its Arabic origins, going back to the 8th century, and its three main markets, Capo, Vucciria and Ballarò, are reminiscent of Arab souks. The abundance and variety of food, and their theatrical vendors, give Palermo’s markets a distinct attitude. Touring them can be a bit daunting, so try a street food tour with Streaty. The price includes a passaporto del mangione (glutton’s passport), a certificate awarded to those who manage to eat their way to the end of the tour. Rick Stein apparently did it. • Tours from €39, streatyAt the intersection of Via Maqueda and Corso Vittorio Emanuele is Piazza Vigliena, whose four baroque corners mark the centre of the historic quarter, locally known as Quattro Canti. Immediately south and east is grandiose Piazza Pretoria, also known as Piazza della Vergogna, the square of shame, for the thoroughly naked statues of nymphs, tritons and leaping river gods (senza veli, without veils) adorning the magnificent circular fountain in front of the Palazzo Pretorio (City Hall). In the streets around are stunning 12th-century churches, Arab-Norman Chiesa Santa Maria dell’ Ammiraglio, Chiesa Capitolare di San Cataldo with its distinct faded red domes, and the baroque 16th-century Chiesa di Santa Caterina.Start your visit to the city centre with a ritual stopover at a bar. My favourite is Antico Caffe’ Spinnato 1860, where I like to sit at an outdoor table for a granita al caffe con panna (shaved coffee ice with whipped cream) and watch Palermitani go by. The cannoli (tubes of cream-filled pastry) are also delicious. • Via Principe di BelMonte 107-115, spinnato.itNarrow Via Maqueda, built in 1600, is an artery connecting the north of the city to the south. As a young girl, I remember it being a noisy, car-congested place, but it has recently been pedestrianised, and makes the perfect place for a passeggiata any time of day. Take the time to walk and get lost along the narrow side streets. You will be amazed how many hidden palaces and churches lie among the remains of dilapidated buildings left to decay since being bombed in the second world war. Occasional liberty style (Italian art nouveau) shops are still standing. Pasticceria Costa (Via Maqueda 174), dating to 1700, does delicious marzipan patisserie, and the walls are decorated with frescos by Ernesto Basile, the artist who painted the Teatro Massimo opera house (see below).At the top of Via Maqueda, you cannot miss Teatro Massimo Vittorio Emanuele, the third largest opera house in Europe, after Paris and Vienna. After the unification of Italy in 1861, Filippo and Ernesto Basile spent 20 years building this architectural masterpiece in classic style using local stone and marble. Its location was chosen to mark the point where the ancient quarters and the new expanding city meet, symbolising the historical link between the two. Grab a refreshing granita al limone from one of the moped sellers on Piazza Verdi, then take a guided tour of the theatre, with its ornate gold and red auditorium and seven tiers of boxes rising to a splendid ceiling painted by Rocco Lentini (about 30 minutes, adult €8, child €5). Even better is the Roof Terrace Tour, with breathtaking views over Palermo (€20). • teatromassimo.itOff Quattro Canti lies Via Vittorio Emanuele with stalls and a street market and a vibrant atmosphere. If you’re hungry by now, it’s hard to resist the aroma of the traditional Palermitan deep-dish pizza, sfincione, from street vendor Salvatore. This will set you up for visiting the 12th-century cathedral, built at the height of the Norman domination, and Museo Riso, Sicily’s contemporary art gallery. If you have time, take in Angela Tripi’s terracotta workshop in the Castrone di Santa Ninfa courtyard. Her handmade terracotta cribs and nativity figures are exported all over the world.Turn left into the peaceful gardens of Villa Bonanno and on to Piazza Indipendenza and the 11-12th-century Palazzo dei Normanni – which, despite its name, was built by the Arabs well before the arrival of the Normans. Its Cappella Palatina is the highest artistic expression of Latin, Byzantine, and Arabic style, with gold, mosaics and marble covering every inch of its interior. • Adult €10, federicosecondo.orgThe Cala (marina) quarter of Palermo is seeing a slow food renaissance, pioneered by the Gagini Social Restaurant, in what was once the workshop of renowned 15th-century sculptor Antonio Gagini. Guests share large designer tables and embark on a slow food dining journey in a candlelit setting. It feels like the soul of renaissance art is still here. Gioacchino Gaglio is Gagini’s adventurous and talented chef. I love his linguine gambero: delicate shrimp pasta, parsley pesto and a garnish of traditional breadcrumbs. • From €50 a head, gaginirestaurant.itClose to the train station and metro is the recently opened B\u0026ampB Suite Del Ponte Normanno. It takes its name from the historic Ponte dell’Ammiraglio in up and coming nearby La Kalsa, once the ancient Arab quarter.

Top marks! Two years ago, Lucy Worsley delivered unto us the three-part series British History’s Biggest Fibs. She took us through the spin Henry VIII put on the Wars of the Roses and how Shakespeare took it and ran with it, helping to preserve big H’s not entirely unbiased account of it as one of the most attractive pieces in the national reliquary. She pointed out that the bloodless Glorious Revolution wasn’t so bloodless or glorious if you happened to be walking as a Scotsman or Irishman through the tumultuous year of 1688. She also showed us how the new, modern, caring ‘n’ sharing form of imperialism that created the Raj with loving Empress Vicky as the gentle polisher of the jewel in her crown … umm … wasn’t.It was an opportune look, presented with customary brio by the historian, at the process of wish fulfilment, misdirection, confabulation and copper-bottomed lying that makes up an unknowable proportion of all the “facts” we think we have about the past and how it unfolded. Now – because, let’s face it, the time for programmes problematising national narratives and interrogating how they are wrought ain’t got any less ripe over the last 24 months – it is the turn of the United States.In a move that will probably put her among the first up against the wall when Trump eventually finds the right combination of concrete slabs, metal slats and funding to build it, the first episode of American History’s Biggest Fibs investigated the traditional story Americans tell themselves about plucky colonial farmers unhooking George III’s greedy little tax fingers that were squeezing the life out of a land that yearned to be free in the American Revolution.The standard version pitches it as a David and Goliath battle. Said plucky colonial farmers, armed with a musket apiece, set their faces against the professional British army and, with a little help from Paul Revere, General George Washington, God and Molly Pitcher, conquered it and brought about life, liberty (bells) and the pursuit of happiness for all, with a little time for high jinks in Boston Harbour along the way.Unless you are currently wearing full Maga regalia beneath your Klan outfit, you will already know this is not quite how it went down. But Worsley drilled yet deeper, dispelling myths as she showed how they were constructed out of political and emotional needs, enshrined in art and perpetuated by both. E pluribus version of events, unum foundation story.So Revere didn’t make his ride from Lexington to Concord alone, but had two companions. In fact he didn’t make it to Concord – one of the others did. But Henry Wadsworth Longfellow made him a lone (and successful) hero in his poem a century later and that’s the story that stuck. Similarly, there is no evidence the liberty bell rang out to summon Philadelphians to the town hall for the first public reading of the Declaration of Independence, but novelist George Lippard published a story in 1841 in which it did and so it has rung ever since. Molly Pitcher comes into being 50 years after she supposedly took up her husband’s sword on the battlefield, fragments of anecdote and memory gathered and embodied in one figure as witnesses passed away.The Boston Tea Party was no picnic either, but part of several years’ violent struggle between colonial and British troops, with the perpetrators being condemned as criminals rather than hailed as hilarious pranksters.Less whimsically and rather more of a factor in the construction of the American psyche and identity, the plucky farmers did not overwhelm the superior force with determination, grit and small arms. They allied with Britain’s great enemy, the French. Yes, dear GOPers – cheese-eating surrender monkeys helped George Washington to victory at Georgetown.This is but to scratch the surface of all the information contained within the hour, for Worsley always puts together a dense package. She powers through it with her earnestness and academic training and rigour backing her up all the way. You have to pay attention, but the rewards are great when you do.

A waitress, who wandered over occasionally to fill a round of water glasses lined with lemon wedges, seemed to intuitively know not to ask if anyone needs a soft drink or a plate of chicken fingers.“I’m not usually a water drinker,” Hannah Gariepy, a teacher – and eight-year employee – of the federal prison pointed out, “But I was thinking, what’s free?” Her colleagues erupted in laughter, all of them agreeing. One has a salad in her car. Another ate before coming to the bar.Jesup in southern Georgia feels like an archetypical blueprint of a small American southern town, dotted with a Dollar Store and a Piggly Wiggly grocery store. Everyone knows everyone, the same few family names have shuffled in and out of local politics, and most days, its clean streets look deserted.But now this sense of desertion is different. For Jesup, like many other communities across America, is in the grip of a partial government shutdown affecting 800,000 American workers. And Jesup will feel the hit eventually as a large chunk of its economy relies on the federal prison – one of the town’s major employers.In one of the town’s bars, colleagues from the federal prison – which employs more than 300 people in Jesup and the surrounding Wayne county – fretted over cancelled doctor’s visits and now impossible requests from children to buy video games. These workers are all now working without pay.“We’re not rich,” someone said, as colleagues continued to join the group. But sometimes it seems they are alone in their ever-expanding worries as the now-longest ever shutdown grinds on.Yet non-federal workers in the town say they have yet to feel the full bite of their fellow citizens’ hardship.The town will feel it eventually, Melvina Barnes, a reintegration and re-entry officer at the prison who lives in Jesup, concluded. “Before the shutdown, I ate out every day in Jesup,” she added, sitting across from Gariepy. Just yesterday, she spent $100 on groceries. “The milk was six bucks,” she grimaced, admitting she has just $278 left in her bank account.But so far, outside those directly affected federal workers and their families, many in Jesup say the shutdown remains at a distance. Some have not even heard of it at all.Only one person has called in this morning, thinking if it went any longer he might be late on his water bill, Deal said. But we’ll work with him if they’ve been good paying customers, he added quickly. It’s the first phone call his office has received from a prison employee.A few blocks over, a sign in English, Spanish, German and Italian welcomes customers to Cafe Euro. Christian rock blasted over the speakers. A line formed for sugar-laden smoothies and frappes. One of the employees behind the counter said she hasn’t heard about the shutdown. I think it’s fine, she mused, because no one is talking about it. In Jesup, she said, that’s a big indicator if something is important or not.Other residents agreed. A cashier at the Piggly Wiggly did not know what the federal shutdown was exactly. Neither did an incoming shopper. Next door, at Surcheros, a Tex-Mex fast-food restaurant many of the prison employees say they frequent, noticed a slow lunch rush on the first unpaid payday for the prison employees. Yera Moye, who is ringing up customers said she didn’t know exactly why. She also had not heard about the shutdown.The county administrator tried to put the implication of the shutdown in Wayne county’s perspective. “My county, if you look at it, is very rural,” Ed Jeffords explained, pointing to a map across from his desk. A lot of people leave the county for work daily, or sometimes, permanently. He suggests the economy has needed revitalizing for years. For example, he added: “My kids can’t afford the lifestyle we gave them without leaving town.” His son plans to move to Orlando.Just outside Jeffords’ office, shuttered storefronts and near-empty stores on the town’s main drag lay empty as the evidence of the flagging economy in Jesup – a trend that started long before the shutdown hit the town’s main employer. The same group of teens circle three blocks for two hours one afternoon. The Strand dinner-movie theatre, showing Aquaman, The Mule and Vice, sees a few stragglers going in and out for tickets one afternoon.It’s a well-known fact that a few families in town own the majority of the wealth, Hank Tucker, a senior correctional officer and the president of the prison employees’ union said. Right now, he and his colleagues spend their dwindling savings on gas money to make their commute to the prison. That can’t last, though.“In two weeks, federal employees won’t be able to afford to show up to work because they won’t be able to pay for the gas to drive there,” Tucker said.Detta Dyal, who owns Shear Designs around the corner from where the group has convened, attends to her lone customer. As she brushed out her clients’ blond hair, she shrugged when talking about the shutdown. One of her employees’ husbands works at the prison, she says, but I’m sure she’s fine, she added.“I watch Fox News so I know about the shutdown,” she began, continuing: “I don’t know the impact on her but I’m sure she’s fine because I saw on the news people are getting extensions of mortgage payments and kids are getting free lunches.”The lack of understanding in the wider community hurts those workers laboring for nothing.“For the public to not know, to not care, to be so completely oblivious, to think we’re undeserving, that our very livelihoods, that our children that go to school with their children, that our family members that go to church with their families, are somehow less deserving for the service that we do is like a slap in the face,” Gariepy spat out, exhausted from the multiple 16-hour days she has worked in recent weeks, even during the shutdown.But she thinks her fellow citizens will notice their plight soon enough as the shutdown rolls on with little end in sight."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c06b5b8247342be6b9d7549a6303a57ba1211c5/426_722_2336_1401/master/2336.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7694dfcd5b6ade1a4ed5b8d1a95471bf","title":"italian town sambuca sicily dozens homes for sale one euro","story":"Officials in Sambuca, in Sicily, seek to revive depopulated town – but there’s a catchBritish house prices may be falling, but you would still be hard-pressed to find a cheaper property than those on sale in one Sicilian town, where homes are going for as little as €1.Dozens of properties have been put up for sale in Sambuca, a hilltop town with stunning views across the Mediterranean island, for less than the price of a takeaway coffee.The deal is a bid to revive an area that has undergone depopulation in recent years, with residents moving to bigger cities.According to local officials, anyone interested can more or less make a purchase straight away.There is a catch, though – new owners must commit to refurbishing their property within three years, at a cost starting from €15,000 (£13,200), and will need a €5,000 security deposit. This will be returned once the refurbishment is complete.But buyers won’t be disappointed, according to Cacioppo.“Sambuca is known as the ‘city of splendor’,” he added. “This fertile patch of land is dubbed the ‘earthly paradise’. We’re located inside a nature reserve, packed with history. Gorgeous beaches, woods and mountains surround us. It’s silent and peaceful, an idyllic retreat for a detox stay.”With the population dwindling, Cacioppo said the town needs outsiders to prevent it from going under.“We can’t afford to lose our lovely Arab heritage. Luckily, foreigners are lending a hand in this rescue crusade,” he said.The two-storey dwellings are built with reddish-pink stone and feature courtyards, palm gardens and arcaded entrances.

His work has since been seen as a gold standard for news journalism.But in an interview, Galtung said his definitions were intended to show how news was getting it wrong. He stressed that his paper said that if news continued to reflect the world in this antagonistic way, it would generate extreme negativity, and “a growing tension between the centre and the periphery both nationally and globally”.“It’s a complete misunderstanding,” he said from his home in southern Spain. “Our work from the early 1960s was meant to be a warning of the consequences for the way news media filtered the world. But the western news industry believed I was describing how things should be done, instead of what is being done.“I was saying, ‘what you do is incomplete. You are missing a major part of the image of the world,’” said Galtung, who will address the annual Constructive Journalism Conference in Geneva on 18 January.But, he said, editors and journalists, particularly in the US, interpreted the work as “the standard on which generation after generation ever after has filtered the world to the public through the news”.The overwhelming negativity of news in recent years has prompted a debate about its impact on the public psyche. Recent academic studies have found that pessimistic news makes audiences feel helpless and less likely to engage in solving global problems.“News media are now so full of stories on misery,” said Hans Henrik Knoop, an assistant professor at Denmark’s Institute of Psychology. “Negativity controls news flow, and therefore also politics and public debate. Apathy or fear is the result. The risk is that people not only deselect media as sources for news, but also that they disengage in the public debate.”Galtung predicted as much in 1965. The article “The structure of foreign news” was published in March of that year in the Journal of Peace Research by Galtung and colleague Mari Holmboe Ruge. The pair examined the coverage of international conflicts in four Norwegian newspapers and listed 12 criteria, which seemed to be present in order for an event to be considered newsworthy. One of the most dominant was “reference to something negative”.To this day Wikipedia cites the article from Galtung and Ruge as the basis for how the news is constructed.As Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism at Oxford University stated in 2013: “The most cited work on news value has been that of Galtung and Ruge … Most of the research since the 1960s ... has used Galtung and Ruge as the starting point.” The academics’ findings are taught in school and journalism colleges across the world.The academic paper concluded with a warning on the consequences for society if news organisations continued to promote confrontation, tension and sensation over collaboration, resolution and compassion.“The consequence of all this is an image of the world that gives little autonomy to the periphery but sees it as mainly existing for the sake of the centre,” the paper said. “Conflict will be emphasised, conciliation not.”“And this is exactly what has happened,” Galtung said. “News media give a total biased picture of reality. The perception of reality in the public becomes overly negative.”For years, the founder of peace and conflict studies and head of the Peace Research Institute at the University of Oslo has been reluctant to speak to journalists, as he feels misrepresented by the news industry.He is unequivocal on the consequences of the news media’s misreading of his research. “It is enormous. Absolutely enormous,” he said.“It shapes what people are doing. And it shapes politicians, it makes them negative, instead of putting emphasis on the good in society they want to construct.

But, as Indonesia heads towards a presidential election, looks can be deceiving.The two presidential candidates are in fact fictional.Created by a group of disaffected millennials, they have struck a chord with young voters and their social media profiles, which regularly lampoon mainstream politics, have attracted almost 400,000 followers on Instagram and thousands on Twitter and Facebook since their creation last month.In what has so far shaped up to be a lacklustre election campaign, Nurhadi and Aldo have become best known for their vulgar campaign tagline, a creative abbreviation of the last few letters of their names to make “Dildo for Indonesia”.“I see this movement as a breath of fresh air for our politics,” says Edwin, one of the creators, told the . “It is a new perspective, a new way to enjoy politics, and the drama of elite politicians who always argue, but don’t actually represent us.“I was really looking forward to hearing from our candidates, but mostly they don’t show us their programs, or generate solutions for our problems.”The world’s third-largest democracy heads to the polls in April, and millennials will account for 80 out of 187 million voters, but some young voters are not enthused about the choices in front of them.On Thursday night in the first of five presidential debates – focused on law, human rights, terrorism and corruption – neither candidate veered much off script, with analysts suggesting they failed to articulate creative visions for some of Indonesia’s most deep-rooted problems.President Joko Widodo’s controversial pick for running mate, 75-year-old Islamic cleric Ma’ruf Amin who has advocated support for fatwas against religious minorities, LGBT people and even yoga, barely managed a few words, although when he did he made them count, saying “terrorism is not jihad”.His rival, the former military general Prabowo Subianto, avoided talk of past human rights violations, of which he stands accused, arguing the wages of civil servants should be increased to discourage corruption.The Nurhadi and Aldo accounts appropriate the classic Indonesian campaign aesthetic, a pious-looking candidate pictured next to their ballot number, or a lofty social program, often abbreviated into a catchy acronym.They mock the political formula, often using vulgarity. One policy for an internet subsidy program, “Program Subsidi Tagihan Warnet Bagi Umum” is cut into “Prostat Bau”, meaning “smelly prostate”.Others posts mock the conflict of interest between Indonesian media ownership and political parties, or use a caricature of Karl Marx, a satirical stab at Indonesia’s paranoia of communism, which is banned.Nurhadi and Aldo are also pro LGBT rights and have a “halal” program to legalise marijuana – both unthinkable in Indonesia’s current political climate.Edwin, who is a college student from central Java and asked that the  use his first name only, said he created the candidates with the help of seven other young people he met through an online comedy page after becoming fed up with this year’s presidential candidates.A masseur from the Javanese town of Kudus agreed to lend his face to the campaign as Nurhadi, while Aldo is pure fiction, a mash-up of two different faces.This year’s presidential election pits controversial and retired Army general Prabowo Subianto and his running mate, former investment banker and businessman Sandiaga Uno against the incumbent president, Joko Widodo and his running mate, Ma’ruf Amin. The president’s running mate is a 75-year-old Islamic cleric notorious for promoting fatwas against LGBT people, religious minorities and yoga.Pangeran Siahaan, the founder of Asumsi, a YouTube channel that includes a weekly political talk show, says that after Amin’s candidacy was announced some young voters started to consider abstaining from the vote. He says: “I think Dildo For Indonesia, that counter movement, was started because there is some part of the young generation that are not really satisfied.”“I think both candidates are trapped in what I call ‘viral and meme politics’ because they want to be viral and well distributed on social media because they think that is where millennials read their content,” explains Pangeran, “But if you take a look deeper, it is nothing but cosmetic.”Wearing sneakers or including a pop culture reference in a political speech, he adds, hasn’t worked for them either because: “The millennials don’t buy it.”Behind the dirty references masked as political visions, Edwin says their satirical account has a serious agenda.By showing how easy it is to replicate a vacuous political campaign he hopes voters will think twice about their choices. “We are here to provide humour but also education about how to choose a great leader and be a critical thinker,” he says, “So Nurhadi-Aldo are doing something other candidates are not.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b995a8405c7fcb69364f310a31edf04dcff70df4/3_126_3628_2176/master/3628.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5b5e2b2f12bf359e642874d621d093e6","title":"indias kumbh mela festival in pictures","story":"Thought to be the world’s largest human gathering, more than 20 million Hindu pilgrims ritually bathed on the opening day of the festival"},{"url":null,"title":"college","story":"The first significant career choice you make will not necessarily be life-determiningRegister your details now \u0026ndash you can determine your final course preferences laterMany students receive financial help but preparation is key when it comes to securing the correct level of fundingAvoid the traps: Parents can offer vital support, but their knowledge is often outdatedWhat factors should you consider when deciding on what career path you wish to takeMultinational firms concerned over standard of foreign languages among school-leaversWe talk to graduates who made the wrong call when they filled out the CAO formTimeline for the 2019 college application processThousands to apply for courses ahead of this month\u0026rsquos application deadlineDownload PDFs of our comprehensive list of level 8 and level 67 courses"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3762045.1547762624!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"record number of students now in third level","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSome 44,000 new entrants began higher education courses in Ireland last year, according to official figures.

Some 44,000 new entrants began higher education courses while more than 70,000 graduated from either undergraduate or postgraduate qualifications, according to official figures.The Higher Education Authority, which compiled the data, said this large talent pool will help the country meet whatever challenges it faces in the years ahead. “Ireland is clearly a society committed to learning, where now one in every 15 adults in the State is studying in one of our universities, institutes or colleges,”said Paul O’Toole, the authority’s chief executive.However, the figures also point to challenges facing the sector with new financial data showing that universities are more reliant than ever on private income.While universities used to receive most of their income from the State, the bulk of their funding now comes from private sources such as student contributions, research grants, international student fees, loans and other sources.Overall, there were 231,710 enrolments in the higher education system in 201718. Most students were full-time undergraduates (up 8 per cent over five years). Of those who graduated with honours degrees, about one in five received first class honours while almost half received 2.1 degrees .The single biggest area of study for new entrants are arts and humanities (19 per cent), business administrationlaw (19 per cent) and health and welfare (14 per cent).

Photograph:  Jack TaylorGetty ImagesJeremy Corbyn could face up to a dozen resignations from the Labour frontbench if the party backs a second referendum as a way out of the Brexit crisis.A string of junior shadow ministers have told the  they are strongly opposed to the idea of a second referendum, which they fear would expose Labour to a vicious backlash in leave-voting constituencies.The development follows another tense day of brinkmanship in Westminster between Theresa May and the Labour leader as they seek a way out of the crisis that has engulfed both major parties.Mr Corbyn refused to enter talks with Theresa May on Thursday until she rules out the idea of a no-deal departure and demanded that his party’s MPs refuse similar invitations. Later Mrs May wrote to Mr Corbyn telling him that ruling out no-deal was “an impossible condition” and calling on him to join cross-party discussions.With no sign of the impasse being broken, pressure is growing on Labour to consider a so-called people’s vote as the UK prepares to leave the EU on March 29th.With Mr Corbyn’s hopes of a general election fading with the prime minister’s narrow victory in the no-confidence vote, some Labour supporters are raising pressure on Mr Corbyn to support a second referendum.A snap poll conducted after the crushing defeat of Mrs May’s Brexit plan has found a 12-point lead for remaining in the EU – the largest margin since the 2016 vote.But several senior shadow ministers from constituencies that voted to leave the EU say they would consider their positions if Mr Corbyn concedes to pressure to back a second referendum.One said: “I would be in a really difficult position if we backed a second referendum. I would have little choice but to stand down if I was to have any hope of retaining my seat and representing my constituents.”Another said they had made their views clear to Mr Corbyn’s office and the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer. “I would feel deeply uncomfortable about going into a people’s vote at this stage. Given all the commitments that we made in the general election, we have to carry them out. This concept of blocking Brexit is wrong and would break a link with millions of our traditional voters who expect us to keep our word,” the shadow minister said.Anti-Brexit campaign group Labour for a People’s Vote published a list of 71 Labour MPs who support its cause on Wednesday, and claimed many more were privately supportive.But backbench MPs who have been canvassing opinion claim that number is matched by vehement opponents of a referendum, some of whom would be prepared to break the whip rather than support it.Several shadow cabinet ministers, including the Labour chair, Ian Lavery, and the shadow justice secretary Richard Burgon, are also sceptical, believing the party’s first priority must be to keep up the pressure for a general election.Lavery made a passionate intervention against a new referendum at last week’s shadow cabinet meeting. Len McCluskey, the general secretary of the Unite trade union, has also said it would be a “betrayal” to seek to reverse the 2016 result.Gloria De Piero, the shadow women’s minister, told the  she was not in favour of a second referendum. “I stood on a manifesto that promised to respect the referendum result,” she said.Other shadow cabinet ministers, including the deputy Labour leader, Tom Watson, and the shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, are more sympathetic towards a second referendum.Labour strategists have not ruled out a free vote on a second referendum, believing that whipping MPs either to support or oppose a referendum would open a deep rift.Lucy Powell, the MP for Manchester Central, said that with no agreed Brexit deal in place, it was unclear what options would be offered on a second referendum – and referendums were the wrong way to resolve the complex situation.“I think they’re terrible ways to make rational decisions,” she said. “And there’s a swathe of the public who would never forgive us.”At a meeting in Hastings, East Sussex, Mr Corbyn remained uncommitted on the idea of a second referendum, saying again that it remained one of several options if an election did not happen.Explaining why he was the only opposition leader not to meet Mrs May for one-to-one talks, Mr Corbyn dismissed the cross-party discussions as a “stunt”, adding that Mrs May appeared unable to grasp the fact that her withdrawal agreement was now “dead”.“She seems to be prepared to send the country hurtling towards a cliff-edge,” he said.But Labour’s former prime minister Tony Blair said Mr Corbyn was wrong to refuse to meet Mrs May.“If, in a moment of national crisis, the prime minister asks the leader of the opposition to come and talk, of course he should,” Blair told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.Another former Labour prime minister, Gordon Brown, called for the Brexit deadline to be extended by a year, as he said the country was now “more ided” than at the time of Margaret Thatcher’s poll tax.MPs should force the government to extend article 50 and then give the public the final say on a renegotiated Brexit deal, he said.Speaking in Edinburgh on Thursday evening, Mr Brown condemned the “paralysed and immobilised” parliament in Westminster and said there was rising anger from the public who wanted to be involved in the decision-making process.In a further development, a poll conducted by YouGov of more than 1,000 voters on Wednesday found 56 per cent would now vote to stay in the EU, against 44 per cent who want to leave.Exactly the same proportion of voters said they wanted a second EU referendum - three points higher than recorded in a similar poll before Christmas. Backing for a so-called people’s vote among Labour supporters stood at 78 per cent.The remain lead was extended further when respondents were asked to compare it to Mrs May’s withdrawal agreement or the option of leaving the EU without a deal.Against the prime minister’s deal, remain led by 65 per cent to 35 per cent, while against no-deal was 59 per cent to 41 per cent in favour of staying in the EU. – "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2017/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000140439032_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"parliament accused conflict interest rejects nda debate","story":"John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, refused to allow Maria Miller to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerfulHouse of CommonsMaria Miller, the Tory MP, last night accused Parliament of a conflict of interest over Britain\u0027s MeToo scandal after it emerged she had been blocked from questioning the Government over it.The Daily  can reveal John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, yesterday refused to allow Ms Miller, who chairs the women \u0026amp equalities Commons select committee, to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerful, including the Topshop tycoon Sir Philip Green.Helen Jones, chairman of the petitions select committee, also rejected calls to allow a parliamentary debate on non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) after two separate petitions demanding a change to the law between them secured 250,000 signatures. It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward.

These can result in companies being fined up to $525,000 (£291,000) and the poster being fined up to $105,000 (£58,273).Asked about whether the government was considering the Australian model, Baroness Williams said: “One of the things that we always do is look to see what other countries are doing and certainly we are looking into it in the white paper.“Nothing is off the table in terms of what we are looking at in terms of the white paper.”Her comments come as the minister also said social media companies needed to do more to stop people with facial disfigurement and visible conditions being abused online.The charity Changing Faces, which campaigns for people visible differences, said many had experienced abuse online with some having their picture taken in public so they can be mocked on social media.Baroness Williams, who is working with the charity on the issue, said: “I think the responses (from social media companies) are sporadic. Just because something doesn’t meet a legal threshold there are still the terms of user conditions that they have.“Also I think for the social media companies there is a reputational risk here. Social media was actually developed for very positive reasons and we don’t want it to become a platform which certain people can’t go near because of some of the bile that is spat out with a cloak of anonymity.”Becky Hewitt, the CEO of Changing Faces, said social media could be a positive place for people with visible conditions, but that abuse was putting them off.That charity has found that a third do not use their photo on their profile and that some people had had their online photos taken and turned into hurtful memes.She added: “One of the things that people often talk to us about is people taking their photos and without their permission when they are out and about.“So one of our champions talks about a time that she was in the car with her brother and her mum and someone stuck a phone in to get a photo of her and then that can be used on social media as a form of bullying. It is those kind of things that are quite common.”There have been some positive steps taken by social media companies to combat the abuse, such as by Twitter, which has now given Changing Faces special status to report incidents.However Ms Hewitt said many people facing abuse still felt a sense of “resignation” when it came to social media companies taking action.The charity is calling for the government to officially recognise abuse against people with visible conditions in the white paper.Natalie Ambersley, a 36-year-old PA from London who has the skin condition vitiligo, told the : “People don’t realise how damaging and upsetting it can be for that person, so social media platforms should make it a priority.“It can have a really negative impact on how people see themselves.”Department for Culture, Media \u0026amp SportPlease review our commenting policySecond Brexit referendum: Official Government guidance says it will take a year to organisePicture exclusive: Prince Philip \u0026#39very shocked and shaken\u0026#39 after car crash near Sandringham Estate Giant 21ft great white shark named Deep Blue spotted off coast of HawaiiComment: A note to the Conservatives: cosying up to big business is only going to fuel CorbynismComment: Until Brexit is no longer seen as a Right-wing plot there will never be a cross-party planRemaining in the EU \u0026#39could spark a new extremist movement\u0026#39Multinationals may seek to preserve the status quo after Brexit but Britain\u0026#39s small businesses want changeNorth Korea’s bio weapons ‘more of a threat than nuclear arsenal’Japanese company sends satellite into space to deliver artificial meteor showerNorth Korea envoy in US for talks ahead of new Trump summitMan arrested over killing of Israeli student Aiia Maasarwe in MelbourneBercow could be first Speaker to go without peerage in 230 years as ministers urge May to block the honourAsthma attacks three times more common than thought, amid warnings over air pollution The Last Survivors, BBC Two, first-look review: this Holocaust documentary is essential viewingDonald Trump cancels Cabinet members\u0026#39 trip to Davos due to shutdownHealth and military personnel must work together in conflict and disastersSpace is new arena for war, Donald Trump says as he unveils missile defence strategyJeremy Corbyn faces split as defiant Labour MPs discuss Brexit deal with ministersAmerican History\u0026#39s Biggest Fibs with Lucy Worsley, review: the myth-busting’s great but let’s ditch the play-actHospital, series 4 episode 2 review: a key understanding of one of Britain\u0026#39s most renowned institutionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"no pants subway ride 2019 pictures","story":"First things first.. pants as in trousers, the American usage !

After levelling the land, acquiring superior seeds and changing planting techniques from a scattering style known as broadcasting to transplanting nursery-grown crops in neat rows, his output has increased by more than 50 per cent.“I’ve realised rice farming is a business,” he says.Rice is a staple food in Africa but supply falls far short of demand with yields in the sub-Saharan region among the lowest in the world. Pressure is mounting on local agriculture to feed rapidly growing populations and reduce reliance on expensive foreign rice.A worker at Labana rice millsIn Nigeria, the continent’s most populous country, productivity has increased but 55 per cent of demand is still met by imports. Government efforts to reach self-sufficiency and improve food security are contingent on the success of small-scale farmers like Sani, who account for more than 80 per cent of cultivation.But slow mechanisation, insufficient yields and poor quality rice – compounded by a weak market infrastructure – have left them unable to compete with consumer preferences for imported varieties.In the past, you risked “losing a tooth” on the stones in Nigerian rice but there’s a growing awareness that now it matches up to imported brands says Abubakar Abba Adamu, CEO of Labana, one of the largest rice mills in north-west Nigeria.Labana provides training and high quality seeds to thousands of farmers in Kebbi State then guarantees purchase of their harvest under the Competitive African Rice Initiative (CARI), a project that supports value chains in African rice farming.Farmers plant rice in rows using rope to space the seedlings“The mills feel their investment in rice is protected and farmers know they have a market,” explains Dr Kristina Spantig, project manager at CARI, which is implemented by Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH, the German development agency.More than 90,000 Nigerian farmers have entered into contracts since 2013 and 81,165 have attended CARI’s Farmer Business School, learning to fill in cropping calendars, space seedlings with rope and irrigate fields during wet and dry seasons.Agents visit the fields with agriculture apps like RiceAdvice and WeedManager, which calculate fertiliser quantities and identify types of weed. At harvest time, farmers beat grain from the husks on metal drums to minimise breakage.“They are more and more ambitious,” says Adegoke Kazeem Adeniyi, CARI coordinator and value chain advisor at GIZ. The price of local rice is rising as the quality improves. “It’s no longer more attractive to buy imported rice,” he adds.  Rice farmer Umar Abu Bakr uses a portable pump to manage the water levels in his paddy fields in KebbiIn Suru Village, where residents are mainly farmers, Umar Abu Bakr has enrolled his daughters in school, finished the frontage of his house and fulfilled his religious obligations as a Muslim by going on the haj.Before he only produced enough rice for domestic use these days he has “peace of mind”, he says.  Since switching to transplanting he has upped his yield from around 30 bags of paddy (unmilled rice) to 75 per hectare.“I didn’t think it would work at first but then I saw the benefit.” Using a portable pump he lowers the water level in one of his fields. It makes the crops think they are dying and boosts growth, he explains.Most of the farmers in this community have shifted their focus to rice. Outside the heaving village grain store, new motorbikes are clustered beneath a tree. Young people are buying more as the wealth of the whole community increases, Abu Bakr says.Women dry parboiled rice in the sunMarket day here is the busiest in Kebbi State as trucks squeeze by to load up on fresh paddy for the mills, which supply wholesalers in the city of Lagos. Others come with camels or bikes to transport single sacks for local buyers.Just 20 minutes away in Jega Village, a group of women sieve and toss pots of paddy in the shade of a tree. This way of cleaning and preparing the grains is generations-old but a few simple adjustments have refined the process and reduced the time it takes from 24 hours to 14.“The new technology is easier for us,” says overseer Hadiza Adamo, 50. The paddy is washed several times then steamed rather than boiled, resulting in cleaner, tastier rice that fetches a higher price at market, earning the women up to 2,000 (£4.30) Naira profit per bag compared to less than 700₦ before.These days they don’t need to ferry the bags to market. “Now customers come to us,” Adamo says. Newsletter promotion - global health security - end of articleProtect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Picture exclusive: Prince Philip \u0026#39very shocked and shaken\u0026#39 after car crash near Sandringham Estate Giant 21ft great white shark named Deep Blue spotted off coast of HawaiiComment: A note to the Conservatives: cosying up to big business is only going to fuel CorbynismComment: Until Brexit is no longer seen as a Right-wing plot there will never be a cross-party planRemaining in the EU \u0026#39could spark a new extremist movement\u0026#39Multinationals may seek to preserve the status quo after Brexit but Britain\u0026#39s small businesses want changeNorth Korea’s bio weapons ‘more of a threat than nuclear arsenal’Japanese company sends satellite into space to deliver artificial meteor showerNorth Korea envoy in US for talks ahead of new Trump summitMan arrested over killing of Israeli student Aiia Maasarwe in MelbourneBercow could be first Speaker to go without peerage in 230 years as ministers urge May to block the honourAsthma attacks three times more common than thought, amid warnings over air pollution The Last Survivors, BBC Two, first-look review: this Holocaust documentary is essential viewingDonald Trump cancels Cabinet members\u0026#39 trip to Davos due to shutdownHealth and military personnel must work together in conflict and disastersSpace is new arena for war, Donald Trump says as he unveils missile defence strategyJeremy Corbyn faces split as defiant Labour MPs discuss Brexit deal with ministersAmerican History\u0026#39s Biggest Fibs with Lucy Worsley, review: the myth-busting’s great but let’s ditch the play-actHospital, series 4 episode 2 review: a key understanding of one of Britain\u0026#39s most renowned institutionsDJ Moggster: Jacob Rees-Mogg to present new LBC phone-in show We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 17 january 2019","story":"A member of crew mops the deck of a boat in the Atlantic OceanPicture exclusive: Prince Philip \u0026#39very shocked and shaken\u0026#39 after car crash near Sandringham Estate Giant 21ft great white shark named Deep Blue spotted off coast of HawaiiComment: A note to the Conservatives: cosying up to big business is only going to fuel CorbynismComment: Until Brexit is no longer seen as a Right-wing plot there will never be a cross-party planRemaining in the EU \u0026#39could spark a new extremist movement\u0026#39Multinationals may seek to preserve the status quo after Brexit but Britain\u0026#39s small businesses want changeNorth Korea’s bio weapons ‘more of a threat than nuclear arsenal’Japanese company sends satellite into space to deliver artificial meteor showerNorth Korea envoy in US for talks ahead of new Trump summitMan arrested over killing of Israeli student Aiia Maasarwe in MelbourneBercow could be first Speaker to go without peerage in 230 years as ministers urge May to block the honourAsthma attacks three times more common than thought, amid warnings over air pollution The Last Survivors, BBC Two, first-look review: this Holocaust documentary is essential viewingDonald Trump cancels Cabinet members\u0026#39 trip to Davos due to shutdownHealth and military personnel must work together in conflict and disastersSpace is new arena for war, Donald Trump says as he unveils missile defence strategyJeremy Corbyn faces split as defiant Labour MPs discuss Brexit deal with ministersAmerican History\u0026#39s Biggest Fibs with Lucy Worsley, review: the myth-busting’s great but let’s ditch the play-actHospital, series 4 episode 2 review: a key understanding of one of Britain\u0026#39s most renowned institutionsDJ Moggster: Jacob Rees-Mogg to present new LBC phone-in show We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"surely sick joke now virtuous laugh gallows humour","story":"I haven’t heard a truly sick joke for at least a decade.

Ltd, plans to deliver its first out-of-this-world show over Hiroshima in the spring of 2020.That should be enough for 20-30 events, as one shower will involve up to 20 stars, according to the company.ALE’s satellite, released 500 kilometres (310 miles) above the Earth, will gradually descend to 400 kilometres over the coming year as it orbits the Earth.The company plans to launch a second satellite on a private-sector rocket in mid-2019.ALE says it is targeting the whole world with its products and plans to build a stockpile of shooting stars in space that can be delivered across the world.When its two satellites are in orbit, they can be used separately or in tandem, and will be programmed to eject the balls at the right location, speed and direction to put on a show for viewers on the ground.Tinkering with the ingredients in the balls should mean that it is possible to change the colours they glow, offering the possibility of a multi-coloured flotilla of shooting stars.Each star is expected to shine for several seconds before being completely burned up – well before they fall low enough to pose any danger to anything on Earth.They would glow brightly enough to be seen even over the light-polluted metropolis of Tokyo, ALE says.If all goes well, and the skies are clear, the 2020 event could be visible to millions of people, it says.ALE chief executive Lena Okajima has said her company chose Hiroshima for its first display because of its good weather, landscape and cultural assets.The western Japan city rose from the ashes after the 1945 US atomic bombing and faces the Seto Inland sea where the floating gate of Itsukushima Shrine is.ALE is working in collaboration with scientists and engineers at Japanese universities as well as local government officials and corporate sponsors.It has not disclosed the price for an artificial meteor shower.Please review our commenting policySecond Brexit referendum: Official Government guidance says it will take a year to organisePicture exclusive: Prince Philip \u0026#39very shocked and shaken\u0026#39 after car crash near Sandringham Estate Giant 21ft great white shark named Deep Blue spotted off coast of HawaiiComment: A note to the Conservatives: cosying up to big business is only going to fuel CorbynismComment: Until Brexit is no longer seen as a Right-wing plot there will never be a cross-party planRemaining in the EU \u0026#39could spark a new extremist movement\u0026#39Multinationals may seek to preserve the status quo after Brexit but Britain\u0026#39s small businesses want changeNorth Korea’s bio weapons ‘more of a threat than nuclear arsenal’North Korea envoy in US for talks ahead of new Trump summitMan arrested over killing of Israeli student Aiia Maasarwe in MelbourneBercow could be first Speaker to go without peerage in 230 years as ministers urge May to block the honourAsthma attacks three times more common than thought, amid warnings over air pollution The Last Survivors, BBC Two, first-look review: this Holocaust documentary is essential viewingDonald Trump cancels Cabinet members\u0026#39 trip to Davos due to shutdownHealth and military personnel must work together in conflict and disastersSpace is new arena for war, Donald Trump says as he unveils missile defence strategyJeremy Corbyn faces split as defiant Labour MPs discuss Brexit deal with ministersAmerican History\u0026#39s Biggest Fibs with Lucy Worsley, review: the myth-busting’s great but let’s ditch the play-actHospital, series 4 episode 2 review: a key understanding of one of Britain\u0026#39s most renowned institutionsDJ Moggster: Jacob Rees-Mogg to present new LBC phone-in show We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/10/14/15/climate-change.jpg","title":"davos 2019 world economic forum what is when date switzerland guest list attending","story":"IM Subscribe \u0026nbsp registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

More than 500 journalists were in attendance to watch US president Donald Trump booed for repeating his familiar criticisms of the press while former British prime minister David Cameron made headlines after being buttonholed by a reporter into arguing Brexit “isn’t a disaster”.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialWhat is the WEF?The WEF defines itself as “committed to improving the state of the world by engaging business, political, academic\u0026nbspand other leaders of society to shape global, regional\u0026nbspand industry agendas”.In addition to providing a space for the exchange of ideas and policy proposals, Davos has also\u0026nbspserved as a platform from which world leaders can resolve their differences.Most famously,\u0026nbspNelson Mandela and\u0026nbspFW de Klerk, South Africa\u0027s last white minority leader,\u0026nbspshook hands on the future of their country\u0026nbspat the summit in 1992. Two years later,\u0026nbspIsraeli foreign minister Shimon Peres and Yasser Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation,\u0026nbspreached key draft agreements on the disputed territories of Gaza and Jericho.It has also seen controversy.Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan stormed out of a session in 2009 after arguing with Mr Peres who had subsequently become Israel\u0027s prime minister, North Korea’s invitation\u0026nbspwas revoked in 2016 over sanction-defying nuclear tests while Chinese premier Xi Jinping used a speech in 2017 to stand up for the international establishment after populist uprisings had led the Leave campaign to win the Brexit referendum and seen President Trump enter the White House.Among the many notable celebrities to have addressed the WEF is Hollywood actor Leonardo DiCaprio, a passionate environmentalist, who spoke at\u0026nbspthe forum’s gathering in 2016\u0026nbspon climate change, pledging a $15m (£11.6m) donation on behalf of his foundation. A commendable effort undermined somewhat when he was ridiculed four months later for using a private jet to fly from France to New York to accept an award bestowed by a clean water group.The WEF has faced criticism in the past, with its meetings picketed by anti-globalisation protesters who believe organisations like the forum, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the World Trade Organisation,\u0026nbspexacerbate poverty and environmental destruction by promoting corporate interests and profit-driven business practices over humanitarian concerns.Davos, they argue, amounts to little more than the Champions League of networking events for Fat Cats.The Transnational Institute, a Dutch non-profit think tank, has gone further, attacking “the Davos class” and suggesting the WEF’s purpose is\u0026nbsp“to function as a socialising institution for the emerging global elite, globaliation’s \u0027Mafiocracy\u0027\u0026nbspof bankers, industrialists, oligarchs, technocrats and politicians. They promote common ideas, and serve common interests: their own”.What is the theme of this year’s summit?The WEF is again placing a green agenda at the centre of\u0026nbspits 2019 summit, whose theme is: “Globalisation 4.0: Shaping a New Architecture in the Age of the Fourth Industrial Revolution.”The collective recently issued\u0026nbspa report warning the international community’s ability to combat pollution has plummeted to “crisis levels” as a result of political and economic tensions, citing the US-China trade war as a particularly threatening development.“With global trade and economic growth at risk in 2019, there is a more urgent need than ever to renew the architecture of international cooperation,” said WEF president Borge Brende.“We simply do not have the gunpowder to deal with the kind of slowdown that current dynamics might lead us towards.“What we need now is coordinated, concerted action to sustain growth and to tackle the grave threats facing our world today.”Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Three people have been injured in a massive explosion on the roof of a La Doua university building in Lyon, FranceSri Lanka\u0027s Special Task Force members perform during their passing out parade in KalutaraCars are seen on fire at the scene where explosions and gunshots were heard at the Dusit hotel compound, in Nairobi, KenyaEmergency workers and people near the wreckage of a Boeing 707 military cargo plane which crashed on the west of the Iranian capital, near Fath airport.

This includes ensuring the accuracy of official statistics. But despite these responsibilities, the Authority has refused repeatedly to correct the problem,” the committee said.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialSince 2010, when there was a change in the way clothing prices were averaged, there has been an 0.8 per cent gap, on average, between the annual rate of RPI inflation and the growth of the Consumer Price Index, up from 0.5\u0026nbspper cent previously.\u0026nbspThe majority of experts agree that the RPI is upwardly biased.UK inflation hits two-year low as petrol prices fallThe UK Statistics Authority, which was formed in 2008, says the reason it has not ordered the Office for National Statistics, which it oversees, to reform the way it calculates RPI is because this would impact many UK Government bond holders, whose payments are linked to RPI, and any reform would require the approval of the Chancellor of the Exchequer.The chair of the Authority, Sir David Norgrove,\u0026nbspinformed the committee\u0026nbspin his testimony\u0026nbspthat there was no point doing so because he expected the Chancellor would simply refuse and that it would be a more productive use of his time to put pressure on ministers to stop using the RPI for regulated prices and to use the Consumer Price Index (CPI) instead.But the committee, which includes two former Chancellors and senior Treasury officials, said this stance was “untenable”.“Rather than pre-empting the decision of the Chancellor, it should fulfil its statutory duty to promote and safeguard the quality of official statistics and to do that, it should request a fix to the clothing problem,” it said.“The Chancellor should approve this change regardless of the effects on index-linked gilt holders, holders of which before 2010 received an unwarranted windfall.”The RPI’s status as a “national statistic” was revoked in 2013, but the ONS continues to compile it because it is required to do so by legislation. The index is used as a benchmark for £435bn of inflation-linked government bonds.It is also used in the calculation of student loan interest and increased in train fares.The problem in the RPI relates to a flawed formula and its interaction with a change in the collection of the prices of women’s tops.It has been estimated that around £1bn a year in excess interest is paid to bond investors by taxpayers due to the 2010 RPI change.But in other areas the Government has been accused of “inflation shopping” for its own benefit.The chairman of the Lords committee, Michael Forsyth, said: “When the government gives money to people it is generally opting to adjust payments for inflation using the CPI. But when it takes money from people, it is generally opting to use the RPI, which has been around 1 per cent\u0026nbsphigher than CPI in recent years. This simply is not fair.”In response to the Lords committee’s report, the UK Statistics Authority said it agreed that the RPI had “significant shortcomings” and it would “continue to work closely with our counterparts in government and at the Bank of England and respond to the committee”.The most recent data shows CPI inflation at 2.1\u0026nbspper cent in December 2018 and RPI inflation at 2.7 per cent.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The country artist returns after the release of his acclaimed 2016 album Shine On Rainy Day with Providence Canyon a slice of blue-collar country offering fresh tales of Southern lifeThe Brighton metal band’s sublime second album is their most ambitious to date. Enlisting Adrian Bushby (Foo Fighters, Muse) on production was a master-stroke – with his help they offer up vast sonic landscapes that recall the drama of Darion Malakian’s Scars on Broadway record, DictatorOne moment opining the joys of leaving a party to pluck your eyebrows, the next raging over the gaslighting of assault survivors, Miya Folick’s debut album continues her habit of cracking the shiny veneer of pop, and unsettling the exceptions put upon a feminine voiceThough their themes remain in the gutter, Suede aspire to monuments, and The Blue Hour will stand as another sordid masterworkSix years after the release of her last LP Sun, Cat Power – whose struggles with alcoholism, addiction and mental health issues have been much publicised – demonstrates “both a newfound sense of calm, and strength” on her new albumHoly Hell offers up some of the best tracks of the band’s career, with a through-line that maintains Tom Searle\u0027s role as an integral part of Architects, particularly on “Doomsday”, while “Hereafter” feels like the song that launches the album’s momentum. Listening to vocalist Sam Carter scream: “I wasn’t braced for the fallout” is intensely cathartic – even non-metal fans will find it hard not to be moved by the band’s sincerity. (RO)Even in discarding such basic pop necessities as melody, Robyn has managed to create a masterpiece. With her first album in seven years, the Swedish singer delivers nine songs that glow and pulse with bittersweet sensuality, sung in a voice that sifts over the synths like icing sugar1040 31. Florence \u0026amp the Machine - High as HopeOn Florence \u0026amp The Machine’s latest album High As Hope, her voice is just as powerful when she holds back. She seems to attribute much of this calmness to her new-found sobriety – she quit alcohol a few years ago and looks back on her twenties with a mix of fondness and regret1140 30. Teyana Taylor - Keep that Same EnergyShe’s not restricted by genre constraints, and K.T.S.E. (Keep That Same Energy) is a pleasant surprise. Embellished with producer Kanye West’s keen ear for samples, it blends Eighties nostalgia with fresh rap and R\u0026ampB. At the core of the project is Taylor’s love of pleasing herself, her relationship with her husband, and being a mother1240 29.

Kamasi Washington - Heaven and EarthFor a new generation, Kamasi Washington is largely responsible for the revitalised interest in jazz in modern music, most notably with his work on Kendrick Lamar’s jazz-heavy masterpiece, To Pimp a Butterfly. On Heaven and Earth, the Los Angeles saxophonist and band leader splits his second record in two halves: the urgent Earth side explores reality while Heaven deals in dreamy opulenceThe 21-year-old south London MC Novelist’s debut album is a clear, concise look at the current social and political landscape of the UK, offering up astute observations on black masculinity and the music industry along the way.The German composer’s 10th solo album is a stirring, complex work that draws on the concept of connection a fluidity in the way the universe worksCamila Cabello\u0027s debut solo album is the first time fans have been able to see her clearlyOn Mitski\u0027s brilliant fifth album she is desperate and lonely one minute, hardened and withdrawn the next.

Written as her burgeoning stature and hectic touring schedule began to take their toll, these 10 songs are Barnett’s attempt to work through her vulnerability and sadnessFor Negro Swan, Blood Orange’s fourth album, the multi-instrumentalist has dreamed up a 16-song suite that weaves together impressionist psych-pop and interstellar funk, late-Seventies Marvin Gaye and early-Eighties Prince, with some tangled ballads and insomniac blues reminiscent of Elliott Smith and King Krule thrown into the pot2140 20. Cardi B - Invasion of PrivacyWhen she sings off the hook, it’s just another moment where Cardi B runs to her own rhythm: because nothing about Invasion of Privacy is formulaicWith producer SOPHIE on board (whose own album, also released this year, is well worth your time), they explore the anxieties and frustrations of being a teenage girl through clattering beats and Nokia samples. The result is exceptionalGhetts re-evaluates much of what he said on Ghetto Gospel, when he was frustrated and angry with the world. Now he looks more to the future, whether on “Next of Kin”, where he speaks from the perspective of a mother carrying her child’s coffin, or “Black Rose”, which addresses fears for his daughter in a society that places double standards on black women. It’s a reminder that grime is so much more than violence and threats. (RO)2440 17. Cypress Hill – Elephants on AcidElephants on Acid is a 21-track monster, loaded with twists and turns that take you as far as Egypt, where Muggs recorded much of “Band of Gypsies” – teaming up with artists on oud, sitar, keyboard and guitar, as well as some of its street musicians. Its lead hook harks back to the glitchy shrieks of “How I Could Just Kill a Man” from their eponymous 1991 debut.His brilliant fourth album Love Is Magic takes listeners on a similar thrill ride, dominated by swirling loops of grand, romantic melody, sly twists of sardonic wit and heart-stopping drops of sheer honestyHis third record, produced entirely by Kanye West, could easily have been an EP, coming in at just seven songs and 21 minutes. While many fans were disappointed by the erratic and self-indulgent nature of some of West’s other releases, including his own album ye, the beats on Daytona are sample-heavy and superb the instrumentation is sparse but all the more impactful for itSince her debut single – the AK Paul-featuring “So Good” – was released in 2014, London-based singer-songwriter NAO has hovered around a near-perfect brand of sultry, neo-soul-inflected R\u0026ampB. Four years later, and she seems to have mastered itThe third solo album from the US artist stars an overwhelming number of (uncredited) guest features, producers and co-writers, but, ultimately, it’s his own, most career-defining work to date. Bloom captures the A to Z’s of modern queer love with pinpoint precisionHoward’s music has always, above all, reflected the shifts and moods in nature, while he sings poetic lyrics in his signature low, warm murmur. On Noonday Dream, he expands on the Cornish landscape that impacted his earlier work and brings in sounds and instruments that spark the imagination for places further afield, in the most exquisite way3140 10. Shame – Songs of PraiseDistinguishing themselves from the hordes of other white, indie guitar bands that emerged around summer 2017, south London natives Shame manage to make raw, bleeding anger on their debut album sound articulate.Gaika broke new ground on the UK music scene and asserted himself as one of the most provocative and multitalented young artists of this generation with his debut album, Basic VolumeTamino’s music on his debut Amir draws on the old-world romance of his grandfather – a famous Arabic musician and actor ¬– but also embodies the genre-less quality of much modern pop. The musical heritage that is so essential to the 22-year-old’s sound comes to life in the dramatic, sweeping instrumentation on a song like “So It Goes” haunting, graceful violins, bold drum beats and the shimmer of a tambourine transport the listener entirely.Mac Miller turned his anguish into one of the year’s most disarming records3540 6. Colter Wall - Song of the PlainsWall’s songwriting is as stark as it comes: his plain-speaking manner is delivered in a slow, melancholy drawl that paints him as some lonely cowboy – the last man of the West, as he describes in the most matter-of-fact terms how a bullet ripped in to “poor Wild Bill”. There’s no fuss in the instrumentation, either, mostly just gentle picking or brisk, deep thrums on Wall’s acoustic guitar, which are bolstered by icy laps of pedal steel and the occasional harmonica. It’s effective in the simplest of ways – and allows the listener’s imagination to do the restKendrick Lamar co-executive produced the Black Panther soundtrack, has writing credits on its 14 tracks, and appears in various skits and features. But his most essential job on this album is that of the curator, as he brings in a staggering array of talent – from Anderson .Paak, SZA and Future to South African gqom (EDM) artist Babes Wodumo and alt-rapper Yungen Blakrok.Kacey Musgraves third album flips between wide-eyed country pop and disco-electronica. Aided by co-writers and producers Daniel Tashian and Ian Fitchuk – both Nashville stalwarts – Musgraves conjures up a feeling of lightness as she melds the traditional and futuristic.Dirty Computer is Monáe’s gift to the LGBT+ community, non-binary people, black men and women… anyone who faces stigma and abuse just for embracing their true selves. It’s a message of love and hope to anyone who fears what is different, but who has capacity to learn and know better. And it’s seemingly a gift to herself, as well. (RO)Tranquility Base Hotel \u0026amp Casino feels more like an interlude between AM and a seventh Arctic Monkeys album – a delve into the bizarre, where even the Steinway piano has its own character. On “The Ultracheese”, the descending piano chords symbolise a kind of final bow the last soliloquy of the night before the curtain closes. Few bands today are as brave as this.Letissier makes her vintage synths snap, crackle, pop, fizz, freeze, squelch, shimmer and soar. There’s even a shattered glass effect (on “Stranger”) to complete the Old Skool Electronica bingo card. Treble notes bounce from air-cushioned soles. Bass lines lasso your hips. Chiffon layers of Letissier’s Anglo-French vocals glide around your neck and shoulders and roll them back. It’s ridiculously danceable.Thom Yorke’s first ever soundtrack summons the darkness of horror, and the terror of blood and evil, over 25 tracks.Marauder is Interpol’s most experimental to date, blending everything from rough garage rock to Motown rhythms. The band appear reinvigorated, brimming with energy and self-assurance.Brent Cobb’s music is built around people and places. The country artist returns after the release of his acclaimed 2016 album Shine On Rainy Day with Providence Canyon a slice of blue-collar country offering fresh tales of Southern lifeThe Brighton metal band’s sublime second album is their most ambitious to date. Enlisting Adrian Bushby (Foo Fighters, Muse) on production was a master-stroke – with his help they offer up vast sonic landscapes that recall the drama of Darion Malakian’s Scars on Broadway record, DictatorOne moment opining the joys of leaving a party to pluck your eyebrows, the next raging over the gaslighting of assault survivors, Miya Folick’s debut album continues her habit of cracking the shiny veneer of pop, and unsettling the exceptions put upon a feminine voiceThough their themes remain in the gutter, Suede aspire to monuments, and The Blue Hour will stand as another sordid masterworkSix years after the release of her last LP Sun, Cat Power – whose struggles with alcoholism, addiction and mental health issues have been much publicised – demonstrates “both a newfound sense of calm, and strength” on her new albumHoly Hell offers up some of the best tracks of the band’s career, with a through-line that maintains Tom Searle\u0027s role as an integral part of Architects, particularly on “Doomsday”, while “Hereafter” feels like the song that launches the album’s momentum. Listening to vocalist Sam Carter scream: “I wasn’t braced for the fallout” is intensely cathartic – even non-metal fans will find it hard not to be moved by the band’s sincerity. (RO)Even in discarding such basic pop necessities as melody, Robyn has managed to create a masterpiece. With her first album in seven years, the Swedish singer delivers nine songs that glow and pulse with bittersweet sensuality, sung in a voice that sifts over the synths like icing sugar1040 31. Florence \u0026amp the Machine - High as HopeOn Florence \u0026amp The Machine’s latest album High As Hope, her voice is just as powerful when she holds back. She seems to attribute much of this calmness to her new-found sobriety – she quit alcohol a few years ago and looks back on her twenties with a mix of fondness and regret1140 30. Teyana Taylor - Keep that Same EnergyShe’s not restricted by genre constraints, and K.T.S.E. (Keep That Same Energy) is a pleasant surprise. Embellished with producer Kanye West’s keen ear for samples, it blends Eighties nostalgia with fresh rap and R\u0026ampB. At the core of the project is Taylor’s love of pleasing herself, her relationship with her husband, and being a mother1240 29. The 1975 – A Brief Inquiry into Online RelationshipsOn their third and best album, A Brief Inquiry into Online Relationships, The 1975 have created what so many post-Radiohead bands couldn’t: a coherent pop statement with enough hope, radical honesty and genre-ning breadth to make sense across ided generations1340 28. Kamasi Washington - Heaven and EarthFor a new generation, Kamasi Washington is largely responsible for the revitalised interest in jazz in modern music, most notably with his work on Kendrick Lamar’s jazz-heavy masterpiece, To Pimp a Butterfly. On Heaven and Earth, the Los Angeles saxophonist and band leader splits his second record in two halves: the urgent Earth side explores reality while Heaven deals in dreamy opulenceThe 21-year-old south London MC Novelist’s debut album is a clear, concise look at the current social and political landscape of the UK, offering up astute observations on black masculinity and the music industry along the way.The German composer’s 10th solo album is a stirring, complex work that draws on the concept of connection a fluidity in the way the universe worksCamila Cabello\u0027s debut solo album is the first time fans have been able to see her clearlyOn Mitski\u0027s brilliant fifth album she is desperate and lonely one minute, hardened and withdrawn the next. Her music, which exists in a space between fierce, guitar-led walls of noise and soft, delicate balladry, feels like an open wound – and Be The Cowboy is no different. (AP)Frontman Olly Alexander is offering fans their own generational pop icon: a young man who has the courage to put all of that vibrant, dynamic character on full displayOn Tell Me How You Really Feel, Courtney Barnett turns her keen eye inwards, exploring anxiety and depression while coming to terms with her own emotional life. Written as her burgeoning stature and hectic touring schedule began to take their toll, these 10 songs are Barnett’s attempt to work through her vulnerability and sadnessFor Negro Swan, Blood Orange’s fourth album, the multi-instrumentalist has dreamed up a 16-song suite that weaves together impressionist psych-pop and interstellar funk, late-Seventies Marvin Gaye and early-Eighties Prince, with some tangled ballads and insomniac blues reminiscent of Elliott Smith and King Krule thrown into the pot2140 20. Cardi B - Invasion of PrivacyWhen she sings off the hook, it’s just another moment where Cardi B runs to her own rhythm: because nothing about Invasion of Privacy is formulaicWith producer SOPHIE on board (whose own album, also released this year, is well worth your time), they explore the anxieties and frustrations of being a teenage girl through clattering beats and Nokia samples. The result is exceptionalGhetts re-evaluates much of what he said on Ghetto Gospel, when he was frustrated and angry with the world. Now he looks more to the future, whether on “Next of Kin”, where he speaks from the perspective of a mother carrying her child’s coffin, or “Black Rose”, which addresses fears for his daughter in a society that places double standards on black women. It’s a reminder that grime is so much more than violence and threats. (RO)2440 17.

More than 500 journalists were in attendance to watch US president Donald Trump booed for repeating his familiar criticisms of the press while former British prime minister David Cameron made headlines after being buttonholed by a reporter into arguing Brexit “isn’t a disaster”.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialWhat is the WEF?The WEF defines itself as “committed to improving the state of the world by engaging business, political, academic\u0026nbspand other leaders of society to shape global, regional\u0026nbspand industry agendas”.In addition to providing a space for the exchange of ideas and policy proposals, Davos has also\u0026nbspserved as a platform from which world leaders can resolve their differences.Most famously,\u0026nbspNelson Mandela and\u0026nbspFW de Klerk, South Africa\u0027s last white minority leader,\u0026nbspshook hands on the future of their country\u0026nbspat the summit in 1992. Two years later,\u0026nbspIsraeli foreign minister Shimon Peres and Yasser Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation,\u0026nbspreached key draft agreements on the disputed territories of Gaza and Jericho.It has also seen controversy.Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan stormed out of a session in 2009 after arguing with Mr Peres who had subsequently become Israel\u0027s prime minister, North Korea’s invitation\u0026nbspwas revoked in 2016 over sanction-defying nuclear tests while Chinese premier Xi Jinping used a speech in 2017 to stand up for the international establishment after populist uprisings had led the Leave campaign to win the Brexit referendum and seen President Trump enter the White House.Among the many notable celebrities to have addressed the WEF is Hollywood actor Leonardo DiCaprio, a passionate environmentalist, who spoke at\u0026nbspthe forum’s gathering in 2016\u0026nbspon climate change, pledging a $15m (£11.6m) donation on behalf of his foundation. A commendable effort undermined somewhat when he was ridiculed four months later for using a private jet to fly from France to New York to accept an award bestowed by a clean water group.The WEF has faced criticism in the past, with its meetings picketed by anti-globalisation protesters who believe organisations like the forum, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the World Trade Organisation,\u0026nbspexacerbate poverty and environmental destruction by promoting corporate interests and profit-driven business practices over humanitarian concerns.Davos, they argue, amounts to little more than the Champions League of networking events for Fat Cats.The Transnational Institute, a Dutch non-profit think tank, has gone further, attacking “the Davos class” and suggesting the WEF’s purpose is\u0026nbsp“to function as a socialising institution for the emerging global elite, globaliation’s \u0027Mafiocracy\u0027\u0026nbspof bankers, industrialists, oligarchs, technocrats and politicians. They promote common ideas, and serve common interests: their own”.What is the theme of this year’s summit?The WEF is again placing a green agenda at the centre of\u0026nbspits 2019 summit, whose theme is: “Globalisation 4.0: Shaping a New Architecture in the Age of the Fourth Industrial Revolution.”The collective recently issued\u0026nbspa report warning the international community’s ability to combat pollution has plummeted to “crisis levels” as a result of political and economic tensions, citing the US-China trade war as a particularly threatening development.“With global trade and economic growth at risk in 2019, there is a more urgent need than ever to renew the architecture of international cooperation,” said WEF president Borge Brende.“We simply do not have the gunpowder to deal with the kind of slowdown that current dynamics might lead us towards.“What we need now is coordinated, concerted action to sustain growth and to tackle the grave threats facing our world today.”Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Three people have been injured in a massive explosion on the roof of a La Doua university building in Lyon, FranceSri Lanka\u0027s Special Task Force members perform during their passing out parade in KalutaraCars are seen on fire at the scene where explosions and gunshots were heard at the Dusit hotel compound, in Nairobi, KenyaEmergency workers and people near the wreckage of a Boeing 707 military cargo plane which crashed on the west of the Iranian capital, near Fath airport.

If they do not, we will use our powers to intervene.”Created with Sketch.Student news in pictures Show all 34Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.South Korean policemen detain student protestors during a protest against South Korean President Park Geun-Hye outside the National Assembly in Seoul, South Korea.Filipino demonstrators face off with anti-riot police during a protest near the US Embassy in Manila, PhilippineHundreds of protesters including Indigenous People, students and militant groups marched towards the US Embassy to protest against the presence of US military troops and condemning the violent dispersal which left at least forty people hurt including twenty police officers and three people who were run over by a police vanA federal judge in Mexico has ordered that a once-fugitive police chief be held on charges of kidnapping in the disappearance of 43 studentsA man holds up a photograph of a missing student with a caption reading \u0027We are missing 43,\u0027 during a meeting marking the 25-month anniversary of the disappearances of 43 students in the southern state of Guerrero, in Mexico City.

This includes ensuring the accuracy of official statistics. But despite these responsibilities, the Authority has refused repeatedly to correct the problem,” the committee said.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialSince 2010, when there was a change in the way clothing prices were averaged, there has been an 0.8 per cent gap, on average, between the annual rate of RPI inflation and the growth of the Consumer Price Index, up from 0.5\u0026nbspper cent previously.\u0026nbspThe majority of experts agree that the RPI is upwardly biased.UK inflation hits two-year low as petrol prices fallThe UK Statistics Authority, which was formed in 2008, says the reason it has not ordered the Office for National Statistics, which it oversees, to reform the way it calculates RPI is because this would impact many UK Government bond holders, whose payments are linked to RPI, and any reform would require the approval of the Chancellor of the Exchequer.The chair of the Authority, Sir David Norgrove,\u0026nbspinformed the committee\u0026nbspin his testimony\u0026nbspthat there was no point doing so because he expected the Chancellor would simply refuse and that it would be a more productive use of his time to put pressure on ministers to stop using the RPI for regulated prices and to use the Consumer Price Index (CPI) instead.But the committee, which includes two former Chancellors and senior Treasury officials, said this stance was “untenable”.“Rather than pre-empting the decision of the Chancellor, it should fulfil its statutory duty to promote and safeguard the quality of official statistics and to do that, it should request a fix to the clothing problem,” it said.“The Chancellor should approve this change regardless of the effects on index-linked gilt holders, holders of which before 2010 received an unwarranted windfall.”The RPI’s status as a “national statistic” was revoked in 2013, but the ONS continues to compile it because it is required to do so by legislation. The index is used as a benchmark for £435bn of inflation-linked government bonds.It is also used in the calculation of student loan interest and increased in train fares.The problem in the RPI relates to a flawed formula and its interaction with a change in the collection of the prices of women’s tops.It has been estimated that around £1bn a year in excess interest is paid to bond investors by taxpayers due to the 2010 RPI change.But in other areas the Government has been accused of “inflation shopping” for its own benefit.The chairman of the Lords committee, Michael Forsyth, said: “When the government gives money to people it is generally opting to adjust payments for inflation using the CPI. But when it takes money from people, it is generally opting to use the RPI, which has been around 1 per cent\u0026nbsphigher than CPI in recent years. This simply is not fair.”In response to the Lords committee’s report, the UK Statistics Authority said it agreed that the RPI had “significant shortcomings” and it would “continue to work closely with our counterparts in government and at the Bank of England and respond to the committee”.The most recent data shows CPI inflation at 2.1\u0026nbspper cent in December 2018 and RPI inflation at 2.7 per cent.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But using a Nasa craft in orbit around the Moon, the scientists have been able to estimate the age of craters for the first time.Fossil of gigantic ‘mammal-like’ reptile discovered in PolandBones of new species of vegetarian dinosaur found in BrazilLargest dinosaur foot ever recorded came from brachiosaur, study finds“The relative rarity of large craters on Earth older than 290 million years and younger than 650 million years is not because we lost the craters, but because the impact rate during that time was lower than it is now,” said Rebecca Ghent, an associate professor at the University of Toronto and one of the paper’s co-authors. Thermal data and images collected by Nasa’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO), which has been circling the Moon since 2009, has allowed scientists to determine the size of soil and rocks surrounding a crater. During the lunar night, bigger rocks radiate more heat than finer lunar soil.In conjunction with data on how long it takes for Moon rock to break down into soil, it was revealed the size and number of large rocks near a crater give an indication of that crater’s age. Younger craters tend to be covered with more boulders and rocks than older craters. This breakdown is caused over hundreds of millions of years by the “constant rain of tiny meteorites”, the research team said. “The LRO’s instruments have allowed scientists to peer back in time at the forces that shaped the Moon,” said Noah Petro, an LRO project scientist based at Nasa Goddard Space Flight Centre in Maryland.The findings on the Moon were supported by geological studies on Earth. The team in Toronto worked with the University of Southampton’s Thomas Gernon, who studies a terrestrial feature called kimberlite pipes.Created with Sketch.Dinosaurs in the Wild  Show all 18Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Dinosaurs in the WildDinosaurs in the WildPair of QuetzalcoatlusDinosaurs in the WildDinosaurs in the WildDinosaurs in the WildDinosaurs in the WildChronotex X90 with an AlamosaurusDinosaurs in the WildTyrannosaurus and geyserDinosaurs in the WildDinosaurs in the WildTimebase 67 and a QuetzalcoatlusDinosaurs in the Wildriceratops with a Chronotex X90Dinosaurs in the WildDinosarus in the WildDinosaurs in the WildDinosaurs in the WildPair of QuetzalcoatlusDinosaurs in the WildDinosaurs in the WildDinosaurs in the WildDinosaurs in the WildChronotex X90 with an AlamosaurusDinosaurs in the WildTyrannosaurus and geyserDinosaurs in the WildDinosaurs in the WildTimebase 67 and a QuetzalcoatlusDinosaurs in the Wildriceratops with a Chronotex X90Dinosaurs in the WildDinosarus in the WildThese “pipes”, formed over the last 650 millions years, are the subterranean remnants of long extinct volcanoes, which stretch down in a carrot shape “a couple of kilometres” below the surface. The hardness of the rock means they remain some of the least eroded areas on our planet. Dr Gernon found the crater records in these areas correlate closely with those of the Moon. The research suggests crater formation over the last 290 million years has been as much as three times higher than in the previous 700 million years.“It was a painstaking task, at first, to look through all of these data and map the craters out without knowing whether we would get anywhere or not,” said Sara Mazrouei, lead author of the paper who analysed all the data for the project at the University of Toronto.But she said the study now “provides evidence for a dramatic change in the rate of asteroid impacts on both Earth and the Moon that occurred around the end of the Paleozoic era.”New dog-sized dinosaur species found in AustraliaIt is not known why there was this rapid escalation in the number of asteroid strikes on the Earth and the Moon, but the team have suggested it could be related to huge collisions taking place in the main asteroid belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. Such events can create debris that can reach the inner solar system.Dinosaurs proliferated about 250 million years ago, and “as a species were particularly vulnerable to large impacts from the get-go, more so than earlier animal groups”, said Dr Gernon.“It’s perhaps fair to say it was a date with destiny for the dinosaurs – their downfall was somewhat inevitable given the surge of large space rocks colliding with Earth,” he added.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Used for conditions such as myopia and cataracts.A second phase would involve a superconducting proton machine in the same tunnel, at a cost of about 15 billion euros more. That machine could start operation in the late 2050s.\u0026nbspThe concept paper, five years in the making, aimed to explore prospects of tantalizingly more powerful particle colliders that can inaugurate the post-LHC era in high-energy physics, CERN said on its website.Scientists discover new subatomic particle at Large Hadron ColliderUltimately, the FCC would include a superconducting proton accelerator ring with energy of up to 100 tera electron volts, compared with a maximum 17 TeV in the current collider.\u0026nbspCERN Director-General Fabiola Gianotti called the report a remarkable achievement that could help boost understanding of fundamental physics and advance technologies.\u0026nbspCERN said it was not possible to say exactly what benefits the new collider would bring to the world, but pointed out that the discovery of the electron in 1897 led to the electronics industry that now contributes $3 trillion annually to the world economy.The proposal came out of the European strategy for particle physics, which recommended that design and feasibility studies be conducted in order for Europe to be in a position to propose an ambitious post-LHC accelerator project at CERN by the time of the next strategy update.But the decision on whether to go ahead with the FCC - incurring an initial 9 billion euro ($10.25 billion) bill for participating governments plus a later 15 billion euro upgrade - is effectively part of an international race to host the LHC\u0027s successor, with China, Japan, the United States and Europe all interested.Any big machine for the future will be a global machine, said Arnaud Marsollier, head of media relations at CERN.No one expects to have two 100-km colliders built in the next 20 years, so if one is built in China, maybe Europe will do something else.The LHC is expected to keep running until around 2036-2040, by which time it will have done its job collecting data, but it might also be possible to upgrade it by increasing the energy of collisions, which would require major investment.China has floated plans for its own 100-km collider, but has not yet confirmed it will go ahead.Japan is expected to take a decision on a linear collider in March, which could play into a potential choice by European countries in 2020 about whether to back the FCC or another proposal for CERN, the Compact Linear Collider.For physicists, the location may be less important than the science opportunities on offered by a new collider, allowing them to peer into the debris left when subatomic particles smash together and shatter into even smaller pieces, some of which may answer fundamental questions about the universe.But science mega-projects attract talent and can generate unforeseen spin-offs - including the invention of the World Wide Web at CERN, which has become a global centre for physicists, despite the high cost of living around Geneva.The discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012 earned Peter Higgs and Francois Englert the 2013 Nobel prize. They had predicted half a century earlier that it would one day be discovered.Additional reporting by agenciesOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Scientists were able to weigh the rings by measuring their gravitational pull.Just before Nasa\u0027s Cassini spacecraft fell into Saturn and destroyed itself, it flew between the rings and the planet itself, allowing scientists to watch how they tugged it around during the flight. That meant the spacecraft could act as a gravity probe, measuring how much pull the rings themselves had.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialThe researchers found that estimate – which showed they had about 40 per cent of the pull of Saturn\u0027s moon Mimas, itself about 2,000 times smaller than our own Moon – shows the rings are relatively new.

The crew of seven was the largest to fly on a spacecraft at that time, and STS-41G was the first flight to include two female astronauts1730 A Fresh Perspective on an Extraordinary Cluster of GalaxiesGalaxy clusters are often described by superlatives. After all, they are huge conglomerations of galaxies, hot gas, and dark matter and represent the largest structures in the Universe held together by gravityNasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telescope has unveiled in stunning detail a small section of the Veil Nebula - expanding remains of a massive star that exploded about 8,000 years agoThe arrangement of the spiral arms in the galaxy Messier 63, seen here in an image from the Nasa Hubble Space Telescope, recall the pattern at the center of a sunflowerThe spectacular cosmic pairing of the star Hen 2-427 — more commonly known as WR 124 — and the nebula M1-67 which surrounds itFour images from New Horizons’ Long Range Reconnaissance Imager (LORRI) were combined with colour data from the Ralph instrument to create this enhanced colour global view of Pluto2230 Fresh Crater Near Sirenum Fossae Region of MarsThe HiRISE camera aboard Nasa\u0027s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter acquired this closeup image of a fresh (on a geological scale, though quite old on a human scale) impact crater in the Sirenum Fossae region of Mars. This impact crater appears relatively recent as it has a sharp rim and well-preserved ejecta2330 Earth Observations From Gemini IV in 1965This photograph of the Florida Straits and Grand Bahama Bank was taken during the Gemini IV mission during orbit no. 19 in 1965. The Gemini IV crew conducted scientific experiments, including photography of Earth\u0027s weather and terrain, for the remainder of their four-day mission following Ed White\u0027s historic spacewalk on June 32430 Nasa Celebrates 50 Years of SpacewalkingFor 50 years, NASA has been suiting up for spacewalking. In this 1984 photograph of the first untethered spacewalk, NASA astronaut Bruce McCandless is in the midst of the first field tryout of a nitrogen-propelled backpack device called the Manned Maneuvering Unit (MMU)2530 Hubble Peers into the Most Crowded Place in the Milky WayThis Nasa Hubble Space Telescope image presents the Arches Cluster, the densest known star cluster in the Milky Way2630 An Astronaut\u0027s View from SpaceNasa astronaut Reid Wiseman tweeted this photo from the International Space Station on 2 September 20142730 Giant Landform on MarsOn Mars, we can observe four classes of sandy landforms formed by the wind, or aeolian bedforms: ripples, transverse aeolian ridges, dunes, and what are called “draa”A sokol suit helmet can be seen against the window of the Soyuz TMA-11M capsule shortly after the spacecraft landed with Expedition 39 Commander Koichi Wakata of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), Soyuz Commander Mikhail Tyurin of Roscosmos, and Flight Engineer Rick Mastracchio of NASA near the town of Zhezkazgan, Kazakhstan2930 Jupiter\u0027s Great Red Spot Viewed by Voyager I3030 Chandra Observatory Sees a Heart in the DarknessThat finally answers a long argument among planetary scientists. Some argued the rings must have arrived alongside the planet, some 4.5 billion years, formed out of ice that was left behind when the solar system came together – others argued that they were much newer and came about when an object was destroyed and became rubble that orbited around the planet.Researchers found themselves initially\u0026nbspshocked by the data they received back from Cassini and what it seemed to suggest about the ring\u0027s gravity. But they then accounted for the fact Saturn has deep flowing winds and the measurements started to make sense.The first time I looked at the data I didn\u0027t believe it, because I trusted our models and it took a while to sink in that there was some effect that changed the gravity field that we had not considered, said Burkhard Militzer, a professor of earth and planetary science at the University of California, Berkeley, who models planetary interiors. That turned out to be massive flows in the atmosphere at least 9,000 kilometers deep around the equatorial region. We thought preliminarily that these clouds were like clouds on Earth, which are confined to a thin layer and contain almost no mass. But on Saturn they are really massive.It is still not clear how the vast rings managed to form so recently, according to the study\u0027s authors. But the researchers say that the surprising discovery of the ring\u0027s youth is a fitting way to end Cassini\u0027s mission, and marks one of a range of surprising discoveries about the planet and the rings that surround it.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It has made a number of changes to deal with a no-deal Brexit – as well as the possible disruption caused even by\u0026nbspan orderly withdrawal.Who is responsible for the EU’s no-deal preparations?Responsibility for the EU’s no-deal preparations is split between the European Commission\u0026nbspin Brussels, and the 27 EU member states themselves.Plan for parliament to seize control of Brexit gains momentumAll the member states will have to make some kind of preparations, but some will be more affected than others.France, the Netherlands\u0026nbspand Belgium will bear the brunt, as they\u0026nbsphave the closest links with the UK because of their geographical location. Spain also faces extra challenges due to the proximity of Gibraltar.In Brussels, the EU’s general secretary Martin Selmayr, who leads its civil service, is personally in charge of no-deal prep.What is the European Commission itself doing to prepare for a no-deal scenario?The European Commission has issued dozens of “preparedness notices” to help inform businesses about how they might be affected when the UK leaves.\u0026nbspThese are sorted into different policy areas, ranging from public procurement\u0026nbspto environment – often down to minute detail.Created with Sketch.Brexit deal vote: Opposing groups of protesters gather by Parliament Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people\u0027s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of ParliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer UKIP leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside ParliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster Bridge ahead of today\u0027s vote Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outiside ParliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside ParliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster Bridge ahead of today\u0027s vote Protesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside ParliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near ParliamentAn anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people\u0027s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of ParliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer UKIP leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside ParliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster Bridge ahead of today\u0027s vote Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outiside ParliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside ParliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster Bridge ahead of today\u0027s vote Protesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside ParliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near ParliamentThere is, for instance, a three-page notice dedicated to occupational retirement pensions. Inland waterways get\u0026nbsptheir own notice, as do slaughterhouse operators.The commission has also made a number changes to its own structures. It has relocated the European Medicines Agency and the European Banking Authority, drawn up new guidelines on visas, and issued new regulations on air transport, ship inspection, and car-type approval – among other tidying-up exercises.A\u0026nbspsenior EU official will also be dispatched to each member state to help no-deal prep.What are inidual EU countries doing to get prepared?Different EU countries have different interactions with the UK, and are making different preparations accordingly.\u0026nbspFor some states, the main issue is what happens to British citizens living within their borders\u0026nbspin the event of a no-deal Brexit. Because UK nationals will no longer be able to live and work in EU countries by default, states have to decide what to do with them. This is the responsibility of member states, not the EU as a whole.Most countries are creating\u0026nbspsome kind of registration scheme for existing British nationals, and have guaranteed their rights even\u0026nbspin the event of a no-deal scenario – though some have been quicker than others.Other countries have a closer relationship with the UK. The Netherlands deals with a lot of trade bound for the UK, so the Dutch government has hired 1,000 extra customs officers for the port of Rotterdam and Schiphol airport, which are both major hubs into the UK. These staff will be needed to deal with the extra customs checks a no-deal would bring.On 28 January it will be launching a major information campaign for businesses, which the government says have not moved quickly enough to prepare.France’s national assembly has, meanwhile, granted the French government sweeping emergency powers to deal with all aspects of a no-deal Brexit.

insists crashing out can only be blocked by agreeing a deal, or by revoking Article 50 –\u0026nbspadding: \u0027I believe it would be wrong to overturn the referendum result\u0027Click to followIndy PoliticsTheresa May has toughened her stance on refusing to rule out a no-deal Brexit, telling Jeremy Corbyn it is an “impossible condition” that she cannot meet.The Labour leader is boycotting talks with the prime minister until she drops threats to crash the UK out of the EU\u0026nbsp– and has told his MPs to do the same.But, in a letter to Mr Corbyn, Ms May has said: “That is an impossible condition because it is not within the government’s power to rule out no-deal.”For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialShe argued that the default position, under the Article 50 process, was that the UK “will leave the EU without a deal on 29 March”.Ms May wrote: “There are two ways to avoid no-deal: either to vote for a deal, in particular a withdrawal agreement that has been agreed with the EU, or to revoke Article 50 and overturn the referendum result.”And she challenged Mr Corbyn to make his choice, adding: “I believe it would be wrong to overturn the referendum result.”The letter came as it was revealed that No 10 has drawn up a paper setting out the potential timetable for a Final Say referendum on Brexit – arguing it would take an astonishing 14 months.The document’s existence emerged after Ms May referred to it in meetings with other political leaders, as she seeks a consensus on how to solve the crisis.But Dominic Grieve, a Tory supporter of a fresh referendum, ridiculed the idea as “simply wrong”, adding: “It could be carried out swiftly and within a limited time extension of Article 50.”Ms May\u0027s no-deal claim comes despite both foreign secretary\u0026nbspJeremy Hunt\u0026nbspand chancellor\u0026nbspPhilip Hammond\u0026nbspsuggesting MPs could – in reality, whatever the legalities – block a crash-out.In a leaked transcript of a conversation with business leaders this week, Mr Hammond said: “It is clear to me there is a large majority in the Commons that is opposed to no deal in any circumstances.”In her letter to Mr Corbyn, Ms May also appeared to dismiss the aims of a cross-party campaign, coming to a head next week, to put parliament in charge of the process.Created with Sketch.Brexit deal vote: Opposing groups of protesters gather by Parliament Show all 20Created

An exclusive survey for The Independent shows that a fresh vote received more support than any of the\u0026nbspfour other options put to the public, including allowing\u0026nbspthe prime minister to go back to Brussels\u0026nbspor a\u0026nbspno-deal Brexit.The survey by poling organisation BMG Research also suggests that more people oppose\u0026nbspMs May’s deal than back it, although the prime minister can take some comfort in the data showing a softening of opposition.

It found 28 per cent were against and 26 per cent did not know.Remaining in the EU was backed by 45 per cent, while 39 per cent of people said they\u0026nbspopposed reversing Brexit and 16 per cent said they did not know.Forty-five per cent supported further negotiation with the EU, while 34 per cent were against going back to Brussels for fresh talks. More than a fifth (21 per cent) did not know.Some 40 per cent would opt for Norway-style deal – which allows access to the single market – but 36 per cent dismissed the option and 24 per cent were unsure.Leaving the EU without a deal was the least popular option as it was preferred by only 35 per cent, while 45 per cent opposed it and 21 per cent said they did not know.It comes as\u0026nbspthe prime minister has been reaching out to Labour MPs and trade unions in a last-ditch bid to get her deal\u0026nbspthrough parliament.Government insiders are expecting Brussels\u0026nbspto offer\u0026nbspMs May some extra help by Monday, which they hope will ease fears from wavering MPs over\u0026nbspthe\u0026nbspIrish backstop.However, she is unlikely to secure a legally binding guarantee that the UK can independently decide to the leave the backstop, which Brexiteers and her\u0026nbspDUP allies want.BBC analysis estimates Ms May could lose the meaningful vote by\u0026nbsp228 votes next week, after which she would have to come back to parliament within three days with a plan B.Northern Ireland secretary ‘using peace process as bargaining tool’What is the position of the big trade unions on Brexit?The truth about May’s shambolic approach to the unionsFinally, May has realised she desperately needs Labour’s backingArticle 50 set to be extended even if May wins crucial Brexit voteOpposition to Ms May’s deal\u0026nbsphas weakened among the public, as the BMG research shows 37 per cent think\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspshould reject the deal, compared with 43 per cent in December.When asked if parliament should vote to accept the terms of the deal, 29 per cent said they should, up from 26 per cent last month. More than 30 per cent said they were unsure in both instances.The poll put Labour and the Conservatives\u0026nbspneck and neck on 36 per cent of the vote,\u0026nbspwith the\u0026nbspLiberal Democrats on 12 points,\u0026nbspUkip\u0026nbspon 6 per cent and the Greens on 5 points, once don’t-knows were excluded.The Independent\u0026nbsprevealed on Friday that Ms May’s\u0026nbspchances of delivering\u0026nbspBrexit\u0026nbspon 29 March are fading fast after senior ministers privately admitted more time is needed, even if her deal wins the backing of parliament.On Saturday, transport secretary Chris Grayling was accused of engaging in “gutter politics” when he warned that blocking Brexit could lead to a surge in far-right extremism.Created with Sketch.

Failing this, a general election will be called.The last time a motion of no confidence successfully received the required support of MPs was in 1979 - by just one vote.

Haaland and Sharice Davids of Kansas, a member of the Ho-Chunk Nation, are the first Native American women.Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan are the first Muslim women.

They got it in 1962, making the southwestern state the last in the nation to extend it.On 3 January, Haaland welcomed her new constituents to an open house at her congressional office before being sworn in on the House floor.

But for activists, the battle is not over yet.\u0026nbspTheir wider goal, they say, is demanding proper asylum rights from the city council.\u0026nbspAlvaro, a member of the solidarity movements\u0026nbspwho is writing a PhD thesis on them, said there was a strong socialist spirit of “fighting fascism, real estate speculation and gentrification by tourism”\u0026nbspamongst what he described as “solidarity networks”\u0026nbspacross the city.\u0026nbspHe added that it is thanks to such communities that refugees and asylum seekers are able to find places to live, “otherwise they would be left on the streets”.He said the asylum application process is difficult for many because they do not fit specific requirements and many end up without a roof over their heads.Created with Sketch.

So we basically try to put them into the system so they can get a proper welcome.”\u0026nbspThe solution is temporary and this is why we held this protest. We want the government to provide a proper hosting system for refugees with permanent housing, education, and work opportunities.The squat was one way in which they have tried to help newly arrived asylum seekers and refugees.\u0026nbspUntil two months ago, Barcelona’s “marginalised people” occupied the building, Maria says, but vacated it so asylum seekers could make use of it instead.\u0026nbspBut while the squat eviction has been temporarily suspended, the prospect\u0026nbsphas not been permanently banished. At a protest following the celebratory lunch, several hundred activists highlighted the limbo the squat’s residents now find themselves in.\u0026nbsp“For now, we are happy the eviction has been stopped, but we don´t know where they will go so we demand a permanent solution,” Maria added.“What can you do in the absence of state help? Just leave refugees on the street?\u0026nbsp“Every day we are receiving new people here. We are doing this, but it’s exhausting at the same time. And I think the officials are grateful for our work because it means they don’t have to do their job.”She says members of the\u0026nbspcity´s solidarity network met council officials, who agreed to send a mediation team to conduct a vulnerability report, leading a judge to halt the eviction.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Three people have been injured in a massive explosion on the roof of a La Doua university building in Lyon, FranceSri Lanka\u0027s Special Task Force members perform during their passing out parade in KalutaraCars are seen on fire at the scene where explosions and gunshots were heard at the Dusit hotel compound, in Nairobi, KenyaEmergency workers and people near the wreckage of a Boeing 707 military cargo plane which crashed on the west of the Iranian capital, near Fath airport.

He initially sought asylum in Germany, which was “not so friendly,” so came to Barcelona two months ago after hearing it was more welcoming to refugees. He has lived at Casa Africa since.\u0026nbsp“Since I´ve been in Barcelona, I have seen a lot of friendly, nice and very welcoming people,” he said.\u0026nbspHousing for asylum seekers is abysmal – things need to change now“Many of them are also struggling and it´s not easy for them to help, so we really thank them a lot.“It is also not an easy life to be a refugee and I have met many people sleeping on the street. I was told that if I see someone in trouble like this, to bring them here. I have brought maybe four or five people here, to the squat at Casa Africa.”Zac said he was granted asylum seeker status a week ago but still does not have access to a social worker, which he needs in order to find accommodation, and a job.“My dream is to find work. If I don´t have a home, I cannot achieve this, but hopefully this will change.”Ignasi Calbó, manager of the city council’s “Barcelona, Refugee City” plan\u0026nbsp(Barcelona – Cuitat Refugi) said all asylum seekers at Casa Africa are enrolled onto language courses and have access to legal advice.\u0026nbspHe said the plan’s “Service Centre for Immigrants, Emigrants and Refugees”\u0026nbsp(SAIER)\u0026nbspwas launched in 2015 in response to the crisis. Its website states refugees and immigrants are provided with information on housing, legal aid, social care and on learning Catalan and Spanish.\u0026nbspMexico agrees to take in America’s asylum seekersBut Mr Calbó bemoaned the lack of central government support, which, he says, “creates unrealistic policies, provides no resources to help refugees and simply does not care for them.”He said the council is appreciative of the work of Barcelona’s community of activists for helping newly arrived refugees.\u0026nbsp“It’s good to see how people are working to help people who need it, but we are working with the community to find solutions,” he added.“They help us and we help them to achieve their goals, like we have done with postponing of this eviction.”He confirmed Casa Africa was not an isolated case of solidarity shown by locals to newcomers.\u0026nbspMr Calbó said some 7,000 refugees arrived in the city in 2018, up from around 4,000 in 2017 and nearer 2,000 in 2016.But he said programmes to integrate and host refugees are expensive.Those who have found shelter at Casa Africa must wait to hear whether they will be allowed to stay.However, for Zac, it has already proved\u0026nbsphow migrants need not be regarded with fear and suspicion, and can help benefit their adopted communities.“There is plenty of room for everyone,” he said. “People are just not given access to go and work and pay taxes. If they are given this, everything will be comfortable.\u0026nbsp“If you are working you must pay your taxes and that is what we want to do.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Few believe him.Last year, he enraged EU chiefs, grabbing a key role as the European Commission’s Secretary-General by stealth and seizing control of the entire Brussels machine and its , staff.This puts him in pole position to succeed his boss, Jean-Claude Juncker who lurches into retirement this year as the commission’s supreme leader.Mrs May, steely-eyed and unflinching at home, has been the first to blink whenever the EU has set out its demands.Now she has infuriated fellow Tories by flirting with opportunistic Labour MPs and offering concessions to trade union dinosaurs such as Len McCluskey.“Her first loyalty has always been to the Conservative Party,” says a former ally.“Yet here she is presiding over its potential destruction.”The rebellion, led by Tory hypocrite Dominic Grieve, will reach its climax as Tory Remainers gang up with Labour and unSpeakable John Bercow to sabotage Brexit and block No Deal.A “secret” plan to hijack Commons procedure is being hatched by ex-minister Oliver Letwin, perhaps the silliest clever person in Westminster.It was Letwin who devised the disastrous poll tax, invited thieves into his house at am to “use his loo” and loot his property and casually dumped secret Cabinet papers in a Hyde Park litter bin.And it was Letwin, “the man in the custard-coloured corduroys”, who drove a stake through free speech in a am stitch-up with Labour and the Lib-Dems.Tory Chief Whip Julian Smith overheard the plotting in an MPs’ cloakroom, perhaps after being alerted by Letwin’s yelping giggle.He swtly leaked the scheme to frighten waverers into saving May’s deal.The rebel rabble have no idea what will happenthey succeed in killing it.A second referendum giving a clear choice between In and Out might well see an increased vote for Brexit.Any attempt to fiddle the question would trigger a dangerous backlash.An emergency election is for the birds. That leaves us with a No Deal Brexit on World Trade terms, which cannot be stopped without a change in the law before March .Forget about the Government’s Apocalypse Now propaganda. Germany is near recession, Italy is already there and France is joining the queue.Our economy is growing better than most and experts say it will accelerate, whichever way Brexit is resolved.For that silent -per-cent majority, a clean break still seems the right answer.SHOUTY Remainer Anna Soubry rightly complains about being labelled a “Nazi” by unsavoury protesters.Yet this publicity-hungry Tory MP is very free with her own insults, casually labelling as “racist” anyone who voted Out – surely a far nastier insult in modern Britain.Perhaps Ms Soubry should follow her own revolting advice . . . and “just suck it up”.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Even worse, it would deny us the right to walk away from these new arrangements without the EU’s say-so.May’s dodgy deal would reduce the UK to a vassal state, a bossed-about colonial outpost of the Brussels ­oligarchy. The people voted for Leave, yet May offers us Remain by another name, a deal that sells out Brexit.For the PM to so wilfully ignore the cry of her people is a sucker-punch to the most basic principles of democracy.But it gets worse. The MPs who plan to revolt against May’s deal in the ­Commons today will not do so to protect Brexit.They are not taking a stand against May’s deal to defend what .million of us — the largest bloc in British ­electoral history — voted for in June : A clean exit from the EU.No. They see taking down May’s deal as the first step to taking down Brexit itself.Whether it’s Europhile Tories or Labour, SNP and Lib Dem MPs who have long loathed the idea of Brexit, an army of parliamentarians plan to knock down May’s deal so they can set about knocking down Brexit.So the real ide in ­Parliament today is over how to stop Brexit.The main thing our MPs will disagree on today is whether Brexit should be killed off by May’s shady deal, by extending the Article  process or even with a second referendum, as anti-May MPs would prefer.Think about this. Think about what it says about the state of British politics.The people vote in historic numbers to leave the EU. Yet the political class plot and conspire to make sure we do not.It is hard to think of another time in living memory when politicians have been so ­spectacularly out of touch with public sentiment — and so ­sinisterly cavalier about overriding our democratic wishes.There are honourable exceptions, of course. From Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg in the Tory camp to Kate Hoey on the Labour benches, some MPs will opposeMay’s deal precisely because they believe in Brexit and plan to carry on fighting for it.But a majority of MPs fall into one of the two Brexit-phobic camps — whether it’s May’s “Remain by another name” or those who would stop Brexit entirely.Some MPs are terryingly upfront about their distaste for the democratic process and their disgust with us, the pesky ­electorate.In an unhinged online rant, Labour MP Clive Lewis branded Brexit a “racist endeavour” and said “we need to end it, now”. Let’s be real about what this means.Ending Brexit means overturning the largest vote in British history. It means ending the right of ordinary people to have a say in Britain’s future. When MPs like Lewis scream, “Stop Brexit!”, they are really saying: “Stop democracy!”Labour’s David Lammy is also open about his desire to overthrow the largest act of democracy in our history.He described the vote for Brexit as “madness” and says MPs must “bring this nightmare to an end”. By “this nightmare”, he means the ­public’s reasoned, ­democratic request to leave the EU.This is the depth of the ­contempt some MPs now feel for ordinary people. They see our political beliefs as a “nightmare”.On the Tory side, people such as Anna Soubry have not been shy about their hatred for Brexit. On Sunday Ms Soubry posted a chilling message on Twitter.She said Parliament has “historic” business to take care of this week and reminded everyone that under Section  of the Public Order Act, it is an “arrestable offencea person uses ­threatening or abusive words”.In essence, she is warning the masses to stay away from Parliament, to not even think about protesting.It is testament to the arrogance of the political elite that they can openly call for the overthrow of Brexit and warn the little people they might be arrestedthey get too angry about this blatant assault on our democratic rights.“Know your place, plebs.” That is what they are saying.The extent to which Parliament is ­conspiring against the people can be seen in Speaker John Bercow’s ripping-up of parliamentary rules.Last week, Bercow let MPs vote on an amendment to a motion put ­forward by Tory arch-Remainer Dominic Grieve.The amendment, voted through by  MPs to , would force the ­Government to come up with a Plan B within three daysMay’s deal is defeated in the Commons.It should be noted here that Grieve has changed his tune.In his election message to constituents in May  he declared: “The decision of the electorate in the referendum must be respected and that I should support a ­reasoned process to give effect to it.”Now he is saying it is “the biggest ­mistake of our recent history”.As one commentator astutely put it ­yesterday: “It’s precisely this sort of ­sophistry that ­created the backlash that led to Brexit in the first place.”The BBC has stated that Grieve’s ­amendment means MPs who are “plotting” against Brexit would have “more space in which to work”. Thanks to Bercow’s unprecedented move, backbenchers will have much greater ­leeway to hamper and even kill off Brexit.It is believed anti-Brexit backbenchers are planning to table an amendment that would give their motions priority over Government motions.This would not just dramatically change how Parliament has always operated — it would let backbenchers scupper a No Deal Brexit, perhaps even force through a second ­referendum.Some are referring to this as a coup — an attempt by certain MPs to take back control from the Government and also from us, the public.As one senior Government figure said: “This could be ‘game over’ for Brexit.”Democracy is hanging by a thread in this country.Last year, MPs celebrated the th anniversary of women and working-class men getting the vote. This year, they are using their clout to overthrow ­something millions voted for.The hypocrisy is staggering.In today’s battle between MPs who back May’s Brexit betrayal and MPs who want to go even further in ending the “nightmare” of Brexit, there will be one clear loser . . . democracy.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

To allow Brussels,it wanted, to keep us bound hand and foot forever in the Irish backstop, unable to forge our own independent trading policy.It would rapidly have become clear to the Leave majority that their decision, while nominally honoured, had been sold down the river. That we had not truly left the EU and maybe never would.More practically it all but guaranteed the collapse of the minority Tory Government since,it had somehow passed, the DUP would have withdrawn their support.The Government was always going to lose heavily. The discredited Commons speaker John Bercow ensured it by refusing to select any amendments to the Bill that might have helped narrow the margin of defeat.It was another low for a man who has already brought disgrace to his historic office by abusing his powers to help engineer the destruction of Brexit. Parliament will be a better place without him.But let’s not pretend it would have made much dference. The deal was fatally flawed.Mrs May’s response to the vote last night was feisty — challenging Parliament to find a viable alternative that could win a majority and honour the ­referendum. No one has a clue what that would be.And her call for MPs to “listen to the British people” was dead right.Outside Westminster, the public just wants Brexit done. They are aghast at the political games.The Sun reluctantly believes we must head for a clean break, finalise preparations as best we can and batten down the hatches.We never wanted a No Deal. It would mean a tough and probably damaging few months. But it would be the only solution left which defends what should now be paramount and most precious to us all: Our democracy — and the public’s faith in it.None of the alternatives does that.  They neither honour the referendum, nor are possible to sustain.They are all damaging in their own way. Yet our Remainer-dominated Parliament will fight tooth and nail to secure one of them and thwart a clean break, in direct conflict with millions of voters.The Norway-Plus proposal, however its champions spin it, is EU membership without the voting rights. No independent trade ­policy. No end to free movement.It is a short-term Remainers’ Brexit which would lead to only one ­conclusion: A new and irresistible clamour to exit properly.Another Tory idea is to lure Labour support by offering the permanent customs union they want with the EU, abandoning all thoughts of independent trade. It is a potentially suicidal idea which could destroy their Party and put Corbyn’s Marxists in power.Then there’s the toxic second referendum which would upend our democracy, shatter trust in politicians for all time and burst fully open our national isions.Its only upside is that Leave would probably win again. Plenty of the more sensible Remainers have seen through the EU now — and dislike the blatant unfairness of overriding a democratic mandate before it has been enacted.But what would the question be  Remain versus a deal already now rejected by a monstrous Commons majority as bad for Britain And whatRemain DID win  It is staggeringly naive to imagine that would settle it. Why should Leavers accept it  The wounds would never heal.Labour appears almost ready now to buckle to its europhile members and back that second vote — and its betrayal of millions of left-leaning Leave voters will finally be complete.Shadow Cabinet ministers are already teeing it up, laughably attempting to deflect blame by claiming Tory failure gives them no option. Don’t believe a word.The Tories have dedicated nearly three years trying to see Brexit through while Labour have tried to thwart every effort and their Brexit spokesman Keir Starmer has secretly lobbied relentlessly for a ​new referendum. Labour will own every ounce of the betrayal their working-class voters will feel — and will richly deserve the ballot box backlash.Mrs May has had the hardest task of any Prime Minister since Winston Churchill, trying to fulfil the Brexit mandate with no majority in a Parliament stuffed with Remainers, some colluding with the EU to sabotage her position.Even so, her handling of it has been a woeful failure.She is clinging to power by her fingernails.

Disgracefully, this attempt is being led by the Gloomster of the Exchequer, Philip Hammond.This is just another version of ’s Project Fear that was launched by the Treasury to try to persuade us against voting for Brexit by prophesying disasterwe did. Some prophecy that turned out to be! Project Fear Mark II is just as ridiculous.That said, Brexit has always been primarily about politics, rather than economics. The strongest argument for it is quite simply that we should be free to make our own decisions. But there is a connection with economics, because freedom includes being able to make decisions about economic matters.Moreover,people could be persuaded that re-establishing self-government for our country would carry a heavy cost that would hit them in the pocket, many might be dissuaded from supporting it.But it would NOT carry a heavy cost. Quite the opposite. It would bring large gains.Listening to the Remainers who dominate the BBC’s coverage, you might easily believe that the EU is a raging economic success. It isn’t. Yes, it was a relative success when we joined it in . But over recent decades the EU’s relative economic performance has been poor.The reason is clear: The EU makes bad decisions, including about economic matters, because its institutions don’t work very well and it is pursuing a political project, namely the establishment of a federal state. In the process, it is pushing barmy policies of harmonisation and integration and it engages in excessive regulation. The euro is the worst of the EU’s blunders — so far. But you can be sure that there will be more.Nowhere  are countries pursuing anything like the EU’s mad agenda — no single markets, no monetary unions and no federal super-states. Unlike so many members of our elite, other countries’ leaders have noticed that the EU doesn’t work.So why are so many clever and decent people among our leaders apparently still keen that Britain should stay in the EU  There are two reasons. First, many of them simply don’t know the facts about economic performance and don’t understand economics anyway.People with little experience of business who are steeped in the world of politics or the civil service naturally tend to assume that prosperity flows from the pens of those who sign agreements. People like them. But it doesn’t. It derives quite simply from the efforts of millions of men and women and of the businesses that employ them.Yes, trade deals can be good, but you do not need them in order to trade. Currently we do not have a trade deal with the United States. Yet the US is our biggest single trading partner. Go figure!Second, many among our governing elite do not like nation states. And they particularly don’t like ours. By contrast, they have a touching faith in the EU’s ability to suppress the uglier sides of nationalism while keeping the peace and pursuing an agenda of good government for all. Doubtless they also believe in Father Christmas.If we leave the EU in March without signing a deal, we would not be “crashing out” or “falling off a clf”. Nor would it be accurate to describe this as a “hard” Brexit.Rather, it would be a clean Brexit, a full Brexit, a true Brexit, in contrast to the half-baked non-Brexit proposed by Mrs May.Mrs May’s “deal” was the Remainers’ Revenge. You only had to look at the expression on the face of Jean-Claude Juncker to know what had happened.The EU got everything while we got nothing. And we were due to pay £billion for the privilege.Now that Mrs May’s capitulation of a “deal” has been consigned to the knackers yard, we should devote our energies to preparing to leave in March without any such deal. I am not suggesting that a No- Deal Brexit would be roses all the way. There would be some immediate dislocation that would carry some costs. But they would be relatively minor and short-lived. And it would be wrong to mistake such short-term minor disruption for the eventual destination.Just like umpteen other countries around the world, we can thrive outside the EU — without anything like Mrs May’s deal.Within a few years I am sure we would look back and wonder how anyone could have thought otherwise.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I was there because I tried to take my own le, I couldnt take it any more.My husband was there because of his back, its painful being in the car.One million people are already receiving it and by the time the system is fully rolled out in , nearly  million will be on it.But there are big problems with the flagship new system - it takes  weeks to get the first payment and it could leave some families worse off by thousands of pounds a year.And while working families can claim back up to  per cent of their childcare costs, they must find the money to pay for childcare upfront - we’ve heard of families waiting up to  months for the money.Working parents across the country told us they’ve been unable to take on more hours - or have even turned down better paid jobs or more hours because of the amount they get their benefits cut.It’s time to Make Universal Credit work. We want the government to:Together, these changes will help Make Universal Credit Work.Join our Universal Credit Facebook group or email UniversalCredit@the-sun to share your story. Winston is  this year and when you reach  youre entitled to sheltered housing.However his birthday is in May and we could be dead by then. Im worried we are going to die here.Universal Credit is the Governments new flagship benefits system, but it has been slammed by charities and claimants who say it is pushing more people into poverty.Currently it takes five weeks to get the first payment, leaving many people in insurmountable debt, and working families have to pay childcare costs upfront, before later claiming back  per cent of the cost.The Sun is campaigning for the Work Allowance to be raised and the taper rate reduced to p for every £ earned to help at least four million families hold on to their hard earned cash.A spokesman for Colchester Borough Homes warned could take up to two years for some people to get a home.As a general rule this meansany applicant presents as homeless and we believe they may have a priority need, we may have a duty to provide accommodation while we look to find a housing solution that relieves their homelessness.If we do not believe they have a priority need, accommodation will not be provided but we will still assist them to secure alternative accommodation.If we are unable to relieve their homelessness, we are required to make inquiries under the full or main homeless duty.If we accept this duty, temporary accommodation will be provided and their banding on the housing register will be amended to reflect this.Applicants will then remain in temporary accommodation until they are either housed through the housing register or we end the duty by placing them in private sector accommodation.It is dficult to determine theof time an applicant will have to wait for specic property types to become available, as applicants are able to decide this by bidding on properties.In general, most applicants wait in excess of  to  months."},{"url":null,"title":"dover python loose snake spotted back garden","story":"The monster serpent was spotted slithering under a fence and into an alley between houses in Kent on Monday night.Local resident Mark Smith, , who owns two giant Burmese pythons, was notied of the escaped animal when his friend called him to say hed seen a snakes head pop out under a fence while he was walking home.Snake-loving Smith, whose pets were safely locked away when the escaped reptile was sighted, then went out looking for it and posted about the incident on Facebook.But the python still hasnt been found.Smith told Kent Live: I got over there just before midnight to look for it.

He is happy to hang around with Stalinists and anti-Semites, Holocaust deniers and apologists for terrorism. But he won’t talk to the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.The Labour leader’s refusal to discuss Brexit with his Tory — and come to that, Lib Dem, SNP, DUP and Plaid Cymru — counterparts reveals the utter smallness of the man.For two years, Jezza has been noisily demanding that Theresa May “reach out” to other parties. Yet the moment she does, he comes over all snooty and stand-offish.He won’t join any discussions about our EU policy unless and until the PM pledges that we won’t leave without a deal.That condition is absurd. Mrs May, as Corbyn well knows, is also keen to avoid No Deal. But the only way to avoid that is to agree on, you know, a deal.That’s precisely why the PM is talking to the other party leaders.The only effect of publicly ruling out No Deal — as several MPs in all parties have been pompously doing — is to encourage Brussels to dig in and thus, paradoxically, to make No Deal more likely.What explains Jezza’s sudden coolness  Is it simple tribalism of the sort that has now taken over the top ranks of Labour Immediately before the vote, for example, Richard Burgon, the Corbynite Shadow Justice Secretary, repeatedly described Conservatives on TV as “the real enemy”.After the confidence motion, another Labour MP, Danielle Rowley, posted a picture of the Conservative benches with the caption, “People are dying because of these people”.Is Corbs unwilling to talk to Tories because he sees them as evil murderers I don’t think so. Part of the old booby’s schtick is that he will talk to anyone. It’s how he justies his meetings with Irish Republicans and jihadi extremists.It’s how he justies taking money to appear on a TV station backed by the ayatollahs in Tehran.He has even said that he would be prepared to negotiate with the head-hackers of IS in order to facilitate peace.I don’t think so.

It would force him to take a public position on Brexit. And that is the last thing he wants to do.Corbyn is an Old Left Eurosceptic. He took what was, effectively, the Moscow line during the Cold War, namely that the EEC was the economic arm of Nato.He disliked what he saw as its capitalism, and knows he will be able to implement a far more radical form of socialism once Britain is no longer constrained by EU rules on competition and state aid.He also knows that the overwhelming majority of Labour MPs want to stay in the EU.During the referendum campaign, he reluctantly went along with his party, though he made little secret of his distaste.Although we’ll never know for sure, I have a strong suspicion, looking at his face as he left the polling station, that he secretly voted Leave.Be that as it may, he has since kept the Labour coalition together by attacking the Government while saying nothing about what he would do.That ambiguity has allowed him to appease his party without alienating the millions in Labour’s northern heartlands who voted Leave.From a self-interest point of view, it made sense. But the impact on Britain’s negotiating position was dire.Labour’s tactic has been to demand impossible conditions from the Government. As Barry Gardiner, the Shadow Trade Minister, was overheard saying in Brussels: “It’s bollocks — always has been bollocks.”The trouble is, that by adopting its testicular conditions, Labour has ended up arguing for something that would represent the worst of all worlds.The main stated dference between the two parties is over the customs union. Labour says it wants Brussels to control Britain’s trade policy in perpetuity after we leave.As recently as last year, Corbyn was against the customs union on the unarguable grounds that “It is protectionist against third- world countries”.That was the reason successive Labour Eurosceptics, as far back as Clement Attlee, opposed joining the EEC.But last February, spotting an opportunity to vote against the Government without having to commit to anything, Labour somersaulted and started demanding customs union membership.Be clear: Being outside the EU but inside its customs union would be disastrous. It would keep the costs of membership without the benefits of leaving.As former Canadian PM Stephen Harper, a massive Anglophile and a Remain supporter in , put it recently: “It is really critical that this country rediscovers itself as a trading nation. If you do not do that, then frankly the Brexit experience will be bad.” When I put that point to another member of the shadow cabinet in a BBC green room, he looked at me asI was mad. We’re this close to the first truly socialist government in Britain,” he told me. “You really think we care about the customs union either way ”Yet it is precisely that cynicism that voters are turning against. People are furious at the game-playing in Westminster. They accept that MPs have dfering views, but they can tell when a party is advancing bogus arguments for purely selfish reasons.In the last analysis, Jeremy Corbyn has shown himself to be unwilling to work in what he himself sees as the national interest. That is what makes him unfit for office.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He’s also got his own wet room which is more private so he can keep his dignity.“They’ve installed CCTV and a monitor in Simon’s room so I can check on him.“The monitor means I can hear him breathing and it’s like he’s next to me. It means that I don’t have to constantly be by his side to know he’s okay.“The doorways and the front door have been widened so it’s easier to get Simon from one room to the other in his wheelchair.“Before we had a manual hoist but now we have a ceiling hoist that he can use to get from his bedroom to his en-suite.She told the BBC One show: Youve really changed our lives... there are no words, what youve done is amazing.Since the vicious attack in ,  men have been convicted for their part in the assault and while they may be behind bars, the nightmare for Simon and his family goes on.His we has slammed the so called “firm” that left her husband with a “le sentence”.Nicole blasted the hooligans who “ambushed” Simon on an away day, labelling them “absolutely pathetic”.Speaking exclusively to Sun Online Nicole, , said: “Simon had always been a football fan – he would watch all the World Cups and would go to Cambridge as they are our local team.“I had seen hooligans on the news – but that was always at the really big games.“Then I found out about the firms. I just do not understand how grown men can arrange to meet each other and then kick the living daylights out of each. It is absolutely pathetic. They need to grow up. You don’t get it in any other sports.“Simon had not been involved in any trouble.

So expect some politicians to miss the point entirely and make it more “inclusive”.ASKED to produce a list of the th Century’s most iconic explorers, everyone would probably name Scott of the Antarctic, Roald Amundsen, Edmund Hillary and Sherpa Tenzing Norgay.Everyone, that is, except a group of BBC “experts”, who ignored all of the above and replaced them with Jane Goodall and Gertrude Bell last week.I don’t even need to explain why, obviously.The names alone tell you it’s all down to the deranged, obsessive PC box-ticking that governs everything the BBC does and makes a farce of its new voting series Icons, which has the nerve to claim: “We want your opinion.”It doesn’t, obviously. It wants to impose the BBC’s right-on opinion on you and swallow its rewritten version of th Century history in the process.So for quota-driven reasons, Elvis didn’t make the entertainers shortlist and Alexander Fleming was left out of the last four scientists, despite discovering penicillin.But while Margaret Thatcher was included among the political finalists – and, boy, that must have hurt the BBC – they totally ignored her Falklands and Cold War victories in favour of re-styling her as a female gender warrior, almost the very last thing the former Prime Minister actually stood for.The episode where this series’ barmy levels of political correctness will really be laid bare is the Sports Stars episode, which has named Labour-supporting Paralympian Tanni Grey-Thompson as one of the th Century’s four greatest icons, but left out Jesse Owens, George Best, Usain Bolt, Rod Laver, Olga Korbut, Roger Federer, Eric Liddell, Martina Navratilova, Seb Coe, Jack Nicklaus, Tiger Woods, Carl Lewis, Diego Maradona, Michael Jordan, Ayrton Senna and even the talisman of our greatest trophy-winning team of all, Doug Rougvie.Shameful.This Morning’s Alison Hammond, , metres above sea level, in the ski resort of Val D’Isere, interviewing skiers ­wearing skiing gear: “Why are you here ”THE Voice UK contestant Dean Mac is living the dream. How do we know He told us all, on Saturday night.“I’m living the dream,” he boasted, “in a really cool penthouse apartment, in the centre of Manchester. Duplex, with a pool table.”He also told us he performed “baby-making music,” though the world had been surprisingly slow to acknowledge Dean’s “triple threat” potential.“I went to LA, Paris, Liverpool, as a choreographer dancer, and one day a music producer said, ‘You need to be the front guy’.“The next stage now is to release the beast of my showmanship and have my craft appreciated.”So, on Saturday, he unleashed it in the direction of the four Voice judges and, honestly, the reaction was almost perfect.Hardly a serious button flinch or a twitch or a hint one of them was going to bite. In fact, he’d have had more luck getting the four heads on Mount Rushmore to turn.A response that said: “If that’s baby-making music, the human race is gone in  years’ time.”The saving grace of the ITV show’s format is that there’s nothing he could do or say to the judges afterwards either.Dean Mac just had to trudge back to his “really cool penthouse apartment”.Living the dream.Chris Kamara: “He headed his shot just over the bar.”The food: “Pizza, pasta, ravioli and all that s***.”I know.

Jacob Rees-Mogg invited leading Tory eurosceptics including Boris Johnson, David Davis and Iain Duncan Smith to a celebration party. Guests were greeted with a champagne flute at the door of the Tory MP’s pound million mansion just minutes from the House of Commons. The other side of Westminster, Theresa May was contemplating her humiliating defeat and steeling herself for another tumultous day ahead. Her strategy for surviving the no confidence vote was to make sure she didn’t take the fizz out of the Brexiteers champagne too early.   Instead, she waited until after the result was announced by her chief whip before inviting Jeremy Corbyn and other party leaders to talks. But before they even made it to the steps of Downing Street she had scuppered any attempts at compromise by ruling out a customs union. It is Labour’s biggest ask - and would infuriate hardline Brexiteers - but is also one of the few plan Bs that could command a majority in Parliament.  Instead - as the clock ticks ever close to crashing out of the EU without a deal - more stalemate beckons. Over the next few days the PM will try to win over the leaders of smaller parties and backbench Labour MPs. But her refusal to even countenance budging on her red lines suggests she is putting the Tory party ahead of the national interest. She has just four days to try to reach agreement. At that point the Government will have to table a fresh motion which - crucially - can be amended by MPs.   Parliament will take control of Brexit with a series of votes on their own alternatives. Pro-EU MPs are expected to demand the Government rules out a no deal, delays Brexit or holds a second referendum. Even though the votes would not be legally binding, it would be politically impossible for the PM to ignore them. With a softer - and delayed - Brexit looking the most likely outcome, perhaps the champagne should have been kept on ice.

Labour has been on an election footing for several months now with party funds up and candidates selected for the majority of marginal seats. But the party’s attempt to trigger a general election fell flat after the Democratic Unionist Party MPs sided with the government - despite voting down the Prime Minister’s Brexit deal a day earlier. At a speech in the ultra marginal seat of Hastings, the Labour leader told supporters: “While Brexit consumes all the government’s energy, the vital issues that affect people most directly – cash-starved schools, the NHS at breaking point, rising bills, unaffordable housing – have all gone to the back of the queue. He said the Tories were ignoring the needs of the country while fighting internal battles.   And he accused work and pensions secretary Amber Rudd, who holds Hastings and Rye by just  votes, of sneaking out devastating pension changes which will leave some pound, worse off while parliament voted on the Brexit deal - a charge the government refutes.Ahead of a visit to a local hospital to discuss the NHS and social care Mr Corbyn, who has indicated that Labour could continue to call confidence votes in the government, said: I believe that the real ide in our country is not between leave and remain.  It’s between the many who do the work, create the wealth and pay their taxes, work in our society, deliver for the rest of us – and those others, those few who set the rules, reap the rewards and dodge their taxes.

Having suffered the worst defeat in shyParliamentary history, Mrs May finally did what she should have done when taking office – she reached out to opposition leaders.   Their reticence in accepting this belated olive branch is understandable. The PM has shown no indication she is prepared to compromise on her Brexit plans. Her appeal for MPs to act in the national interest would carry more weight had she not put her own party’s interest first at every stage. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn was right to demand taking no-deal off the table as the condition for any talks. Mrs May must show she is ready to make concessions.

Leanne and Darrel Fleck are preparing to mark the year since their son Kayden died at the age of five. The mischievous and fun-loving schoolboy was swept to his death on the Braid River in County Antrim, Northern Ireland. His identical twin brother Jayden was the last person to see him alive after desperately trying to save him. The youngster grabbed at his siblings fingertips as the freezing cold water carried him away. As the family brace themselves for the heartbreaking milestone, an unexpected ray of light has given them the strength. Baby Ellianna, Kayden’s little sister has brought joy to the familys le during their dark time. “We didn’t know she was coming,” Leanne told Belfast Live. “But about three weeks after we lost Kayden, through all the pain and darkness of that time, we discovered I was pregnant.   “It was a huge shock. And more than anything, it was just so bittersweet because we were going through all the emotions of losing Kayden and trying to figure out what way our family was going to go from there. Then suddenly, she came along. “She shone a wee bit of light on our family. We had people telling us it was too soon for us to cope after losing Kayden - but then we had others offering us support as well, and they said she was our wee blessing. And I think she was. “I’m never going to forget Kayden. I’m never going to forget that day. And when the anniversary comes around I don’t know how we’re going to be but at least now we have our baby to focus on. “She’s healthy, she’s here, she’s our wee girl and we will love and care for her like we did Kayden, and our other children.” The morning of that fateful Saturday in February last year started out full of hope and fun. Leanne and Darrel, who had tied the knot just two weeks earlier with their handsome twins as ring bearers, had moved the family from the Ballykeel estate in Ballymena to a new home in Cullybackey with high hopes for the future. That day, they ed to their old house to collect the last of their things. “We got in the car, me and Darrel, the twins and our daughter Amelia, and headed back to Ballykeel,” said Leanne. “Darrel had to clear out the shed, and I wanted to make sure everything was out and that the place was clean and tidy before we handed the keys in.” And it is this detail, as well as every other twist and turn of that time which Leanne continues to pore over and use to torment herself.   “I just wonderwe hadn’t gone back to the house to clear up that day, orwe hadn’t decided to move to Cullybackey at all, would we have lost him ” said Leanne. “Darrel was out sorting the shed and I was in the sitting room when one of the boys came in and said, ‘Can we go out the back ’ Even now I can’t say for sure which of them it was, because I was taking down these old blinds and I just said, ‘OK, but don’t be going away’. “I didn’t even look round to see which one it was and I hate myself for that because I was too busy doing these bits and pieces to look around. “You see they never went anywhere without us. They never went far, and that day I thought they’d be running in and out through the empty house into the back garden but when I went out to put the blinds in the bin, they weren’t there.” When Darrel told Leanne the boys had been in the garden just seconds earlier, the pair headed straight to the boys’ usual stomping ground, a play-park just a stones throw from the house.  But the boys were not there. “Kayden had found p in the car on the way so my next thought was, had they tried to walk to the shop up from the house,” said Leanne.“So we split up to look for them. We didn’t even think to go to the river because they’d never been that direction without us in their lives.” It was Darrel who first became aware just how grave the situation was. He recalled: “I was looking for the boys and then I heard ‘Daddy help, Daddy help’, and there was Jayden coming running across the path. “He was soaked from his neck to his feet. I asked him where Kayden was and he said, ‘He fell in the river Daddy, he fell in the river’.” Young Jayden and his father rushed to the spot Kayden had fallen, at the edge of the Braid River near the Ecos Centre in Ballymena. “I was running up and down the river looking for Kayden, searching for the bright orange jumper he was wearing that day,” said Darrel. A man passing by heard the commotion, and called for help. “They were quick,” said Darrel. “But by the time the police and search and rescue were there, Kayden was long gone.” The schoolboy, a pupil at Harryville Primary School in Ballymena, was pulled from the river four miles away. “Afterwards, Jayden told us he was wet because he’d got into the river to try and catch Kayden,” said Darrel.   “He’d got the tip of his finger, but the current was too strong and he couldn’t hold onto him.” Making sense of the tragedy has been excruciating for the family. Why them and why that day  Why had one son managed to escape the river, while the other had not  “It was awful, we couldn’t make sense of it,” said Leanne, who also has an older son, Daniel, . “But Jayden said he held onto the grass, he clung to it. Kayden couldn’t.” While the boys were identical in almost every way, one huge dference marked the twins apart. From the moment he was born, Kayden was extremely ill. Born with a congenital heart defect, hypoplastic right heart syndrome, he spent the first year of his le in hospital, travelling from Belfast to Birmingham, to Antrim and back undergoing surgery and intensive treatment for his condition. The youngster didn’t step foot in his family home until two days before his first birthday. “We had the biggest party for them, we hired a hall and got them a clown,” recalled Leanne, smiling at the memory. “But that start in le meant Jayden was always that little bit stronger. Kayden had his first open heart surgery when he was  hours old, and the last one less than a year before he died. We’d hoped that one would see him through until he was .” Kayden’s tough start in le only strengthened his bond with his brother, and little Jayden was his right-hand man through it all. “Kayden was taken straight to Birmingham Children’s Hospital the day after he was born,” said Darrel. “Leanne wasn’t allowed to fly because she’d had a caesarean, but I went over with my mum. “On the fourth day, I was able to come back and take Jayden over with me on the flight and when the boys were about a week old a nurse asked meJayden had been in beside his brother yet.   “When I told her no, she took Jayden and set him into the cot beside his brother. Their two wee arms came together, and they held hands. That’s when Kayden started to turn a corner.” After that, says Leanne, the boys were inseparable. And when their sister Amelia came along less than two years later, she got stuck straight in. “She was joined at the hip with Kayden as well,” said Leanne. “Now she says a prayer to him every night when she goes to bed. Even though he was just a toddler when she was born, he loved babies. He’d have loved Ellianna.” And the family are determined the baby, now seven weeks old, will grow up knowing all about her brother.  “I said from day one, from the minute we lost him that he’s always going to be part of our family,” said Leanne. “So we will make sure she knows him.” Complications from Ellianna’s birth meant Leanne spent three days in hospital in the run-up to Christmas, only getting home to her family on Christmas morning. “On the way home, Darrel and me took a drive over to the grave,” she said. “It was hard, knowing Kayden wasn’t there to share it all - the joy of the baby, the joy of Christmas with his family. That’s the hardest part. “People have said to me they find it hard I’m still talking about him after nearly a year, but that’s my way of coping. I talk about him constantly,I’m here by myself I’ll talk to his pictures. If he’s gone five years or , I’ll still talk about him and to him because to me he is still here. “And even though we can’t see him and we can’t hear him he’s going to live on in us, and in the other wee ones. Ellianna will know him. He’s her big brother.” Following the tragedy, the family have called for safety steps around the Braid River to be stepped up. “I just want to make sure this doesnt happen to any other family,” said Leanne. A Mid and East Antrim Borough Council spokesperson said: “Council has erected new barriers and signage along sections of the River Braid. A full water safety survey has also been conducted across Mid and East Antrim’s water sites. Staff regularly inspect paths along river banks to monitor flooding and slippage. “We would urge anyone using paths near rivers to be aware of potential flooding, particularly during heavy rainfall. Council are also launching a water safety campaign later this year to help raise awareness of the dangers of water.” "},{"url":null,"title":"meghan markle kate middletons childbirths","story":"NewsWhy Meghan Markle and Kate Middletons childbirths will be totally dferentMeghans time in hospital looks set to be very dferent to that of her sister-in-law as she shuns Kates posh Lindo Wing for the NHS Frimley Park HospitalShareCommentsByMatt Roper:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsMeghan and Kates experiences of giving birth look set to be very dferent \"Get Royal Family updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailOne is the height of luxury - a private maternity ward sometimes likened to a five-star hotel. The other is a standard NHS hospital with caring but overworked staff. If Meghan Markle wanted to endear herself to ordinary Brits, she’s made a huge step by choosing NHS Frimley Park hospital to give birth, rather than the exclusive Lindo Wing where Kate Middleton has had all her three children. A source told The Sun that theDuchess of Sussex, , who is due to give birth in late April, wants to have her baby at the hospital in Surrey as she “doesn’t want to do anything that Kate Middleton has” . The news follows reports Meghan has been crowned “Duchess Dficult” by staff and has clashed with the Duchess of Cambridge, also , on a number of occasions.So how will her experience of giving birth dfer from that of her sister-in-law  Kates choice -The Lindo Wing   Kate has given birth to all her three children in the exclusive Lindo Wing of St Mary’s Hospital, Paddington. The private wing of the NHS hospital is also where Princess Diana gave birth to both Princes William and Harry. And the maternity ward is fit for royalty, with art installations, luxury toiletries and chef-made gourmet food - including afternoon tea. Often likened to a five-star hotel, new parents can even order a glass of champagne to toast their baby’s arrival.  A brochure for the wing reveals how each room comes equipped with satellite TV offering major international channels’. There is also a radio, bedside phone and a fridge’, a wide selection of newspapers and free WiFi. Patients are each given a private room with their own ensuite bathroom, stocked with hair-care products and lotions, with deluxe suites available for those who require extra space. Extensive menus created by their own in-house chef cater for special dietary, cultural and religious requirements, while the hospital also offers a wine list, with champagne on offer.  And a ‘celebration afternoon tea’ tea delivered to the new mum’s room is part of the maternity package. Parents can book luxury extras, including a post-natal massage to help new mothers stimulate milk flow, while there is also a secure, supervised nursery so parents can enjoy much-need rest. But the luxury comes at a price, with expectant mothers paying from pound, for  hours in the hospital for a normal delivery,rising to pound, for a deluxe package and even higher for the wards suites. Meanwhile, for a caesarean delivery the cost is a steeper pound,, while the hospital also offers even more pricy ’deluxe’ and ‘suite’ packages. As well as successful royal mothers, a host of celebrities have given birth at the unit, including Amal Clooney, who gave birth to twins last year.  But the hospital hasn’t satisfed everyone with one reviewer on Mumsnet complained of “grumpy” staff, a TV that didnt work and “barely edible food”. The reviewer, who said she’d paid pound, to have her baby there, wrote: “All night long the buzzer was going off and there was never enough people to help, sometimes the buzzer would be going for  mins, waking everyone  up too. A few times it took an hour for someone to come to help you. “The fruit plate was completely unripe and tasted either sour or of nothing.The food was barely edible. Some of the staff were lovely but the majority grumpy and overworked. “The final straw was when it came to check out and they told me I had to be gone by midday or they would charge by the hour for every hour over.” Meghans choice - Frimley Park Hospital  The hospital where Meghan has opted to give birth couldn’t be more dferent to the home-from-home of her sister-in-law Kate. Frimley Park Hospital in Frimley, Surrey, is just  miles away from the Duke and Duchess of Sussex’s newly-refurbished Frogmore Cottage in the grounds of Windsor Castle. But while it is more conveniently located, especially in the case of a last-minute dash to give birth, the hospital offers no special facilities or personalised treatment. The NHS-run hospital’s large labour ward doesn’t offer private care for maternity patients, while rooms don’t come with TVs or even en suite bathrooms.  There are  labour rooms available on the general ward, which saw , birth from April  to April . With the high turnover of births, women with uncomplicated deliveries stay for an average of six to  hours after birth. Partners are generally asked to go home overnight. While private postnatal rooms are available for pound-a-night - much less that Lindo Wing’s pound,-a-night price tag, they don’t offer any luxuries.  Meghan could also opt to stay in one of the four birthing rooms in The Mulberry Birth Centre, which focuses on “birth without medical intervention” and offer mood-changing lights and a pool roomshe prefers a water birth. But it does have some royal fans - Sophie, the Countess of Wessex, credits the hospital with saving her live after performing an emergency caesarean section after she had a placental abruption while giving birth in November . She ed there four years later to give birth, again by C-section, to her son James. Mums on Mumsnet have also given the hospital a thumbs up, although point to the wards overstretch staff.

The first - Is the Duke of Edinburgh alright  The second - Can members of the Royal Family even be arrested by the police  Well the answer to the first is thankfully a very good one, as Buckingham Palace have confirmed that he was not injured in the accident. However, the answer to the other question is a little more complicated.   Its well known that The Queen has Sovereign Immunity in the UK, meaning that she can, quite literally, do no wrong. No civil or criminal proceedings can be taken against the Sovereign, but the same rule doesnt apply to any other member of the Royal Family. Therefore, it is the case that the likes of Prince Philip, Prince Charles, Prince William and Meghan Markle can be arrested - however there are a few loopholes. According to the legal encyclopedia, Halsburys Laws of England, members of the Royal Household cannot be arrested in civil proceedings.   Moreover, theres one very specic place that offers them protection. The encyclopedia states that arrests cannot take place in the presence of the monarch - so as long as they stay by the Queens side, they cant be cuffed by a police officer. This rule also applies to the ious royal palaces across Britain, such as Buckingham Palace and Kensington Palace. If a royal is anywhere near a palace, they cannot be taken into police custody.   One royal has already been given a criminal conviction. In , the Princess Royal,Princess Annewas fined pound and made to pay compensation after pleading guilty to a charge of one of her dogs attacking children. She was the first member of the royal family to plead guilty to a criminal offence. The year before this, Anne was also fined pound for speeding in her Bentley after admitting driving at mph in a mph zone in Gloucestershire.

It has been a long-held tradition in the Royal Family for brides to borrow a headpiece to wear on their big day.Usually there is huge sentimental value behind it, and not to mention numerous dazzling jewels worth millions of pounds. At Meghan and Harrys Windsor Castle wedding in May, the now Duchess of Sussex stunned in a bandeau diamond tiara, made in  for Queen Mary. And on Kate Middletons wedding day on April  in , she dazzled in a stunning Cartier Halo tiara. Now Deborah Papas, a gemologist and jewellery expert from Prestige Pawnbrokers who found fame on Channel  show Posh Pawn, has revealed how much she thinks the three tiaras are worth. The most expensive one - thought to be worth up to poundm - may surprise you. Kate Middletons tiara - estimated price: pound, - pound,,   Kate Middletons tiara was loaned to her by the Queen and signied the time-honoured custom of wearing something borrowed on her wedding day on April ,  at Westminster Abbey. It was made in  for the Queen Mother by Cartier, from diamonds and platinum, before being passed to the Queen as a birthday present. It features  baguette-cut diamonds as well as an astounding  brilliant cut diamonds of ying weights. The Queen Mother, who was gted the tiara by her husband, was only ever pictured wearing it once.  The tiara was later given to the Queen, then Princess Elizabeth, by her mother on her th birthday in . Her Majesty has not worn this piece very often, which used to be known as the Scroll tiara, but she did loan it to her sister Princess Margaret on several occasions. It was made famous again in , when Kate wore it for her wedding. Although its not the grandest of crowns from the royal jewellery vaults, its become iconic because of Kate. Deborah told the Express: “It is very hard to estimate the value but as a Cartier piece, I would estimate it to be worth approximately pound, - pound,,.” Meghan Markles tiara - estimated price: pound,,  The now Duchess of Sussex opted to style her glossy hair into a low chignon, and finished the look with a statement lace veil and a gorgeous English tiara for her wedding to Prince Harry on May ,  at Windsor Castle.The veil was held in place by the bandeau diamond tiara, which was made in  for Queen Mary.The band was created with diamonds and platinum in  sections, and pierced with ovals. The centre of it is set with a detachable broach, dating from , and is crafted with ten brilliant diamonds. The brooch was given to the then-Princess Mary for her wedding to Prince George.The beautul piece was lent to Meghan by the Queen herself, who was left the bandeau and broach by Queen Mary in . Its thought that this particular tiara hasnt been seen since , whenPrincess Margaretwore it.  Meghan previously said of the tiara: When it came to the tiara on the day, I was very fortunate to be able to choose this gorgeous art deco style bandeau tiara. Harry and I had gone to Buckingham Palace to meet with Her Majesty The Queen to select one of the options that were there, which was an incredibly surreal day as you can imagine. And that [tiara] was one that, I think, as we tried them on, stood out... However it was claimed there was a row over the tiara. An unnamed source told The Sun that Meghan wanted to wear an emerald-encrusted tiara, but the Queen said no.   The source said: Meghan had her heart set on this tiara with emeralds and Prince Harry hit the roof when they were told it was impossible for her to wear it. There was a very heated exchange that prompted the Queen to speak to Harry. She said, Meghan cannot have whatever she wants. She gets what tiara shes given by me. Meanwhile, Deborah told the Express: It is hard to put a value on this little seen piece but could be worth up to pound million. “It is set with a large brilliant cutdiamond estimated to be approximately  carats or more and surrounded by nine smaller brilliant-cut diamonds . There is a cluster either side also of seven round diamonds and an array of additional round brilliant-cut diamonds all over this  jointed art-deco piece.” Princess Eugenies tiara - estimated price: pound,, - pound,,   For her ceremony at St Georges Chapel in Windsor Castle on October , , Eugenie opted to wear The Greville Emerald Kokoshnik tiara, owned bythe Queen. The stunning item was made by Boucheron for Margaret Greville in  in a style popularised by the Russian Imperial Court. Mrs Greville was a close friend of Queen Mary and before her death, she bequeathed all her jewels toThe Queen Mother,including a diamond necklace thought once to have belonged to Marie Antoinette, a pair of diamond chandelier earrings, a ruby necklace and the tiara. For her special day, Eugenie also wore a pair of diamond and emerald drop earrings, which while being a beautul match for the tiara, were actually a gt from her husband Jack.  The -year-old wore the tiara sans veil, with her wedding gown featuring a v-shaped back which showed the scars from the le-changing spinal surgery she underwent as a child. The Queens granddaughter specically requested a low back on her custom-made gown by Peter Pilotto to show the scar. Deborah said: “In keeping with the fashion of the time, this tiara was designed in the Russian headdress style, made of finely pierced platinum, which was kept delicately simple, although intricate in detail, to show off the main stone.  “Accompanying the centre emerald are matching old step-cut emeralds, as well as ample pave set brilliant and rose cut diamonds. “This piece is certainly exquisite the centre emerald has a wonderfully vivid colour and large size, something which is rare to find these days. “With such strong historical provenance, from Mrs Greville to the Queen Mother, and now the Queen, an elegant jewel such as this would be estimated to fetch in the region of pound- million at auction.” "},{"url":null,"title":"prince charles worried prince philips","story":"NewsPrince Charles worried about Prince Philips driving before Land Rover smashThe Prince of Wales, , made the remarks four years ago but said his elderly dad insisted on remaining behind the wheel of his  Ford SierraShareCommentsByTom DavidsonOnline Reporter:,  JAN NewsPrince Philip driving at the Royal Windsor Horse Show in  \"Get Royal Family updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailPrince Charles worried about his dad driving in his advanced age more than four years ago. This afternoon Prince Philip was behind the wheel of a Land Rover which overturned after being in a collision near the Queens Sandringham Estate in Norfolk. The -year-old, who was miraculously unharmed, was breath tested at the scene by a Norfolk Police officer and provided a negative reading. Some have questioned the fact the Duke of Edinburgh was still driving, despite his advanced age. On June   Prince Charles told a D-Day veterans son he worried about his dads insistence on still driving a car. The heir-to-the-throne spoke to Ivor Thomas, a former Corporal in the Royal Engineers. Mr Thomass son, Philip told the Prince his father, who was sitting in a wheelchair, still insisted on driving his car, a  Ford Sierra.   So does my father. Im always worried, Charles said, before gesturing towards Mr Thomas, and asking: But his eyesights all right  These apparent concerns did not dissuade the duke from driving Barrack and Michelle Obama to lunch during their visit in April . And earlier last year he was pictured driving at the Royal Windsor Horse Show.The cause of the accident is under investigation, Norfolk Police said.The president of the AA, Edmund King said high profile car crashes involving elderly drivers often spark calls for bans or restrictions on older drivers.   But he added: If driving restrictions based on age and safety were introduced we would be more likely to restrict young drivers rather than older drivers. Young, predominantly male, drivers are much more likely to crash within six months of passing their test than older drivers within six months of hanging up their keys. Older drivers often self restrict their driving by not driving at night and only driving on familiar roads. Norfolk Police said it was force policy to breath test all drivers involved in collisions.   Although the duke and the passenger in the Land Rover, thought to be a close protection officer, were unharmed two women in the other vehicle, a Kia, suffered minor injuries. They have both since been discharged from hospital. The duke is spending the evening at Sandringham with the Queen at his side. The pair have lived there since Christmas although Philip did not attend a church ceremony on Christmas Day. He officially retired from royal duties in August .

Medics fear the prince could be at risk of a subdural haematoma, a bleed on the brain, which can be deadly. Dr Nick Scriven, President of the Society for Acute Medicine, said yesterday: “They will have to keep an eye on him overnight because the risk for this will be over the next  to  hours.” The prince emerged shaken but seemingly physically unscathed from the collision. But Dr Scriven said: “This is not a minor event for a -year-old.” Philip was seen immediately by a doctor at the Sandringham Estate and it was decided he did not need treatment at hospital. But it is possible he will suffer delayed symptoms and experts say because of his age, an accident of this type could have serious consequences.   Dr Scriven said: “Risks in any accident like this are concussion or even a subdural haematoma following a head injury.” A subdural haematoma is where blood collects between the skull and the surface of the brain. Dr Scriven added: “This would especially be a worry in the elderly. If he has had any head injury he will need monitoring for his mental state and alertness. People suffering from subdural haematoma can become confused and sleepy. “He will have people around him I suspect. He may have medical staff who will be with him. If he wasn’t knocked out and there’s no obvious head trauma it is probably OK for him to stay at home and be monitored by the people who know him.”  Subdural haematomas are potentially deadly and can cause seizures, coma, behavioural changes, headaches or vomiting. Dr Scriven said the prince’s age makes it likely that he will take time to bounce back after the “trauma” of the crash. He said : “It doesn’t take much trauma for a very elderly person to lose their confidence. “If he is immobile with bruises it will take a while to regain his strength and fitness because people who are immobile lose their fitness very quickly. “The loss of mobility for a couple of days can take two or three weeks to get back. Then there are risks of infection to any elderly person who is immobile, especiallythey are in pain.”  Ella Clarke-Billings, an AE nurse at King’s College, said: “He could have had an internal bleed, head injuries and whiplash. It depends whether he was wearing a seat belt. If the air-bag was deployed, he could have suffered broken or fractured bones. “Obviously with a person of that age, the recovery times are slower. The stress of the crash would also have more of an impact at that age. They would be more confused, or reach a state they call delirium.” The Duke of Edinburgh has stayed fit and sprightly despite his advancing years. He still insists on walking upstairs when possible, but has faced some health problems, needing hip surgery and suffering repeated bladder infections.   Since his retirement from official solo duties in , he has appeared in public alongside the Queen and other members of the royal family at events and church services. After bowing out of public le Philip was expected to keep busy with his hobbies, including carriage driving, oil painting and bird watching. In November , he and the Queen marked  years of marriage, their platinum anniversary, with a black-tie dinner at Windsor Castle. While Philip attended the Cenotaph remembrance service and the traditional Christmas church service at Sandringham in , he was absent from both events last year. In April  he spent a week-and-a-half in hospital after his hip replacement operation.  Just a month later he attended the wedding of grandson Prince Harry and Meghan Markle . In October  he watched granddaughter Princess Eugenie wed Jack Brooksbank. The Duke of Edinburgh admitted ahead of his th birthday in  that he wanted “less responsibility, less rushing about”. In a BBC interview, Prince Philip said: “I reckon I’ve done my bit, I want to enjoy myself for a bit now. “With less responsibility, less rushing about, less preparation, less trying to think of something to say. “On top of that your memory’s going, I can’t remember names. “Yes, I’m just sort of winding down.” "},{"url":null,"title":"prince philip very shocked shaken","story":"NewsPrince Philip very shocked and shaken with Queen at his side after shock crashThe Duke of Edinburgh, , was involved in a two-vehicle crash near Sandringham, Norfolk this afternoonShareCommentsByLaura Forsyth:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video duke-edinburgh-involved-road-traffic-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News ,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News ,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true\"\"Get Royal Family updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAn eyewitness to Prince Philips shock crash said the Duke of Edinburgh was very shocked and shaken when he was helped from his upturned Land Rover.

Martina Baker, from Maine, USA, sufferers from Mast Cell Activation Syndrome- an immunological condition that makes her allergic to “almost anything”, including heat, water and perfume. Even a whf of cooking oil or bleach could send the teenager into anaphylactic shock, andtreatment isn’t administered right away Martina could die. She’s also highly allergic to marijuana smoke, which poses a dficult issue for the teen, as the drug was recently legalised in her home state.   But now, after raising , , there’s a new hope for Martina as her family have been able to get her a highly-trained assistance dog who could help to save her le. With Caiomhe at her side, Martina was recently able to sit though a movie at a cinema for the first time in years - giving her a new lease of le.   Caiomhe has changed my le, I feel so much safer with her around, I am able to have a social le again, said Martina, who was forced to miss school and stay at home in a sealed room to avoid anaphylactic shocks. I lost a lot of friends after I developed MCAS, its hard for people to handle, for them to watch me collapse and have to take my EpiPen and be rushed to hospital all the time, added Martina, who lives in Wiscasset. It could be very lonely at times, but Caiomhe is always beside me protecting me, shes a best friend for sure. She makes me feel less alone, she even checks up on me in the middle of the night.”  Until two and a half years ago Martina was completely healthy, but overnight she was suddenly overcome by terrying symptoms. I wasnt allergic to anything before, then one day I woke up with hives all over my body. I had to go to the hospital because I had an anaphylactic reaction. My throat started swelling up with hives. They treated me with an EpiPen. The students problems only intensied from there. The hives would flare up all the time, shed go into anaphylactic shock and wed to have to rush her to the ER about three times a week, said Martinas mother Loretta Morse Leighton, , a family therapist. We never knew what was triggering it really.” Last summer a skunk sprayed off outside Martinas bedroom window, she went into anaphylactic shock and had to be rushed to AE. Afterwards she had to go and live with a friend for almost two weeks while we had her bedroom windows and door completely sealed up, it was awful, recalled Loretta.  For months doctors had been baffled by Martinas condition. We took her to see a specialist in every major discipline, everything from cardiologists to psychologists, said Loretta, who eventually took Martina to an immunologist in Massachusetts named Jonathan Bayuk, who correctly diagnosed her with MCAS. Thanks to Caiomhe and regular mast cell stabilizing drugs Martinas anaphylactic episodes have reduced from three times a week to once every four to six weeks. Martina often wears a mask when she goes outside and the family still has to be very careful in their home. Loretta cleans with vinegar instead of cleaning products and has stopped using all detergents on sheets and clothing. They must practice odorless cooking and spend a lot of time grilling outside, even in winter. Martina is extremely sensitive to warmth, so her bedroom isnt heated at all, even during the freezing Maine winters.  I dont know how she tolerates the cold, she lives like a penguin in there, laughed Loretta. Last year Loretta discovered that a service dog might help her daughter. Caiomhe was trained by Jamie Robinson, a specialist in Tucson, Arizona - one of the only people in the world to train dogs to assist MCAS patients. Jamie trained Caiomhe to identy a long list of smells that are le-le-threatening triggers for Martina. A dogs nose is about , times better than a human nose and just about every biochemical process in our bodies is indicated with a change in scent, said Jamie, , who runs her own service dog business called Access to Service Corp.  Jamie had Martina send her pieces of clothing she had worn so Caiomhe could get used to her scent, including when she was in anaphylaxis because, to a dog, that scent is dferent. Caiomhe can now snf out when Martina is having a reaction before Martina realizes it, because she can smell the release of histamine from her body. Martina and three-year-old Caiomhe were first united on January  and have been inseparable ever since. Martina has endured a lot of staring, pointing and rude remarks etc, people do not understand, its very dficult for her but shes stayed extremely strong, Im so proud of her, said Loretta. I feel that Caiomhe was destined to be my daughtersangel. In the pictures of Martina now with Caiomhe, I see joy, light and le. A spark that has been missing and robbed from her since this awful disease has taken ahold of her. Caiomhe brought that back to her in a new, wonderful and amazing way.” From more information on MCAS visit: https:tmsforacure.org symptoms symptoms-and-triggers-of-mast-cell-activation  "},{"url":null,"title":"dad finds secret cameras airbnb","story":"NewsDad finds secret cameras in Airbnb rental - but is told he consented to itJeffrey Bigham found one camera in the living room of the property and another near the bathroom doorShareCommentsByLuke Kenton:,  JAN NewsJeff Bigham had been staying at the property with his family during a winter break \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA dad-of-three discovered two hidden cameras inside his Airbnb apartment - with one allegedly positioned facing the bathroom door. During a family trip over the New Year’s period, computer science professor Jeffrey Bigham found two small white cameras in separate rooms of the rented property. In a blog post, Bigham revealed the host had initially disclosed the camera’s presence at the property, but they werent positioned “near the entrance” as listed on the room-sharing app. He found one camera in the corner of the living room during his family’s second day at the property.   Bigham later found a second device positioned where he claims the bathroom door would have been in-shot. He immediately unplugged them both and reached out to Airbnb to complain. The father told the company he never gave consent to being filmed at the residence, nor was he aware of the cameras at the time of booking. However, Mr. Bigham was left stunned when Airbnb sided with the apartment owner, saying the cameras had been disclosed in a picture of the listing, where a small white object in the corner of the photo can be seen. When my family and I stayed in an AirBnB this past winter break, we discovered this camera and another about a day into our stay, Bigham said in a post. I was shocked, and immediately unplugged them. I don’t think we did anything particularly weird in front of that camera, but it’s very likely that my -year-old ran in front of this camera naked . I looked at the home guide again, and it did say that there were cameras at the entrance, which these cameras clearly were not. I contacted AirBnB about it, and long story short they said the single photo above was proper disclosure of both cameras.

The elite soldier, who is in Kenya training the countrys special forces, was on an admin run when al-Shabaab terrorists stormed the nearby hotel complex, killing  people, including a British charity worker. And he sprinted back to his car, where he had left his equipment, before heading to the hotel to take on the terror gang single-handedly. It had been reported that the soldier, a serving member of the elite unit, had been taking part in training Kenyan troops when they got word of the attack and went to respond. But Chris, who served in the elite regiment for  years, said: He was out shopping on an admin run. He had his equipment in the car, so when it all kicked off he sprinted back to his car and quickly got kitted up before heading straight towards the firefight.   When he arrived in the hotel he started organising the entire operation, directing the police and army. Then he went in there on his own to neutralise the enemy and rescue the hostages. His actions certainly saved many lives and shows the manner of these men, who are extremely brave and always ready. Pictures and video from the scene show the SAS operative in jeans and body armour, holding a gun, as he escorts bystanders out of the DusitD hotel to safety. The weapon he is seen clutching is a Diemaco C Carbine - standard issue for Special Forces soldiers. Chris, who served in the highly-secretive regiment for  years, said footage of the soldier showed he is a highly trained fighter who instinctively knew what he needed to do to save lives. And he praised his “creativity” in instructing Kenyan forces to block off roads and exits and storm the hotel on his own.  Best-selling author Chris, whose books are inspired by his SAS bravery, said: “That’s just what the guy does, it’s his nine to five job. He’s trained to the highest level to react to these types of situations.And counter terrorism operations are just bread and butter to him. “He was already there training Kenyan special forces, and then these guys go out to react to situations, and that’s how he was out on the ground. “The calibre of these types of soldiers is such that the other side,al-Shabaab, wouldn’t stand a chancethey came up against this guy. “He is trained to react to the threat. He will instinctively locate the threat, identy it and then neutralise it.   “His tactic is to shoot the enemy before they get a chance to shoot themselves. “You can see from the videos that he wasn’t cowering anywhere, he was aggressively moving on to targets, on the prowl hunting these animals down. “He was dominating the firefight, switching everything from their surprise attack to them being hunted, because they’ve now got a professional solider in the thick of it going after them.” Chris said he was impressed - but not surprised - at how the soldier took control of the situation, directing the Kenyan police and army as he engaged with the terror gang. He said: “Because the guy was part a training team out there, he was already up to date on every tactic they use and how to react.   “These guys can read the situation on the ground, immediately without briefings, and then they can adapt to that situation. “Obviously the guy had all the equipment with him, he had the weaponry, body armour and magazines, so once he was there it was just a case of reacting to the situation, finding the target and putting it down. “The Kenyan forces reacted first, but when he arrived on the scene he took over and started guiding everyone into firing positions, and then bringing the civilians out to safe havens. “You saw he was going in and bringing people out then putting them into a safe area and then going back in. For him that’s as normal as someone  going in to the office and doing their job. It’s as basic as that.  “He’s going in to an area where he will have trained countless times to engage targets and then cover your flanks and protect your flanks, using buildings, vehicles, and other structures to cover himself. “But then as soon as he sees a target he will engage that target. And I can guarantee he will be a hell of a lot more accurate with his weapon that the al-Shabaab guy. “So he will be putting a piece of lead through them and then moving on to the next one. It’s as simple as that really.”  And he said the soldier obviously made a calculated decision to go in alone, believing that it would be better than taking in less professional local troops. He said: “Clearly the guy is really creative. In every footage I’ve seen of him he’s doing it alone and hasn’t taken any of the local forces to give him back up. He’s taken the fight to these guys on his own. “He’s very confident, he knows his capabilities, and he will have a very high understanding of who he was going after. “Sometimes you’re better off working by yourself because around the world certain armies can get a bit fired up, and start firing off rounds. Then you have a big threat of blue on blue. “So he probably felt safer by placing the local security services, police and army, in places, telling them not to move, and to provide him cover. “He might have told the security services to maybe block a street off as he goes in, or to cover exits of buildings so when he goes in and flushes anybody out for them to maybe engage. “That is everything SAS soldiers are training to do, instinctively. It’s second nature to them.” "},{"url":null,"title":"stupid passenger leaps 11th floor","story":"NewsStupid passenger leaps from th floor of Caribbean cruiser for online fameNick Naydev, , from Washington, USA fell over ft into the water below while the ship was docked in the BahamasShareCommentsByLaura Forsyth:,  JAN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news world-news video man-leaps-balcony-caribbean-cruiser-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true\"\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA man was filmed jumping from the th floor of a cruise ship in a bid for online fame.

The pilot had made clear he was prepared to make an emergency landing after the violent passenger attacked people around him. The man - aged  and reportedly recently released from prison in Thailand - went on a rampage on the A flight from Bangkok. Video shows the man tied with sticky tape and belts on the floor of the aircraft’s galley. Passengers “neutralised” him after stewardesses were unable to calm him - and he was tied on the floor of the jet for some four hours until the plane reached Russia.   A male passenger “hit the hooligan several times and with the help of other tourists tied him up”, said Colonel Irina Volk, spokeswoman for the Russian Interior Ministry. “Witnesses confirmed that the captain had warned passengers that they might need to land in China or Mongolia because of this hooligan”. The shocking air rage incident was on a packed alcohol-free flight from Bangkok to Russia’s third largest city Novosibirsk, operated by S, part of the same One World alliance as British Airways and American Airlines.  Some  were on board including babies and young children. The abusive passenger had been drinking whisky from a bottle he carried on board - and started “offensive and threatening behaviour” three hours into the seven hour  minute flight, according to witnesses.   Passenger Pavel Makarov posted: “I spotted him at the beginning of the fight – with a half empty whisky bottle and behaving strangely.” Four hours into the flight, the captain intervened, he said. “There were three ways out under international aviation rules - one, the hooligan calms down. “Two, we continue flying and give the guy away to police on arrival. “Three, the plane lands in China or Mongolia and we sort it out on the ground.”  But he said: “The abuser got more and more wild and finally passengers neutralised him “They tied him with sticky tape and belts.” The man was “hurt a bit” and was given medical attention while tied up. After landing in Novosibirsk, he man was taken away by transport police. S - Russia’s second largest airline after Aeroflot - confirmed the incident from January .  “The passenger behaved in inadequate way during the flight,” said a spokesperson. “He was drinking alcohol, disturbed other passengers and did not react to orders from the crew. “For the sake of security, stewardesses have called the hooligan to the galley in the rear of the plane and tried to calm him down. “But he began to wave his arms, to threaten and abuse the crew and passengers. “  “During the rest of the flight he was closely watched by one of the stewards and a doctor - one of the passengers. “As a result of this incident, there were no delays. “On arrival to Novosibirsk the hooligan was given away to airport police department where he was charged with hooliganism.” It is understood the man was later fined.

A random farmer that neither of us knew even bought us shots of whisky.“I was living in Glasgow while completing my studies so, following that date, Martin was smitten and would visit me most weekends.“We did the long-distance relationship for about a year before I graduated and got a job down in County Durham. Martin followed me, leaving his job and his home and got a job in Middlesbrough.“I still wouldn’t let him move in with me though until about three months later when I realised it really was silly to still be living apart.”In September  sunnier climes called and Martin and Katie were heading to Majorca.However, much to the annoyance of Katie, Martin seemed to be in no rush to pack.Katie said: “I had been asking Martin to look out all the clothes he wanted to take for ages but he never did it so one day I went in to his room and started getting all his T-shirts organised myself.“It was all in a mess and Martin has always got receipts lying about the place so I grabbed them thinking they would be work expenses and quickly realised that one was actually for a ring.“I didn’t know what to do but I couldn’t put everything back in the drawer the same mess that it was so Martin obviously knew I had seen it.”Martin, a service engineer, added: “On the first night of the holiday I said to Katie ‘I know that you know I have got a ring’, so it did make it a bit easier when it was time to ask.“I had the ring for six months before I did ask and occasions kept passing me by and I wouldn’t have done it.”On the second night of their break Martin enlisted the help of nephew Ruan who was one at the time. Martin wrote a letter which Ruan passed to his Aunty Katie.Ruan was three by the time Martin and Katie got married on October  at Fernie Castle in Fe. He had the special job of announcing to the waiting guests that the bride was on her way with a sign that read: “Here comes Aunty Katie, and it’s all thanks to me.”But he wasn’t the only cute attendee to steal the show – Martin and Katie’s four-legged friends Morgan and Talisker also made special guest appearances.However, Morgan was more focused on the chickens which roam the venue than the formal proceedings.Martin first laid eyes on his bride during a “first look” which involved him sitting blindfolded. When the blindfold was removed, his bride was in front of him.Katie added: “It was lovely doing the first look. Our amazing photographer Chris Scott captured every reaction and then he left us for  minutes all by ourselves which you don’t really get at any other point on your wedding day.“We gave each other little cards that we had written too.”It wasn’t the only romantic part before the ‘I dos’ were said though, as Martin had pulled out all the stops to give Katie a bracelet for the day which had originally been gted to her grandmother on her wedding day by Katie’s grandad who died in .Katie said: “I am not an emotional person but Martin on the other hand is a crier.“But I definitely got choked up when he gave me the bracelet. It was incredibly thoughtful.”Following the laid-back morning and ceremony, Martin and Katie cut their magnicent cheese wedding cake from The Cheesery. Well, they attempted to anyway, using a blunt sword which saw the miniature groom fall off and lose his head.They danced to Soldier by Gavin DeGraw for their first sway as a married couple before enjoying the rest of their reception.Katie added: “Neil at Fernie Castle was amazing and we knew we loved the venue from the moment we walked in.“We want to say a massive thank you to all of our family and friends who made the day laidback but filled with fun and laughter.”"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee united director tony asghar says slightly different men can achieve promotion","story":"New Dundee United sporting director Tony Asghar believes, together with manager Robbie Neilson, they can recruit the right players to deliver promotion from the Championship.Asghar’s newly-created role comes after he helped millionaire US owner Mark Ogren broker a deal to take the reins at Tannadice and will see him head up the football side of the club, dealing primarily with long-term recruitment, player development and on-pitch performance.The former police officer, agent and consultant will work closely with United boss Robbie as they aim toto the Premiership at the third time of asking at the end of the season.“The first business plan is only in the short term and that goal is to attain promotion,” he said.“The club itself is a huge club, I think the new owners want to invest in that and get the club back to the Premiership.“Always when a takeover happens just during the January window it’s a bit frantic but we’re trying to stay calm and assess the squad to bring in new players that fit the long-term recruitment strategy for this club.“We’ll be taking a deep breath on February  after the transfer window has closed but short term we really need to attain promotion. That’s our key aim.”And Asghar insists they will be looking for a ‘dferent’ kind of player, assessing their character as well as playing ability.He added: “We will have a way of trying to identy players and I think you’ve seen over the last few players we’ve brought in, they’re slightly dferent, slightly younger with the exception of Morgaro Gomis.“That will be our strategy moving forward, good quality young players who can make this team successful.“I think with our strategy we’re going to try to take a deep breath, try to assist the head coach and develop our players.“It doesn’t mean just throwing money at it willy nilly, we have to be strategic and understand the character of the players, which is not done a lot. There are good players that the other managers that have been here have brought in.“We’ll assess all that, see who is part of what we want going forward,they’re going to buy into what we’re doing and, hopefully, we’ll have a successful conclusion.”Although he will help Robbie identy and develop players as sellable assets, it will be the gaffer who will always have the final say on first-team matters.Asghar added: “I’ll be based at Tannadice, the training ground and part of my remit is also to go and carry out recruitment.“I’m not going to be at the training ground, standing every day, I wasn’t a professional player or a manager so I don’t think there’s any benefit there.“I think there is benefit where I can aide small things that are going to help the team going forward.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/01/5c3dee016491b9.33373019.jpg ","title":"dundee united expect sam stanton to make montrose cup tie","story":"Dundee United boss Robbie Neilson expects midfielder Sam Stanton to be fit for Saturday’s Scottish Cup trip to Montrose.But full-back Stewart Murdoch is a doubt after being replaced by Paul Watson having picked up a knock in the second half of Saturday’s victory over Dunfermline at Tannadice.And by the end of the  minutes, Stanton was limping heavily.

That’s a worry.Seven goals in his first  games after arriving from Danes Aalborg in August suggested the man to get the goals to fire them to promotion had been found.The last seven games, with just one strike to his credit, have dampened such expectations.And while that work he puts in when up front, often on his own, means he continues to be a vital cog in the wheel for the team, there is little question he’d benefit from a regular strike partner.Of course, the arrival of Nesbitt and Smith should help ease the burden on whoever is right up front but only to a degree.Both are capable of chipping in with goals but a good chunk of the work they do is likely to be in creating chances as opposed to taking them.Putting more goals in the team would also ease the pressure on the defence.While the back four have been leaking too many goals this season, they’ve too often taken to the pitch knowing the loss of just one goal may well see a point or points dropped.That’s why the next couple of weeks will see Neilson, presumably backed by new owner Mark Ogren’s money, pull out all the stops to find another quality striker.Particularly in this transfer window, that’s usually easier said than done.If he succeeds and United are back in the top flight come the end of the season it would have been well worth the effort."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/12/5c051af07378a-e1543840266799-940x555.jpg ","title":"tom duthie scottish football should never allow merger of dundees clubs","story":"The latest outbreak of merger fever in Dundee was no more than another in a long list of  alarms among the city’s football public.It’s not unlike the hypochondriac who catches a cold and immediately thinks he’s gone down with pneumonia.The revelation Dundee owner Tim Keyes wants to increase his shareholding to over % and remove the right of the club’s supporters’ society to veto any merger with neighbours United, had temperatures running high.With another American, Mark Ogren, now in control at Tannadice, fans of both clubs had been examining the “symptoms” and reached the diagnosis that a coming together was desired.That shows the accusation the media never let the facts get in the way of a good story can also, sometimes, be levelled at supporters.All along a forensic examination of the timeline of those symptoms strongly suggested this had everything to do with Keyes wanting to be able to build his new stadium at Camperdown without having to get the go-ahead from the fans’ group.Moving away from Dens is another on the list of protected items they can block and,Keyes is going to spend millions on “Nou Campie”, it’s not stretching the imagination to see why he might not want to need permission from a group that won’t be asked to inject a penny.More signicant is the fact Dundee first raised the matter months ago – before Ogren was on the scene at United. Even though this was a case of putting two and two together and getting five, it shows, despite merger being mooted and quickly dismissed on numerous occasions down the decades, it remains a worrying subject for the fans.And while those further afield may see a lot of sense in a one-club city, for those punters who actually turn up at Dens and Tannadice, it is the nightmare scenario. They’ll take hard times like financial crisis and relegation and stick with their team but what they’d never do is watch a merged team.That alone is why such a move is too dangerous. The clubs should always take the “nos” of the fans who go to games over the “I woulds” of potential new customers of a ‘Dundee City’.There is every chance a build-it-and-they-will-come merger would leave us with a club only slightly bigger than the two that exist.That wouldn’t just be bad for the city but Scottish football and it makes it surprising that, when the topic is raised, no one at the top of the game has come out against it.While sporting performance is rightly the normal criteria for the make-up of our top ision,ever it was to be done on size of club, Dundee and United would be in there – and comfortably so.If Premiership membership was decided on that second basis the top  would be something like Celtic, Rangers, Aberdeen, Hearts, Hibs, Dundee United, Dundee, Motherwell, Kilmarnock, St Johnstone, Falkirk and St Mirren.The likes of Morton, Dunfermline and Inverness may argue they should be in there but it would be on the basis they have more potential than the names at the end of that list.When it comes to core support, the first seven clubs listed are untouchable. If Glasgow giants Rangers or Celtic, on their own, are bigger than the rest put together, those from the country’s three other major cities are also well ahead of the others below them.To reiterate, in all but exceptional circumstances, results should determine who’s in the top league, so it’s up to the likes of United to get back there by winning matches.But when the Tangerines and the Dark Blues are in the top flight, Scottish football is the better for it.That will always be the case."},{"url":null,"title":"mcdonalds-launches-veggie-happy-meals-as-greggs-sells-vegan-sausage-rolls","story":"MCDONALDrsquoS restaurants across Glasgow have launched their first-ever vegetarian Happy Meal for children from today."},{"url":null,"title":"richard-madden-flashback-to-when-rising-actor-spoke-to-the-evening-times","story":"RENFREWSHIRE actor Richard Madden has picked up a Golden Globe for his role in gripping BBC drama Bodyguard."},{"url":null,"title":"sir-andy-murray-from-dunblane-to-double-olympic-champion","story":"FROM gangly, wild-haired teenager to one of Britainrsquos great sporting heroes, Sir Andy Murray may have been forced to hang up his rackets but his impact will be felt for generations."},{"url":null,"title":"dennys-bosses-slam-unforgiving-customers-after-being-bombarded-with-terrible-reviews","story":"DENNYrsquoS bosses have hit back at ldquounforgiving customers who have left negative feedback after visiting the dinerrsquos newly-opened branch near Glasgow."},{"url":null,"title":"indyref-2-statement-in-matter-of-weeks-says-nicola-sturgeon","story":"Nicola Sturgeon said she will speak about the timing of a second independence referendum in a ldquomatter of weeks."},{"url":null,"title":"straight-talking-damien-duff-ready-to-make-his-coaching-mark-at-celtic","story":"Damian Duff has conceded that one of his failings is a tendency to curse too much but the former Republic of Ireland internationalist is sworn to getting the best out of those in the underbelly at Celtic."},{"url":null,"title":"celtic-keeping-tabs-on-scott-mctominay-situation-as-united-ponder-loan-move-for-midfielder","story":"Celtic are keeping tabs on Scott McTominays situation with Manchester United prepared for the midfielder to go out on a possible loan move before the closure of the transfer window.

When did two players from Mid Argyll help Rangers win the Scottish Cup The answer is # . Local girls Jasmine McPhie and Carla Todd were both key players in Rangers Girls triumphant run in the Girls Under  Scottish Cup.In their run to the final, Rangers played the top four under  girls teams in Scotland beating Aberdeen - in the first round, then Hamilton - and Central Girls - in rounds two and three. A quarter-final tie against Glasgow City saw the Rangers Girls win - to set up an old firm semi-final against Celtic Girls in which the Rangers Girls emerged - winners in a close game.The final was played on Saturday November  at the Oriam Performance Centre in Edinburgh. In a competitive match, Rangers started strong but Hibernian began to come into the game and whilst both sides had chances, the score remained - at half time. In the second half, Rangers took the lead in  minutes but three minutes later Hibernian drew level.There were few chances in the remainder of the second half and at full time both teams were level at -. Rangers took the lead again in extra time with a deserved winner to secure the cup.Jasmine and Carla came through the Lochgilphead Soccer Centre from primary one age to primary seven, playing in local festivals.In   the girls were important members of the successful Lochgilphead Red Star  team which won the DFDL league cup and finished second in their league. At the end of that season they joined Rangers Girls where they are in their second season playing mostly in the Paisley League against boys teams but also in national girls# competitions.Both girls have also been involved in Scotland national squads for their age group and the Soccer Centre is delighted to see them thriving with a big club.With more than  girls now playing football through the Soccer Centre, the success of Jasmine and Carla should be a real inspiration for local girls.So girls, you may live out in rural Mid Argyll but with talent, hard work and the right attitude you could be creating your own football opportunities."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 01","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThe conditions being endured by refugees on a remote Greek island might seem of little importance to folk living in Argyll, but Pam Gregory spends time helping make their lives easier.More volunteers are desperately needed to assist as conditions worsen during the winter and Samos Volunteers would love to hear from anyone with the inclination to help.Pam#s dedication and the support of the Craignish community deserve great credit.

Invited to join Cameron up at the Cruachan dam for the second of his two recent programmes, I was delighted to tramp the mighty mountain with Scotland’s Number one authority on outdoor pursuits.As an author and broadcaster, Cameron always has an eye on a good story, and so as well as asking me about the lack of health and safety regulations at the time the hydro project was being built, he also wanted to knowthere really was a murder during the construction. There was, as I told him, a body – but the body wasn’t identied, no arrests were made, no court case took place.It would be a shamethat construction period went down in history as an invasion of , workmen – #Tunnel Tigers# as they were dubbed – into one of Argyll#s most beautul settings and a possible murder.My book was intended to give the story of the local people whose lives were punctuated by this ambitious construction project. Quite rightly, those Tunnel Tigers had been lauded in a number of publications. The work that was done hollowing out Argyll’s highest mountain to provide electricity for the nation was amazing.The plan for Cruachan – as for the other major hydro projects of the post World War II era – was conceived by Tom Johnston, to whom I dedicated my book. Johnston was a politician who remained true to his ideals of bringing rural Scotland into the modern world. There was no power in the Highlands, and without power there could be no industry and no prosperity. The engineering genius was Sir Edward MacColl, whose biographer Norrie Fraser called him #a maker of modern Scotland#.Cruachan was the first reversible pumped-storage system in the world. During its years of construction from  to , eminent international engineers visited the project to see how the water was pumped between two reservoirs through reversible turbine generators. At off-peak hours, the water was – is # pumped back up to the reservoir you see high up in the corrie above Loch Awe, held back by a dam that is now so much a part of our landscape. The loch itself is the lower reservoir.I had imagined that the scale of such a project – using Scotland’s top engineering companies who shipped in workers from other parts of the UK and Europe – would have been a cause for resentment and protest by local people.That, of course, failed to take account of the vision of the folk of Dalmally, Lochawe, and Taynuilt. Although it took men with engineering experience to blast the  miles of tunnels, hollow out the mountain itself, and construct the dam, there was also a need for a support army. There were clerks and porters, joiners and caterers, folk willing to let out a room, a caravan, a house, serve in a pub where just occasionally it was necessary to keep a baseball bat behind the bar to maintain bonhomie. The project kick started careers, fortunes and marriages, and gave the area good roads and a tourist industry.If you haven’t visited the hollow mountain or walked Cruachan’s slopes, make  the year you do.[In bold please] Cruachan: The Hollow Mountain is available from the Argyll Book Centre in Lochgilphead and all good book shops, along with Marian Pallister#s other books of local interest.PICS:The Pass of Brander before work started. no_aCruachanLe before the project # the Loch Awe Hotel with steamers. no_aCruachanThe Queen opening the project in October . no_aCruachanWorking on the  miles of tunnels. no_aCruachanWorking on the road to the dam, overlooking Loch Awe. no_aCruachan"},{"url":null,"title":"now ewe see him the mystery of tarberts rambling ram","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowA four-legged Houdini running free around an Argyll fishing village has had local people flocking to social media channels.A rogue sheep # a maleof the Scottish blackface breed # was first spotted loose near Tarbert Golf Club around New Year#s Day.There followed a number of sightings around the Loch Fyne village of the scarlet-painted pimpernel, ranging from the harbour side to the Campbeltown road.He was even spotted near Tarbert Parish Church on Sunday January , though it is not clear whether he joined the flock.One Tarbert resident commented: #It#s like now ewe see him, now ewe don#t.#The woolly wanderer#s fun was curtailed early the following week when he was captured and taken to a nearby farm.As the tup sheepishly set off for more secure accommodation, it seemed the online jokers# fun was at an end # puns involving  #ewe#, #horns#, #mint sauce# and even some unfair references to certain football fans were all the rage on Facebook.But that was that, the sheep was gone.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13865741.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/2_JS172700549.jpg","title":"brexit conservative remainer mp admits","story":"NewsBrexit: Conservative Remainer MP admits he would consider voting Leave in second referendumBill Grant says \"arrogance\" from EU negotiators may push him towards voting Leaveany second referendum arose.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  JAN NewsBill Grant MP \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA Scots Tory MP says he would consider performing a Brexit u-turnBritain goes back to the polls.

Tory group leader Martin Dowey made the plea for the area to be more car-friendly following the announcement of the closure of Hourstons last week. Councillor Dowey urged the council to ease parking charges in the High Street in a bid to encourage more footfall to the area. Speaking at Seafield, Fort and Wallacetown Community Council last Wednesday, he said: “I am frustrated and saddened at Hourstons closing. “Given the retail climate, it wasn’t unexpected.” The councillor said internet and retail park shopping had contributed to the demise of town centres across the country. “Town centre shops need to be smaller and more niche,” he added. “The town centre is far too big for the size of Ayr.   “We need to utilise what we have got to encourage footfall.” SNP ward councillor Siobhian Brown is disappointed that the iconic store is to close and said a long-term plan is needed to attract more people back to the town centre. “It is a sign of times as people buy online,” she added. Norman McLean, the community council’s chairman, said: “It didn’t get the footfall. It was only a couple of months ago I was in the store and I felt like I was the only person there. “Has the council got any contingency plans  “What about waiving the cost of the first hour parking at parking meters ” The meeting heard that Hourstons were paying pound, per year in business rates before they started paying staff and other costs. Now the iconic building could be turned into flats or used by the council for offices.   Councillor Dowey added: “We need more parking and we have to bring cars back into the High Street. “The one-way system brought in the s was probably a good idea then but it is not such a good idea now. “People don’t drive down the High Street as much any more and they don’t see how bad the bottom end is. “I am guilty as anyone because I go to Heathfield for shopping because you can get parking there.” One community councillor said more must be done to attract sport and culture to the town centre to get people back there. “Retail cannot be sustained,” he insisted. “We need cultural tourism to do draw people into the town centre.” Another pointed out that shops in Prestwick and Troon are thriving: “The dference between Prestwick and Ayr is that they have all small units and in Ayr it is all big High Street units for the past  or  years. Big units cost too much.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"sleazy pensioner took pictures schoolgirls","story":"NewsSleazy pensioner took pictures of schoolgirls in miniskirtsA court ruled there was ‘a substantial sexual element to his breach of the peace offence, writes Edwin Lawrence.ShareByAyrshire Post:,  JAN NewsAyr Sherf Court \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA sleazy retired architect took pictures of schoolgirls in miniskirts. And a court ruled there was ‘a substantial sexual element to his breach of the peace offence. Ross McKay, , insisted he was innocent of the sordid behaviour. But Sherf John Montgomery told him: “Your defence is absurd . ‘It wasn’t me. It wasn’t my car’. “There is overwhelming evidence it WAS you, in YOUR car. You’re guilty all day long.” The sherf heard evidence from neighbours in Ayr’s Peggieshill Road who saw McKay in a four-wheel drive vehicle near Belmont Academy. Gary Cornelius, , saw McKay taking sneak pictures with his phone – every time schoolgirls walked by. He took a note of the car’s registration number and called the police. Mr Cornelius said: “It was obvious he was taking photos of every single girl who passed.” This incident occurred in mid  – and Mr Cornelius was shocked to see McKay’s vehicle outside his house again, on March , . Neighbour Paul Cunningham, , also identied McKay on this occasion. Mr Cornelius went to the school where he told a police officer what he had witnessed. Police later seized McKay’s phone and found images of schoolgirls in miniskirts. McKay admitted it was his phone but said he had not taken the pictures. He claimed: “I am aware of a client, just before I retired, who could have done this.” Sherf Montgomery asked: “You mean someone who didn’t like you put them there.” “Yes, but I can’t substantiate it,” replied McKay. “So, it’s a frame-up job – that’s your position ” asked depute fiscal Ed Sheeran. Someone’s in a car with the same registration as yours  Is Mr Cornelius in on the fit-up  Is Mr Cunningham  That’s thoroughly ridiculous,” Mr Sheeran concluded. McKay acknowledged driving in Peggieshill Road on March  but insisted he never stopped or took the pictures.

discussions have been taking place behind closed doors between community groups, the Scottish government, councillors and club members regarding a takeover of the premises.And the clubrsquos

Helen Gillanders, headteacher of Dunbar Primary School, which operates over two sites, also attended meetings to discuss how her school operates.The merging of the two schools was supported by all

headteachers and great support staff and yet we receive these reports.ldquoWe owe it to the children of Prestonpans to give them the best opportunities they can. I think in the long term it will be the best benefit for the people of Prestonpans.His view was given cross-party support at the council meeting, with fellow councillor Norman Hampshire saying that concerns about the merger were caused by ldquoa fear of the unknown.The new school is expected to be operational by February, with a Transition Action Group brought in to oversee any changes.Its name is still to be decided."},{"url":null,"title":"new-landlord-takes-over-at-the-prestoungrange-gothenburg","story":"Michelle Wilson began working at The Goth public house on Prestonpans High Street a couple of years ago and very quickly rose through the ranks to become the general manager, under Sean Woodrsquos leadership.Sean said: ldquoMichelle became very evidently a huge asset to the business soon after she started.ldquoShe clearly has the drive, ambition and passion to make the best out of anything she puts her hands to.ldquoThe businessrsquo entertainment programme has grown signicantly since Michelle took it on and we have become a true destination for those seeking out weekend entertainment.Sean will be moving on to spend more time on other ventures, while Michelle will take on the lease and roll out a plan of improvements and initiatives to take the establishment to the next level.Sean added: ldquoIrsquove done what I can here and itrsquos now time to pass the baton on to somebody  to take things forward and seek out new ways of enhancing what is on offer at The Goth, and I couldnrsquot think of anybody better than Michelle to do just that.ldquoIt seems such a natural transition.ldquoI have found it an absolute pleasure to serve the community during my tenure, having presided over seven weddings, numerous family occasions and events, and have a huge gratitude of praise for Michelle having stood by my side throughout this time.ldquoI wish her all the best for the future.The Goth has changed hands a few times over the  years it has been in existence, the most signicant of which was when Dr Gordon Prestoungrangersquos family purchased and refurbished the building in  they have retained ownership ever since.An attempt to encourage a community buyout two years ago did not come to fruition, at which point Sean took on the lease of the establishment, having been the resident brewer for a year.

We now look forward to the merriment of Hogmanay! These days in between, traditionally known as the Daft Days, are my favourite of Yule time.Yet not so long ago the most popular focus of festivity was neither Christmas nor even Hogmanay, it was Handsel Monday.It fell upon the first Monday after New Year, although there was some dispute as to the exact Monday it should be celebrated, for some measured the date by the old calendar.This was the case for the country folk in East Lothian, or Haddingtonshire as it was then known. So Auld Handsel Monday fell for them on the first Monday after January .It was the country folkrsquos winter holiday because Christmas and Yule festivities had for so long been banned by the Kirk.The word Handsel apparently comes from an old Saxon word which means to give by hand.On Handsel Monday the family gathered together and shared gts and social time, which for much of the th century remained the main winter festival of the rural poor in East Lothian.The East Lothian writer and poet James Lumsden captured the atmosphere of this now forgotten holiday in one of his poems about the day.He tells us the children would wake up all excited, and the merriment would begin as the dawn of this winterrsquos day heralded a special time of conviviality and reunion:ldquoBy screich o morn the bairns are up,\"And loud the auld folk rousin\"What braws are donnd, what sangs are connd,\"What daffin an carousin!\"It was a time when family members made huge efforts tohome and celebrate together. Food had been specially kept for the occasion and those at home awaited the arrival of others who they had perhaps not seen since the previous Handsel Monday.Lumsden says streams of young folk left the towns for their homes in the countryside. Domestic servants, shop assistants, apprentices all set off in the early hours on Handsel Monday ason a pilgrimage, to share in the celebrations:ldquoSune ran we hame wi anxious haste\"For our grand Hansel denner,\"Pork chops and dumplins ndash lord a feast ndash\"A gorge for saunt or sinner!We can picture the scene as daughters and sons ed, greeted by parents and younger siblings, grandparents and old friends. It was a time of gt giving, with family and neighbours sharing treats.But the rich were expected to give too, as it was the tradition that masters and employers would give gts of drink, food and even a financial contribution to the communityrsquos festivities. In fact, the social norms were often overturned on this day, with the landowners serving and working for the poor on this one special day.While it had no religious content, Handsel Monday was in its own way sacred. It was a longed for day off for those who worked hard with little in the way of holidays. It was Christmas Day, Boxing Day and Hogmanay all wrapped into one.And as the day wore into evening, the merriment would build. People made the most of this precious social time together, with stories, dance and song:ldquoSyne sune wi reels, an strathspeys even,\"The wee cot housie dirled,\"As a the blasts o yearth an heaven\"Were gainst its boukie hurled\"Braw lads and lasses lap and skirled.As is always the case with such gatherings, time flew and too soon the day would draw to a close:ldquoBut daffin jigs, an sangs, an tales,\"Sped far too swith the hours on.Sad farewells would have to be made.

This apple is magic and is found at the top of a tall ancient tree, which grows deep in a dark forest.ldquoTo get to the tree first you must find your way through the forest. Then you will come to a circular clearing, where there are no trees except the ancient tall apple tree.ldquoThis tree grows in the middle of the clearing and its single fruit, the apple of your dreams, can be seen on its topmost branch.The storyteller looked round his audience.ldquoWill you try to reach it and pick it to make your dream come true  he asked.The children all answered yes.ldquoThen first you must decide what your dreams are.ldquoBe rich, was a common response. The storyteller smiled and nodded: ldquoYes we all have dreams of being rich, but rich in what  Rich in love and happiness, or rich in money and things ldquoItrsquos the same, said one child. ldquoI donrsquot think it is, said another, looking at the storyteller. ldquoIs it ldquoThat is a good question, replied the storyteller, ldquofor sure having too little money is not a good thing. And the world is an unfair place where those who have too much money and too many things keep it to themselves, so those who have too little money never get their fair share, even though there is sufficient for everyone to have enough.ldquoSo I want to be one of those that has too much! declared one member of the class, to laughter.ldquoAndso would you share what you have with others who do not have enough  asked the storyteller.The child paused for a moment for thought: ldquoMaybe some of it.Other children voiced dferent opinions. ldquoIrsquod keep it all, ldquoIrsquod share it, ldquoIrsquod give some to my family and friends.It created some discussion amongst the children.The teacher was going to ask the children to be quiet and listen to the storyteller, but he indicated he was happy with what was happening.ldquoBut then yoursquod end up being poor again, said one. ldquoNo, Irsquod not give it all away.ldquoBut the whole point of being rich is that you can do what you want.ldquoWell, it also means you can help other people.The storyteller listened to the debate for a minute or two, then he beat his drum to regain the childrenrsquos attention.ldquoAnd so, for most here, money will be your dream. I understand that. Nobody wants to be poor. But lots of money is not really your dream.A chorus of: ldquoYes it is!ldquoNo, replied the storyteller, ldquomoney is not your dream, it is what you spend it on, what it might make possible for you that you do not have now, that would be your dream. That is what you must think of before you set out on your quest.ldquoBecauseyou pick the apple of your dreams, but have no dreams for your le, then you will still be poor, evenyou have all the money in the world.ldquoThatrsquos just stupid, said one boy. The teacher was quick to remind him not to be rude, but the storyteller asked him: ldquoWhat is stupid ldquoWhat yoursquove just said, you canrsquot be pooryou are rich, that doesnrsquot make sense. Thatrsquos what I meant is stupid.The storyteller smiled. ldquoPerhaps you are right, but do you think sometimes people can also be poor in things that money canrsquot buy There was silence for a moment. Then a girl said: ldquoYou mean people can be poor in dreams for their le The storyteller smiled and nodded.ldquoPrecisely, said the storyteller. ldquoThe whole issue of getting rich has stopped us thinking about what our dreams actually are.ldquoI want to be a dancer, said one child. ldquoI want to drive fast cars, said another.ldquoI still want to be rich so I donrsquot have to do anything and just play computer games.ldquoI want to make the computer games, said his friend. ldquoYeah, me too, agreed his pal.ldquoI want to be the President! another said.ldquoI just want to be happy!The storyteller beat his drum again.ldquoAnd so before you set off on your quest you must think about your dreams. And let me tell you that dreams can be shared too.ldquoHowrsquod you do that  he was asked.The storyteller thought for a moment: ldquoWell, for some their dream may be to save an animal that is in danger of being extinct.ldquoOr save the planet, called out another.ldquoThatrsquos why I want to be President.ldquoSo I want you to think about your dreams, and once you have you got your dreams you are ready for your quest into the forest, said the storyteller.The children assembled their thoughts and soon everyone had a collection of dreams to take with them to the apple tree.ldquoThere is one more thing I forgot to tell you, said the storyteller. ldquoItrsquos an important piece of information. You see, when you finally get to the clearing you must be very careful, for wrapped around the base of the ancient apple tree there is a ferocious dragon.ldquoIt sleeps, but very lightly. It will wake when you approach the tree. It will hear you no matter how quiet. It will hear your heartbeat. And there is no place to hide in the clearing. The moment you approach the tree, the dragon will pounce on you.ldquoCan the dragon fly  asked one.ldquoYes.ldquoAnd breathe fire ldquoYes.There were murmurings.ldquoAnd so, the storyteller continued, ldquoyou must decide how you will overcome and defeat the dragon. It is there to stop you reaching the apple of your dreams.Some of the children came up with immediate ideas:ldquoIrsquod run as fast as I could in zig zags.ldquoIrsquod distract the dragon.ldquoIrsquod shoot the dragon with a gun.ldquoIrsquod make a giant kite and fly to the apple.ldquoIrsquod take some friends and feed them to the dragon while I get the apple, then dream my friends back again.There were many solutions and the storyteller listened to them with interest. Each child came up with a dferent strategy.The storyteller nodded, explaining the powers of the dragon that it couldnrsquot be killed by bullets or blades or fire, that it was faster than lightning and once it had heard you and seen you it would go for you.ldquoKnowing all this, are you still going to try and defeat the dragon and reach the apple of your dreams They all said yes, refining their ideas.And so once the children had come up with their final strategy, the storyteller asked them to think about what they might need to take with them to defeat the dragon. They will have to carry these things through the forest, or perhaps collect them on the way.Then the storyteller set the children the task of drawing the things they would need and then the dragon and apple tree. In drawing the apple they would have to decide what the apple of their dreams would look like.When this was all done, the children settled down to hear who had the right answer.ldquoI have looked at all the ideas, said the storyteller. ldquoWhat I must say is that le is unfair and so is this quest. For some, the journey through the forest will be longer than others. The dragon will be more dficult to defeat for some than others, as its mood changes. But you have all come up with the same answer, and so you are all right.There were howls of protest.ldquoNo, we didnrsquot we all have dferent answers!The storyteller beat his drum again to calm the children.ldquoWell yes, you all have dferent ideas on how to defeat the dragon and reach the apple, that is true. But you all have the same answer to the most important question.ldquoWhatrsquos that  the children asked.ldquoWell, said the storyteller, ldquoI had told you how fierce and dreadful the dragon could be. And then I asked youknowing all this, are you still going to try and defeat the dragon and reach the apple of your dreams.ldquoAnd you all said yes, yoursquod try to reach your dreams, even though you had a big fight on your hands.ldquoThat, I believe, is the right answer. You may have dferent ideas on how to get that apple, but yoursquore all right because each of you will have to fight the dragon in a dferent way. The most important thing is your determination to get to that apple.ldquoWhatafter all that we fail  asked one child.ldquoYou might, said the storyteller, ldquobut on your journey to your dreams you may find a new path that leads to another ancient tree without a dragon.ldquoTherersquos another magic apple tree without a dragon !ldquoPerhaps, perhaps not. But the only way to find out is set off on the journey with determination in your heart. You might realise on the journey that your dreams are easier to reach than you had thought, or it could be the other way round.ldquoBut the most important thing is to have your dreams and find ways to reach them.The storyteller finished his session. He left the children with their dreams and their strategy to reach them.Happy New Year and good luck in defeating your dragon, and reaching your apple."},{"url":null,"title":"salon-owner-astonished-as-sign-to-be-torn-down","story":"Anna Mather moved her business from grade C listed premises in Gford into a grade B listed building on Haddington High Street last year.The switch has allowed her successful hair stylist team, who were named Scotlandrsquos Hair and Beauty Salon of the Year, to take on larger premises as they moved into the converted George Hotel building in the centre of town.But Ms Mather was stunned when East Lothian Council planners wrote to her to say that her shop sign, which is the same as the one she had at Gford, would be forcibly removed in a few weeksrsquo time.Ms Mather said: ldquoI contacted planners about the sign when we moved in and was told that, because it is plastic, it is the wrong material for the building, even though the shops across the road use the same type of signs.ldquoWe had gone to great s to ensure it was mounted properly to avoid having to screw it into the wall of the building and it is the same as we had at our previous salon.ldquoI appreciate it is a grade B listed building and am happy to meet requirements but when I asked for advice about what materials I could use they said they could not tell me.ldquoI have to apply for planning permission but, without knowing the material I can use, it will just be rejected and cost us money.ldquoNow they have written to say they are coming to forcibly remove the sign on January  and will charge us for the work.ldquoWe are a new business in the town and cannot afford to have these types of expensive bills.

And so I think I shall.A story from your head is a term I use to describe a story either made up on the spot or a remembered story that was made up at an earlier time. So essentially itrsquos a story that isnrsquot written down anywhere or got from a book.Of course, reading to, and with, children is really important. But making stories together with a child is a really bonding experience and a fantastic way to encourage the child to explore and develop her or his creative imagination.This dadrsquos child is quite young but the process Irsquom about to describe can be used for any age group, and indeed yourself.Firstly, I want you to think of a mountain. You are standing at its base on one side and you want to get to the other side. In order to do so you will need to climb to the summit first. This mountain in your imagination is going to initially help you make a story, because itrsquos called a story mountain.So now you are standing at the base of the story mountain. You need a few things before you begin your journey to the summit, and the first thing is a character or characters.This is the first question to ask your child: who is in the story  Let them decide, and it can be anyone or anything: a dragon, a princess, a footballer, Spiderman, a Minion, a witch, a boy or girl, or even your child themselves.Next question is to find which place the story begins, that is what the setting is for the beginning of the tale. So you can ask where the character is.It can be an imaginary setting or a real one, perhaps even local, itrsquos up to the child for example, answers might include ldquothe dragon is hiding in a school or ldquothe princess lives in a cave.Once you have a character or characters and some kind of setting you have the beginning of the story. ldquoOnce upon a time, a dragon was hiding in a schoolhellip ldquoThere was once a princess who lived in a cavehellipYou can now help the child to add a few detailsyou wish by asking simple questions about the characters and or the settings. For example: ldquoWhy is the dragon hiding in the school  Or: ldquoWhat does the cave look like Questions like these can help direct the story towards what is going to happen, and that is the next part of your journey up the slope to the summit of your story mountain.So the child may say: ldquoThe dragon is hiding in the school because itrsquos scared of a bigger dragon. Or: ldquoThe cave is cold.Now we have the characters and setting, itrsquos time to make the climb to the summit of the story mountain. This climb represents the issue within the story: a problem, a task or quest, a desire or dream to be sought, a need for change or something to be found and so on. In other words, itrsquos the beginning of the adventure.Itrsquos at this point that beginning the process of visualisation is useful. Visualisation is a technique used by storytellers to help them remember a tale and tell it in their own words. It involves actually imagining yourself in the story, asyou are there.So before you set off on the story, imagine the dragon in the school, enter into the image in your head. Is it your old school, what does the dragon look like, where in the school is it hiding, what are its emotions Likewise with the princess, can you see her in the cave  Enter it in your imagination and look around. Is it large or small, cosy or scary  Where does she sleep and can you see the princess shivering in the cold  What is she feeling and thinking This is what story is all about, entering the world of imagination. Itrsquos not the words you need to remember but the images in your mind. Itrsquos like they become a memory which you can later describe.Your child will have his or her own visualisations, but you can help develop that by asking questions and allowing the child to describe what he or she sees.Painting vivid moving pictures in your mindrsquos eye is the key to not only remembering but developing the story.So now we may have a terried small dragon hiding in the dinner hall of your childrsquos school, and a shivering princess sitting by a small campfire in a huge cave, feeling hungry.The next step is to find out what is going to happen. This begins us on the journey to the summit of the story mountain. To give the child ownership of the story, ask him or her questions like: ldquoSo does the big dragon find the one hiding in the school  Or: ldquoWhat does the princess do to make the cave warmer and get something to eat Now we have the issue that takes us up the hill to the summit. The summit represents the transformative moment in the story, the thing or person or happening that alters the course of events. In any story, this is an important ingredient.So perhaps we will end up with: ldquoThe big dragon flies into the playground and all the children run. But the teacher comes out and is really strict and makes it go away so the children are safe, and so is the wee dragon. Or: ldquoThe princess goes fishing. And she sees a pirate ship while shersquos fishing and decides she wants to be a pirate instead.So the headteacher and the pirate ship are the transformative factors in these examples. They change the course of the story, and in doing so the journey back down the other side of the mountain can now take place, for this represents the conclusion or ending of the tale.Is it a happy, sad, funny ending  So questions like ldquowhat happens to the wee dragon  and ldquodoes the princess enjoy being a pirate and living on the pirate ship  may lead to answers that the wee dragon loves the school and becomes a part of the P class and learns to read, and that the princess becomes the pirate captain.So now the base of the other side of the mountain has been reached, with the storyrsquos ending. Now you can take away the structure of the mountain and lay down the bones of the story you have made along the journey.Here are the bones: wee dragon hides in a school from a bigger dragon, teacher chases bigger dragon away, wee dragon decides he likes the school and stays and joins P princess is in cave cold and hungry, she goes fishing by the sea and sees a pirate ship, she joins the pirate crew and becomes the captain.The visualisation technique can now be used to put flesh on the bones, giving it more detail. You can revisit the tale and develop it later, or leave it as it is.In telling the story, donrsquot think of words, think of the images created in your head, then the words will come naturally as you describe what you see.This way you will remember the story. You may tell it slightly dferently each time, but thatrsquos fine. Your child may remind you of how it was told before, as he or she will have their own visualisation of the tale.Or your child may ask you for a dferent story, in which case you are back at the base of another story mountain ready to climb it!Happy storytelling!"},{"url":null,"title":"plans-for-250-more-homes-in-dunbar-to-be-revealed","story":"Members of the public have the chance to view the

of what they put in.Mrs Bell was keen for social housing and bungalows to be included within the development.She noted concerns had also been expressed about how the townrsquos infrastructure, such as medical centre and primary school, would cope with further expansion, as well as fears it would lead to wildle, such as deer, being displaced and even killed on neighbouring roads.More detailed plans

You would probably have to go to Holyrood to find anything comparably inept.It wasnrsquot just that practically no one had a sensible solution for getting out of this mess ndash that is only to be expected, since there is no outcome that will not disappoint, and probably outrage, a sizeable proportion of the electorate. It was that so many MPs have not grasped the most obvious aspects of the issue.Some speeches, it is true, were only ludicrously detached from reality, imagining the UK as some sort of Singaporean laissez-faire paradise or, from the other side, arguing that the EU would like to extend all its advantages, and none of its tiresome rules about markets to us gratis, while Jeremy Corbyn turns the country into Venezuela.But other statements ndash not least Mr Corbynrsquos ndash indicated that many MPs have yet to get clear such minor points as the dference between the customs union and the single market. There were numerous declarations that there was no majority in the Commons for ldquono deal, without any apparent comprehension of the legal reality that itrsquos exactly what they did provide thumping majorities for, when they triggered Article , and then voted down Theresa Mayrsquos abysmal deal.There were, it must be conceded, two good performances in the no confidence debate: the speeches of Tom Watson and Michael Gove, winding up for either side. Alas, however, both demonstrated the flaws in the Government and the Labour Party ndash and in their own words, rather than those of their opponent.Mr Watsonrsquos ldquomore in sorrow than in anger approach was brilliantly effective. He said what a dficult and thankless task it was, and that, despite her admirable sense of duty, dedication and tenacity, Mrs May had nonetheless made a worse job of it than literally anyone  would have. This was all not just incontestably true but shiningly obvious, until one looked to the man sitting beside Mr Watson, at which point it was possible to think of at least one person who might have made an even more cackhanded go of it.That, in turn, made the inevitable conclusion of Mr Watsonrsquos speech ndash when he called for a General Election ndash automatically anti-climactic. The entire population of the UK, one suspects, were with him while he said how useless the current executive is, and that the sooner we get rid of them the better. But the moment he said ldquoelection, we woke up and asked ourselves how that could possibly sort any of our current problems out.Not just because the choice between the two main Westminster parties doesnrsquot actually offer either Remainers or Leavers an obvious camp to join, nor even because Mr Corbynrsquos current policy is even more incoherent than Mrs Mayrsquos, with the added bonus of being located in cloud-cuckooland. But because, evenany party were advocating a coherent position Liberal Democrats and the SNP are, it is bound ndash whatever form it takes, Remain, Leave or some compromise like the EEA ndash to be one that will, first, anger and alienate half the country and, second, that there will be no one competent to deliver. Mrs May and Mr Corbyn may be the two least impressive politicians of the past century, but only the demented would think that Sir Vince Cable or Nicola Sturgeon are a notable improvement.Mr Goversquos speech had a similar self-detonating mechanism. He was excellent on pointing out that Mr Watson hadnrsquot mentioned his own party leader, and provided a comprehensive account of his manest unsuitability for office. He also got a nice dig in at Ian Blackford, who failed to mention fishing during his -minute speech. But all that those lines of attack did was to highlight the fact that anyone could have flung the same sort of argument at him.Leaving the Common Fisheries Policy and halting freedom of movement are the only two things which Mrs Mayrsquos plan offered to deliver, from the long list of promised advantages held out by, inter alia, Mr Gove during the referendum campaign. Itrsquos true that no one from the Leave campaign has actually been allowed to do anything to shape the current policy, but Mr Gove must know how pathetic what is on offer looks next to what was anticipated.And he must know where to place the blame, too, which is, like Mr Watson, with the person sitting next to him on his own front bench. Presumably to avoid the charge he levelled against the Labour deputy leader, he did mention Mrs May. Once. When saying that a lot of jobs had been created under her ldquoinspirational leadership, words which must surely have prompted a hollow laugh as he wrote them.It is horric to think of where we are now, compared with where we might have beenthere were anyone in power at Westminster with a tenth of the leadership qualities the British public would have demanded even from junior cabinet ministers a couple of decades ago.

No other Prime Minister in history has been defeated so comprehensively and survived, yet she still soldiers on, not for something new, but again, to wear down those who might help her across the finishing line with the battered Brexit battle plan she carries in her handbag, be they friend or foe. This plan she presents, her Brexit, is only the sum of the prejudices of the ious factions of her own party, her red lines the boundaries beyond which one faction or the other could or would never stray.The other parties are surely aware that the only agenda for any tea party will be ldquocould your get members to agree to a bit of tweaking on the Irish backstop and other small issues and go back to Parliament for a further vote  What would you want in  What the discussion will not include will be the removal of the \"no deal\" option, a consideration of a Peoples Vote or a fresh look at any of the \"prepack\" options like the EEA. The Tories would string her up for that. And that is what it is still all about ndash party politics, nothing to do with cross-party consensus or an appeal for National unity.Having almost given up on the prospect of a Peoples Vote and watching this shameless woman reduce the governance of our country to a farce, the only way out now is to pull back, to take leaving the EU off the agenda. Itrsquos not at all dficult we just tell the EU that we cannot agree how to leave the club and that we will remain until we can up with something better.

She may talk about how much this issue has ided the nation, but after the events of the week I suspect she really doesnrsquot care too much.Ian McLaren, Buchanan Drive, Lenzie.IF there is to be another referendum on the EU, surely it will be a second referendum, with a dferent question or questions. People who claim its a re-run of the first referendum with Remainers attempting to overturn the  result are mistaken. The first referendum was a binary Remain or Leave question. The next referendum should be about the final deal negotiated and whether, given the terms, the electorate now wish to stay in the EU or leave.The \"will of the people\" changes at every election. Theresa Mays mistake was to seek to implement the will of a very small majority of those who voted.Lizanne MacKenzie, Albert Road, Dumfries.IN the midst of the political turmoil over finding a way out on Brexit that commands majority support, Nicola Sturgeon concludes that what Scotland can best contribute is more constitutional uncertainty, as she continues the SNP tactic of treating Scotland like its plaything.Apparently the First Minister will set out a timetable for independence in a ldquomatter of weeks . It is not enough that amongst all this constitutional isiveness, she imagines giving us some more will help, but also Scotland is to be toyed with as Ms Sturgeon holds the threat over us, no doubt hoping to pick the moment when she can cause maximum disruption.Her purpose might or might not be to genuinely seek another vote, as she surely realises what little appetite there will be for it.

Baird is sitting in a hotel lobby in London, apologising in advance for any trad jazz that might be filtering down the phone line. ldquoJust so you know, theyrsquore piping it through the walls itrsquos not my taste, he says, his Aberdeenshire accentcutting through the background din.As it happens, hersquos been spending a lot of time in hotels over the last couple of months. His new film, the late-years Laurel  Hardy biopic Stan  Ollie, is currently part of this seasonrsquos awards circuit, with a Golden Globe nomination already in the bag for John C Reillyrsquos transformative turn as Oliver Hardy. That means Baird has also been on the campaign trail, zipping back-and-forth between London, Los Angeles and New York to do QAs with Reilly and co-star Steve Cooganand getting influential industry heavyweights to introduce screenings. Just a few days earlier, for instance, Baird found himself in the surreal position of having Martin Scorsese introduce the film in New York.ldquoHa! Irsquom glad you picked up on that it saves me doing my usual name-dropping, he says, with a self-deprecating laugh.Turns out Scorsese is something of a friend and mentor. They first met three-and-a-half years ago after Baird made the Irvine Welsh adaptation Filth.Scorsese was looking for directors to work on his and Mick Jaggerrsquos short-lived HBO drama Vinyl and he tapped Baird to helm one of the episodes. Baird remembers meeting him for the first time and telling him he was the reason he got into film-making.ldquoBy the look on his face you could tell he sort of hears this all the time. He was probably thinking I was going to mention Taxi Driver or Raging Bull or Goodfellas, but then I said that King of Comedy was the one that really got me interested in film-making and he instantly became engaged on a really intense level.ldquoI donrsquot think many people pick that out as one of his best movies.data-src\"https:res. jpress image fetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.ellontimes webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Colin Clark MP, UK Government Minister Lord Duncan and cllr Gillian Owen at the opening event\"  New centre opened in BalmedieviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:res. jpress image fetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.ellontimes webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"David Cook , Cllr Gwyneth Petrie, Cllr Gillian Owen, Cllr Anne Simpson, Cllr Anne Allan, Cllr Iris Walker and Cllr Anne Stirling \"  , Cllr Gwyneth Petrie, Cllr Gillian Owen, Cllr Anne Simpson, Cllr Anne Allan, Cllr Iris Walker and Cllr Anne Stirling \"  Unit to breathe new le into council services viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\"ldquoFrom that moment, he kind of took me under his wing and ever since then, whenever I go to New York I go round to his house and wersquoll have a cup of tea or Irsquoll go to the edit and hersquoll show me stuff from the latest film hersquos been working on. It is like a boyhood dream.Of course, Scorsese is also a walking encyclopaedia of film history, so the fact that Baird has made a film about arguably the greatest cinematic comedy double act of all time must have made him a good person to have in his corner. ldquoHe did mentor me on Stan  Ollie, confirms Baird, who specically sought his technical advice on how to shoot the moviersquos dazzling opening scene: an extended one-take tracking shot following Laurel and Hardy at the peak of their career as they walk through a studio backlot in .ldquoWe only had one day to shoot that because we were in Pinewood and Star Wars had taken all the stages, says Baird. ldquoIt was unbelievable. ldquoWe planned it like a military operation.If the sequence owes something to the cinematic craft of the Copacabana nightclub scene in Scorsesersquos Goodfellas, it also feels like a sly homage to the opening shot of Robert Altmanrsquos Hollywood satire The Player, immediately setting this up as more of a bittersweet look at what happens to movie stars when the glare of the spotlight fades.When Stan  Ollie cuts to  years later, for instance, the protagonists are in a very dferent place.Fondly remembered by the public, but out of step with contemporary tastes, theyrsquore unable to secure even aphone call from producers as they embark on what feels, at first, like a grin-and-bear-it tour of Britainrsquos regional music halls, performing their old routines up and down the country, including in Glasgow, where the Lancashire-born Stan Laurel spent the latter part of his childhood and secured his first professional gig, aged , at the Panopticon.ldquoI didnrsquot really know about Laurelrsquos connection to Scotland until I started doing this film, says Baird, who has fond memories of his own childhood love of watching Laurel and Hardy films on TV in the late s and early s.ldquoTherersquos a picture of me as an eight year-old that my mum still has of me dressed as Stan Laurel at the school fancy dress party, he says.The enduring appeal of Laurel and Hardy is something the filmrsquos melancholic plot zeroes in on and though Reillyrsquos performance is justly winning the lionrsquos share of the acclaim, Cooganrsquos take on Laurel as the quiet, professionally-minded workhorse is perhaps the more relatable.It certainly seems more applicable to Bairdrsquos own career. Having grown up in a fishing town with no family connection to the arts world , he kept his own film-making ambitions secret, moving to London and working in telesales until a friend who worked for a newspaper tipped him off to an entry level job at a production company about to be advertised in the recruitment section.ldquoHe told them there was no space to run it that week and gave me the number. ldquoSo I phoned them up, had an interview, got the job and started the next week, by which point the advert had run and they got  applications.ldquoI know, because I had to st through all the mail!Even now, it still feels like becoming a director was a bit of a pipe dream.ldquoBut I think that made me work a lot harder. I had to. It was either work hard and put everything into it or it was never going to happen. ldquoSo Irsquom glad now, but there were a lot of dark days getting here.Jonrsquos formative years were spent in Peterhead. Educated at the local academy, he worked for his fatherrsquos roofing company and ndash like so many other young loons ndash also worked at the port.He even did work experience at the Buchanie!Despite all this, however, he harboured dferent ambitions ndash he wanted to see his name in lights.In an interview with the Buchanie in , he said: ldquoMy uncle lived in Hampshire and we used to visit him twice a year.

It is proposed that the centre would stay open two days a week, with the cost to be covered by slightly shortening opening hours at other recycling centres.Changes to kerbside services have also been proposed and, out of the two options consulted on, councillors are recommended to choose the option which will give residents a  litre non-recyclable waste bin to be emptied every three weeks.

He will be  next month but still visits schools and other groups to give slideshow presentations about his war experiences. Here we reproduce an interview with Don which was published in the Groat in June  to mark the th anniversary of the D-Day landings. Don flew to Normandy twice on D-Day, first dropping paratroops and then a glider with more troops and equipment.*WHEN the grey dawn broke over Normandy on June , , Don Mason had already made the first of his two contributions to the momentous events of D-Day. The young airman was part of the six-man crew of a modied Stirling bomber that had dropped  paratroops and their equipment at Ranville under cover of darkness. Heading for home, the Stirling came under fire from anti-aircraft guns on the French coast but ed unscathed to its base at Fairford in Gloucestershire. In the early evening the same crew were back over Normandy, this time towing a glider with more troops destined for the original dropping zone ndash and by this stage, almost  hours after the start of the Allies seaborne invasion, the full enormity of Operation Overlord was clear to see. \"It looked like a scene out of a nightmare,\" Don now recalls.Don had been fascinated with aeroplanes since his childhood in Worcestershire. As a young boy he once walked four miles with his family to see a travelling circus which featured a plane of Great War vintage Don could only gaze in wonderment as the flying machine entertained the crowds, and he resolved that one day he would fly an aircraft of his own. It was an ambition that would be fulfilled with the onset of World War Two.Although just  at the time of D-Day, Don had already clocked up numerous operations as a bomber pilot. He had been severely injured in a fighter attack over Germany in  and was declared medically unfit. After being reinstated on appeal, he was retrained as a radio observer.\"We had been in No.  Group Bomber Command,\" says Don, who moved to Thurso in the s but whose Caithness connection goes back to  when he flew Blenheims out of Wick. \"The whole squadron were suddenly lted out of Bomber Command and put into  Group, airborne support, which was a completely new role because wed never worked with paratroops or the like before.\"He was now in  Squadron, flying a modied version of the Stirling four-engined heavy bomber: the Mk IV troop-carrier and glider tug. \"We had to do a lot of exercises to get used to that aeroplane and to get used to dropping troops and towing gliders, which obviously was a dferent ball game altogether... it required a lot of dferent techniques.\"And it was necessary with any airborne group to drop them accurately in as tight a bunch as possible ndash therefore youd got to operate at a low height and also not get them scattered, so timing was important.\"There developed a formation flying technique which was called starboard echelon, so youve got two lines of aircraft flying parallel to one another. We had to practise these on group exercises, and a number of things happened: tow ropes broke, gliders went down in dferent places.\"On one group exercise we were flying along in this starboard echelon formation and there were literally hundreds of us ndash it wasnt just my squadron, it was a number of dferent squadrons ndash and suddenly an aircraft in the port line veered straight across into an aircraft in the starboard line and they both went down in flames. We lost two aircraft and two crews, just like that, on an exercise. Those are the things that stick in the mind.\"That tragic accident occurred on May , , in one of the last group exercises before D-Day. It was becoming clear that a big operation was imminent, one that would have major repercussions for the course of the war.\"Obviously we knew something was happening,\" Don says, \"because we were practising with troops and gliders and whatever. But we werent aware, of course, until the th of June when we were briefed originally.\"The invasion was scheduled initially for June  but was postponed for  hours because of the weather. \"Before that we had the indications of the airfield being closed off and we werent allowed to leave ndash we were shut in, the mail was censored.\"Paratroops of the th Airborne Division had been arriving at Fairford from the middle of May, and glider pilots were gathering there too as the security arrangements became ever tighter. The troops camped out on the airfield and Don remembers: \"One thing that struck me was that most of them were not very big men but the amount of equipment they carried was phenomenal, with kitbags full of gear strapped to their legs. The other thing that struck me as quite remarkable was they were all carrying water bottles full of white rum!\"Stirling LJ  took off from Fairford at . hours on June  in what was code-named Operation Tonga, with Don as wireless operator air gunner. On board were  fully equipped paratroops and the BBC correspondent Guy Byam.Dons chief recollection of that night flight over the English Channel is the sight of vast numbers of landing craft and other vessels in the assembly area ndash which was known as \"Piccadilly Circus\" ndash as they awaited the signal to head for the beaches.\"We were briefed to drop precisely at a time and place,\" he explains. \"It was important to get the troops on the ground in a bunch, not scattered. We were only over mid-Channel so we did an orbit ndash that was a bit dicey with so many aircraft about, all flying in one direction, and us crossing the stream. It all went to build up the tension.\"Finally, at . hours, the troops were released at Ranville, where they were to set up a homing beacon to aid following aircraft and also to assist in holding bridges over the nearby river Orne after the seaborne invasion had begun. Don remembers the red light in the fuselage turning to green on reaching the dropping zone. \"They all had to go together. Naturally some hesitated on the lip of the door ndash but they had all got to go.\"In the lead-up to the drop, there had been a close encounter between the Stirling and a group of paratroops released by a nearby Dakota. \"He released his troops and they came past us and we flew right through and didnt touch one,\" says Don.\"There was no flak at all over Normandy but then we had to fly in a northerly direction towards the Pas de Calais after dropping our troops, which was a feint because the Germans expected us to attack the Pas de Calais rather than anywhere . So we flew on a northerly track and we experienced flak around Le Havre and Dieppe, and then when we exited France towards Beachy Head we got some light flak on the coast, but there wasnt a great deal of resistance.\"It was a dferent matter altogether when Don and his crew-mates embarked on their second operation of D-Day, code-named Mallard.This time their Stirling had a Horsa glider in tow, containing more troops bound for the Ranville area along with an armoured jeep, four anti-tank guns and ammunition. Take-off time was . hours and the glider was to be released at ..Don remembers the scene vividly: \"The Channel was still littered with shipping but when we approached the Normandy coast it was a chaotic mass of ships and landing craft and smoke and explosions. It looked like a scene out of a nightmare, really. And, of course, as we went over land and approached the landing zone there was a lot more activity and a lot more flak.\"You couldnt tow a glider above  knots so it was fairly slow. You were low because you didnt want the glider to be shot down before it could get down to land. So obviously a big aircraft like the Stirling, with a ft wingspan or thereabouts, and a Horsa glider behind it, was a good target. In fact, all  of our aircraft were hit by anti-aircraft fire.\"Indeed one of those planes was shot down and crash-landed into the beachhead. The airmen were uninjured and got away for a while before being picked up by a German patrol.Subsequently the German position where they were held prisoner was captured and the crew ed to base.Reflecting on the chaos and confusion of D-Day, does Don recall feeling scared by what was happening around him  \"Well, everybodys scared ndash I dont care what anyone says,\" he replies. \"If youre not scared you dont perform, but its discipline and training that takes you through. You do reach a point of no .\"This is rude, I know, but its what I call s**t or bust. You go on and do it. Its a matter of accepting whats going on and just dealing with it, and doing the job youre supposed to do.\"Its not a question of bravery. Im very suspicious when people say, Oh, youre a brave man, or Youve got a lot of courage. You react to circumstances. Its a question of training and discipline and doing your job, without really recognising the probability of being killed.\"And I think to some extent the unorm protects you ndash you feel less vulnerable when youve got a unorm on and youre acting in that capacity. Everything happens very quickly.\"So Im very suspicious about bravery. I think we react more instinctively based on our training and our own iniduality. I dont think I could have coped with being an infantryman, for instance. I dont know how those chaps did it, because it must have been hell on earth for them.\"Don can look back on hundreds of hours of operational flying in a distinguished RAF career that included missions for the Special Operations Executive. And yet, despite the passage of years, he has never forgotten the thrill of his first tantalising taste of aviation.\"I fell in love with aeroplanes when I was a kid when Alan Cobhams Flying Circus came to visit our town with an old World War One aeroplane, and it was fascinating,\" Don says. \"He had a couple of old SEs [fighter aircraft] and you could have a flip round the field for  shillings ndash but of course  shillings was half a mans wage, so we just stood there with our mouths open.\"But the smell of hot engine oil, castor oil and fumes and what-not got into you. I was determined to try to get into it in some way, and of course thats what I did.\"He grew up in Kingswinford, Worcestershire, where his father ran a transport yard. Don trained as a motor mechanic after leaving school at the age of  and went on to qualy as a motor vehicle technician in the summer of . He was called up when war broke out in September of that year, having joined the volunteer reserve two years previously.After pilot training he enjoyed rapid promotion in Bomber Command and was an acting squadron leader when, ing from a mission near Hanover in May , his aircraft was attacked from below by an unseen German fighter plane. The bomb aimer, navigator, flight engineer and wireless operator were all killed but Don survived along with his mid-upper and rear gunner. Somehow he managed tohis crippled Stirling to an emergency landing field on the east coast of England despite suffering severe spinal injuries, damage to his left eye, lacerations around his head and a hole in his knee. He still bears the scars.Don spent eight months in hospital and was discharged as medically unfit. However, he refused to accept that his flying career was over and lodged an objection with the air ministry. Eventually his appeal was successful and he was reinstated, being retrained in the new discipline of radio observer.Operations in the aftermath of D-Day included Market Garden in September  ndash \"I went to Arnhem five times during that debacle,\" says Don ndash and he continued in Stirlings until .He and his first we Lillian were married in  and they had three children: daughter Elaine, now living in Ashby-de-la-Zouch, and sons Peter and Robert, who are both ex-Navy. Peter is in Denmark while Robert has a management post at Dounreay.Don ed to the motor trade after the war and became general service manager with a large garage group. He then spent more than  years working in further education, including a spell as head of the engineering department at a college of technology in Salisbury.Lillian died in  after many years of ill-health and in  Don moved to Thurso, coming out of retirement to work for eight years with local firm Ashley Ann. In  he was married for a second time, to Lybster-born Isabel, whose three daughters became part of the family. Isabel died in .Don still keeps in touch with three of his former crew-mates from those D-Day operations: Jim Wayman, the rear gunner, who lives in Dorset Eric Winter, flight engineer, in Coventry and Sid Harrison, the mid-upper gunner, who lives in Crewe. However, there was a particularly close and enduring bond between Don and his pilot, New Zealander Frank Cox.\"Although our families were half a world apart, they sort of grew up together ndash he came over [to this country] and I went to New Zealand,\" says Don. \"In  his daughter rang me from New Zealand and said Frank was dying of bowel cancer ndash he knew he was terminally ill and he hadnt got long to live. They had asked himthere was anything he really wanted, and hed said, Id love to see my old mate again. So I went to New Zealand and I was with him when he died.\"Now you cant explain relationships like that ndash they exist because of the worth of each one of you to the other in action. Its what they call camaraderie. Im still in touch with his family.\"As his thoughtsto the events of  on the Normandy beaches, Don agrees that D-Day was a turning point ndash \"theres no doubt about that\". But he adds: \"I regret to say I dont think weve learned any lessons. I dont think we should be doing what were doing now [in Iraq].\"As I look back I think first of all how lucky I was and I feel very sad about the people who gave their lives in that struggle. Its not really appreciated, the sacrices that were made both on the home front and in action. Its a sad reflection on society, I feel.\"We ought to be very thankful that were free, because thats what it was about. We should remember that this country wouldnt be freeit had been overrun by Nazi Germany.\"It was all for a cause. People may say, Oh, thats patriotic nonsense.

Sixteen-year old Mark Macadie, brother of Richard, made his first appearance on the bench.Academy started positively and Marc Macgregor twice tested Formartine keeper Kevin Main within the opening  minutes ndash first when he scuffed a shot straight at Main after being set up by a driving run down the right from Davie Allan, and then seeing an edge-of-the-box effort comfortably held.With Wick sitting deep in clear defensive blocks of four and five, the visitors took control after that and passed up several decent opportunities to take the lead.Archie Macphee found himself with a clear look at goal a quarter of an hour in but he somehow poked wide of Sean McCarthyrsquos left-hand post, and Rodger followed that moments later by guiding a shot wide of the same spot.After coming through that tough -minute spell, it was Academy who threatened next when, after a great spin in midfield by Grant MacNab, the ball came through for Macgregor whose shot was blocked by Main.The biggest cheer of the half came when Formartine assistant manager Russell Anderson, unhappy with what he felt was a series of unfair decisions against his team, was given a strict talking to by lineswoman Molly Alexander.Academy made a tactical switch with Craig Gunn and Davie Allan swapping wings and Gordon MacNab moving upfield to partner Macgregor up top. The move failed to pay idends as Wick couldnrsquot trouble the away defence throughout the half, Davie Allan coming closest to goal when he skewed his shot wide after a one-two with Macgregor.Formartine similarly struggled to break down a well-drilled home defence, but they smelled blood when Mackay was given a second yellow card in the last minute after a collision with substitute Scott Ferries.It was another Formartine sub who played a key role in the winner when Liam Burnett skipped past Craig Gunn to the by-line and cut back for the unmarked Rodger, who had the simple task of tapping it home.Wick Academy: McCarthy, M Steven, Farquhar, D Mackay, Manson, Henry, Gunn, Macgregor , D Allan, Gordon MacNab , Grant MacNab .

Following on from its four other adaptations of children’s classics, as well as pantomimes and avant-garde entries to the SCDA festival, the group has decided to stage a musical version of Arthur Ransome’s well-known book Swallows and Amazons.Developed for the famous Bristol Old Vic theatre, it tells the story of four rather straight-laced children on holiday in the s, given permission, in those pre-risk assessment days, to take a dinghy out onto the lake with their father’s warning not to be “duffers,” in other words, just to be sensible. They soon get their sense of adventure heightened when they meet the fierce Amazon pirates, otherwise the Blackett sisters, Nancy and Peggy. After a brief “battle of the boats” on the lake, they decide to wage another war against the Blacketts’ Uncle Jim, soon to be renamed “Captain Flint,” simply because he has spent the summer writing a boring book and isn’t a fun uncle any more. That, and a mysterious burglary, makes for an exciting, funny and absorbing play, with a surprise at every turn.The story is great fun, all the more so since the production uses a number of clever devices to turn everyday household objects into boats, rocks, weapons and everything  needed to tell the story. The cast, made up of actors ranging in age from  to  plus, have enjoyed creating their characters and learning the very catchy songs with this year#s musical director Glenys Hughes.Soyou want to see how a hall can be turned into a lake without flooding it, Deerness Dram Group encourage you to come along on February ,  or  and join in the fun!

The names of the companies involved have however, not been released.Minister for energy, connectivity and the islands, Paul Wheelhouse, said: “Issuing the Invitation to Tender marks the next stage of the process to award the new contract to operate the Northern Isles Ferry Services.“The contract will run for eight years, allowing us to build a strong working relationship with the successful bidder, and all the routes within the network are being tendered as a single bundle.“The Scottish Government remains fully committed to high quality ferry services to the Northern Isles. A key benefit of this new contract is the in-built flexibility, allowing the ferry services to be amended to reflect future changes in demand across the important sectors of the islands’ economies – tourism, fishing, food and drink, aquaculture and farming. Scottish Ministers will also retain control of all of important issues, such as fares and timetables, through the public service contract.“We are committed to a fair, open and transparent tender which aims to get the best possible deal for the communities that depend on these ferry services.”• Commenting on the issue, Northern Isles MSP’s Liam McArthur and Tavish Scott said: “The Scottish Government have finally issued the tender. The timescale is very tight indeed given the operator needs to be up and running the North Isles leline ferry services in  months’ time. It is essential that companies make constructive bids with improvements to the existing service. It must, in particular, recognise the growing freight volumes that are being exported south to the Scottish mainland.“So the tender bids must be properly assessed to ensure the service moves forward and not backwards.

I realise that the build up in favour of Michael Ross, trying to prove his innocence, has given the book another layer — whether it’s correct or not. I was shocked that there had never been a book on it, but I think that’s because it’s over such a long time period.”On the evening of June , , Bangladeshi waiter Shamsuddin Mahmood was shot dead at the Mumutaz restaurant in Bridge Street, sparking a full-scale murder investigation. Though questioned at the time, it was another  years before Michael Ross was apprehended for the crime. On June , , Mr Ross was convicted of murder at the High Court in Glasgow. Last year, he admitted attempts to escape HM Prison Shotts, where he is currently serving a -year sentence. This came shortly after news that high-profile lawyer Aamar Anwar would be representing him in an appeal case.“It’s an incredible story,” added Mr Clarkson.“I think it’s one of the most extraordinary true crime stories in UK criminal history.”Having already secured a book deal, Mr Clarkson has long-term aspirations of bringing the story to Netflix which he says, has shown interest in making a six-part series about the case. For now, he is trying to get folk who were involved in the case, or who knew Shamsuddin Mahmood or Michael Ross, personally, to come forward.“I’m really interested in speaking to witnesses who were in the restaurant, to Michael’s ex-girlfriend, and to anyone who knew Shamsuddin when he was living here in Orkney,” he explained.“To be fair to the people who are fighting for his innocence, they deserve a voice as well, and they will get a voice in my book, because what I’m trying to do is look at it from all angles.

She agreed to look at ways the Scottish Government may be able to help in identying potential options.Commenting after these exchanges, Mr McArthur said: “It remains a concern that Orkney continues to be without a local abattoir. I am very conscious that the longer this remains the case, the more dficult it will be to find a solution.“I welcome the cabinet secretary’s willingness to re-engage with the Council and other local stakeholders in Orkney in an attempt to make sure that all possible options are fully explored.

SSEN say these changes are aimed at improving the security of supply serving one of Orkney#s most remote islands, enhancing network resilience for the local community.The network operator has also installed new automation equipment on the network which allows SSEN’s teams to remotely operate switches, meaning power can be restored much quicker in the event of a power cut by remotely isolating the affected part of the network.Colin Rendall, SSEN’s Orkney Operations Manager, said: “The work on Sanday forms part of an ongoing commitment to target our investment towards improving network reliability in the areas with the greatest potential impact and improvement for our customers. We’re delighted to have completed this project on time and on budget, providing a more resilient, stronger electricity network for our customers on Sanday.“As a responsible network operator, we worked closely with archaeologists and ecologists to ensure all works were completed in a responsible manner, with careful consideration for the local landscape and environment. We’d like to thank the local community for their support and patience during these works.”This work, delivering on one of SSEN’s business commitments, means the main network line serving  properties from Stove to the north end of Sanday has now been upgraded — resulting in a more resilient network for SSEN’s customers living and working on the island.Mobile generation was deployed throughout the duration of the project to minimise disruption to the island community, ensuring schools, shops, hotels and local businesses stayed on supply whilst SSEN’s engineers undertook this essential work.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

He told the Ross-shire Journal: ldquoThis issue has rumbled on for some time and as the public interest shows, needs resolved quickly. I have written to Highland Councilrsquos director of community services, William Gilfillan, to ask that he attends a meeting with myself and other local community representatives.ldquoI am eager to get the community and the council round the table and thrash out the best way forward for Fighting Macrsquos monument. I have also written to the ward manager to request a site visit so I can see for myself the locally disputed health and safety concerns.More than  people have already signed a petition pressing Highland Council to take action. It states: ldquoThe time for excuses has passed, we have been let down far too often by officials.Its instigator, George Murray, who is leading moves for a business improvement district in the town, said he was delighted but not surprised by the public response.He said: ldquoThe council never understood the monument is more than just a local landmark with a nice view ndash in our area the MacDonald monument is a source of pride. The first man to ever make it from private to general in the history of the British army was a local from the Black Isle and people are proud of that history, why wouldnrsquot they be He said: ldquoWhat that shows is just how big the disconnect between the people and the council really is ndash I suspect its own officials are out of touch with the new chief executive, at least she listens.ldquoPeople are saying how they loved going up there as a child and how good it would be for education ndash the closure has really hurt the town.Dingwall Community Council chairman Jack Shepherd said support for the petition was a good indication of the strength of feeling towards getting the monument reopened.One who signed the petition, Iona McAuley,said: ldquoI used to love visiting the monument every Thursday evening with the Dingwall in Bloom group. I often take my children up to sit at the canons and tell them the story behind it. I have promised one day Irsquoll take them inside ndash hopefully in the near future.Another, Ireneusz Grochowski, said: ldquoIt would be great to see Dingwall from the top of the monument. I think it will be an amazing viewpoint for villagers and tourists.A Highland Council spokeswoman said: ldquoThe council has offered a community buyout and are waiting to hearthis is a proposal the group want to progress. We are following the findings of the health and safety report that highlighted a number of issues. Our insurance section has also advised us that the council would be unable to insure the monument for this public kind of use.The petition can be viewed at www.change.org p the-highland-council-open-the-hector-macdonald-monument-to-the-publicWhat do you think  Share your views by emailing newsdesk@spp-groupFriday  Jan  : AMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Tourists visiting Scotland may also have some fun by using the haggis emoji as part of their messages to friends and family at home.

It is too dangerous a prospect even to try to use as part of the UK Government’s negotiating strategy, whether with Brussels or MPs.However, the Labour leader is absolutely wrong in his refusal to meet Theresa May until she does so.Instead, Corbyn should immediately enter talks with the Prime Minister with that main aim in mind. If he manages to find a way to prevent a no-deal Brexit, he will have done his country a considerable service, saving the jobs and livelihoods of people across the country.Of course, May is the one who is currently in charge and she might be able to claim the credit, but the time for seeking political victories is over. The UK is in a deep and serious crisis and urgently needs everyone to work in the national interest.: Date set for MPs to debate Theresa May’s Brexit ‘plan B’In his letter to May yesterday, Corbyn correctly described a no-deal Brexit as “disastrous”, but he then claimed that “entering into talks while the clock continues to run down, and the threat of a chaotic ‘no deal’ increases, would be a reckless leap in the dark”.Talking about preventing a disaster is not reckless not talking about preventing a disaster is idiotically reckless.In her letter of reply, May made an error of logic when she argued that ruling out a no-deal was an “impossible condition because it is not within the Government’s power”.She said there were two ways to avoid a no-deal: for MPs to vote for a deal that had been agreed with the EU – meaning her deal, the one that suffered the biggest Commons defeat for a Government bill in modern history – or for Article  to be revoked and the result of the  referendum overturned. “I believe it would be wrong to overturn the referendum result,” she added. So it’s not “impossible” to prevent a no-deal, it’s simply contrary to a belief held by May.Postponing the date of Brexit would not overturn the  referendum result, but it would allow more time and mean Britain was not railroaded into a Withdrawal Agreement that even some of the most ardent Brexiteeers say would be worse than remaining in the EU.It would allow a second referendum to be held, in which the people of Britain could decide whether no-deal is better than May’s bad one orit’s time to call the whole thing off and remain in the European Union.: Brexit: Here’s how we can escape this highway to hell – Bill Jamieson©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4858420.1547760416!/image/image.jpg","title":"brexit article 50 could be rescinded hammond tells business leaders","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Chancellor Philip Hammond told business leaders that a no-deal Brexit could be #taken off the table# and Article  #rescinded#, according to a transcript of a leaked conference call.The transcript, obtained by a newspaper, details Mr Hammond speaking with  business leaders just hours after Theresa May lost the parliamentary vote on her Brexit deal.Mr Hammond began the call by explaining that the defeat raised two questions can Article  be revoked and “whether we can somehow take the option of no deal off the table”.The Chancellor said the EU would not consider extending Article  “unless or until we have a clear plan to go forward” and the “large majority” in the commons are opposed to a no-deal “in any circumstances”.He referred to a cross-party Bill, from Tory MP Nick Boles, which aims to force the government to extend Article a Brexit deal cannot be reached, according to the report.On Monday, MPs will vote on an amendment that will “pave the way for the Bill”, the paper said.Mr Hammond said: “What this group of backbenchers has been doing is seeking to find a mechanism by which the House of Commons can express that view in a way which is binding and effective.”The business leaders sought assurances from Mr Hammond, Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay and Business Secretary Greg Clark, who were also on the call, that a no-deal could be ruled out.Doug Gurr, head of Amazon UK, reportedly said ruling out a no deal would give “comfort” to global boards.But Mr Hammond said it would not be until next week that things became clearer.John Allan, chairman of Tesco and president of the CBI, askedtaking a no-deal Brexit off the table reduced the UK’s negotiating power with the EU.Mr Hammond said removing options had consequences.Mr Hammond added: “The government is not in control of this. I am only telling you what information I have been able to glean. My understanding is that because the bill being brought forward will simply and solely rescind the Article  notice, the legal opinion that they have is that that will meet the test that the European Court of Justice has laid down for unilateral recision of an Article  notice.

This is an issue which needs addressing and one which requires a Strategy, to be put in place.Whilst I like the idea of our local Assembly producing a strategy, it is vital that this statistic is reduced, drastically.”Ian’s we Beverley lost a family member over  years ago, through suicide. Beverley commented: “our family knows only too well the pain and heartache which family and friends endure, following such a tragic loss. For many years, you ask the question why.You also wonder,only they had engaged with someone, and that person had been able to offer some glimmer of hope, which resulted in them not pursuing their course of action. “There have been a number of suicides in our town recently and since the Samaritans are a wonderful organisation, who offer a tremendous telephone helpline service, we thought that it would be worthwhile to try and raise some funds, for this great charity.”The Samaritans’s vision is that fewer people die by suicide. They believe that it is time to look beyond the statistics and into the real lives of these people, so that they and others, can find ways, to reduce any unnecessary deaths. The Samaritans know that when people are in crisis, talking can help that person.Beverley added: “ the money raised at this event, can fund just one phone call to the Samaritans and the Samaritan at the other end of the line is able to provide some hope and results in one person not proceeding with their plan to take their own le,then this event will have been very worthwhile. “I would appeal to anyone who is facing dficulties, no matter what they are, to call the Samaritans on  . The Samaritans volunteers provide a listening ear,  days per year and you can call them any hour of the day, or night,”If you are able to help out in any small way, by baking a few scones tray bakes or by just coming along to have a cuppa and a scone and to give a donation, the organisers will certainly appreciate your kindness.IN PICTURES: Dromore High opens its doors to prospective pupils Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\""},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_auto,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8770151.1547557159!/image/image.jpg","title":"education  ","story":"Dromore High School recently welcomed prospective pupils to the school.

P children from Seymour Hill met with Mrs Jess before her birthday and found out more about her le, before sharing the story with the rest of the school.School Principal Mr Stephen Nimmons explained: “During World War Two Mrs Jess worked at a hem stitching factory near Dromore, where she worked on the machines and made fancy patterns around pillow cases and table cloths. “Every day she would have to cycle four miles to work and in the evenings four miles back home – rain, hail or snow. When the war was at its height, the factory started making unorms for the soldiers. From her house in Kinallen, she could see the lights of Belfast light up the sky when the German bombers came.“Just after the war, in , Mrs Jess married and went on to have three daughters. She has been a widow for  years and now has three children, six grandchildren and six great grandchildren. “Mrs Jess came to live in Seymour Hill on February ,  when there were no schools, shops nor churches built on the estate at the time. Seymour Hill Primary School was built by September  when the first pupils started the school. “She started working in the school when it opened in  and she worked in the school for over  years until her retirement.

Schoolchildren, cyclists, runners, older people and people with acute medical conditions immediately spring to mind, but in fact I think everyone should carry an ICE Card. People don’t think twice about wearing a seatbelt or cycling helmet, butyou had a serious accident you’d like your next of kin to know as soon as possible and you’d want the best care possible in a medical emergency. Almost everyone carries a wallet or purse with them so this is the ideal place to keep an ICE Card”.Chief Inspector Barney O’Connor commented: “PSNI is fully supportive of this initiative which is straightforward, practical and user-friendly and provides families reassurance that a loved one has personal information accessible in all emergency situations. Ideal for use whether you are a student studying away from home, an older person or someone with a medical condition.”The ICE Card ensures all the essential information is accessible in one place meaning it could help save lives, provide the best help and care, as well as make sure your next of kin can be contacted promptly.Information about medications and allergies helps ambulance personnel make better decisions about treatments they can give you and crucially in the case of heavy blood loss, it is important for emergency staff to know your blood type. In the case of people with conditions such asAlzheimer’s it can help a person who may be confused contact their family and avoid any unnecessary distress.The cards are initially being rolled out at PCSP and PSNI engagement events and through groups.

Why  Because De Gaulle called it right. England doesn’t belong in Europe, remains Atlanticist, attached to imperial preference, consumed by the ‘great-game’ of ide-and-rule, of balancing powers in Europe, never committed to “ever closer union”, focused on financial chicanery over agriculture and manufacturing. Was De Gaulle wrong  After the illusion of the Edward Heath era, Britain was only ever in Europe to disrupt it. That game is now up.Whether through opt-outs or rebates, through Maastrict and Lisbon, England’s subsequent conduct in Europe has been as drag-weight and chief saboteur. On reunication, Francois Mitterrand sought to bind Helmut Kohl’s Germany to deepen the European core. British diplomacy embraced Eastern Europe to widen, make shallow and reduce it to free-trading nations. England weighed in under Ireland’s Pat Cox’s cloak to undermine the Commission, the EU’s centre of gravity. And the Jacques Delors social-Europe of the s gave way, under English influence, to free-market liberalism.Things turned with the creation of the Euro. Decisions, increasingly, were taken by the Eurozone. The capacity to disrupt waned, the mileage for further meddling ran out. Whether Little-England or Global Britain, Brexit was the means to get out, to save its soul, or lose the sense of itself. Will England’s dficulty be Northern Ireland’s opportunity I hope so. Northern Ireland is a profoundly dysal polity. Alone in Europe we cannot elect thegovernment. We can’t vote Labour. Conservatives don’t seek a mandate here. We can’t elect the government and more importantly, we can’t chuck a bad government out.Voting in the Northern Ireland entity is like going into the bookies and being told you can back any horse you want – except the horses that might win. We can vote for losers all day long, but not winners. After  years of Northern Ireland, we remain a quarantined zone, the UK’s political slum. Local government is through a Stormont-based native-council, or what apartheid-era South Africans called a Bantustan. Well subsidised, maybe, but a Bantustan nonetheless.As a long-time campaigner to normalise politics within the UK, that avenue is long closed, over, dead. The Brexit vote has allowed us to throw the balls in the air. ‘Creative-chaos’, the policy wonks call it. Or Tony Blair’s prophetic words, to shake the kaleidoscope, and re-order our world. After a change of government, a hard Brexit will allow us to re-join Europe through a border-poll. A hard Brexit will allow us to join an independent Irish state, whose government we can, at least, elect. A border poll, for people like me, is a vote to get the vote # for the first time ever. I’d do that in a heartbeat.The Deltapoll online poll published in September  asked the question: “Imagine now that the UK decided to leave the EU. Under these circumstances how would you vote in a referendum on the constitutional arrangements of the island of Ireland ”More than half, %, said they would vote for a united Ireland, while % said they would vote for Northern Ireland to remain part of the UK. In the event of a ‘hard’ Border, % said they would vote for unity, with only % voting to remain in the UK.The most recent Lucidpoll, published in December found, in the event of a ‘No-Deal’ Brexit, % would vote for unity, with only % to remain in the UK.These polling figures are unparalleled since partition.A hard Brexit will hasten the break up of the UK in other ways. Scotland will have a second independence vote, a second penalty kick to drt off, politically, towards Scandinavia. Whether they have the cojones to do so remains to be seen, but my vote for creative chaos gives them the chance.Hard Brexit will see the City of London diminish. The apex of an imbalanced economy, the ‘City’ is, effectively, a criminal paradise facilitating money-laundering, tax-evasion and the myriad dodgy financial products of predatory casino capitalism. Economists like the ’s Larry Elliot believe the shock-treatment of EU withdrawal could force Britain to focus on developing the real, productive, manufacturing base required to re-balance the economy. What’s not to like Whether Little England or Global Britain, the UK is splintering.And we, locked in the Northern Ireland entity, may soon be admitted to the franchise.

The renaming of the site, taking place on Saturday, is especially poignant as it is where Emma and Clara stood for decades in protest at human rights abuses and in memory of those fatally injured and killed by plastic bullets. Speaking ahead of the unveiling Relatives For JusticeDirector Mark Thompson said: “What these two women have given our community and achieved is remarkable and as a community, a society, a country, we have been privileged and blessed to have had them there for us all.”Mark added: “And it is this very combination of their work, humanity and humility, which they bring to that very vocation of standing up for rights when and where required that makes them stand out even though they’d be the first to shy away from such public accolades. “Emma Groves and Clara Reilly were also instrumental in establishing Relatives for Justice , our NGO, in April , ensuring that a holistic support and care package, from professional therapeutic counselling support for trauma survivors partnering a rights based advocacy casework approach for addressing human rights violations, framed our work. We stand on the shoulders of giants in the sense that ordinary people both made extraordinary sacrices and did extraordinary work at great personal risk in extraordinary times. “Their motto was simple, in that they paraphrased Edmund Burke, in saying ‘That evil can only flourish when good people remain silent.’ They refused to stay silent,” he said. Paul O’Connor from the Pat Finucane Centre described Emma Groves and Clara Reilly as “two lives of resistance”.“Two women who were leaders in their community –and Clara still is,” said Paul. “Many communities would be lucky to have had one of these indomitable fighters. Belfast and beyond had two but for the saddest of reasons. We say that Emma was ‘blinded by a rubber bullet’ in November  but she was actually blinded by a British soldier, a Para, who deliberately fired a rubber bullet at her face. “There wasn’t even an allegation that she was a phantom gunwoman or nail bomber. She simply refused to turn off the rebel songs she was playing in her own home. At some level the British Government must have regretted that day because Emma Groves went on to campaign, highlight, expose, denounce and bear witness to the dangers posed by rubber and plastic bullets in the following decades.“It is totally appropriate that the site of the former Andersonstown RUC barracks, scene of so many pickets with Emma and Clara, should now be renamed to honour these two strong working class women who did so much for others. “The chattering classes can keep their MBEs and CBEs. Clara and Emma are and were real heroes. And Relatives for Justice is a fitting tribute to all those years of dedication and struggle.”NI Amnesty Programme Director Patrick Corrigan recalled first meeting Emma Groves and Clara in the early s when “in Emma’s living room in Andersonstown, over a cup of tea, she told her harrowing story”.“Wearing her trademark dark glasses, she recounted the day in  when she lost the sight of both eyes after being shot in the face at point-blank range with a rubber bullet. Like so many stories from our recent conflict, Emma Groves’ inidual experience was of one of unwarranted violence and unnecessary pain.Clara Reilly and Emma Groves founded the United Campaign Against Plastic Bullets to bring together families bereaved or injured by rubber and plastic bullets and to end their use here and everywhere.“Campaigning by Emma Groves and Clara Reilly shone a light on the human rights abuses and suffering inflicted through use of the weapons, and inspired many to stand with them. They would later help found Relatives for Justiceand inspire its model of mutual support and advocacy.”Ancient Order of Hibernians’ Sean Pender added: “We are proud to add our voice to recognise Clara Reilly and Emma Groves as the community that they worked so hard and long for dedicates the junction of Falls, Glen and Andersonstown Road in their honour.“These two remarkable women stood strong and never wavered in their quest for justice and peace. The AOH was proud to have honoured Clara with its highest award, the Seán McBride humanitarian award, several years ago in recognition of her long history of civil and human rights work.“It is entirely appropriate that there will be an area that will forever recognise the work of these two great women.”The Groves, Reilly and Livingstone families are lelong friends and played prominent roles in the campaign to ban plastic bullets. Belfast Media Group editor Robin Livingstone said: “It was a pleasure and a privilege to have known Emma and to know Clara. The line of placards on the road beside the barracks was and is a familiar August sight and my family can think of no better place and no better way to celebrate the inspirational lives of two amazing women.” The unveiling of Groves Reilly Corner will take place on Saturday January  at pm."},{"url":null,"title":"mps to vote on theresa mays brexit plan b on january 29 corbyn repeats call for","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

All those people have my support in seeking a judicial review.\"Backers of the plan maintained other options had been considered, but the lakeside location was the most appropriate because of its central and neutral location, with good public transport links.Southern Regional College has plans for five acres of replacement habitat to compensate for the construction of the low-rise building.

within the Government’s power” to guarantee no-deal, as this could be done only by securing Parliament’s approval for a withdrawal agreement or by overturning the result of the  referendum, something she was not prepared to do.The Labour leader has snubbed talks offered by Mrs May to parliamentarians from all sides of the Brexit debate following the humiliating rejection of her Brexit deal in the House of Commons on Tuesday.A number of Labour MPs defied a request from Mr Corbyn not to engage in discussions designed to find a plan which might command a majority in the House of Commons.All the other party leaders have now met the Prime Minister to discuss Brexit since she survived a no-confidence vote on Wednesday evening.Mrs May has indicated that she is sticking to the “principles” behind her Withdrawal Agreement, of taking control of money, borders and laws and having an independent trade policy.The EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier indicated that Brussels was ready to respond to any revision of Mrs May’s demands, telling MPs in Portugal: “If those red lines move, we will also move, immediately.”The starting point for any talks to break the Brexit deadlock must be to rule out a disastrous No Deal outcome.My letter to Theresa May... pic vQvUVmpk— Jeremy CorbynJanuary , MPs attending the talks in the Cabinet Office and Downing Street were shown a civil service assessment suggesting it would take more than a year to stage a second EU referendum, and Mrs May made clear that a public vote was not Government policy.The discussions took place as a new opinion poll showed a -point lead for staying in the EUa fresh vote was held.The YouGov survey for the People’s Vote campaign, conducted after Mrs May’s Brexit plan went down to a humiliating -vote defeat in the House of Commons, put Remain on % against % for Leave.Meanwhile, it was announced that military reservists have been put on standby for up to a year of permanent service in to handle the possible fallout from a no-deal Brexit.Reservists will make up around around % of the , armed forces personnel held at readiness ahead of the scheduled Brexit date on March .\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Eurosceptic Tory MPs Owen Paterson, Iain Duncan Smith, David Davis, Mark Francois and Steve Baker attend Brexit talks in Whitehall Speaking in the marginal Conservative seat of Hastings, Mr Corbyn dismissed the cross-party discussions as a “stunt” and said the PM seemed unable to grasp the fact that her Withdrawal Agreement was now “dead”.“She seems to be prepared to send the country hurtling towards a clf edge,” said Mr Corbyn.“To get a deal that can command a majority in Parliament, Theresa May has to ditch the red lines and get serious about proposals for the future.”Mrs May insisted her door remained open for talks with the Labour leader, but told him: “That is an impossible condition because it is not within the Government’s power to rule out no deal.”There was little sign of movement as a series of parliamentarians from both Leave and Remain camps emerged from talks conducted by Mrs May herself, Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay and Cabinet colleagues Michael Gove and David Lidington.Number  said that the Prime Minister was “in listening mode” and wanted to hear views and opinions from every side of the debate before drawing up the Plan B which she is due to present to Parliament on Monday.The PM’s motion, and any amendments tabled by MPs, will be the subject of the latest in a series of crunch Brexit votes in the Commons on January .The one-page document shown to MPs, entitled “referendum timings”, said that seven months would be needed to pass primary legislation paving the way for a new poll, followed by  weeks for a question to be tested and selected, six weeks for secondary legislation, six weeks to designate lead campaigns and  weeks for the campaign.But former attorney general Dominic Grieve, a supporter of the People’s Vote campaign, said the suggested timetable was “simply wrong”.“If Parliament wishes to have a referendum and the Government is prepared to facilitate it, it could be carried out swtly and within a limited time extension of Article ,” he said.“It is neither helpful nor right to have misleading information of this kind put out.”\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Caroline Lucas said the Prime Minister showed little sign of shting from her Brexit position Emerging from Downing Street, Democratic Unionist Party leader Arlene Foster said the issue of the Irish backstop needed to be dealt with “in a very clear way”Brexit negotiations were to make progress.Green MP Caroline Lucas said the Prime Minister had shown little sign she was ready for compromise on the Withdrawal Agreement she reached with Brussels in November.“I’m not convinced she’s willing to loosen any of the red lines she’s set herself,” Ms Lucas said. “She still thinks it’s going to be possible to tweak this deal sufficiently to get the MPs that voted against it to swing behind it – I remain pretty sceptical about that.”Speaking after a meeting with Mr Lidington, Labour MP Yvette Cooper said: “The most important thing now is that the Government actually listens and it doesn’t just think that a defeat that was that huge can simply be dismissed.”She and fellow Labour MP Hilary Benn said they had attended in their capacity as parliamentary committee chairs.Labour’s former prime minister Tony Blair said Mr Corbyn was wrong to refuse to meet Mrs May.“If, in a moment of national crisis, the Prime Minister asks the Leader of the Opposition to come and talk, of course he should,” Mr Blair told BBC Radio ’s Today programme.Conservative chairman Brandon Lewis accused Labour of “trying to frustrate and avoid Brexit”.Jeremy Corbyn needs to get off the fence. The country doesnt want chaos. It wants to come together again and a Peoples Vote is crucial for that. pic KZgRTNzby— Vince CableJanuary , Sir Vince Cable, who spoke with Mrs May on Wednesday evening, accused Mr Corbyn of playing “party political games” and said the Liberal Democrats would no longer join Labour in no confidence votes in the Government.“I believe other parties are taking the same view,” the Lib Dem leader said. “It’s time Mr Corbyn got off the fence and made his position plain.”Lib Dems said they used a meeting on Thursday to press the case for a second referendum.“The Government now needs to get serious about making signicant changes to their own position,” a spokesman said. “The ball is ultimately in their court.”A Conservative Right To Vote campaign for a second EU referendum was launched by MP Phillip Lee, who claimed support for a so-called People’s Vote was “growing fast” among his colleagues on the Tory benches."},{"url":null,"title":"ordeerrrrr john bercow finds international fame with all eyes on brexit","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We could all learn so much from him.Cllr Walker said he hoped those who targeted Ryanrsquos cookie box would realise the error of their ways and stop again outside the young manrsquos home to pay for the food they took.ldquoWhat happened in the dead of night outside Ryanrsquos home is a sad reflection on those responsible. If they do not pay for the goods. I hope they can be identied so the authorities can have a word, he continued.Cllr Walker, who, along with his Rowallane counterpart Terry Andrews, organises several charity events each year, hopes that his  itinerary will allow him to raise some for Ryan which he can donate to a charity of his choice.He added: ldquoRyan is a shining example to us all. He works hard to help others and it is deeply upsetting that there are those in the community who would target of all things an honesty box.

England is to introduce an opt-out system in .Mrs Taggart said: ldquoWe need to talk about the people who have lost their battle for an organ. We need to put faces to these tragedies and we all need to make sure our families know about our wishes.Mr McManus was buried last Thursday in his home town after he died from multiple organ failure at the Freeman Hospital in Newcastle Upon Tyne on December .Despite being put on a ldquosuper-urgent transplant list just days before Christmas, he succumbed to his illness as he waited for a suitable heart to become available.A successful mechanical engineer who travelled the world with his career, Mr McManus became seriously ill in .After six months of investigations, doctors diagnosed that Mr McManus had suffered cardiac arrest.A heart transplant was ruled out as he was too ill at the time, but doctors did all they could for him by fitting a mechanical pump in anticipation of a new heart.Despite being born with a congenital heart defect known as Transposition of the Great Arteries, the former De La Salle High School student had already defied the odds to live a normal le up until then.Raised in the Colmcille Road area of Downpatrick, Mr McManus ed home to be close to his father Tom mdash his mother Colette had passed away earlier mdash sisters Lisa and Roisin and their families.While he waited on the standard transplant list for three years, Mrs Taggart said that her brother bore his illness well.ldquoTommy was unable to work or travel and relied heavily on us for basic day to day things like shopping, cleaning, etc, she said.ldquoHis mobility was extremely limited through fear of over-exertion. Still, he did everything he could to aid his recovery.Tommy and his family were so thankful to the medical team at the Freeman Hospital for saving his le in  that they raised over pound, in order ldquoto pay back the care they had received.Mrs Taggart says that her family know that the doctors ldquodid absolutely everything in their power to keep Tommy alive and had promised that he would have had his heart transplant before Christmas.ldquoThere is a typical wait of between - days for a heart and we just donrsquot know why one didnrsquot become available. But it didnrsquot and his lungs and kidneys began to fail as a consequence of his heart failure, said Mrs Taggart.Despite the efforts of the ldquophenomenal medical team, Tommy required dialysis and ventilation to keep him alive.The medical team were unable to get him breathing on his own again and he was taken off the transplant list.ldquoWe had seen Tommy go through some much and come out of the other side that it never crossed our minds that he wouldnrsquot get a heart, said Mrs Taggart.She and her family now know from personal experience just how hard it is to make a decision to donate a loved onersquos organs.ldquoDue to Tommyrsquos condition, he was only eligible to donate his corneas, she explained.ldquoWhen we were approached about this, my fatherrsquos immediate reaction was, lsquoNo, hersquos been cut into enoughrsquo, despite the fact that Tommy campaigned so passionately about organ donation, and we all knew his wishes.ldquoThankfully myself and my sister were able to be Tommyrsquos voice, and he was able to give one final and very precious gt to someone.ldquoWe desperately hope that the subject of organ donation can be normalised, and that a change in legislation and attitude is seen very soon. We are just so sorry that this change will come too late for Tommy.Mrs Taggart paid a loving tribute to her only brother: ldquoTommy was a fiercely independent, successful and outgoing young man. He was extremely intelligent, loved technology and was a fountain of knowledge.ldquoNo matter where he travelled, he made friends instantly.Mr McManus is survived by his father, sisters, brothers-in-law Bryon and Kieran, nephews Daniel, Paul and Matthew, nieces Emma and Erin, great-nephews Jay and Donal and great-nieces Chloe and Freya.bull To join the NHS organ donation register, go to www.organdonation.nhs.uk.register-your-details.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Finnebrogue to create 90 new jobs with new food ranges  ","story":"THE success of innovative Downpatrick firm Finnebrogue Artisan is set to continue with the opening of a new ultra-modern poundm vegan and vegetarian factory.The latest signicant investment by the award winning company mdash which is one of the districtrsquos leading employers mdash will support  new jobs with the new facility capable of turning over poundm a year.The latest investment by the company is in response to increasing demand for vegetarian and vegan alternatives, with the ersication illustrating the firmrsquos willingness to respond to changing trends across the food industry.The artisan food producer, which has revolutionised the bacon and ham market in the past  months by launching the first mass-produced nitrite-free alternatives, has invested poundm as it looks to step up its meat-free offerings.Finnebrogue has been producing vegetarian and vegan products for three years, but the opening of a brand new factory marks a signicant up-scaling of the firmrsquos meat-free production.The companyrsquos managing director, Brian McMonagle, said Finnebrogue prided itself on providing consumers with ldquodelicious, innovative products.ldquoGiven the increasing demand for vegan and vegetarian alternatives, this new factory was the obvious next step in our extraordinary growth, he continued.ldquoWe are determined not to stand still and are always looking to make food the best it can possibly be, without being bound by the way itrsquos always been done.

An engineer explained that a conductor on a transformer, which had probably been smouldering due to a layer of snow or ice, caught fire.Carryduff, the highest point between Belfast and the Mourne mountains, had falls of up to six inches and drts were reported as deep as one and two feet in some areas.Ballynahinch had several inches fall inside an hour and this worsened as snow continued to fall.

That is absolutely true of the Downe. First class facilities are nothing without first class staff and at the Downe we are very lucky to have both, she said.Mrs Hanlon remarked: ldquoHospital staff are clearly eager to embrace the challenge of expanding services and I have no doubt that in the years to come the Downersquos reputation as a first class facility with passionate, professional staff will see services grow and develop further..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Head blasts at ‘disparity’ over student allocations  ","story":"A GRAMMAR school principal has hit out at education chiefs for not equally planning for an expected increase for post-primary students.Peter Dobbin, principal of Assumption Grammar School in Ballynahinch, says that the Department of Educationhas addressed the need for additional students in Belfast, Bangor and Londonderry by awarding some schools additional places, but has failed to address the local need for  .He has accused DENI of treating some areas in Northern Ireland dferently to others and has urged the Department to address the local problem sooner rather than later.ldquoWe know that this is a major issue waiting to happen, said Mr Dobbin.ldquoStatistics clearly show that there is a signicant number of extra girls to be accommodated across our vast catchment area and I will be left with very angry parents and pupils who are extremely unhappy with not being allocated Assumption Grammar as their preferred choice.ldquoThis would be understandableall schools in all areas were being treated the same, but this is not the case.ldquoHow can some areas be addressed proactively and then other areas neglected  This disparity and the disrespect towards the parents and children in our local area, compared to other areas, is appalling.Statistics from the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency show that an increase of an average of  children in this age group in the Down district annually over the next ten years.However, last night a DENI spokesperson said that it had reviewed the anticipated shortfall and that no additional places for next year were needed in Ballynahinch.ldquoAt the end of the admissions procedure in ,  places remained available in Ballynahinch,  of which were in the denominational sector.

But no unionist politicians have been invited – a move the organisers claim is designed to rebalance the “misrepresentation” of public opinion here.At a launch event in Belfast yesterday, co-organiser Niall Murphy said representatives of “civic unionism” would be participating in  discussions and insisted the conference was open for everyone to attend.“Political unionism has set its face against rights, against progressive, inclusive politics and has misrepresented the outcome of the referendum. This jurisdiction voted to remain and that is not being appropriately represented,” the Belfast-based solicitor said.Mr Murphy, who launched the event alongside political commentator Brian Feeney, denied the movement is a front for a pro-united Ireland agenda.But UUP chief whip Steve Aiken MLA, who voted remain in the referendum, has questioned the motives of those behind the event.“The refusal of the organisers to invite unionist politicians is indicative that they have a pre-ordained agenda. It is disappointing that they have closed minds on an issue which will affect all of our people, unionist and nationalist alike,” he said.“Whether they like it or not, they will have to share this piece of land with their unionist neighbours, but that obviously doesn’t fit with their narrative. It doesn’t hold out much hope for the futurethat’s their mindset.”A TUV spokesperson said “all fair minded people” would see the conference as “a nationalist event designed to promote a nationalist agenda”.But stressing that “political unionism has now adopted a pro-Brexit position”, the organisers of the conference insist they are “encouraging all sections of opinion which are committed to a rights-based society and shared future to participate in the event.”PSNIseized files to Jamie Bryson Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingN.I. issued with severe weather warning - ice and wintry showers due in next  hoursN.I. snow could arrive sooner than originally thought - Arctic blast could strike this weekendThis photograph from an N.I. railway station has sent Twitter into meltdownN.I. snow to arrive tonight and tomorrow - subzero temperatures to reach as low as -degCEmotional tributes to two men killed in Mournes falls          ..

At that point he said: “In the end you can always do a deal with an Ulsterman, but it’s not the way to run a modern, sophisticated society.”In a statement, DUP MP Gregory Campbell responded: “Standing up for the national interests of this country and working to get the best deal for all is the very antithesis of sectarianism. Ken Clarke should reflect on what he has said.”He added: “Ken Clarke, very unfortunately for him, finds himself increasingly out of step with the vast majority in his own party as well as the country. “Instead of swiping at other parties, Mr Clarke would be better served in working to find solutions, with members across the House of Commons during this crucial time to get the best deal for the United Kingdom, that would be a more fitting tribute and better accolade for the Father of the House.” Driver killed his elderly mother in crash tragedy and solicitor Niall Murphy, of Irelands Future - a collective of Irish citizens living in the region seeking to highlight the potential impact of Brexit on their rights and livelihoods, which is organising the Beyond Brexit gathering in Belfast.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The site will potentially generate up to  new work positions across management, supervisory, warehousing staff and apprenticeship roles.Speaking of the new facility and what it will bring, Mr Rattenbury said: ldquoWe are delighted that our vision of a lsquoone stop shoprsquo for our customers is being realised and having a  hour, seven day a week co-packing facility in the heart of Wales, is a game changer for our industry. We can now offer our customers a streamlined product supply chain package by integrating their co-packing requirements with the grouprsquos warehouse and transport subsidiary companies.ldquoLogistically, this works out to be more cost effective overall, but also lowers the carbon footprint on the transportation of food products, which is something we are passionate about.Wild Water Group has a current annual turnover of poundm and Mr Rattenbury believes the company can increase that figure by a further poundm within  months and then reach poundm within two to three years.The project is backed by a pound. million investment from Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking and the Development Bank of Wales and has secured Welsh Government funding under the new economic contract.Using a similar business model to the grouprsquos other three sites in Merthyr Tydfil, Llanishen and Cardf Bay, the first phase of development will be the conversion of available space into a large ambient open plan co-packing facility, which will be operational early November  to meet festive season demand.During the first quarter of , Wild Water Group will move the entire Cardf Bay co-packing facility to Aberbargoed, once freezer facilities, production lines and machinery are in place.The company will then continue services such as frozen to frozen storage, bagging, over wrapping, sleeving and tray sealing, as well as the full spectrum of print labelling applications required under the Food Safety Technicalspecications.Economy Secretary Ken Skates said: ldquoThis project will not only see a successful, growing Welsh business create an additional  jobs, it will also create a new strategic hub and facility for both large and small food and drink businesses across the region to pack or store products themselves. This could, in turn, open up new markets for those businesses ndash so Irsquom excited about what this means not only for Wild Water Group and Aberbargoed, but for the region more widely.ldquoIt shows that both our Economic and Food and Drink Action plans are delivering what we had hoped ndash jobs, prosperity and sustainable growth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

US officials said at the time that North Korea had cancelled the session.A White House official, while not confirming plans for Fridayrsquos meeting, said ldquoa lot of positive things are happening related to North Korearsquos denuclearisation.The official said Mr Trump and Kim Jong Un had established a ldquogood relationship and that US-North Korea conversations were continuing.The official said the two sides were ldquoworking to make progress on the denuclearisation goal and that Mr Trump ldquolooks forward to meeting Chairman Kim again at their second summit at a place and time yet to be determined.The talks had stalled over North Korearsquos refusal to provide a detailed accounting of its nuclear and missile facilities that would be used by inspectors to very any deal to dismantle them.The North has been demanding that the US lt harsh sanctions and provide it with security guarantees before it takes any steps beyond its initial suspension of nuclear and missile tests.Kim Jong Un expressed frustration in an annual new yearrsquos address over the lack of progress in negotiations.But on a visit to Beijing last week, he said North Korea would pursue a second summit ldquoto achieve results that will be welcomed by the international community, according to Chinarsquos official Xinhua News Agency..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Second US-North Korea summit the focus of Washington talks article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  comments        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg --\"Most popularMost commentedLoading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos nowMost popularCommentedLoading...Read more         ,CommentsSorry, an error occurred.Thank YouYour complaint has been sent to the site administrators.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentContact UsPhoto SalesNewsquest PrintingAdvertiseArchiveSite MapAnnouncementsLeapExchange and MartDatingTerms  ConditionsPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyManage ConsentTerms of AdvertisingContributor TermsDiversity StatementIpsoregulatedThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ulster Business takes a further look A few years back, the options were fairly limited for NI firms when it came to venture capital funding.Now, between private funds, investors and those backed by Invest NI, the options have widened signicantly for companies – especially those which are high-growth – to seek a cash injection, and get to the next level.Jayne Brady is partner at the Bank of Ireland Kernel Capital Growth Fund NI.“We have been operating in Northern Ireland for five years, and in that period we have seen a growing momentum in the Northern Ireland ecosystem,” she told Ulster Business.“We have  companies in our portfolio, and have invested in eight companies in Northern Ireland as part of that.”And a lot has changed in the last few years, particularly with the sheer number of avenues in which businesses can find access to funding.“There wasn’t an availability of local funds, and it was dficult to get that level from GB, because you needed to reach a certain level.”And where is the investment now going in Northern Ireland  “It’s very strong sectors of expertise, and there is a big FDI element – medical technology, cyber-security. It’s not created in isolation, andan availability of skills.”“More recently, there has been more external investors. We would co-invest, and there is a level of investment from outside players – there are good opportunities.”Jayne says that Kernel Capital tracks investments, and the level and size of deals here has grown. A lot of that has been down to the growth of the Knowledge Economy – which has expanded seven or eight-fold in the last few years.For businesses looking towards funds like Kernel, a typical deal size is from around £m up to £m.One of the largest investments was secured by B-Secur, which has created a biometric technology which uses the human heartbeat to unlock everything from finance and healthcare through to cars and buildings.The company, based at Catalyst Inc, secured £.m from investors including Kernel Capital and ADV.For Jayne, Kernel is looking at companies with turnover of more than £m, which have the ability and scope to be scaled.“We see investment where there is a scaling potential. We look at companies where we are generating £m plus –– which you can scale rapidly, or those with a deep IPfocus. Some companies in services won’t have that level of scale.”Then, there’s the Growth Finance Fund, and Growth Loan Fund II, which provide a total of £m of funding for Northern Ireland’s SMEs.The two new funds are being managed by WhiteRock Capital Partners, a homegrown fund manager set up in  to manage the first Growth Loan Fund, which has committed £m of loans to more than  businesses over the last six years.There’s also the Growth Finance Fund. That will see loans from £, up to £m going to growing businesses. It’s also the first time the British Business Bank has invested in a fund aimed solely at supporting Northern Ireland businesses. The latest figures from the Irish Venture Capital Association, which covers businesses across the island, show venture capital funding has slumped, with a fall-off in major deals and seed funding.Investment was down by almost a third to €min the first nine months of the , confirming a signicant slowdown on .The drop-off in cash accelerated during the year, with the amount raised by tech firms and startups in the last three months just half what it was a year earlier.The figures suggested that the largest segment of funding to see a decline is in deals was above €m .But a Northern Ireland report by Catalyst Inc, published last year, showed companies raised over £m in equity capital in .Elsewhere, flying the flag for venture capital in Northern Ireland for more than  years is Crescent Capital.Run by Colin Walsh, former CBI chairman in Northern Ireland, it’s invested in a raft of the most successful and leading companies here.That includes Andor Technology and Belfast-based biotech firm Fusion Antibodies, which is based at Springbank Industrial Estate in the west of the city.According to Jayne, it’s not just about backing Belfast firms, or FDIs setting up shop in the heart of the city.“We look towards the strong sectoral focuses, and outside Belfast as well. We are very conscious to go to our customers.” That includes holding regular open events across areas such as Newry, Co Tyrone and Londonderry. “We are very open to meeting any companies, and our door is open,” she says.But will Brexit play a part in the future of venture capital funding in Northern Ireland  “We need to be cognisant of any particular indication of any change in regulation,” Jayne says.“From our perspective, because we invest in deep tech, they are somewhat removed from that direct impact.” Elsewhere, there are other revenue streams which firms can look towards, especially when it comes to working capital.That includes Upstream – an alternative finance company run by Judith Totten, which specialises in funding for SMEs.“As Northern Ireland’s largest independently owned and managed provider of working capital, Upstream works collaboratively with organisations’ existing lenders to provide additional capital in a more flexible way to help businesses thrive,” sales director Alan Wardlow says.“Businesses come to us for our responsiveness – our formal credit approvals are achieved in days rather than weeks or months. Upstream has long standing relationships with many local venture capitaland private equity providers as well as the ious Invest NI-backed loan funds and we work closely together to provide solutions for business owners across Northern Ireland“We recently incorporated a trade finance solution into our product range to bridge the gap for organisations who require additional growth funding, quickly, to deliver orders beyond their current capability. This funding is proving incredibly popular alongside our long-standing invoice finance option which gives organisations the ability to release funds against their debtor book thereby freeing up cash flow for businesses to seize growth opportunities as they become available.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/ob_1.jpg","title":"leaders in business owen brennan","story":"Posted on Wednesday  January  by Ulster Business Owen Brennan, Devenish Nutrition In , Devenish Nutrition was an agri-feed business, established in Fermanagh, with around two dozen staff.In the  years since its takeover, Owen Brennan, executive chairman with the now global company – which has its headquarters in Belfast – has grown the business from a firm with annual revenues of £m, to an international business now doing that in a week.“By the time we got there it was well-established for over  years. The shareholders were looking for somebody to take the business to the next stage.“While the company was smaller at the time, they were really keen to see it grow from the Northern Ireland base.“The business has grown substantially. At that time, the Northern Ireland revenues were over % of the entire sales. Today they are less than %.”However, Northern Ireland revenues are around five times larger than when Owen took over the business.Devenish has round  staff – across  nationalities, which is roughly the size of the entire workforce  years ago. But it counts Northern Ireland as its main base, and remains a key element of the business. The company sells into more than  countries.“The most important metric is that we spend around £m a year on innovation projects,” he said.“The big focus in  was seeing a niche opportunity for a specialised, innovative nutrition product, full-service business.”It deals in animal feed supplements – specialised high-value nutrients in a small pack. It also makes diets for small animals at the early stage of their lives, along with specialised nutritional products.And Owen says while the public hears about the negative impact of livestock, the positive impact isn’t heard.In his time at Devenish, Owen has been handed several accolades, including winning the BelfastCup  at the Ulster Farmers’ Union annual dinner.  “I’ve always taken those awards very seriously, and it’s the reflection of the work of a lot of people. I might happen to be the person that ends up being the recipient, but that’s only possible because of the success of the overall business.”He says, while sounding like a cliche it’s “genuinely a team effort”. “Part of my interestis that I see the parallels between sport and business.“Who is the most important person on the rugby field … actually, it’s everybody. If you have one weakness in that  or match-day .“If you take that analogy into the business area. I was once asked by a mentor, who did I think were the most important people in the business at that time. I said I didn’t know.“But he said ‘the telephone receptionist and the lorry driver’. He said those two people, between them, have by far and away the most customer contact in our business. I’ve never forgotten that. And  years later, I find that to be true.”On Brexit, Owen says the position among businesses has remained consistent, with a majority opposed to the UK leaving the EU.“The three things which have emerged to date include the diminution in the value of sterling – that has been a very bad thing for business, generally.“… the second effect has been uncertainty… le is uncertain, as is business. But anything that adds a large uncertainty in a business environment is not good.“The third is maybe a little harder to define. I think the debate around this leaves a lot to be desired. “People have said to me that the focus on immigration has made a lot of people, that would be described in those debates as immigrants, feeling very uncomfortable.“We are an international business, and had got to used to thinking of that international dimension as a good and wholly positive thing, so to hear a debate with that emphasis, with that sort of connotation for people of an international background.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/gibsn_1.jpg","title":"outlook  the year ahead has forecasting ever been harder","story":"Posted on Wednesday  January  by Ulster Business Professor Neil Gibson, chief economist at EY Ireland says in two decades in the field, predicting the future has never been harder Forecasting is always a challenge but, in  years as a professional economist, I have never had less confidence in predicting the year ahead than I do now.  At the time of writing, the nature of the UK’s departure from the EU remains unclear. Estimates of the economic impact of ious exit scenarios ranged from -% in a catastrophic exit .Notably, all of the iants suggested a loss of GDP in the UK, though it also worth noting that GDP means virtually nothing to most of the voting public.  The prediction of % loss in house prices in the disorderly scenario is much more likely to focus minds. Moreover, Brexit is far from the only uncertainty ahead.  Trade wars are continuing, oil prices are slumping and stock markets are incredibly volatile. Many of the global warning lights have flicked from green to amber and it is entirely possible that  will be a very challenging year indeed. Despite the gloomy introduction, the base case forecasts continue to suggest a year of modest growth ahead. EY predicts a small contraction in the local labour market but most other forecasters disagree. This base case projection assumes a transition period is in place and that a global slow-down does not materialise:  two rather large assumptions to make. The optimism is partly borne out of what has been a remarkable period of job growth in Northern Ireland. The workforce jobs measure reports , net additional jobs have been created in the year to Q . This continues a trend that started in  and has seen the overall employment level rise by , since Q . This is despite very modest levels of recorded GDP growth and, finally, it has taken the region back above the total employment levels reached in . This performance is a credit to businesses throughout the region as, remarkably, all council areas have enjoyed job growth and all sectors outside of public administration have increased their headcounts since Q . The consumer is, perhaps, the most intriguing aspect of the economy heading into . Inflation is running very close to UK average salary increases, which means that, on average, people are not getting richer. However, overall consumer spending has been rising – partly because there are more people in work and partly because people have been willing to run down savings or take on debt.The data shows NI to be particularly vulnerable in this regard, with higher proportions of people without savings . The fragile state of the economy means,  probably, that interest rate increases are unlikely, especially with falling oil prices easing inflation, but the impact of a change in consumer sentiment and spending behaviour would trigger a marked slow-down. Consumer confidence measures are inherently volatile but there are reasons to be concerned. Confidence surveys have been edging downwards – the UK credit conditions surveys suggest a tightening amongst lenders in  and savings ratiosare at historic lows. Consumer trends should be watched closely in early  as they will prove critical to overall economic performance. TRENDS TO WATCH IN There are a number of economic trends I would expect to see in :Continued retail transformation: it has been a dficult time on the high street as consumers move increasingly to on-line shopping. A number of high profile closures have taken a toll and we expect this pattern to continue.  This will, as all periods of change do, create winners and losers and will  place pressure further on an outdated rates system that relies heavily on retailing. Embracing digital: the potential that new forms of technology presents has been clear for some time. Articial intelligence, blockchain, software as a service , data analyticshave long been touted as potential game changers. There has been a marked pick-up over the last  months in firms making investments in these areas. Maturing of the technologies and a tighter labour market are factors in these trends and we expect that to continue in . Pockets of growth: regardless of the wider economic conditions, there will continue to be pockets of very fast growth throughout Northern Ireland. The pipeline of professional services inward investment remains strong, in particular with US firms seeking talent a noticeable trend. Media and film continues to boom and, even on the high street, there is no sign of a slowdown in the proleration of coffee shops, personal wellbeing businesses and take away outlets. Volatility: share prices and exchange rates are likely to be incredibly ‘spikey’ given the turbulence in the world economy. Summary – beating the forecasters The Northern Ireland economy’s labour market has surprised me over the past  months. I hope that it continues to outperform expectations in .  Hopefully, there will be a transition period in place with a clear roadmap to a future free trade agreement between the EU and UK which may prevent the scale of slow-down I worry may be coming. While on the subject of wish-casting, let us hope that the Executive is back and operating too in . If all these pieces fall into place then next year’s outlook for  will be much easier to write.

He’s just taken over at the helm of the internationally renowned next generation science park which is home to  innovative knowledge based companies, who are employing more than , engineers, researchers, entrepreneurs and executives, across four locations – and has his sights firmly set on making Northern Ireland a leader in two key innovative areas of tech business.Taking on the role as chief executive of Catalyst from stalwart Professor Norman Apsley OBE, just two months ago, plans are under way to build on the foundations of an organisation which has an estate of , sq ft of agile workspace filled with innovative companies. Catalyst leads the way in innovation and entrepreneurship by supporting the creation and growth of innovation companies in Northern Ireland.“We have a rightful place in leading the world. We aren’t going to follow anybody. Let’s get back to leading the world,” Steve tells Ulster Business.“I am going to take the foundation that Norman left and look at how we leverage that by a signicant factor – in terms of economic activity and dynamism for Northern Ireland.“We need deeper, more strategic partnerships with key institutions. It is through collaboration we can do something to scale and put Northern Ireland on a world map.”Catalyst is the thriving, beating heart of Northern Ireland’s booming technology sector and leading the way in educating and preparing companies and young people for the changing world of work through the impact of the ‘Fourth Industrial Revolution, which is seeing the impact of new technologies impacting on le, work and society.Formerly known as the Northern Ireland Science Park, Catalyst is an independent not-for-profit organisation operating across the region. It provides agile workspace across four locations – the main site in Belfast’s Titanic Quarter, the Innovation centres in Londonderry, and Ballymena and most recently opened Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub, a co-working space dedicated to the fintech sector in Belfast city centre, which is a partnership with Danske Bank.“The business model we have had for the first  years was the perfect model for that period. We need a new model for the next. We are identying a simple, but ambitious strategy – building on the existing foundation.”Part of the strength of Catalyst is in attracting big international firms, such as Citi, in close proximity to businesses at the very birth of existence. Steve says as a result, “accidental encounters” lead to relationships and outcomes which otherwise, would not have happened.It also plays host to Queen’s University’s leading research body, ECITwhich itself is home to CSIT .Some of the leading thinkers based at the site include ECIT’s Professor Maire O’Neill – one of the youngest ever engineering professors at Queen’s, one-time UK Female Inventor of the Year and a leading researcher. “You have US companies looking at why would they want to move to Northern Ireland – they want to meet Professor O’Neill. She’s amazing,” Steve says.“Then there are cyber companies, like B-Secur. The firm specialises in technology which can read your ECG heartbeat as a unique biometric identy verication.“There are other indigenous companies, like Titan IC in cyber-security, Displaynote and ProAxsis. We have great companies that are now making a dent in the world.”And pushing forward with what his predecessor Norman Apsley built, plans are under way to expand and redevelop Catalyst further still.That includes another new building, Pierpont  – which will provide another , sq ft of space – and a revamp and refurbishment of Catalyst’s Innovation Centre, as part of an addition £m investment.“We want to make this the best place to work – improving the environment, the flow around the campus, the accessibility, and the experience, so that you love being here.“We want to refresh some of the buildings on the site. The Innovation Centre will be modernised by March and we will freshen-up our identity.”His big goal is to lead the way in two areas of technology and business at Catalyst – putting Northern Ireland front and centre.“We want to help to incubate two clusters where Northern Ireland leads the world.“How do we build on what ECIT is doing  We take the start-up capability, and ecosystem we have in Northern Ireland and leverage that further.“We want to make it easier for corporations to set up in Belfast and Northern Ireland in order to access amazing research talent. They want to define what the next big breakthrough is.“We can develop something for global companies that they can’t find where in the world. We want to create clusters, that will act as a magnet to attract hundreds of companies.”One of the unique elements of Catalyst is Connect – a network of experienced entrepreneurs, business professionals, top research talent and potential investors who provide their time and experience pro bono to help foster and develop the next generation of entrepreneurs.“It’s helping entrepreneurs to figure out how to build a company around their product idea and providing the support to validate and access the marketplace, capital, investment and or talent,” Steve says.“With the Connect network, we had  early stage companies or entrepreneurs engaged in our programmes last year. There is a lot of exciting and vibrant activity going on at the moment.”And it was Connect, which Steve founded and developed at Catalyst, which first drew him back home to his native Northern Ireland, following years of running and founding tech firms in the West Coast of the US.“I was an entrepreneur in Calornia for a number of years, in San Francisco and San Diego. I was there for the peak of the dot coms,” he said.That included his own start-up business, Kineticom, as well as other tech companies. It was his time in San Diego which resonated strongly with Steve.“Personally, I became obsessed with the San Diego story and the parallels to Northern Ireland. When they started on their journey in , San Diego had a population of . million people, % of their economy was dependent on the public sector. They have an ocean to one side, a mountain range around them and another country to the bottom of them.”San Diego went from the bottom of every league table to the top – with the collaboration of top universities, research and development and entrepreneurship, building the city into the tech stalwart it is now.The Connect  emanated from San Diego – a concept which help shaped the programme in Northern Ireland.“Meeting Norman Apsley at the Science Park was just the most beautul thing ever,” Steve says.The financial and economic impact and contribution that Catalyst has is hard to ignore. It’s estimated the businesses which operate there contribute around £m in GVA each year.“Everything we do is based on the simple belief that innovation has the power to transform our economy. People around the world are all innovating quickly, adapting new technologies, articial intelligence, for example. In Northern Ireland,people are producing goods and services, but are behind in adopting those new technologies, our economy is going to be in trouble as we will not be competitive.“The question is, how does innovation become the foundation on which everything is based ”And as a result of Catalyst’s research into the NI Knowledge Economy, an annual report published later this month, which acknowledges the huge changes to the workplace in the coming year, Catalyst is hosting their second Future of Work summit in May  – aimed at demystying how roles and traditional jobs are changing, right across the Knowledge Economy sectors.Of course, Brexit is still on the horizon. For Steve, the main concern is around the availability of talent. “The tech sector is hungry for talent, but with the uncertainty in the last couple of years, fewer people have been willing to consider moving to Northern Ireland. That places a lot of pressure on the existing employees in the sector.”“Long-term, we have to be optimistic and look at the opportunities which can come out of Brexit. The businesses within the Knowledge Economy are export driven, representing over % of all NI exports. With % of these exports outside the EU, the Knowledge Economy is the sector least dependent on Europe and should be the key for driving growth at this time of uncertainty.”So, for Steve, his level of optimism and dynamism is clear in his new role, one which he says he is “very fortunate” to have.“It’s a position which comes around so rarely, and whoever gets the opportunity is so blessed and fortunate to have the opportunity to lead. We have a talented team of people who are all passionate about what is possible. It’s so exciting. The opportunities and possibilities are endless.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/323433.jpg","title":"theresa mays brexit deal voted down business reaction","story":"Posted on Wednesday  January  by John Mulgrew Business groups have overwhelmingly raised concerns over crashing out of the EU without a deal after Prime Minister Theresa May’s withdrawal plan with Brussels was overwhelmingly rejected by MPs. Ann McGregor, chief executive of Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry “The business communities that we represent have always had a erse range of views on what form the UK’s future relationship with the EU should take, however they do agree on the need to avoid a messy and disorderly Brexit. “To achieve this we therefore need an agreement that will secure the transition period and protect jobs. As businesses wait to see what happens next in Parliament, it is crucial that those at Westminster move beyond tactical manoeuvring and look at all the options in order to avoid a ‘no deal’s scenario. “Firms are in the dark on too many aspects of le after March . This has already led to many businesses taking action – pausing on recruitment and investment, stockpiling goods, and relocating factories in other parts of the EU. In fact, a third of NI Chamber members are currently putting growth and investment plans on hold in the absence of clarity from Westminster. There is however nothing to stop government acting decisively on areas within their control, such as migration and customs procedures.”  Aodhan Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium “The result this evening will be a cause for concern across the Northern Ireland business community. Northern Ireland businesses desperately need certainty about the UK’s future trading relationship with the EU and will be severely disadvantaged by a no deal. A no deal Brexit means that Northern Ireland households will face higher prices and less choice on the shelves something they can ill afford. “Se need politicians  to coalesce around a workable solution that protects consumers from the costs and disruptions due to the loss of tarf-free and frictionless trade we currently enjoy with partners in the EU. We are now closer than ever to the possibility of a no-deal that will be a disaster for Northern Ireland.” “  Angela McGowan, CBI Northern Ireland director “Every business will feel no deal is hurtling closer. A new plan is needed immediately. This is now a time for our politicians to make history as leaders. All MPs need to reflect on the need for compromise and to act at speed to protect the UKs economy. “No deal would immediately put Northern Irish jobs and businesses at risk and jeopardise years of positive economic development and integration across the island.  It must be avoided to protect our all-island economy.”  Glyn Roberts, Retail NI chief executive “This is a disappointing but not unexpected result. While the Prime Minister’s draft Withdrawal Bill was in no way perfect, it was definitely preferable to crashing out of the EU with no deal. “The Government now needs to work on a cross-party basis with Labour and other opposition parties to reach a broader agreement for a withdrawal deal and secure the transition period, protect jobs and a positive future relationship with the EU  Colin Neill, chief executive, Hospitality Ulster “Leaving the EU without a deal would damage the sustainability of the Hospitality industry and impact on the potential growth of Tourism in Northern Ireland. We appeal to our elected representatives to work together in a spirit of consensus government to ensure that a no deal scenario does not happen.”  Tina McKenzie, FSB NI policy chair “With the clock ticking down to Brexit Day in just  weeks, we are running out of time to avoid a clf-edge, no-deal outcome. “A disorderly exit from the EU would be deeply damaging for small businesses, causing disruption to supply chains, increasing costs and stling investment. “A no-deal is something which we simply cannot countenance, so it is imperative that political leaders sharpen their focus and do all they can to reach agreement in the short time available.”  View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
