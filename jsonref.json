Following on from Land of Ibeji, Sanne de Wilde and Bénédicte Kurzen travel to Mojiang in Yunnan for the second chapter of their project about the mythology of twinhood. The area has an exceptionally high percentage of twins, celebrated in its annual tropic of cancer twin festival The first chapter of this project was called Land Of Ibeji. West Africa, and specifically Yorubaland, has 10 times more twins than any other region in the world. Ibeji, meaning “double birth” and “the inseparable two” in Yoruba stands for the ultimate harmony between two people. “Shuang bao tai”, 双胞胎 is the Chinese word for twin, which translates as: 双 double 胞 womb 胎 embryo.These legendary twin wells are located in the nearby village of Hexi, where 100 families have given birth to 10 sets of twins. Tales abound in local folklore, recounting how one pair of twins has transformed into two magic wells. The wells are a popular destination for newly wed couples, as the water is believed to increase fertility. It is said that many couples come to drink from the wells hoping to get pregnant with twins, especially important when China’s one-child policy was in place.Mojiang has been hosting the tropic of cancer international twins festival for the past 15 years, attracting thousands of twins and visitors from all corners of the world. The festival brings together the multiple dimensions of the role twinhood plays in Yunnan and in China: the Hani sun celebration, the unusually high twin fertility rate, the Taoist immortal figures, and recent Chinese government policies have all encouraged old religions and beliefs.Tales about twins abound in local folklore and in centuries-old Taoist traditions. In Mojiang, an entrepreneur saw the twin legend as a possible economic venture that could go hand in hand with the colourful sun festival of the Hani people. Now every year, thousands of visitors flock through streets crowded with vendors, while Hani people proudly wear their traditional outfits and sing songs.The more generic Chinese culture, which has been infused with the Taoist cosmology, philosophy and beliefs, uses an endearing representations of twins: “the laughing twins” or “He-He Er Xian”, which translate as “the immortals of harmony and union” and as the “two gods of harmony and union”, and are usually bald and smiling. These two immortals symbolise perfect partnership and express the idea that harmony is more profitable than strife, and are a centuries-old wedding gift.The photographic approach extends beyond appearance, to show the twin as a mythological figure and a powerful metaphor for the duality within a human being, and the duality we experience in the world that surrounds us. It reflects the “other”, the double, the doppelganger, our shadow self, our reflection in the mirror. This visual narrative and an aesthetic language, exploring new documentary strategies, is meant to reflect and empower the culture that celebrates twins, with symmetry, resemblance and reflections as tools.To highlight the “magical” and “supernatural”, to visualise that what can not be seen, two colour filters were used in certain pictures, amplifying the duality of two perceptions coloured differently. Purple referenced the mythology and storytelling: Mojiang is geographically tied to the tropic of cancer and is said to have a special “feng shui” and to be a ying-yang balancing point, which results in purple vegetables and the famous purple rice (a sign of prosperity and fertility) in the region. Blue is used to refer to water, the beginning of life and the magical twin wells.Layers of portraiture, double exposure, landscape and still life come together as a visual narrative translating the mythology of twinhood. Various photographic genres have duality as a key theme: the metaphor and the literal, the visible and the invisible, the material and the spiritual.There is a fascination for twins around the world. Although many of the myths and stories about twinhood have faded or been forgotten, it is a recurring theme weaving through biblical and cultural storytelling, philosophy and even science. Think of the Gemini stars Castor and Pollux, Romulus and Remus creating Rome, and Plato articulating the dual nature of humanity.The mythology of twinhood becomes a way to address themes such as identity, genetics, economy, religion, environmental issues, the one-child policy, censorship, cultural tourism and demographics."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb71c37672e95d5c45b734258c32e88815511f0b/0_353_5414_3248/master/5414.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d7f2bdaf2f39c2d96c8ac8d02cedc4b5","title":"buy a classic sport photograph gazzas last minute joy","story":"The latest in a  Print Shop series featuring classic sports images from the likes of Gerry Cranham, Mark Leech and Tom Jenkins – yours to own for just £55 including free delivery“England have done it in the last minute of extra time!” was John Motson’s euphoric commentary following the sensational, swivelling strike by David Platt that sent England into the quarter-finals of the 1990 World Cup – commentary that later featured in Baddiel and Skinner’s song Three Lions (Football’s Coming Home).

It is not backed by the Tolkien estate, which declined to comment on the project when approached by the .Organisers want to create a “centre devoted to Tolkien” in his former Oxford home. Project Northmoor does not intend to turn the property into a museum, but to establish a centre “for creative writing, screenwriting and illustrating, especially in fantasy” at the property.According to Project Northmoor’s Twitter feed, it has already raised $250,000 (£190,000).But questions have been raised by members of the public over the charity’s declaration that donated money will not be returned to backers if the project is not fully funded, and over how much focus the centre will put on Tolkien’s faith.Project Northmoor’s Charity Commission entry states that one of its objectives is to “advance the public knowledge and appreciation of the life, faith and works of JRR Tolkien and the Inklings”. Project Northmoor’s founder, author Julia Golding, writes from a “faith-based perspective”. Its three trustees are all active or retired directors of Christian organisations. The PR firm representing the project is “a longtime leader in the promotion of faith-based campaigns”. The fundraising platforms it chose to launch the project with are both Christian platforms: Stewardship in the UK and The Signatry in the US. The Signatry describes its mission as “to inspire and facilitate revolutionary biblical generosity”.No reference to Tolkien’s Roman Catholic faith was made on Project Northmoor’s website until 4 December when it updated its FAQs to state that it is not a religious organisation, and hopes “to welcome people of all faiths and as well as those of none to appreciate Tolkien’s legacy”. “Tolkien himself was a committed Roman Catholic and member of the Inklings, a group which included CS Lewis, so some people will be drawn to Oxford to find out more about that, which is great, but it is not the only way to enjoy Tolkien. Our programme will reflect the breadth of his interests,” says the charity.Golding told the  that the reason for choosing two Christian platforms was that “we had to move at speed and The Signatry and Stewardship were both able to help set up tax-efficient giving within a couple of days whereas other platforms said they would take weeks … Our understanding is that The Signatry and Stewardship are giving platforms developed by the faith community but not exclusively for the faith-based groups. The Signatry, for example, lists its areas of involvement as community development, education and religion.”She added: “We fit within education and we are not a charity for the advancement of religion.”Golding said the charity was also establishing a JustGiving account, which would allow backers to receive a refund if the project was not fully funded. JustGiving confirmed that the charity had applied for an account and was looking to fast-track its application, with the JustGiving page subsequently going live on Monday night.The charity’s updated FAQs now state that “donations made via PayPal may be refunded upon request if the house purchase does not go through”, with a number of caveats.“We would like to adopt a giving-back policy and this will go live once we receive our JustGiving account and will also apply to PayPal donations,” said Golding. “But we were not able to do this because of the technical constraints on the initial giving platforms, which rely on the money being given over for charitable purposes, which is governed by tax law. If the project does not succeed, then we will consult the initial donors on how the money should be spent in pursuit of the wider objectives concerning JRR Tolkien and literature.”Golding said the three objectives of Project Northmoor were: “to preserve 20 Northmoor Road, Oxford as the former home of JRR Tolkien and where The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings were written to advance the public knowledge and appreciation of the life, faith and works of JRR Tolkien and the Inklings to advance education in the arts and crafts including the arts of literature and language”.“We understand most people are giving in the hopes of securing the first objective but this property was offered to us for sale by the current owner and we can’t guarantee that he won’t sell it to someone else,” she said. “The Charity Commission have said that whether or not the house is secured for posterity, the charity can pursue its other educational and literary aims.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/54c85dd8e8dd941b44ca5c5b87219a65f947a5d7/0_8_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3136a79ae88bf39264d832243cf043a1","title":"tell us have you lost your uk retail job as a result of the pandemic","story":"As the Arcadia retail group goes into administration, we want to hear from retail workers who lost their jobs this yearAround 314,000 people lost their jobs in the three months prior to September in the UK, with hospitality, retailing and leisure amongst the hardest hit industries.As the Arcadia retail group, which owns brands including Topshop and Dorothy Perkins, goes into administration and Debenhams looks set to close for good, we’d like to hear from retailer workers who have lost their job as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.You can get in touch by filling in the form below.

This means that companies can attract the vital investment we need while making sure that consumers don’t pay more than is necessary to achieve this.”The plan was welcomed by the consumer group Citizens Advice as “genuine progress” in balancing the tension between the need to invest in tackling the climate crisis and to protect consumers.Alistair Cromwell, the acting chief executive of Citizen Advice, said: “For too long network companies were able to make excessive profits, not because they were efficient firms, but simply because previous price controls were too generous.”“Although we are pleased with this progress, we have argued that Ofgem could have gone further in limiting shareholder returns and still believe that to be the case.”The network companies – National Grid, SSE and Scottish Power – said they would review the plans before responding in full. SSE and Scottish Power remain “disappointed” with the rate of return offered on their investments."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad1cfa3b24fe425c10ee2b523f279da378de53b6/0_65_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6bc1264d25798afff53043b569269724","title":"uk grocery sales record covid lockdown kantar","story":"Sales of Christmas turkey and alcohol were up by just over a third in November, says KantarNovember was the biggest month ever for UK grocery sales with shoppers spending almost £11bn as the return of lockdown in England drove supermarket purchases of food and alcohol.Shoppers are likely to be stocking up early to avoid queues caused by social distancing during the Christmas rush, but Kantar is predicting that sales in December will be even higher than last month – at close to £12bn, £1.5bn more than last year.The strong figures are another boost for supermarkets and discounters which have handed back close to £2bn in business rates relief after an outcry that they received a tax break while sales soared during lockdown."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f43d6a3907a29a26786c05ead18eb3cbd6dd804/0_66_3247_1948/master/3247.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=a8f63e979db35c8f303741803950dc05","title":"how darjeeling express and dishoom put a fresh spin on tradition to shift the tastes of modern britain","story":"The founders of two of the UK’s most pioneering Indian restaurants changed the nation’s perception of the cuisine by drawing on the old waysThe first Indian restaurant in Britain opened more than two centuries ago – almost as long ago, in fact, as the earliest Scotch whisky distilleries – so it’s no surprise that curry is so firmly embedded in the nation’s psyche. But the days of the homogenous chicken tikka masala or korma are firmly in the past, as a new breed of restaurateurs have spiced up the nation’s palate with their original thinking and modern perspectives on Indian cuisine. And despite a tumultuous year for the restaurant industry, this culinary revolution shows no signs of abating.Think of game-changing Indian restaurants in Britain and a leading contender has to be Dishoom. Inspired by, and putting a fresh twist on, the Irani cafes of Mumbai, it sparked a wave of new restaurants, all bent on pushing boundaries and unearthing the richly-varied culinary lore of India.“Before Dishoom, certainly in London, there was a sense of Indian food just being about curries,” says its co-founder Shamil Thakrar. “Dishoom allowed for more regionally-focused Indian cuisine, and for people to mess around with small plates and cocktails. When others saw we were successful, they thought: ‘We could do something like that.’ There are some fantastic restaurants that have come up subsequently, like Gymkhana or Gunpowder.”For housewife-turned-chef Asma Khan, the notion of refining tradition has taken the form of unwinding the templated feel of the typical high-street curry house, and going back to the roots of Indian cooking – an authentic labour of love, served with the warmth of the home. Darjeeling Express began life in 2012 as a supper club, as Khan experimented with the old family recipes she’d grown up eating in Kolkata. Within five years, she had opened her restaurant to such acclaim that, before long, she had appeared in her own episode of Netflix’s Chef’s Table (the first British chef to do so).At Darjeeling Express, in central London, slow-cooked dishes such as lamb dum biryani and fish malaikari are designed to be shared, while the chef looks on, a warm presence in the dining room rather than staying hidden in the kitchen. “I see the people come in and, like a grandmother, I watch while they eat,” says Khan. “I want people to relive that moment of knowing that someone loves you enough to cook for you. It is the reason for cooking – it should not be to impress.”If Darjeeling Express makes diners feel right at home, then Dishoom, which now has eight restaurants across London, Birmingham, Manchester and Edinburgh, is like the friendly cafe down the road whose door is always open. It’s charming, immersive and stylish thanks to mid-20th century Irani cafe design details such as marble tables, ceiling fans and family portraits. Dishoom’s signature staples such as vada pav and black dal, not to mention the legendary bacon naan breakfast rolls, ensure customers return again and again, often queuing round the block for a table.“The idea of cafes doesn’t feel very Indian, so it was lovely to change the way people thought about urban India and its food,” says Thakrar. “Irani cafes were some of the early spaces in India that brought together different walks of life – the taxi driver, the barrister, the artist – in one place to eat. I remember when we opened in Shoreditch, there were hipsters in their skinny jeans and big glasses standing in the queue next to old Indian aunties.”Having non-culinary backgrounds seems to have enabled both restaurateurs to envision new takes on the norm. Thakrar worked as a corporate strategist and then as a director at his family-owned business before co-founding Dishoom Khan, meanwhile, did a PhD in British Constitutional Law before eventually deciding to pursue “the dream of cooking for others”.“I don’t cook the way people think Indian people cook, I don’t measure,” says Khan, who taught herself using her mother’s recipes when she was homesick after her move to Cambridge from India in the early 1990s. “Cooking is about tasting and layering and balancing. There’s a whole journey of different flavours. Even though it’s spicy, the chilli should not dominate – and if it does, you’re a bad cook!”Innovation is not only to be found on the plate, of course. A point of pride at Darjeeling Express is its all-female kitchen, where the average age is 50. Khan likes to employ people from an immigrant background who don’t have professional culinary skills, because they remind her of herself.While Thakrar might not be as hands on in the kitchen at Dishoom – where executive chef Naved Nasir reigns – the skills he brings to the table are just as essential for the brand to remain ahead of the game.Thakrar is an inveterate storyteller, even creating a fresh narrative theme that closely informs the concept and design of each new branch of Dishoom. He imagines who might have launched the cafe, and who its patrons might have been, had it opened in Mumbai – which Thakrar, evoking its more freewheeling older days, refers to it by its former name.“It takes you to a different time and place and offers you a sense of immersion,” he says. “I love the idea that you can take these stories and make them whimsical and beautiful, and teach someone a bit of history, and then finally you get to taste this delicious food. For people who know Bombay, it is transporting, and for everyone else it’s putting the food and drink in the right cultural context.”The restaurant industry, like so many others, is facing up to the challenges of the coronavirus pandemic and subsequent lockdowns, and both Thakrar and Khan have had to innovate and adapt. Dishoom now offers a delivery service and – taking advantage of the popularity of its breakfasts – an at-home bacon naan kit. Darjeeling Express has launched a takeaway deli menu even while going ahead with plans to open a new, larger site in Covent Garden in December.As a year like no other continues to redefine the once gloriously-normal pleasure of dining out and exploring the nuances of global cuisines, restaurateurs such as Khan and Thakrar continue to pave the way – shifting perceptions and pushing boundaries even as they honour traditions.Original by TraditionThe Glenlivet is the original Speyside Single Malt and has been breaking traditions to set new standards in whisky since 1824.

Our experts share the drinks they’ll be serving up as the nights draw inThe golden hue of autumn leaves, the scent of woodsmoke and bonfires … there’s no spirit that better captures the feeling of autumn than a single malt. But single malts have, for unfathomable reasons, long been the purview of the connoisseur. What better season to usher in the realisation that they can also star in some truly tasty cocktails that are perfect for the weeks ahead?Here’s an array of five moreish cocktails to see you through the long autumn nights. The classically floral and fruity flavours of Speyside-style whisky are at the forefront, yet enhanced by the fresh new twist of deliciously innovative ingredients.The rusty hues of an Old Fashioned look like autumn in a glass. Bobby Hiddleston, bartender and co-founder of Swift Bar in Soho, London, adds a further seasonal twist to this absolute classic by swapping out the slightly summery citrus of orange for the earthy October flavours of plum and pear.How to make itMix in a glass 50ml The Glenlivet 12 Year Old, 25ml umeshu, 10ml crème de poire and add two dashes of lemon bitters for the tart kick of a classic old fashioned. Add a big cube of ice and garnish with a twist of lemon peel.Espresso Martinis are so last season. Instead, try a warming batch of Spiced Speyside Coffee, the ultimate whisky cocktail when you have friends over. This one’s made for long nights chatting by the fire, or a delicious pick-me-up as group energy levels start to waiver.“The character of The Glenlivet 12 Year Old stands up to the flavour of the coffee, while the hint of cayenne pepper complements the spice of the single malt,” says The Glenlivet’s head of heritage and education Alex Robertson.How to make itFor intimate autumnal gatherings, whip up a batch for four. Take 160ml of The Glenlivet 12 Year Old, 60ml coffee syrup, 40ml sugar syrup, 300ml americano coffee, and ½ tsp cayenne pepper. Mix together in a warmed glass jug. Pour into four long-stemmed glasses, and top with lightly whipped double cream, drained over a spoon into each glass to form a layer on top. Garnish with chocolate flakes and a sprinkle of cayenne pepper.As the rays of a low sun stream through the trees, crack out the blender for a cocktail that blends the last throes of summer with the chilly days of autumn. Dubbed The Glenlivet Colada by whisky writer Felipe Schrieberg, the pineapple juice works nicely with the flavour profile of The Glenlivet Caribbean Reserve – which is selectively finished in Caribbean rum barrels – and whispers a faint memory of warmer days, while the warm hit of cinnamon brings in the smoky-sweet hint of autumn.“Pina coladas are my (not very) guilty pleasure, any season, and using a gentle, sweeter whisky like The Glenlivet Caribbean Reserve serves as a perfectly lovely substitute for rum,” says Schrieberg, who is currently running virtual whisky masterclasses all autumn over Zoom.How to make it Add 50ml of The Glenlivet Caribbean Reserve to 120ml pineapple juice, 60ml coconut cream, a dash of bitters, and a splash of cinnamon syrup. Pulse together in a blender with crushed ice. Garnish with pineapple leaves and a stick of cinnamon.As the nights draw in, cuddle up on the sofa with a calming nightcap. The Glenlivet’s Small Voice of Calm cocktail is a soothing mix of chamomile, whisky and lemon: the perfect tonic after a long day of video calls and endless emails.“The floral notes in The Glenlivet Founder’s Reserve are brought out by the chamomile, while the sharp lemon notes complement the sweetness of the whisky,” says Robertson.How to make itPour 50ml The Glenlivet Founder’s Reserve, 25ml chamomile syrup, and 10ml lemon juice into a cocktail shaker and lightly shake to mix the ingredients. Strain over cubed ice in a short glass and top up with 100ml chilled soda water. Garnish with chamomile flowers or a wedge of lemon.As the cold weather draws in, the temptation is to stay indoors. Stick the kettle on and rustle up some company – a luxurious Hot Toddy. Served in an enamel mug, it’s like a tiny hot-water bottle for your hands and warms your insides. This is a favourite of whisky writer and Instagrammer The Whisky Lady, AKA Anne-Sophie Bigot.“As the temperatures drop, autumn is all about warming up and being cosy, and for me whisky cocktails are definitely part of the equation. A good scotch hot toddy on the couch, sat by a crackling woodfire is a must. It screams autumn vibes to me,” says Bigot.How to make itBest built in an enamel mug, take 50ml of The Glenlivet Founder’s Reserve, add 15ml lemon juice and 15ml ginger syrup for a spicy kick. Swirl together with a couple of dashes of bitters. Top with hot water and garnish with a slice of lemon studded with cloves for that sweet, peppery aroma that whispers of frosty nights.The Glenlivet is the original Speyside single malt, setting new standards since 1824.

Cross 5 from Kieran Tierney is pinged low and tapped away by Eric Dier at the near post. Cross 7 forces Harry Kane into a scrambling clearance. Crosses 12-15, delivered in quick succession between 43 and 44 minutes, are all headed away. Cross 19 hits Steven Bergwijn and goes out for a throw.Like all the best performance art, Arsenal’s attacking display against Tottenham revealed itself only in stages: slowly building us a universe, generating its own mesmerising, percussive logic. Cross 30 from Willian sails over Hugo Lloris, over everyone. But – surprise – this merely hastens the onset of cross 31, from Dani Ceballos on the opposite flank, which fails to beat the first man.As the minutes tick away, as determination gives way to desperation, you begin to glimpse a strange beauty in this permanent bombardment, an analogue for the essential futility of human endeavour. Cross 42, delivered deep into injury time by Tierney, is humped clear by Pierre-Emile Højbjerg. Inevitably, back it comes: cross 43 from Bukayo Saka, headed behind for a corner. Is there time for cross 44? There is, from Willian. It’s headed away.Like it or not, some statistics end up becoming you. David Moyes’s Manchester United once put in 81 crosses against Fulham, a number that seemed to crystallise his era, that on some level continues to define him. The temptation will be to see in Arsenal’s 44 crosses on Sunday a similarly liminal moment for the Mikel Arteta brand: his Waterloo, his jumping the shark, his Dan Burn.Underpinning all this is a curious and very modern assumption, one adopted by the punditry class, the regular fan and the internet’s banter-industrial complex alike. “They huff and they puff, the ball goes wide, no cuteness, no cleverness, so it ends up being a cross,” observed Graeme Souness on Sky. “Were we opening up the Spurs team?” Alex Scott asked. “No, we were putting crosses into the box. That isn’t opening up a team to create chances.”Somehow, crossing has become a sort of shorthand for bad football: for aimless, headless-chicken punts. Never mind that this is one of the hardest and most visually appealing skills in the game. That the two most prolific crossing teams in the Premier League last season were Liverpool and Manchester City. That in among the duds, Arsenal’s most threatening moments came from out wide. Who will speak out for the poor, traduced cross?The first thing to note is that crossing contains multitudes. The Fifa games offer three crossing options (highdrivenlow), but in reality there are hundreds: outswinger, inswinger, floated, swirled, skimmed, clipped, dinked, smashed, early, on‑the‑run, cut‑back, the long diagonal, the short diagonal, near‑post, far‑post, the deep, the D, the rabona and plenty more besides. There’s the cross specifically designed to win a corner. The cross that’s really a shot. The shot that’s really a cross.Then you have its leading proponents and like handwriting no two crossers have ever been the same. Gary Neville used to shuffle them in like he was wearing slippers. Marc Albrighton’s seem to hang in the air for hours. Bolo Zenden delivered his crosses almost reluctantly, as if what he really wanted was to keep dribbling: over the line, into the stands, out into the car park, away to freedom.These days, at the elite end, the cross is more of a precision instrument: an extension of the modern percentage game with its fixation on automatisms and controllable outcomes. This is why, like swearing and mixtapes, crossing just isn’t what it used to be. Let’s be clear: the level of skill is as good as ever. There are some brilliant crossers: Kevin De Bruyne, Andy Robertson, James Rodríguez, Hakim Ziyech. But such is the miniaturisation of the modern game that you rarely glimpse their true range.Take Ziyech, a man who essentially plays one kind of cross – the little dink to the far post with his left foot. He probably plays the others brilliantly too. But Chelsea’s game is so honed and stylised that we may never find out. I love Ziyech as a player but as a crosser? Give me Beckham, Wilcox or Hinchcliffe any day of the week.The real problem isn’t with crossing itself, but the way we talk about the game: the motifs and narratives that wind themselves around teams and players like weeds. You see it in the vaguely sneery way people talk about Stewart Downing or Chris Brunt: this idea that crossing, like heading or set pieces, somehow lies outside the core of the modern game, a relic of a pre‑concussion age.Anybody who saw Sunday’s game will know what Arsenal were trying to do: with the centre blocked and no real playmaker, they simply went where the space was, creating overloads out wide. Tierney is one of the best crossers in the game. What they lacked was an aerial presence and bodies in the box. Their problem wasn’t crossing: it was bad crossing, slow crossing, crossing without a plan.And yet, fairly or unfairly, this feels like one of those tags that might stick. Being 15th in the league will do that to you. Moyes has rebuilt his career at West Ham but if you go on YouTube you can still watch those 81 crosses against Fulham, sped up and set to the Benny Hill music. Unless Arteta can turn Arsenal around sharpish, this might also be – so to speak – his cross to bear."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60f0a570f3f4d41f268db44c4435b4c9d46bbfe5/96_1191_885_530/master/885.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4c05362d3533c4ec43a51e6fccfa6c41","title":"david squires on the booing of footballers taking a knee","story":"Our cartoonist on demoralising scenes at Millwall, angry old white men and unlikely Marxism"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4fcc3740423b7a57a63e2201fea08e2143b244f4/0_0_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dc433cda32040f1e798eb29bceb2e7bc","title":"teaching dogs to talk stella bunny","story":"Provided with a board full of buttons, some pets appear to be communicating with their humans – and researchers are investigatingThere are plenty of reasons why we talk to our pets. Some research suggests our chattiness can be motivated by loneliness, a need to feel control over the dynamic of our relationship with them, or even just our perception of animal consciousness. It’s likely that most pet owners would simply feel weird not greeting their wagging pup at the door with a shower of “oh, hellooo”s or cooing baby-talk to their purring cat.What’s altogether unexpected is the idea that pets might talk to us – but new research is exploring whether and how they can.Helmed by Dr Federico Rossano, director of the Comparative Cognition Lab at the University of California San Diego, and Leo Trottier, a PhD candidate, project They Can Talk is one of the latest in a decades-long series of psycholinguistic studies seeking to document non-humans expressing themselves in language-like ways. But unlike many studies of the past, which either focused on the learning capacity of a single star animal – like Koko the gorilla, Kanzi the chimpanzee, or Rico the dog – They Can Talk is an unusually large, open-source citizen science study.More than 1,000 dogs, 50 cats and a few horses are involved in the project – with more applicants every day.Yet there would be no They Can Talk at all if there was not first the work of Christina Hunger, a San Diego speech-language pathologist who began training Stella, her Catahoulablue heeler mix, as a puppy in 2018.Inspired by the behavioral similarities she perceived between Stella and preverbal toddlers, she ordered a box of four recordable buttons and started off with a few of them each programmed to say a different word. “My initial intention was just to teach her a few words to express some basic needs to help us communicate a bit better, but we just kept progressing,” Hunger says.Today, Stella can use her expanded button set-up – itself a kind of augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) device not unlike those used by humans with language problems – to seemingly convey concepts with combinations of up to five words at a time.When Trottier came across Hunger and Stella on Instagram in 2019, he had already spent years studying cognitive science and developing tech to monitor animal behavior. He quickly realized he could make a prefab pet AAC soundboard anyone could use, and that gaining systematic insight into whether and how animals use language-like communication could be easier than scientists had previously gauged.“I saw Christina doing what she was doing with buttons, and it became clear what we thought would take reams and reams of data and probably a decade or more, as well as a large team of software developers, could actually be done in a fraction of the time with people who are familiar with techniques of speech-language pathology and a bunch of talk buttons that make sounds,” he says.Trottier and Rossano launched the They Can Talk pilot program in March of this year. The researchers found an initial group of 50 – “a lot of teachers, a lot of speech-language pathologists, a lot of dog trainers”, says Trottier – willing to kickstart the project from home by recording their dogs’ interactions with a soundboard of programmable AAC “HexTiles” Trottier designed and now sells through his company, FluentPet. (Hunger, who will release a book of her own work next spring, did not join.)Two of these pilot participants were Tacoma’s Alexis Devine and her sheepadoodle, Bunny. Bunny, who has been using some form of recordable buttons to express herself since Devine brought her home in 2019, is now a bit of an internet celebrity.Since Devine began posting Bunny’s adventures in communication on TikTok in May, her account @What_About_Bunny has amassed 5.3 million followers who love watching Bunny seemingly request afternoon walks by pressing “now”, “afternoon”, or “walk”, or observe the audible ocean waves outside her house by pawing the buttons “water” and “sound”.Bunny’s TikTok popularity supercharged public interest in project They Can Talk, sending heaps of eager new applicants – many of them bored at home during the pandemic and spending loads of time with their pets anyway.By engaging with concepts of time and space, Bunny is also a good representative of what researchers hope to see: pets who are able to go beyond first-order associations, demanding, for example, food or attention, and who rather suggest the capacity for things like syntax and conceptual contextualization. The reason it’s important that Bunny, or any other pet, may be able to refer to things that happened last week is that it counters “the long philosophical and psychological tradition which claims that only humans have certain cognitive abilities that are related to language”, such as episodic memory, explains Rossano.Additionally, Rossano notes that scientists currently believe humans are the only species to use language to convey our emotional experiences to others. By pointing out things that interest her, such as the waves, Bunny seems to be acting much like a human toddler, sharing something that has caught her attention.If animals can truly and reliably use language to place themselves in time and share their emotions, “then already it changes our representation of the emotional, mental life of other creatures, which can of course affect our very assumptions of these animals and how we treat them, how we interact with them, and what kinds of rights we give them”, says Rossano.Critics of the project have noted the issue of confirmation bias: we, as enthusiastically anthropomorphizing humans, long to read into animal behavior and see an intellectual complexity comparable to our own. Perhaps that’s all that is going on when we watch a dog like Bunny.Rossano emphasizes that no dog or other animal should be forced or coerced with food to engage with AAC soundboards. Domestic animals, he notes, have their own fundamental way of relating to humans and each other, and project They Can Talk neither can nor should replace that.“What I’m hoping is, at the very least, participants will get to spend more time with their animal and interact with them, and that itself should be a good thing,” says Rossano. “If the animal doesn’t learn to use the buttons, it doesn’t matter.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9da35191d1b312eddebfc1acc4b7816ea766535a/549_523_6041_3624/master/6041.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=60fbe008223e973921e4f47e59f0ea85","title":"how to have a covid safe christmas","story":"Families across the UK are being allowed to gather over Christmas, even as tens of thousands of new coronavirus cases are recorded each day.

Normally a Conservative government is all too happy to speak up for the royal family, but the spokesman sidestepped the question. He said:That is obviously a matter for the palace and I would point you towards them. But we set out clearly the tiers and the advice around the current guidelines that we are asking the public to abide by.Asked if the royal couple had complied with the coronavirus rules, the spokesman said: I’m making the general point that we have set out the regionalised tier system that is now in place and the guidance that we are asking people to abide by.When it was put to the spokesman that it sounded as if No 10 was refusing to give its backing to the couple’s trip, he replied: “I would point you towards the palace.”The SNP’s Martyn Day asks what the government is doing to encourage take-up. And will the government pursue an elimination strategy?Hancock says that it is only with a vaccine that we can get rid of the virus.And he says countering information is incredibly important. That is best done with positive information, he says. He urges MPs to talk about the benefits of the vaccine.He says international surveys show that the UK has one of the highest rates of vaccine acceptance in the world.Jeremy Hunt, the chair of the Commons health committee, says what people really want to know is if they can book a summer holiday. Can they?Hancock says he has “high confidence that the summer of 2021 will be a bright one”, without the restrictions in force this year. Hancock says he has booked his holiday already he is going to Cornwall.Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, is responding now. He has some questions.When will areas without hospitals get vaccine programmes?Will vaccination centres be suitable for the disabled?Will medical students get priority?And what will happen about hard to reach groups, like the homeless?Hancock says vaccination will be rolled out to further centres, including Leicester (Ashworth’s constituency city) next week.It will be available to all people, including the disabled and the homeless, he says.In the Commons Matt Hancock is responding to the UQ now.He says this morning Margaret Keenan became the first person in the world to receive a clinically authorised vaccine.Today marks “the start of the fightback”, he says.He says vaccinations will take place in hospitals this week. From next week vaccines will be distributed to GPs. And by Christmas vaccinations will take place in care homes, he says.But he stresses that is important not to “blow it now”.There are worrying signs of the virus growing in some parts of the country, including parts of Essex, London and Kent, and over the coming weeks and months, we must all keep following the rules to keep people safe, and make sure we can get through this safely together. The Downing Street lobby briefing has just finished, but reporters were left none the wiser as to when the planned meeting between Boris Johnson and Ursula von der Leyen will take place. “In the coming days” was about as specific as the prime minister’s spokesman was willing to be. He said Davod Frost, the UK’s chief negotiator, was meeting his EU counterpart, Michel Barnier, in Brussels today to agree a briefing for the leaders on where the differences remain, and later Frost will return to London to meet Johnson.But the spokesman did rule out the EU offer for talks to continue into 2021. (See 11.54am.) Asked about this, he said:We have been clear that the future relationship needs to be concluded by the end of the year, and negotiation won’t continue into next year. That has been our position throughout.Matt Hancock, the health secretary, will shortly answer a Commons urgent question on the vaccine rollout.Sir Patrick Vallance, the government’s chief scientific adviser, has told Sky News that even with vaccines being introduced, it could still be necessary next winter for people to wear masks in some circumstances. He said:This is incredibly important and it is important that we all stick to the rules in the meantime – the rules are what’s keeping the virus down now, we need to keep the virus down while we allow the vaccine programme to roll out.It may be that next winter, even with vaccination, we need measures like masks in place – we don’t know yet how good all the vaccines are going to be at preventing the transmission of the virus.Vallance stressed that, although vaccines prevent people getting the disease, it is not yet known if they also prevent people spreading it.A former Conservative party MEP has been appointed as chair of the new Brexit body to monitor the treatment of EU citizens by the Home Office and other authorities.Sir Ashley Fox, who was knighted by Theresa May in September 2019, will be the first chair of the Independent Monitoring Authority for Citizens Rights Agreementsm which will start operating from 1 January under the withdrawal agreement. The appointment of a former Tory politician has raised eyebrows among campaign groups nervous about the future of EU citizens in the country. Last week the justice committee noted Fox had said he did not intend to “raise hopes” that the body would deal with inidual citizens’ complaints even though it is mandated to “initiate investigations” and, if necessary, take action “up to an including seeking judicial review”. It endorsed his appointment “subject to” the considerations above. Also appointed by the lord chancellor today as non-executive members of the body are: Punam Birly, a partner at KPMG Marcus Killick, the head of a Gibraltar law firm and Leo O’Reilly, a former civil servant in Northern Ireland government departments.In an interview with the Today programme this morning Kate Bingham, tje head of the government’s vaccine taskforce, said she thought it should be safe for people to take summer holidays abroad next year. She said that although the virus would never completely disappear, vaccines meant that by the summer of 2021 “we should be in a much better place to get on planes”.She told the programme:My gut feel is that we will all be going on summer holidays.I think by the summer we should be in a much better place to get on planes.I don’t think we’re going to get away from this virus ever – so we’re going to have to maintain sensible hygiene and washing hands, and so on.I would like this vaccine to be as routine as an annual flu jab and that we manage it rather than get bowed down by it.The EU is willing to carry on further talks with the UK in 2021 even if there is no deal before the end of the post-Brexit transition on 31 December, the European commission said this morning.Daniel Ferrie, a commission spokesman, said the mandate given to officials by the 27 member states and the European parliament would permit further talks. He said:If that deal is not in place on January 1, then we have a no-deal situation. That does not exclude that negotiations can continue – from our side – and it does not exclude that we can continue on the basis of the mandate that is given to us.Eric Mamer, the European commission’s spokesman, told reporters this morning that no date has yet been fixed for Boris Johnson’s meeting with Ursula von der Leyen, the commission president.He said the conversation between the two leaders yesterday had been “very cordial”, but that it had focused on the “sticking points” in the negotiations.Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, told Sky News in Brussels this morning that he has had a meeting with David Frost, his UK counterpart, to prepare the “next steps” – drawing up an agenda for the meeting between Boris Johnson and Ursula von der Leyen, the European commission president.

The balance of –6 percentage points was the lowest among 24 countries studied.Mark Cahill, managing director of ManpowerGroup UK, said: “The headline numbers are steadily moving in the right direction, and we are seeing a continued resurgence in key sectors like finance and business giving us reasons to be cheerful as we head into 2021.Retail and hospitality employ about 6 million workers between them, but Manpower said both had felt the impact of the four-week lockdown in England from 5 November to 2 December, with hiring intentions at their lowest level on record. Record lows were also reported by London employers.Cahill said: “The further decline of Britain’s high streets is deeply concerning. Shops, restaurants, and bars have remained mostly shut across the country, and the young people who make up a large proportion of workers in this sector have often borne the brunt.“London’s shuttered shops are a stark reminder of the economic impact of the pandemic. Many of the city’s largest companies stuck to their hiring plans at the start of the first lockdown but are now adopting a ‘wait and see’ approach, deferring hiring until the impact of the EU exit and Covid-19 in the new year is clearer.”Helen Dickinson, the BRC chief executive, said: “November saw the brakes put on the sales growth that had been seen over the previous three months. In-store non-food sales saw a significant decline as a result of the lockdown in England however, some retailers were able offset a proportion of lost sales through greater online and click-and-collect sales, ensuring they could still serve their customers.“Extended discount periods helped spread demand and offered customers great deals on gifts including the latest gaming consoles, other electronics and home accessories. However, the disparity between online and in-store non-food sales widened, with the highest online penetration rate since May. Non-food stores once again experienced double-digit decline as tighter restrictions were brought in across England.”Paul Martin, KPMG’s UK head of retail, said: “The evolution of Black Friday from a day to now ning multiple weeks has further distorted trading patterns and will have likely brought Christmas purchases forward. Despite this, high-street retailers will still be hoping that consumers will be pounding the pavements in the coming weeks as they battle hard to make up for lost ground in this crucial time.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/acbd34c42cb23207239fb6e9fb8c2a6a93d6d0b6/0_313_5266_3160/master/5266.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4b2b9be0a0ccc433e5cf224486795649","title":"england to fly home on thursday after tour party pair cleared of infection covid cricket","story":"England have been given the green light to leave South Africa on Thursday after the two tourists who had tested positive for Covid-19 over the weekend were subsequently cleared by further checks.Eoin Morgan’s squad pulled out of playing two last-ditch ODIs before their departure after Ashley Giles, the team director, ceded to collective anxiety about the bio-secure bubble and an inability to focus on playing.But while there were issues with the set-up – one South African player and two hotel staff members tested positive, forcing games at Newlands and Paarl to be called off – England’s two suspected cases have been dismissed following additional analysis and testing.Dr Nick Peirce, chief medical officer of the England and Wales Cricket Board, said in a statement: “Following the independent ratification of the two unconfirmed positive Covid-19 tests from the England camp in South Africa, the ECB can confirm that, following further testing and analysis, in the opinion of the independent virologists based in Cape Town and London, the two iniduals are not infected, and do not pose any risk of passing on the infection to the rest of the party.“As such, the advice is they are now free to join the rest of the group and are no longer self-isolating. The England party, returning to the UK, will depart Cape Town on Thursday morning.”It is a relief for the touring party, with the pair – believed to be a player and a member of the support staff – having faced the prospect of remaining behind in South Africa until 15 December to complete 10 days of isolation.While Tom Curran and Tom Banton have pulled out of upcoming deals with the Big Bash due to bubble fatigue, the five players still set to travel to Australia – Sam Billings, Jason Roy, Liam Livingstone, Jake Ball and Lewis Gregory – are due for further Covid-19 tests before their departure."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f6cb5a973cc9982871c59330281c398ce77e0325/0_322_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6a338125f970f66f507bbf074cf3ed63","title":"uber self driving car aurora","story":"Ride-hailing company sells ision to startup Aurora but says they will collaborate Uber has ditched efforts to develop its own self-driving car with the multibillion-dollar sale of its driverless car ision to a Silicon Valley startup.The ride-hailing company is selling the business, known as Advanced Technologies Group (ATG), for a reported $4bn (£3bn) to Aurora, a start-up that makes sensors and software for autonomous vehicles and is backed by Amazon and Sequoia Capital.Uber said it would collaborate with Aurora in bringing driverless cars to its network in the coming years.“Few technologies hold as much promise to improve people’s lives with safe, accessible, and environmentally friendly transportation as self-driving vehicles. For the last five years, our phenomenal team at ATG has been at the forefront of this effort – and in joining forces with Aurora, they are now in pole position to deliver on that promise even faster,” said Khosrowshahi.Developing autonomous technology has been Uber’s big ambition since its then chief executive Travis Kalanick launched the driverless car ision in Pittsburgh in 2015, in a mission to drive down costs. At the time, Uber was ahead of rivals such as Google and Tesla in the race to develop “robotaxis”. But it suffered a serious setback when an autonomous Uber car killed a woman who was crossing the street in Arizona in 2018, and was also caught up in legal battles as Google’s self-driving car project Waymo sued Uber for alleged technology theft.Under Khosrowshahi, Uber has expanded in areas such as food delivery. The company, which went public in 2019, has come under pressure from investors to focus on becoming profitable.Aurora was founded in 2017 by Urmson, an early pioneer of what became the self-driving taxi firm Waymo Sterling Anderson, the chief product officer, who previously worked at Tesla and Drew Bagnell, the chief technology officer, who was a founding member of Uber’s self-driving ision."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eef4120b7f01666cb2dbdf5869285140e79c02f4/421_0_6228_3740/master/6228.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=f44e0a5bf590c1290b6cf6d161453611","title":"north yorkshire national parks named international dark sky reserves","story":"A five-year campaign for designation has resulted in the Yorkshire Dales and North York Moors parks forming the largest dark-sky area in the UKThe Yorkshire Dales and North York Moors national parks have been named international dark sky reserves, creating the largest dark sky area in the UK and one of the biggest in Europe. Combined, the two parks cover 1,396 sq miles, and achieved the status after a five-year campaign.Dark sky reserve designation is granted by the International Dark-Sky Association (IDA), the foremost authority on light pollution, based in Tucson, Arizona. To be designated, an area must undergo a rigorous process to prove the exceptional quality of its nocturnal environment as well as showing strong community support, encouraging the take-up of dark-sky-friendly lighting and facilitating educational activities.There are 16 other IDA dark sky reserves in the world, including five in Britain: Brecon Beacons national park, Cranborne Chase, Exmoor national park, Moore’s Reserve in the South Downs national park and Snowdonia national park. In the north of England there’s also an international dark sky park in Northumberland. Parks and reserves have similar requirements, but reserves must be at least 270 sq miles in size and formed of a core darkness area surrounded by a populated belt of communities that work in tandem to protect the darkness of the core. At 572 sq miles, the Northumberland dark sky park is less than half the size of the combined Yorkshire reserves areas.Jim Bailey, chairman of the North York Moors national park authority, said: “This designation as an international dark sky reserve is the culmination of immense dedication and teamwork, and it will continue as we encourage more people to think carefully about our night-time environment. From helping nocturnal wildlife to boosting off-season tourism, the North York Moors looks set to have a better, darker future.”It is hoped that gaining dark sky reserve status will enable the two national parks to further develop and capitalise on astrotourism. Since 2016 North Yorkshire has held an annual Dark Skies festival across the two national parks each February, which has helped raise the region’s profile as a stargazing destination. Each year the event contributes more than £500,000 to the rural economy, and in 2019 the festival was attended by more than 8,000 people, double the number that participated in 2018.The festival comprises more than 100 events over 17 days, including dine-and-gaze events, after-dark runs and stargazing safaris. This year for the first time, both national parks also hosted fringe events during October half-term.North Yorkshire’s dark-sky-friendly businesses have welcomed the news. Colin and Vicky Simmons, owners of the Fox and Hounds in Ainthorpe, have been working with the Dark Skies festival for the past 18 months and have taken part in a programme to reduce light pollution in the North York Moors by fitting new lighting around their premises. Vicky said: “Achieving dark sky reserve status is fantastic news. We hope it will bring more international tourists to the area, particularly in the off-season winter months when the night sky is at its best.”Join a stargazing safari in Dalby ForestThe 3,440-hectare Dalby Forest is one of three designated dark sky discovery sites on the North York Moors, all of which have “Milky Way” status – meaning it is possible to glimpse the galaxy with the naked eye here.

Former president Barack Obama had previously turned the tennis court into one suitable for basketball.Planning for the project began in early 2018, followed by approval in June 2019 by the commission of fine arts and the national capital planning commission. Construction was in partnership with the trust for the National Mall and the National Park Service.Trump helped break ground for the project in October 2019, which was funded by private donations. However, the White House did not disclose the cost.The pavilion’s unveiling isn’t the first time the building generated controversy. Earlier this year the first lady received a firestorm of criticism for tweeting photos of herself wearing a hard hat while reviewing the structure’s blueprints as the coronavirus pandemic began to wreck havoc across the country.Critics lashed out, calling the photos insensitive.Completion of the tennis pavilion follows the first lady’s redesign of the White House rose garden earlier this year.Biden is set to take the oath of office as the nation’s 46th president on 20 January. From then, he will have the power to uproot any or all of Trump’s design should he choose.The Associated Press contributed to this report"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/adabef194b75864875b92cbc06e0f8d3b49a578c/0_168_5028_3017/master/5028.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=d50e01cf1bc97490e0a82ff896dfe2b1","title":"are you getting the pfizer coronavirus vaccine this week in the uk","story":"We’d like to speak to people who are due to be given the Pfizer coronavirus vaccine in the coming daysThe Pfizer coronavirus vaccine is due to be rolled out in the UK this week, with the first people to receive doses on Tuesday.

Asked if it was the right moment for the royal couple to visit, Gething said: I’d rather that no one was having unnecessary visits. And people always have isive views about the monarchy, but their visit isn’t an excuse for people to say that they are confused about what they are being asked to do.On Monday, the Scottish leader, Nicola Sturgeon, suggested that William and Kate travelled to the Scottish capital of Edinburgh despite their office being made aware of coronavirus restrictions for those wanting to cross the border.Royal officials have said the visits were planned in consultation with the Scottish and Welsh governments, and that William and Kate were allowed to travel across the border because they were working.Wales and Scotland have their own devolved governments and different sets of coronavirus restrictions from England even though they are all part of the UK. Welsh and Scottish officials have discouraged people from the rest of the UK from travelling to their regions without a reasonable excuse in an attempt to reduce the virus’s spread.Britain has Europe’s deadliest outbreak, at more than 61,000 reported dead.Milan’s La Scala opera house staged a three-hour televised medley of arias and ballet on Monday after the coronavirus pandemic forced the cancellation of the traditional season opener for the first time since the second world war.Masked members of the choir and orchestra performed the national anthem in an empty auditorium that in other years would be packed with Italy’s political, business and show business elite for one of the highlights of Milan’s cultural calendar.Organisers called the show “A riveder le stelle” (“to see the stars again”) in reference to the final phrase in Dante Alighieri’s Inferno, signalling hope that the pandemic which has brought Europe’s economy to its knees will soon be overcome. This was an extraordinary experience but I hope not to repeat it.Italy shut its theatres and concert halls in October to contain a resurgence of the pandemic after the summer and the restrictions are due to stay in place until at least after the Christmas holiday season.Some performances were live and others pre-recorded. They included the star dancer Roberto Bolle, who performed a ballet solo surrounded only by light beams.Organisers also took viewers to normally off-limits rehearsal and backstage areas of La Scala, the 242-year-old theatre at the heart of Milan’s musical life.With the Lombardy region around Milan among the worst affected areas in Europe and still recording thousands of new coronavirus infections every day, it is still unclear how La Scala will stage its planned new season.In October dozens of La Scala singers and musicians tested positive for the virus, forcing all members of the chorus into quarantine along with members of the orchestra.Switzerland and Italy will halt all cross-border rail service from Thursday because train personnel do not have capacity to carry out Covid-19 safety checks ordered by the Italian government, the Swiss Federal Railways (SBB) has said.The move, in place indefinitely, affects dozens of daily routes, including long-distance trains between Milan and Frankfurt, Germany, as well as regional trains that connect the two countries, where many workers travel daily across the border from northern Italy to Switzerland.Switzerland and neighbouring Italy, Germany and France had reduced train service in November, but rising cases during the second wave of infections that prompted the Italian government’s new requirements mean train service will be stopped much like it was during the pandemic’s first wave.Italy did not explicitly forbid train travel abroad, but its requirements – including for passengers’ temperatures to be measured – exceed the capacity of train personnel, an SBB spokeswoman told Reuters, leading to the decision to shutter the Swiss-Italian routes. SBB said:Swiss Federal Railways trains will travel only to the country’s border to Italy.Italy, France and Germany have also introduced new requirements meant to prevent skiers from travelling over the holidays to Switzerland and Austria, where resorts are due to be open for limited, locals-only skiing. India’s government regulator could grant a license to some developers of Covid-19 vaccines in the next few weeks, the country’s top health official said on Tuesday.Six vaccines, including Astra Zeneca’s Covidshield and Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin, are in trial stages, the federal health secretary, Rajesh Bhushan, said.Bhushan said Bharat Biotech had sought emergency-use authorisation from India’s drug regulator for its Covid-19 vaccine. Pfizer and Astra Zeneca have already applied for emergency-use authorisation in India.This has just been sent in by a reader. Switzerland goes against the flow for the skiing season. Now outrage at these scenes... Health officials and experts are still baffled by a mysterious illness that has left more than 500 people hospitalised and one person dead in the southern Indian state of Andhra Pradesh.The illness was first detected Saturday evening in Eluru, an ancient city famous for its hand-woven products. People started convulsing without any warning, said Geeta Prasadini, the director of public health.Since then, symptoms ranging from nausea and anxiety to loss of consciousness have been reported in 546 patients admitted to hospitals. Many have recovered and returned home, while 148 are still being treated, said Dasari Nagarjuna, a government spokesperson.Teams of experts have arrived at the city from India’s top scientific institutes. Different theories have been suggested and are being tested. The most recent hypothesis is contamination of food by pesticides.What is confounding experts is that there does not seem to be any common link among the hundreds of people who have fallen sick. All of the patients have tested negative for Covid-19 and other viral diseases such as dengue, chikungunya or herpes. They are not related to each other and do not all live in the same area. They’re from different age groups, including about 70 children, but very few are elderly.Initially, contaminated water was suspected. But the chief minister’s office confirmed that people who do not use the municipal water supply have also fallen ill, and that initial tests of water samples did not reveal any harmful chemicals.A 45-year-old man with the single name Sridhar was hospitalised with symptoms resembling epilepsy and died on Sunday evening, doctors said. Prasadini said his autopsy did not shed any light on the cause of death.The hypothesis currently being tested is that people ate vegetables tainted with pesticides made of organic compounds containing phosphorus. But this is an assumption based on the fact that such pesticides are commonly used in the area and not on any evidence, Prasadini said.She said that experts were testing to see if pesticides had contaminated fish ponds or spilled over to vegetables.Opposition leader N Chandrababu Naidu demanded on Twitter an “impartial, full-fledged inquiry into the incident.”Andhra Pradesh state is among those worst hit by Covid-19, with more than 800,000 detected cases. The health system in the state, like the rest of India, has been frayed by the virus. Israel will receive a first shipment of Pfizer’s coronavirus vaccines on Thursday and will administer them to the elderly and other high-risk populations, a cabinet minister said on Tuesday.Pfizer and its partner BioNTech last month agreed to provide Israel with 8m doses of the vaccine, which Britain on Tuesday became the first country to administer.The intelligence minister, Eli Cohen, confirmed media reports that a first batch would be flown to Tel Aviv from Chicago on Thursday.Those doses would be given to at-risk populations, mainly those over 60-years-old, Cohen said in an interview with Army Radio. He gave no start date for the innoculations or details of the size of the batch.The public broadcaster Kan said it would contain 110,000 doses.Israel, with a population of 9 million, has reported 347,497 coronavirus cases and 2,925 deaths. Red wine mulled with cinnamon sticks, star aniseed, orange and plenty of sugar is a staple of the German Christmas season.And while cities across the country have this year agreed to forego hosting Christmas markets on their town squares due to the pandemic, Germans seem less willing to give up on the seasonal mug of steaming Glühwein.German authorities on Tuesday expressed their growing concern about pop-up stalls selling mulled wine in takeaway cups and “Glühwein street-walkers” gathering in city centres in spite of social distancing restrictions.The health minister, Jens Spahn, told the broadcaster RTL it was irresponsible to have crowds of people congregating around pop-up stalls while hospitals around Germany were voicing concerns about rising infections.Health expert Karl Lauterbach, of the Social Democratic party (SPD) complained that ’mulled wine booths are undermining social distancing restrictions’. There would be plenty of time to indulge in the sweetly sick drink after people had been vaccinated, he said.Some cities, including Lüneburg, Leipzig and Hamburg, have already taken steps to sell the outdoor sale of alcoholic beverages. Four lions at Barcelona zoo have tested positive for Covid-19, veterinary authorities said on Tuesday, in only the second known case in which large felines have contracted coronavirus.Three females – named Zala, Nima and Run Run – and Kiumbe, a male, were tested after keepers noticed they showed slight symptoms of coronavirus.Two staff at the zoo also tested positive for coronavirus, the authorities said, after the outbreak was first detected last month. Authorities are investigating how the lions became infected.Keepers carried out PCR tests on the lions in the same way as humans are tested as the animals are accustomed to contact with the zoo staff.The veterinary service of Barcelona contacted colleagues at the Bronx Zoo in New York, where four tigers and three lions tested positive for Covid-19 in April. It is the only other zoo where large felines are known to have contracted coronavirus. All of them recovered.“The zoo has contacted and collaborated with international experts such as the veterinary service of the Bronx zoo, the only one that has documented cases of Sars-CoV-2 infection in felines,” the Barcelona zoo said in a statement.The lions were given veterinary care for their mild clinical condition – similar to a very mild flu condition – through anti-inflammatory treatment and close monitoring, and the animals responded well.The four-year-old male and the females, who are all 16 years old, have had no contact with other animals at the zoo, which is open to visitors.Morning, I will be taking you through todays global coronavirus updates.

It is also going to be a challenging time for shoppers, as they try to get organised for a Christmas like never before with more than 40 shopping days taken from them almost overnight.We know the problems all too well, but we know the solution, too, or at least part of it. The internet. But,\u0026nbspas we have said before and will say again,\u0026nbspshopping online comes with a caveat. As much as 70 per cent of Irish consumers’ virtual spending leaves the country as people shop overseas.It doesn’t have to be that way. As we are learning, there are many, many local sites that need our support this month and every month. If we could keep just 10 or 20 per cent of our online spend this year at home it would inject tens of millions of euro into our local economies. That would save jobs and keep businesses going.So our 100 became 200, and is now becoming 400.Jump to: Toys Food and drink Art and gifts Jewellery Clothes Books Music and tech Sporty stuff Health and beauty Everything elseTOYS nimblefingers.ie  A Dublin toyshop that has been making children and their parents happy for generations.

Photograph: Alan BetsonThe The volume of HGVs on the State’s roads is now higher in many areas than at the same period in 2019, according to an analysis of transport trends carried out by the CSO covering the period March 1st to November 28th. The analysis noted that in Dublin HGV traffic volumes were “unaffected by the increased restrictions in Dublin”, adding that HGV traffic had exceeded 2019 levels for the twenty third consecutive week in selected Dublin locations. The report found that in Dublin and a selection of regional locations the volume of HGVs is now greater than last year and that while the volume of cars on Irish roads fell initially in October, when tighter restrictions were introduced, it has risen consistently each week since.The CSO used data from the Revenue, Transport Infrastructure Ireland which counts traffic numbers using counters set into the main routes, and data from the National Transport Authority, as well as the Road safety Authority among others, to compile the report. The data suggests traffic volumes have recovered significantly from the Covid -19 restrictions first introduced last March. In relation to the most recent Level 5 restrictions the CSO said the volume of cars on Irish roads fell initially in October when they were introduced but had risen consistently each week since.It found that by the end of November car traffic volumes across the State had grown for the fourth consecutive week, despite the State-wide introduction of Level 5 in early October, which did not end until early December. While car traffic numbers have not yet reached 2019 levels, there were 11 more fatalities on Irish roads during the first eleven months of 2020, compared to the same period in 2019.However, while vehicular traffic is showing signs of recovery post lockdown, it appears commuters are more circumspect when it comes to returning to public transport.The number of journeys by bus and rail were 63.2 per cent lower than pre-Covid-19 levels, by November 28th, the CSO said. There was an increase of just 1.4 per cent in the volume of bicycle journeys in Dublin City during off-peak hours in November 2020 compared to November 2019.Fuel excise clearances of unleaded petrol were 28.7per cent lower in October 2020 compared to October 2019, reflecting the lower levels of traffic on the roads. Commenting on the latest bulletin, Olive Loughnane, CSO statistician, said Covid-19 restrictions continued to have a significant influence on traffic volumes, the number of journeys on public transport and travel through Irish airports, which all remain at significantly lower levels than the same period in 2019.But she said car traffic volumes had increased consistently since the week commencing 1st November and HGV traffic volumes were “unaffected by the increased restrictions in Dublin”.

Amid pessimism in Dublin and Brussels about the prospects for an agreement, it is understood she believes that a path to a deal can still be found, despite the differences between the two sides. Ms von der Leyen spoke to a number of EU leaders last night, following her conversation with Mr Johnson. However, with EU leaders due to meet in Brussels on Thursday, there are fears the patience of EU member states with the process is exhausted, as they contemplate another EU summit being dominated by Brexit. EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier said yesterday the talks must finish by tomorrow, in advance of an EU summit in Brussels on Thursday.This morning Mr Johnson warned it was proving “very, very difficult” to make progress in the talks.Mr Johnson said: “Our friends have just got to understand the UK has left the EU in order to be able to exercise democratic control over the way we do things . . . But hope springs eternal, I will do my best to sort it out if we can.”Senior officials in Dublin yesterday discussed preparations for January 1st, with significant disruption at ports expected even if there is a deal between the two sides. Mr Johnson and Ms von der Leyen will meet face-to-face in Brussels in the coming days in a final effort to salvage negotiations on Britain’s future relationship with the European Union.The two agreed to meet after they held a 40-minute phone call on Monday to take stock of the negotiations.Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney, who was in Brussels on Monday for a meeting with EU foreign ministers, warned the mood was starting to shift away from making compromises to secure a deal towards preparing for a no-deal outcome.He said there was “a great deal of frustration on the EU side” and that many foreign ministers were becoming resigned to a no-deal.The British government has agreed to drop treaty-breaking clauses in the Internal Market Bill and in a forthcoming taxation Bill if it reaches agreement with the EU in a joint committee on how the Northern Ireland protocol should be implemented.EU member states have already appealed to the European Commission to roll out contingency plans for a no-deal outcome, and it is expected to act swiftly if the negotiations conclude without success.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

I think it is legitimate for them to say ‘No, it’s not OK to present that lecture’.“I do think that students should be exposed to controversial views. But the lecture I thought was not sound pedagogy and Eton was right to question it.”In another blow to Mr Knowland, the fashion tycoon and Old Etonian Johnnie Boden also withdrew his support. The 59-year-old founder of clothing retailer Boden had signed a petition which called for Mr Knowland’s reinstatement and accusing Eton of institutional bullying by firing him.Boden said at the time that he was extremely concerned about the incident adding: An institution I loved is losing its nerve.”But on Monday, he said that he too would like to retract his “unconditional support” for Mr Knowland, having now “watched the video and heard the arguments in more detail”.Boden said he has been assured that “lively debate of questionable views” are still very much encouraged at Eton but added “I can understand why the school cannot allow public posting of these views masquerading as facts. On Monday, a group of Old Etonians wrote to the school’s Head Master to say that Mr Knowland’s supporters have been “misleadingly” claiming that freedom of expression is at stake at the 580-year-old institution.“The reality is quite the opposite, as becomes apparent to those with common sense who watch Knowland’s lecture,” they said.“The school is defending the importance of substantiated debate in an educational setting that abides by professional and legal guidelines.”An internal panel, chaired by the school\u0027s vice-provost, will meet on Tuesday to consider Mr Knowland\u0027s appeal.If the panel upholds his dismissal, he said he is prepared to take the school to an employment tribunal and has so far crowdfunded close to £60,000 to cover potential legal costs.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pubs encouraging drinkers purchase tickets live music nights","story":"Pubs are encouraging drinkers to purchase tickets for their live music nights, in order to exploit a loophole which means customers do not have to order a \u0027substantial meal\u0027 when buying alcohol.In Tier 2 areas, live music venues are allowed to operate at 50 per cent capacity and serve alcohol to ticket holders at the bar, without them having to order a main meal as well.Now, a number of venues across the country are taking to social media to drum up support, telling customers not to “nurse half a lager all night” as they look to kickstart their businesses after a punishing second lockdown.“We will be ticketing Friday, Saturday, Sunday live music events for £3,” said The Horns in Watford, which is listed as a pub on companies house.“This also means we CAN SERVE YOU ALCOHOL WITHOUT FOOD at any of our weekends gigs,” they added.“Tickets will be sold on the door on a first come first serve basis.”New regulations brought in last week mean that the “table meal” clause does not apply “where alcohol is being provided to a customer at a cinema, theatre, concert hall or sports ground.” The alcohol must be “ordered by, and served to, a customer who has a ticket for an exhibition of a film, a performance or an event of training or competition at the venue, to consume in the area where the audience is seated to watch the exhibition, performance or event.”This has been a lifeline for small pubs which double up as live music venues.In South London the Cavern Freehouse wrote in a social media post: “We will be selling Tickets to get in on the door on the night. Doors open at 5pm, Bands start at 8pm and bar closes at 10pm. No food is now required.  “I would suggest people get here early as it will get full very quickly as I\u0027m limited to 50 people. No bookings, it\u0027s a first come basis.  “If you are someone that nurses half a lager all night then I would please ask you not to come as I\u0027m trying to survive here and that place could be taken by someone that understands that!”Sue Hathaway, who works at the venue clarified: “The Cavern is classified as a grassroots music venue, not a pub.”The guidelines originally stated that alcohol could only be served as part of a ‘substantial’ meal, but the Music Venue Trust argued that 92 per cent of grassroots music venues do not have the necessary facilities to provide this. The revised decision to allow alcohol sales, therefore, identifies the purchase of a ticket as equivalent to the purchase of a meal.Mark Davyd, CEO of Music Venue Trust, said he had worked hard with the government to make the case that the consumption of culture and the consumption of food should be treated equally.He added that he was “delighted” with the outcome.In Tier 3 areas, however, all indoor entertainment venues must remain closed.Not all pub landlords are happy with the new rules.“I’m all for live music venues being supported, but if alcohol is being singled out as a root cause of infection, then it should be subject to the same restrictions everywhere, whether it is a pub, theatre, music venue or supermarket,” said Laura Trotten, who operates the Crown in Rutland.“Until now I could see some sense in serving food in order to try and mitigate against the effects of alcohol on people’s ability to adhere to the regulations, but this just doesn’t make sense,” she told the Morning Advertiser.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"dominic cummings joke proves cracker festive judges","story":"If you thought Dominic Cummings\u0027 explanation for driving to Barnard Castle was a joke, you are not alone.A competition to find the best topical Christmas cracker joke produced this winner.

A colonnade, parapet wall and fanlight windows tie the new building to the look and feel of the White House.But critics expressed anger at the White House\u0027s announcement while the US is in the grip of the coronavirus pandemic.On Twitter there were comparisons to Marie Antoinette and the quote “Let them eat cake”, which is often attributed to her.Molly Jong-Fast, an editor at The Daily Beast, tweeted: Oh Good, those people in their ICU Beds will feel so much better knowing that Melania has finished her tennis pavilion.Eric Feigl-Ding, an epidemiologist and health economist with the Federation of American Scientists, said: How many PPEs, tests, masks, contact tracers, and ICU beds could that have bought instead?One Twitter user called the first lady Melania Antoinette:Earlier this year, as the virus began to take hold, the first lady tweeted photos of herself wearing a hard hat while reviewing blueprints for the pavilion.Her critics lashed out, with some calling the photos insensitive during the coronavirus scare.She pushed back in a follow-up tweet encouraging everyone who chooses to be negative \u0026amp question my work at the @WhiteHouse to take time and contribute something good \u0026amp productive in their own communities.In a written statement on Monday, the first lady thanked the talented craftsmen who worked on the project and the generous supporters of the White House.It is my hope that this private space will function as both a place of leisure and gathering for future First Families, she said.Biden is set to take the oath of office as the nation\u0027s 46th president on January 20.President Barack Obama, an avid basketball player, had turned the tennis court into one suitable for basketball.President Donald Trump had been a regular spectator at the annual US Open tennis tournament held in his native New York, but he has not attended since taking office.Completion of the tennis pavilion follows the first lady\u0027s redesign of the White House Rose Garden earlier this year.Mrs Trump helped break ground for the pavilion project in October 2019.

While Michael Gove has said there are no plans to introduce vaccine passports, Nadhim Zahawi, the vaccine minister, has said the Government is looking into the technology behind them. Some readers support immunity certificates, adding that it would make them feel safer in public places. However, others argued that such passports or certificates would be unethical. Read on for  readers on vaccine passports and share your view in the comments section below.Vaccine passports - why not? I would be far happier getting on a plane if I knew everyone had been vaccinated. You already need certain vaccines to travel to certain countries, yellow fever for example. So this is nothing new!Having flown on holiday this summer, I am comfortable flying regardless of a vaccine. I do not believe in coercion, and proof of antibodies or test-and-fly should be valid alternatives if someone has not been vaccinated.One could still catch flu or other illnesses on a flight, yet we have comfortably lived with those risks for decades.I have already had Covid and still maintain antibodies eight months after infection. Why should I now have to have a vaccine in order to travel internationally, or indeed do anything else?Further, have there been any tests on the use of vaccines on people whom have already got immunity?This all needs to be reconsidered in my view.Ludicrous idea. If you feel you need a \u0027freedom pass\u0027 to do normal day-to-day activities, you don\u0027t know what freedom is.If the vaccine does not prevent you passing on the virus, your passport is simply a document to travel the globe and infect, or have I missed something?An inidual’s medical information is between them and their GP, and other parts of the NHS on a need to know basis. That principle must not be breached.While it might be reasonable to ask for medical records (in confidence and with the inidual’s specific permission) before admission to a university, for example, it is not reasonable for every shop assistant and night club bouncer to demand that information. This must not be allowed to become a precedent.Vaccination passports ignore the vast quantity of people who are medically not suitable to receive the vaccine.This would stop all those people from shopping. What a kind, humanitarian attitude.When I get vaccinated I will be protected so I have no concern that someone who may stand next to me in a shop might not have the vaccine.There is no sense in that and those that are proposing that do not explain their reasoning, if there is any.If I decide not to have the vaccine and shops and indoor venues refuse me entry, I\u0027ll just take my money elsewhere. It will be their loss.Since the vaccination is being done on the NHS, and everyone has an NHS number, it should be simple to set up a system so checks can be made.I have a flu jab, annually, to prevent me from contracting the illness. I\u0027m not issued with certification that allows me access to pubs, shops, cinemas, etc. as I\u0027m protected.As far as I\u0027m aware, I can still be a carrier and infect those that haven\u0027t been inoculated but I\u0027m safe from other carriers. So far, so good.So why is there all this talk of being enforced to carry certification to show I\u0027ve received the Covid vaccine? I assume that the injection is to protect me.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"tories used understand importance human rights","story":"Human rights are a simple, but audacious idea. Every person – whatever their background, wealth, faith, gender or colour – should have certain rights that must always be defended. While they have their roots in Magna Carta of 1215, human rights were only codified properly following the tyranny and bloodshed of the two world wars that defined the first half of the 20th century in Europe. Following the defeat of Nazism, there was a shared conviction across the continent that horror on this scale must never be repeated.The European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) which resulted laid the hidden foundations that help us live together freely and fairly to this day, from the right to express an opinion to the right to fair pay, access to education, a decent place to live, privacy at home and protection from abuse.Writing for the , the Lord Chancellor, Robert Buckland, announced the political aims of his forthcoming review into the Human Rights Act, which incorporates the European Convention on Human Rights into domestic British law. It follows briefings in the Sunday  in September that Boris Johnson is planning “opt-outs” from the Human Rights Act that threaten Britain’s place in the ECHR.It is easy to take human rights for granted while they are protected, but we should not let this blind us to the fact that we all benefit from the Act every day. Human rights are essential tools that empower the public to stand up to people in power, be it the government, an employer, a landlord or a corporation.The problem with opting out of one aspect of human rights is that by doing so you undermine the legitimacy of all those rights. We cannot criticise other nations for human rights abuses if we fail to show absolute commitment to basic rights and freedoms here at home. If the changes the Government puts forward as a result of this review are inconsistent with membership of the ECHR, the UK will become the only major European nation other than Belarus which is not a signatory. It would be a backward step for a country which led the world in enshrining the values of dignity, fairness, equality, tolerance and respect.This announcement should worry those of us from all political traditions. Winston Churchill was one of the first to set out a vision for what he called a “Charter of Human Rights, guarded by freedom and sustained by law”. Another Conservative politician, David Maxwell Fyfe, later Lord Kilmuir, drafted them “as a beacon to those at the moment in totalitarian darkness”. By questioning the value of our human rights in this way, this Government has broken with a proud tradition in its party’s history.As the UK sets its new path outside the European Union, it is vital that we demonstrate that Britain will continue to stand up for the values that underpin our democracy. By abandoning the rule of law over the internal market bill, and launching attacks on judicial review and human rights, the Conservatives are not only disempowering the British public, they are trashing Britain’s global reputation.The election of Joe Biden in the US makes it even more imperative that the UK Government changes course. The president-elect plans to restore America’s “moral leadership”, end Donald Trump’s “love affair” with autocrats and make supporting human rights around the world an “early priority”.There is no way to isolate the UK more quickly from our friends in Washington, as well as Brussels, than for the Government to define itself as hostile to human rights.The Government’s mishandling of the pandemic has left Britain with one of the highest death tolls in the world and the sharpest recession of any major economy. This is not the moment for it to dilute the powers that previous generations of British people fought so hard to secure.Instead of stripping rights from the public, the Government should be doing all it can to ensure vaccines are rolled out safely, swiftly and fairly so that once again we can all enjoy the freedom the Human Rights Act guarantees.David Lammy is the shadow justice secretaryMore from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"under 18s barred buying lottery tickets government gambling","story":"Teenagers under 18 are to be barred from playing the National Lottery and other UK lotteries under a Government shake-up of gambling laws.The minimum age to participate will be raised from 16 to 18 for all online games from April, and for high-street ticket sales from October, as part of a major review of gambling laws to protect children and vulnerable people from harm.It would bring the age limit for lotteries in line with the purchase of alcohol, cigarettes and voting in a general election from next year.Ministers will also consider strict limits on how much punters can lose online and legally enforced checks on whether players can afford their losses in an attempt to reduce the estimated 400,000 problem gamblers in the UK, of which 55,000 are said to be children.There could be new curbs on sports sponsorship including a possible ban on logos on football shirts following criticism by campaigners including Church of England bishops of the 26 Premier League and Championship sides that have multi-million pound deals with betting firms.A new gambling ombudsman is being considered to act as an independent arbiter of customer complaints to work alongside the watchdog – the gambling commission – which regulates the industry.The commission could be handed increased powers to fine errant gambling firms. To date, its biggest fine was issued against casino operator Caesars in April this year for £13 million for “systemic failings” that included allowing one customer to lose £1.6 million in a three-month period.The Government consultation, which will last until March 31 next year, signals a sharp brake on the liberalisation of gambling which was brought in by the government of then prime minister Tony Blair in 2007 but failed to anticipate the surge in betting unleashed by the growth of the internet and smartphones.Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, Oliver Dowden said: Whilst millions gamble responsibly, the Gambling Act is an analogue law in a digital age. From an era of having a flutter in a high-street bookmaker, casino, racecourse or seaside pier, the industry has evolved at breakneck speed. This comprehensive review will  ensure we are tackling problem gambling in all its forms to protect children and vulnerable people. It will also help those who enjoy placing a bet to do so safely.”It follows a series of high profile cases of suicide and crime in gambling. Earlier this year, engineer Chris Bruney, 25, killed himself hours after online gaming software supplier Playtech plied him with £400 in bonuses.The issue sparked the creation of a 150-strong cross-party lobby of MPs and Lords and is backed by the Prime Minister Boris Johnson.The Gambling Commission has already banned betting credit cards and is conducting a review into gambling-like elements in children\u0027s video games.The Government is also investigating whether to ban \u0027loot boxes\u0027 in gaming, which have been blamed for drawing children into betting by offering prizes that can be then gambled for cash.New games could have to be tested or graded for addictiveness before they are launched under measures to boost online protection for children.Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Sport, Heritage and Tourism, Nigel Huddleston said: “We’re committed to protecting young people from gambling related harm which is why we are  raising the minimum age for the National Lottery. “Patterns of play have changed since its inception, with a shift towards online games, and this change will help make sure the National Lottery, although already low-risk, is not a gateway to problem gambling.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus tiers map england restrictions rules","story":"Article bookmarkedFind your bookmarks in your Independent Premium section, under my profileDon\u0026#x27t show me this message again✕Most of the country will be under tougher rules than before the lockdown after government scientists warned previous measures were not effective enough to stem rising Covid-19 infections.The Department for Health published details of which tiers areas would be in on Thursday as Matt Hancock outlined the plans in the Commons.Only a handful of areas have been placed in tier 1, where the restrictions are the most limited.

He said: The application is on the basis firstly that Miss Begum is a Member of Parliament for Poplar and Limehouse and since the murder of Jo Cox, MPaposs are advised to take higher regard to their security and is not usually safe practice to reveal details of home addresses. Secondly thereaposs issues with members of the Labour Party.

But fishing, while itaposs worth comparatively little to the UK, is politically impossible to ignore. Itaposs emblematic of the entire Brexit argument - Britannia ruling the waves as a sovereign nation, evil Johnny Foreigner nicking our fish and chips, and a load of old pollocks pretending to be something theyaposre not.Because while Johnson and his Hard Brexit weirdos bang on about piracy on the high seas, theyaposre forgetting the uncomfortable fact that the British fishing industry is not particularly British. Most of the British fishing fleet is controlled by just five firms - pescatarian barons who send supertrawlers out to scrape the seas of all that might be edible. The fuel their ships use is heavily subsidised by the EU.Government statistics show % of the deckhands are foreign nationals, who are cheaper and, as of January , will need to apply for visas to do the work theyaposre underpaid for, or  do it in France.They mostly fish for mackerel, which has the most profits, and itaposs mostly all sold to Europe. And less than three-quarters of it is from UK waters. The rest comes from - gasp - foreign seas.But % less mackerel is landed than in , even though the quotas have been set higher than science advises, because the drive for cash means fish stocks are disappearing.Oh, and at least one of these barons donated to the Vote Leave campaign. He must be VERY clever.Johnson is tying himself in knots over an industry with , fishermen, not all of whom are British. By comparison, the collapse of Arcadia about which the government is doing nothing involves , jobs, the failure of Debenhams risks , jobs, and the UK car industry which will collapse in a No Deal Brexit involves , workers, directly and indirectly. And , as threatened, Britain turns down an EU agreement for the sake of those fishermenaposs right to not bump into les Francaises dans le mer, those same fishermen will be facing big EU tarfs on the mackerel which they will be less able to sell abroad, but which will suddenly turn up, nice and cheap, on our supermarket shelves next to the chorinated chicken. And donapost assume, for a moment, that they can merelyto fishing for cod, and weaposll all get cheaper fish and chips. About % of the cod we consume comes from the waters around Norway and Iceland. Neither are EU members, but both are in the European Economic Area, and allow our fleet into their waters under its rules. After Brexit, they both want to fish in our waters too. So no sharing our waters, no chip supper.  To sum up - we fish in other waters, rely on foreigners to fish in our own waters, sell and buy fish with European nations, and in protecting fishing rights, are only protecting the rights of about five major corporations, some of which are foreign-owned.Itaposs the perfect emblem of Brexit, in that youaposre being lied to in order to convince you to support a thing which is ultimately more damaging than the thing youaposve already got.And thereaposs no need for the lies, because thereaposs a good pro-Brexit argument for fishing. These fleets burn huge amounts of oil that, after Brexit, will need to be subsidised in a world that wants to be greener. Post-Brexit, the government could tie fuel subsidies to cleaner vessels, better wages, higher safety standards.Quotas set by the EU have, according to campaigners, been far too high compared to the scientic advice on keeping the seas well-stocked. After we leave, we could set better quotas in our own waters, trading access to them with other nations infor healthier numbers of fish.And we could also use the laws of the sea as a blueprint for how we should deal with Europe after Brexit - co-operation, mutual interest, a better environment, and an understanding that,the fish get to keep their freedom of movement, perhaps humans could remember that borders are optional, too."},{"url":null,"title":"10 steps coronavirus vaccine needs","story":"News steps coronavirus vaccine needs to take to get from factory to inside your bodyFrom around the clock production at Pfizer’s plant in Puurs, Belgium to the UK’s biggest immunisation plan since the polio vaccine was delivered in the mid s - we chart the steps the Covid- vaccine will take to protect usmirrorShareCommentsByMatt Roper:,  DEC Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video grandmother-becomes-first-world-receive-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

The UK is aiming to become the first country to immunise its entire population - but how will we achieve it  Here, we show how the vaccine will get from the factory to inside your body… . Production  Employees at Pfizer’s plant in the small town of Puurs, Belgium, are working around the clock to produce doses of the Covid- vaccine with , vials coming off the factory’s huge automated production line every minute. . Ice boxes The vaccine must be stored at around -C so Pfizer has designed travel cases that hold , to , doses that keep the shots ultra cold for  days. . By air, sea and road The vaccines are transported to the UK by lorry via the Channel Tunnel and plane. When production is at its height,  trucks will be leave the factory every day. GPS trackers and thermo sensors packed inside the boxes will relay back location and temperature information to ensure safe delivery. The army could be drafted in to help. . NHS hubs  Around , vaccination centres, run by GPs, are already prepared to receive the vials. But it is thought the first batches will go to hospitals, which are best equipped to store and dispense the vaccines within the time limits.It is not known when exactly the  hubs [ see list below ] – spread across the country from Newcastle to Truro – will receive doses as they are starting to administer the jab at dferent times, but deliveries are expected to arrive throughout the week.. Storage  Once the vials arrive at hospitals they will be stored in special ultra-low temperature freezers with room for up to five millions doses nationwide. At the community-based vaccination centres, the vials can be kept in normal fridges for up to five days. . Jabs begin  The first , doses will begin to be administered in hospitals, to frontline health staff, care-home workers and people over  who already have outpatient appointments. Vaccination centres will then operate from am to pm, seven days a week, each vaccinating at least , people over that period. . Mass roll-out  In the UK’s biggest immunisation plan since the polio vaccine was delivered in the mid s, mass hubs will open, including town halls and football stadiums. Mobile vaccination vans that visit care homes and prisons are planned. More than , extra staff are being recruited while St John Ambulance is training , volunteers. . Waiting your turn NHS staff and care-home workers will be contacted by their employer giving details of how theycan be vaccinated.Eligible members of the public should wait to receive a letter or text message from the NHS. . Second shot  Those who go for their first vaccine will be given a date tofor their second, three weeks later. Maximum immunity should be received one week after their second dose. They will also receive a credit card-sized Covid ID card proving they have received the two jabs, with the vaccine batch number and the date it was administered. . Testing of how well it works...  Those who have been vaccinated will be asked to take part in long-term monitoring for possible side effects. People’s immunity levels will also be monitored – it is currently unclear whether the vaccines will need to be administered every year.

Lori Addison-Simmons, , said she gritted her teeth to carry on with her job at Hermes as she is a single mother needing to provide for her two children. But she described feeling depressed and anxious and being like a robot while working for the delivery company - which she joined in January, StokeonTrentLive reports. Lori would load her car at the firmaposs Fenton depot at am and work flat out to complete her delivery run around Longton and Dresden by pm six days a week.  The courier described how she changed car five times in the course of her one-year employment at the company. But what afflicted her most was how she had no time to be there for her two children. Lori said: “I was getting home late. My daughter goes to secondary school and she was coming in and I was not getting in until around pm. “It was not fair on her and when I was at home I was too tired to do anything.  The job is supposed to fit around you and your circumstances. But there was one day when I had  items and got a call to say there were another  on my run. My car was already full and yet I needed to go back to the depot to pick another  up. “The most I had in the house would be about  parcels. That includes big boxes and packets. My living room was once taken over.” Lori says she was paid for each item delivered. It was p for a packet and £ for heavier parcels. Matters came to a head last month when her vehicle broke down - with  parcels in her car. She secured cover to deliver some of the parcels and faced having to take the rest on foot.  Lori added: “I was told they had to go out that day. But I couldnapost take them on foot because some of the streets were right up the top of Abbey Hulton. I was not doing that. “I’d given them almost a yearaposs commitment and I couldnapost take anymore. “I loved the job because I loved the customers. They were the ones keeping me going but I felt just like a number. “Sometimes the customers don’t understand how pressured we are and when I went out to deliver I put a smile on and had a joke but sometimes I was dying inside because I was so upset. “During one of my rounds I broke down in the car and I just felt fed-up and ignored.

Things looked so bad that owner Susannah Lovegrove, who pulled him from the fox’s jaws, was told it might be kinder to put him down. But after losing Ronnie’s brother Reggie and mate Cagney in the attack, Susannah was desperate to save him. She says: “I hatched him and his brother Reggie under a hen. “They grew up quite naughty ducks, chasing the other chickens and the dog. So we got them some wives. “I was totally devastated when Reggie and one of the girls were killed in the fox attack, so I was determined to save Ronnie in any way I could. “After the attack in June, I did think it’d be a case of having him put to sleep, which was heart-breaking. But we wanted to give him every chance.” Her determination saved Ronnie’s le. She says: “The vet agreed to give it a couple days to see what happened.  “Thankfully some feeling did come back in his legs and feet and so we agreed to give him pain relief and get him some physio.” Susannah, who lives with husband Giles and three children in Oxfordshire, built Ronnie a wheelchair to support and protect him while he learned to walk again. Now he is recovering well and even has his own yoga mat for his daily exercise routine. The three-year-old duck has won a Daily Mirror Animal Hero Special Recognition Award for his bravery.  Susannah says: “We do daily ­exercises on his yoga mat, he has daily swimming sessions in the bath, and he has massage on his feet and legs to help nerve repair. “I even built him his own set of wheels, it’s basically a sling on wheels, which you can push around. It simulates the treadmill, and also gives him support when he is eating, washing and preening himself. It also gives him social time with the other ducks without them trampling on him.” Before the attack, cheeky Ronnie used to chase the family dog Willow and stick his head through the cat flap to taunt her. But now that injured Ronnie sleeps indoors at night the pair have become firm friends, and even snuggle up together in the kitchen.  “Willow seems to have accepted Ronnie and is very good with him, allowing him to share her bed and she even lets him have a little beak nuzzle,” Susannah says. “I think she knows he can’t chase her any more, so she can relax!” Due to his complex needs, Susannah has had to take Ronnie with her on trips as far away as Cornwall and Bedfordshire.

April Sweeney, , is charging £ per raffle ticket for a chance to win the £, semi-detached house which comes with three bedrooms and a garden. The Stockport property, in Greater Manchester, comes with a sitting tenant which means the lucky winner will become an instant landlord. April, a former estate agent, is also offering to pay any stamp duty as well as a £, cash prize. The mum, of Stockport, plans to donate £, of the proceeds to charities and travel the world with her husband Lee and their four children. In an online advert, April said: It has been a really dficult year and we felt by raffling off our house, which is typically rented out and provides an income for us, we could help to give something back to the people who are struggling the most. “As well as raffling off our house, we’re donating £, to charities close to our hearts. There’s a lot of focus on fundraising for the NHS right now which is brilliant, but we’re worried that so many other charities are going to slip through the net and be forgotten.  “Some people have been left homeless and many more jobless, and this is an opportunity for them to gamble just five pounds of their money and win a lovely home or start a business with no strings attached. The house was recently valued at £, and features off-road parking, two separate reception rooms and a large back garden. Results will be announced in November next year and the winner will also not have to pay legal fees. April added: aposaposIt really is a brilliant opportunity, and the lt people need after a really terrible year.”  The couple decided against putting the house on the market as they feared many house hunters might struggle to get finance due to the pandemic. Instead, April said her the raffle means buyers will get a once in a letime opportunity to get a property mortgage free. April, whose husband Lee is a property landlord, had been thinking about travelling for some time. But they worried that listing a house for sale during a pandemic was a bad idea and would be impossible due to the financial struggles many have faced.  April said: “This year has been an eye-opener for a lot of people and we’ve really realised what truly matters. aposaposWe have always wanted to go travelling and show our children, who are aged , , eight and six, the world. After everything that’s happened this year, it made us realise there’s no time like the present and we shouldn’t hold back. Our eldest children are getting to a stage where they might not want to go away with us for much longer, so it’s now or never.  The family have many destinations on their travel bucket list with a particular interest in Vietnam and Cambodia. April added: aposaposThere are so many beautul places we’d love to see, in particular we’d love to visit Vietnam and Cambodia. “Our friends think we’re having a midle crisis, but we feel we’re giving back and doing something wonderful. Raffling our house will give us the ability to travel the world whilst also allowing somebody to live mortgage free or to become their own boss.

To tell you the truth I got this opportunity of doing it, and I was in hospital. It was a great opportunity, added Mrs Keenan, who only retired from her job in a jewellers four years ago.

If you are not sick of data by now, then the ZOE Covid Symptom Study app presents its daily data from experts at health science company ZOE and Kingaposs College London, in a handy new dashboard. It shows the prevalence rate - cases per , of the population - of coronavirus for every area in England as well as the rate among people aged  and above. In a glimmer of hope, it shows only five subregions which are in Tier  and where the case rate is rising. This includes the county of Suffolk in the East of England, and in the South East, the combined subregion of Reading, Wokingham, Bracknell Forest, Windsor and Maidenhead and West Berkshire has seen cases rise. Meanwhile, in the South West region, the apossubregionapos of Wiltshire and Swindon has also seen cases rise. And in the North West, the apossubregionapos of Warrington and Cheshire has also seen cases increase. If these places continue to see cases rise they could enter the dreaded Tier  next week when the tiers are set to be reviewed. The ZOE Covid Symptom Study report is presented to the Government each day. The latest report shows that the majority of England has seen cases per , of the population fall or remain the same. But it is bad news for the Warwickshire, Coventry and Solihull subregion in the West Midlands region, as they sit in the toughest Tier  and are seeing cases rise - meaning they may be stuck there for a while yet. And in Yorkshire, in the Humber, cases have also increased in the Tier  area. Areas in Tier  which have seen cases increase Suffolk Reading Wokingham Bracknell Forest Windsor MaidenheadWest Berkshire WiltshireSwindon Warrington CheshireAreas in Tier  which have seen cases increase Warwickshire Coventry Solihull The HumberAreas which are seeing cases go downGreater Manchester Cumbria Liverpool city region Tees ValleyNorth East West Yorkshire York and North Yorkshire Derby and Derbyshire Nottingham and Nottinghamshire Lincolnshire Staffordshire and Stoke-on-Trent Shropshire and Telford and Wreakin Worcestershire Herefordshire London Hertfordshire Norfolk Kent and Medway East and West Sussex, and Brighton and Hove Oxfordshire Devon Dorset, Bournemouth, Christchurch and PooleThe ZOE Covid Symptom Study UK Infection Survey figures are based on around one million weekly reporters and the proportion of newly symptomatic users who have positive swab tests. Leading the team is Professor Tim Spector, a Professor of Genetic Epidemiology of Kingaposs College London and Principal Investigator of the ZOE Covid Symptom Study app. He tweeted on Friday: We launched today on the ZOE app, a complex dashboard about the stats for English tiers based on the govt criteria on prevalence, trends and NHS capacity.  Prof Spector said his team would be simplying the format of the data - but it is currently available to all users who self-report on the app. The boffin said Englandaposs R rate of transmission is at around . across England. But it is above  in Wales. The capital London is now seeing more new cases than in the North, where new infections have remained stable. The ZOE Covid Symptom Study UK Infection Survey found that there are , daily new symptomatic cases of the virus in the UK on average over the two weeks up to November , excluding care homes.  This compares to , daily new symptomatic cases a week ago and more than , six weeks ago, the researchers said. The survey found that in Scotland, cases have fallen to the same levels of the end of September, but recently plateaued and there are still around , infectious iniduals. It found that in Wales, cases have fallen to around the same level as the end of the September but have started to rise again. Prof Spector said it was encouraging to see the falling rates, but warned against complacency. Itaposs encouraging to see rates are still falling across most of the UK, and weaposre now below , cases, less than half the peak of the second wave we saw in October.  However, while we are also seeing steady falls in admissions now, itaposs important that we arenapost complacent. Even though the UK will start the vaccine rollout next week, many of us wonapost be getting one for a few months, so keeping the numbers low and under control is really important for the NHS. Iaposm confident that Zoeaposs app data really is the most up-to-date picture we have, he said. The latest survey figures were based on data from , swab tests done between November  to . Boris Johnsonaposs toughened  Tiers lockdown system will be reviewed every two weeks. As it was implemented on December , this means Wednesday next week will be the date of the first review.  Decisions will be made based on the latest case rate data, how much capacity the NHS has and what advice and recommendations are made by local directors of public health. Any changes will come into effect on December , after a decision is made at a Cabinet committee. The plan is to have the tiers system brought back before Parliamen on January , by which time it will have been reviewed four times. Vaccine details emerging It comes as Downing Street today confirmed more details of who will be first in line to get the vaccine when the first doses are delivered tomorrow. Alongside the those already revealed to be in line for doses, No  has confirmed that people being discharged from hospital after treatment will also be eligible for the vaccine - so long as they meet one of the other criteria. The first priority groups for hospitals will be people over , those who work in care homes or on the front lines of the NHS.  Care home residents are also in the first batch of the priority list but roll-out to them has been delayed because the approval to break up doses of the vaccine for delivery to inidual homes was not confirmed until today. A Downing Street spokesperson said: The NHS set out over the weekend that we have , doses available. The first of the vaccine will go to people over  alongside care home workers and frontline NHS workers. They have also set out that a small number of NHS primary care networks will begin delivering the vaccine from next week, the week beginning the th. They also confirmed that hospitals will be inviting people who already have out patients appointmentsthey meet the criteria - as will people who are leaving the hospital after treatment. The others will join throughout December and the coming months, they added. Asked about when care homes will begin to recieve doses, they added: The process of delivering care home will begin shortly...I donapost have a date. Care homes are rightly at the top of the list so they will be prioritised. Downing Street dismissed the prospect of NHS vaccination cards becoming a form of “immunity passport” to allow people who have received the jab to enjoy extra freedoms. “We have been clear that there are no plans to introduce immunity passports,” the Prime Minister’s official spokesperson said. “The cards … are NHS reminder cards that prompt people to get the second dose that they need. “That’s a well-established practice in the NHS to offer people cards to remind them of their next appointment.” The Government said it expects “the majority” of vulnerable people will be vaccinated in January and February.

The Navy will say it is all contained but clearly it isn’t, especially when people just blatantly ignore the rules. The place is riddled with it.

Pupils at Edgar Stammers Primary Academy were expected to eat a apossmall amount of mash served in a Yorkshire puddingapos without any cutlery.The youngsters are having school dinners delivered to their classrooms to prevent them from mixing with children from other bubbles in the coronavirus pandemic. A reduced menu of finger food is being offered at the West Midlands school in Walsall to ensure this is done as safely as possible, Birmingham Live reports.But parents were unhappy to discover their little ones were left to eat mash with their hands, with one calling it an utter joke. Headteacher Darren Mann admitted in a letter to parents that not all feedback was positive. He said: As parents know, we have been trying to increase the amount of hot food in the menu, but with the restriction of it being classed as finger food. Today, as part of the lunch, we had a small amount of mash that was served in a Yorkshire pudding to enable the children to pick it up and eat together.  Unfortunately, the feedback from this from some parents and children has not been positive. Weaposd like to thank these parents and children for their feedback and we realise that it hasnapost worked today. We will look to adapt the menu again to try and make it better and easier for the children. In his letter, sent at the end of November, Mr Mann reassured parents he had expressed the desire to bring back cutlery as soon as possible via the University of Wolverhampton Multi Academy Trust .  He added: I have also informed our academy trust of our desire to start using cutlery as soon as possible. As soon as it is deemed safe under their Covid restrictions, we will let all parents and children know. Professor Michelle Shaw, CEO at UWMAT, said picnic lunches were being served in brown bags as plates, hot food and utensils aposcould not be transported around schools safelyapos. She said: All our school leaders work very closely with their catering teams to continue to provide hot meals for our children throughout the pandemic. Arrangements at lunchtimes are in place to ensure that children do not mix with children from other bubbles, meaning that children are having their food brought to them in their areas of the school buildings instead of using school dining halls. To ensure that this is done as safely as possible, hot meals are provided in aposgrab bagapos style packaging.Prof Shaw said the school has increased hygiene measures and that pupils washed their hands before and after meals, with limited use of hard utensils.  She reassured menus are carefully planned to ensure they comply with school food standards, including dferent foods each week including fruit and veg. She added:All decisions that we make are carefully considered and we highly value the views of all our school communities, encouraging our parents carers and children to give feedback. With health and safety as the priority in all our schools, all of our Covid risk assessments are reviewed regularly and procedures are updated accordingly. We have ensured that we keep our children safe by limiting the use of hard utensils which may spread the virus, and continue to monitor the situation following all available guidance.

Dr David Hepburn, an intensive care consultant at the Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport who caught Covid- himself, has discussed worries around the vaccine and why it is completely safe to take. Margaret Keenan, , was the first person to ever receive a Covid- vaccine, as apart of the biggest vaccination programme in NHS history this morning. She was among up to a  people set up to have the jab, which arrived in an insulated container only minutes before the injection. Now the inoculations have begun, the next challenge is making sure people receive it with some anxious about taking the vaccine that Dr Hepburn described as a aposgame changerapos.  Prime Minister Boris Johnson said people should not be afraid of getting vaccinated, and that people objecting to having the jab are ‘totally wrong’.He went on to say: ‘Itaposs safe, itaposs the right thing to do, itaposs good for you and itaposs good for the whole country.’ Dr Hepburn told WalesOnline : There is no agenda, there is no deep state conspiracy. Nobody is trying to inject you with microchips. Look at who you get your information from. Do you get your information from renowned scientists, big academic departments, your local doctors and medical staff or do you get it from something that a person has posted anonymously on Facebook In a QA he has spoken in depth about the vaccine including about possible side effects, how it is produced and explained why it as been able to be produced so quickly and stay safe. What was your reaction when you first heard about the new vaccine being approved  David Hepburn: It was fantastic news. I was absolutely elated because it was never a certainty we would get an effective vaccine so the fact they had one which was more than % effective could be a complete game-changer. I am and most of my colleagues are very pleased about that. Anything that can shorten the le of this pandemic has to be a good thing in my book. Some people are not necessarily anti-vaccine but they are concerned about how quickly it has been turned around. What do you say to those people  It may seem to have come along very fast and a lot of people are a bit worried about that. But when it normally takes  years to produce a vaccine a lot of that is dead time. If I wanted to develop a new vaccine the first thing you need to do is get seed money to do it and then I need to do investment rounds to get companies interested in putting the money into producing it. What I am also making the vaccine for can also be is a big problem. For example, say I come up with an idea for a vaccine for herpes. That is a disease that affects people fairly commonly but it is a bit niche and doesnapost have the huge, huge numbers we are seeing with Covid. One of the problems with getting a vaccine for something like that is that you need volunteers who are willing to try the vaccine and you also need a certain level of incidence in the community because the way studies are run in phase three is that you give half a people the vaccine and half the people a placebo. You follow those two groups till you get a trigger number of patients developing the disease. You are hoping that will be in the placebo group not in the vaccine group.  If you have a disease which isnapost very common in the community it can take years to reach the correct number before you can stop the trial. Because Covid is very widespread in the community and lots of people are catching it you can reach that level very quickly. Are there any other reasons that is has been produced so quickly  The other thing to say is there is no shortage of volunteers because everybody wants to see a vaccine for this disease so people were queuing up to be guinea pigs, essentially, for the first trial. Normally in vaccine trials the recruitment of your test groups takes an awfully long time so that cuts down the speed signicantly. Also the key is getting funding from drug companies or governments to pay for the research and that can often involve lots of resubmissions of funding applications which can be rejected or need to be changed. That red tape really slows things down. With Covid- lots of those barriers were removed because everybody is looking for a Covid- vaccine. Bringing out a vaccine and bringing it to trial takes a lot of money because you need to set up centres for recruitment etc. The whole process of finding funding and getting it approved and finding groups takes an awfully long time. But this has been made much quicker because Covid is the only game in town.  Every single vaccine and treatment could have side effects. Youaposve mentioned before it is a balance and weighing up the risks. Can you explain more about this  Vaccines are one of the safest treatments you can give people. We know that because there are lots and lots of vaccines out there that have been given for a number of years. You have the early reactions which are things like allergic reactions or short-term effects like feeling a bit rundown and a headache etc. These are very common with lots of vaccines. They usually happen within a couple of days of having it. There are rarer and more unusual side effects and here we are talking like between one in , to a one in ,, chance. Youaposve got to remember that vaccines are not a drug so they have got no pharmacological ingredients that are going to affect you in the same way that drugs do. They are either dead viruses that are injected into you so the body can recognise the viral proteins – and that is the basis of the Oxford vaccine – [or] alternatively they are a new type of vaccine called the mRNA vaccine which tells your body to produce a protein which is part of the virus so you are basically, rather than injecting a bit of dead virus into yourself, making your own bits of virus using your protein factories in your bodies so your antibodies can recognise it as foreign and deal with it.  So is it up to the person taking it to weigh up the risks  Every time we have a new set of flu vaccines there will be one or two people who suffer a form of vaccine reaction which is called antibody-mediated. This is when you get a vaccine and your body makes antibodies which are little proteins which recognise foreign invaders. What can happen is when you get a vaccine that instead of recognising the viral proteins of a foreign invader your body can accidentally, due to cross-reactivity, recognise some of your own cells as foreign invaders and then they prime your immune system to attack those cells. This can create something called Guillain-Barre syndrome and can happen after jabs but they can also happen after infections as well. That can cause worsening paralysis but generally does get better. There have been a few cases of that associated with the flu vaccine every year but in terms of the numbers of people who have a flu vaccine itaposs very, very small and very, very unlikely. You are more likely to get Guillain-Barre syndrome as a result of having food poisoning you get in your local takeaway then you are from a vaccine. It is all relative risk. You have up to one in a million chance of getting it from a vaccination but you have one in  risk of dying of Covid and probably a much higher risk of Long Covid. Think about operations. With operations there is a risk. There is a risk of bleeding and there is a risk of infection as well as blood clots and other things going wrong. Butthe operation is going to make you better you accept those risks – and vaccinations are exactly the same. Youaposre probably at more risk getting in your car every morning to take the kids to school. Our lives are all about calculated risks. Can misinformation about vaccinations be damaging  You have to weigh up the risks. I think most people are intelligent enough that they can weigh up the ious risks. You only have to look at the very much discredited and  work of Andrew Wakefield, who has now been struck off, who suggested there was a link between the MMR vaccine and autism. This has been categorically disproved and he had a big agenda in this, carried out very unethical experiments and then drew a conclusion that no-one has ever been able to replicate. But even the suggestion of this put people off vaccinating their kids.  Do you think there is a problem with the amount of people who are getting their information from social media Lately there has been a move to,I quote Michael Gove, have had enough of experts.This vaccine has come about because of a lot of work by scientists and assessed by the Medicines  Healthcare products Regulatory Agency who are very, very vigorous and independent scrutineers of these things. There is no agenda, there is no deep state conspiracy. Nobody is trying to inject you with microchips. Look at who you get your information from. Do you get your information from renowned scientists, big academic departments and your local doctors and medical staff or do you get it from something that a person has posted anonymously on Facebook  We all need to be looking at where we get our sources of information from. Are they credible  If a guy on Facebook is saying this is all a conspiracy but youaposve got most of the worldaposs scientists saying aposThis is not a conspiracy and here is the science behind itapos an intelligent person should be able to work out what is a more reliable source of information. I can understand people having misgivings of anything new and it does seem to have come about very quickly but actually understanding why it has come out quickly is important.

The first jabs give us genuine hope we will finally beat a pandemic which has killed tens of thousands and devastated the economy. But there is also fear a Government that committed deadly errors will fail again. If that happens, Boris Johnson and his Conservative MPs will never be forgiven. NHS and public health experts must be in charge every step of the way or the work of brilliant scientists will be undermined. We can all play our part by continuing to obey restrictions and by being inoculated when we are invited to be, ignoring the  scaremongering of crackpot anti-vaxxers. V-Day is a day to celebrate and to keep our guard up. Deal us in, PM Crashing out of the European Union without a trade deal would be catastrophic for Britain and damaging to  neighbours, so an agreement is beneficial to all. Boris Johnson must not be precious, and Michel Barnier and Ursula von der Leyen must be prepared to compromise during last-ditch talks in Brussels this week. The stakes are too high for Johnson to cling to his pre-referendum plan. His lies and nostalgic images of sovereignty are threatening jobs and livelihoods.

The coronavirus vaccine taskforce chairwoman made the comments as the NHS begins a phased rollout of Pfizeraposs Covid- jab to older people, health staff and care home workers. Ms Bingham told BBC Radio aposs Today programme: My gut feel is that we will all be going on summer holidays. It is likely that those people most at risk will be vaccinated through to April, and then the JCVIand the Department for Health will then consider how to broaden out the vaccinations to other adults. I think by the summer we should be in a much better place to get on planes. I donapost think weaposre going to get away from this virus ever - so weaposre going to have to maintain sensible hygiene and washing hands, and so on. I would like this vaccine to be as routine as an annual flu jab and that we manage it rather than get bowed down by it. She said she was delighted the UK is the first country to start vaccination, and said she expected the Oxford vaccine would get approved too - though said there were plansit does not come through. I am optimistic that the Oxford vaccine will get approved, and because of what we have put in place in terms of our industrial legacy and those plans, we will be in a much better position for the future for generating new vaccines as and when we need them. Health Secretary Matt Hancock shared Ms Binghamaposs optimism for some normality next year, saying he has great hopes for the summer and hopes that restrictions can be lted from the spring. He told BBC Radio aposs Today programme: Weaposve said that we think that, from the spring, things can start getting back to normal, and, because weaposve been able to get this vaccination programme going sooner than anywhere  in the world, weaposll be able to bring that date forward a bit.

One manaposs attempt to enjoy a TV show while flying on a plane took an unexpected and x-rated turn recently. A fellow passenger detailed the embarrassing incident on TikTok, and itaposs made others howl with laughter - and cringe. Not long into the flight, it all went wrong for the unfortunate passenger as he tried to relax during the long journey. A traveller sitting behind him started filming him after noticing that he was seemingly watching something explicit on his phone. As he zoomed in on the phone screen, a woman can be seen looking very, err, happy with herself. The caption on the video said: Not sure what the bloke in front is watching on the screen. The person who filmed the cheeky clip joked: When your [sic] sat on your flight and the guy in front is having more fun than you. Luckily for the unknown passenger, there is a simple explanation. He was watching Channel  comedy series Peep Show. starring David Mitchell and Robert Webb, which ran from  until .  It featured friends Mark and Jeremy who shared a flat in London and hung out with a range of dysal characters, including drug-loving Super Hans. So not a show for children - but not an X-rated film that you canapost watch with strangers surrounding you in a metal tube in the sky. The video of the mortying incident has been watched more than , times since being shared on TikTok. One person joked: When you try to relax on a plane and it goes very, very wrong.

Saints, however, failed to harness the wind advantage and it was the home side who looked the more threatening in the early stages.Skipper Lewis Buchanan registered Saints first effort on goal in the th minute, cutting in from the right to send a well-struck shot just wide of the postage stamp corner.Saints manager Donald Black made early use of the agreed rolling substitutes policy, sending on Fraser MacFarlane in the th minute to replace Alan Buchanan in the centre forward#s role.It didn#t take MacFarlane long to make an impact and his neat turn on the edge of the D created the space for a right foot volley which arced away from the Red Star keeper#s right hand to nestle in the bottom corner and give Saints a st minute lead.Red Star cancelled out the Saints advantage on the stroke of half-time after good work on the right from Chris Hart took him all the way to the bye-line from where his cutback picked out Stuart MacLean on the six-yard line for an easy finish.With the wind gathering pace, a long second half was in prospect for Saints and it took the hosts just four minutes to capitalise on their controlled first half performance when central defender Ben Forbes poked home an Andy Weir right wing corner through a sea of legs.After Lewis Buchanan had headed a th minute Andy Weir left wing corner off the line, Weir#s follow up delivery from the opposite flank picked out right full back Coll McCallum eight yards out for the home side#s third goal.Red Star stretched their advantage still further on the hour mark when Ben Forbes whipped a wind assisted free-kick from the halfway line into the postage stamp corner giving Murdo MacKenzie no chance.After keeping the hosts at bay for  minutes, Saints conceded a fth goal with almost the last kick of the ball. Murdo MacKenzie did well to parry a dipping -yard Aaron Moore shot, but luck deserted the Saints keeper when the ball broke to Ewan Litster, who chipped over the stranded keeper into the unguarded net.With the rain coming horizontally, both sets of players were delighted to hear referee Jimmy Litster#s final whistle immediately after the restart signalling a stampede for the sanctuary of the ious cars and vans in the school car park."},{"url":null,"title":"science matters unravelling our deep origins","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

We know that our early ancestors split from chimpanzees, our closest ape relative, around - million years ago , and that the first near-humans of our genusevolved in Africa at least . Myr.These forerunners eventually gave rise to us , but our knowledge of what happened between these dates is very limited, largely because fossilised remains are extremely rare.Common illustrations depicting how our upright posture, facial features and lack of body hair gradually evolved are based on few skeletons of ancient ancestors. Most notable is that of Lucy, a young female skeleton dating back to . Myr.Lucy was discovered in the Afar depression, Ethiopia, in , and was assigned to a species more primitive than ours , and named A. afarensis after her location. In the s a few teeth and bone fragments were found that proved to be similar to, but even older than, Lucy, dating from ^ Myr and called A. anamensis. it was assumed that Lucy was directly descended from this ancient primate.Not surprisingly, there was much excitement in the field when anthropologist Yohannes Haile-Selassie discovered a near-complete skull of A. anamensis dating from approximately . Myr. He found the skull, simply known as MRD for now, during his fieldworks at Woranso-Mille, Ethiopia, in . As the oldest and most-complete skull of A. anamensis, this find allowed detailed comparison with Lucy’s species.There was general agreement that, like the illustration, our ancient ancestors descended one from another in a linear fashion. So most experts assumed that A. anamensis evolved directly into Lucy’s species.Haile-Selassie’s detailed study of MRD suggests, however, that the two species co-existed in Africa for at least , years, presumably with the potential for interbreeding. This undoubtedly shakes up previous thoughts and reshapes our understanding of Homo evolution.But only time will tell Haile-Salassie says he hopes to find the rest of MRD’s skeleton # and even earlier members of our Homo genus # which should certainly help unravel our deep past."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast episode 17 congratulations and jubilations","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Some applicants do not have English as their first language and Citizens Advice Bureauoffices have experience in obtaining advice via interpreters.Outreach clinics, centred in local area job centres, are also a feature of the CAB service and enable job centre staff to refer clients directly to a CAB Advisor based there for a day.Any cuts will increase the workload on CAB offices exponentially as thousands more may be made redundant, find they have no income of any kind, and turn to CAB for advice. Cuts will undoubtedly affect the vulnerable in our society immediately, with theIn cities such as Glasgow, the closure of offices would mean that many claimants could find it impossible to travel to other parts of the city and, in any case, with an already growing list of applicants those offices would soon be overwhelmed,they are not already.Several members of CAB staff have already been made redundant. I believe that more may follow without additional funding.In Glasgow alone, five offices face closure, though it is estimated that in excess of , people in Glasgow sought advice from these offices in the last year. This is likely to be the case in major cities around Scotland.Our petition calls on the Scottish Parliament to urge the Scottish Government to provide urgent funding to Citizens Advice Scotland. It can be found on the Scottish Parliament website # petition number PE: Urgent funding for Citizens Advice Bureaux.Alistair S Stephen, by emailSir,The Covert Human Intelligence Sources Bill currently going through Westminster, dubbed the Spy Cop Bill, gives agencies including police, armed forces, HMRC, and even the Food Standards Agency permission to break the law with impunity.These agencies will be permitted to break international and domestic law in direct contravention of the Geneva Convention on human rights.Why is this legislation being brought in, and why are HMRC and the Food Standards Agency being given such powers  It is beyond belief that the majority of MPs actually voted for this bill.A clue may come from recent comments made by the home Secretary and endorsed by the prime minister about #leftie lawyers# and #do-gooders#, referring to human rights lawyers and refugee organisations.As for the Food Standards Agency, clues might come from the other very concerning bill in process at present which is the Internal Market Bill which contravenes the Good Friday Agreement and the devolution settlements for Scotland and Wales by undermining the authority of the devolved governments, as well as breaking an international treaty signed less than a year ago.This bill contains some deeply concerning clauses which would come under the remit of The Food Standards Agency which normally only has jurisdiction south of the border, but this bill would enable a UK trade minister to unilaterally overrule Scottish legislation on food safety standards to allow for a trade deal with the US, and the importation of sub-standard foods and food products.It is also the case that any UK minister or appointee would be able to overrule any Scottish legislation. This could affect all aspects of our lives.The Spy Cop Bill is a means of enforcing the Internal Market Bill by using the threat of underhand means. Thus piling illegality on illegality with regard to international law.We need to be very concerned on both counts.Amnesty International has already voiced its grave concerns, as have other international bodies and governments.Surely independence is now the best option for Scotland, where we can build a better, fairer nation for ourselves one that obeys international laws and respects the basic human rights of all its citizens, with a written constitution to ensure that no future Scottish government could ever impose such draconian legislation on the people of Scotland.Cecilia Rees , Lochgilphead.Sir,The Covid- pandemic continues to be exceptionally dficult for all of us, but has also led to crisis levels of #pet poverty# in the UK.PDSA is a charity that provides free and low cost vet care for those who struggle to pay treatment costs for their sick and injured pets.Since the first UK lockdown began, we’ve seen an overwhelming number of additional enquiries from pet owners who have hit hard times.

Martin Bonar replaced Scott Johnston for Saints while Chris Hart made way for Innes Meikle for the hosts.The deadlock was broken in the th minute from a quickly-taken free kick by Cammy Hill after Martin Bonar had been brought down in the centre circle by James McGuiness.Hill spotted Aaron McKay in space on the right and sent him scurrying forward. McKay cut into the box and picked out the run of Craig MacEwan who was foiled from six yards by Ally Lewis.The young keeper#s good work was undone when he couldn#t hold MacEwan#s shot allowing the ball to spin away from him.Ben Forbes was on hand with a sliding challenge to knock the loose ball away from MacEwan but only as far as Gavin Forgrieve, who gleefully tapped home from four yards.Lewis saved again from MacEwan three minutes later this time managing to hold onto the ball at the second attempt before a neat Matty Kelly turn on the corner of the Star -yard box wrong footed Ben Forbes creating the space for Kelly to curl a ball to the far post a matter of inches in front of the outstretched boot of Scott Maitland.Maitland got forward again in the st minute finding Gavin Forgrieve in front of goal. He took the ball down well only for Innes Meikle to get back with a vital challenge at the expense of a corner kick.Martin Bonar climbed well at the back post to meet Forgrieve#s delivery from the right but couldn#t direct his header on target.Despite being unable to hit the target himself Bonar was able to claim an st minute assist for the second and final goal.The big midfielder, a key member of Red Star#s  Scottish Amateur Football League Premier Division Two title winning side, won possession well in the centre circle and opened up his former team mates with a perfectly weighted pass for the forward run of skipper Craig MacEwan.Top marksman MacEwan comfortably beat stranded Red Star keeper Ally Lewis with a deft chip from  yards into the unguarded net.Referee Jimmy Litster, who ensured the two local rivals remained on friendly terms throughout, called time on proceedings after three added minutes with both sides satisfied to complete another  minutes while the majority of their respective league rivals remain side-lined."},{"url":null,"title":"in praise of john campbell factor mor","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The town on its present site would be taking shape by the time young Zachary began his schooling.His education, however, was said to be #rudimentary#, so young Zachary began teaching himself Latin and Greek as he absorbed English classic literature.Employed from the age of  in a merchant#s office in Glasgow, historical references describe him falling into #bad company# and indulging in excessive drinking.At the age of  in  he emigrated to Jamaica to take up a role as a book-keeper, effectively a slave overseer, on a sugar plantation. Such was his horror and disgust at the way in which slaves were treated on the plantation that he became an implacable opponent of the slave trade.He gave up his job in Jamaica # by this time a #model book-keeper# # and ed in  to Britain and secured a position in London. His sister Jean had married Thomas Babington of Rothley Temple, Leicestershire, a country gentleman and ardent evangelical. Babington took MacAulay under his wing and introduced him to the Clapham Sect # a group of Tories against slavery.Among them was William Wilberforce, founder and leader of the anti-slavery movement.Through working with the Clapham Sect, MacAulay was invited in  to visit Sierra Leone # the West African colony established to provide a home to emancipated slaves from the United States who came to Sierra Leone via Nova Scotia.In , aged , he was promoted to the post of governor and remained in the post until .Returning to England on a slave ship, he brought with him  African children, with the hope of finding them a better le in the Clapham Sect community.He settled in Surrey following his marriage to Selina Mills on August , .Having witnessed the misery of slavery, MacAulay became a member of the Society for the Abolition of the Slave Trade, working closely with Wilberforce, and soon became a leading figure in the parliamentary campaign. He later became secretary of the committee, which became known as the African Institution.The campaign succeeded in , with an Act of Parliament making the slave trade illegal throughout the British Empire. The practice, however, was to continue despite this victory.Many abolitionists had thought slavery would fade away once the slave trade was stopped, but that failed to happen.MacAulay continued in his activism, helping seize a slave ship in . On this act, William Wilberforce commented in a letter to MacAulay, #you really deserve a statue#.In the s MacAulay turned his attention towards securing the total abolition of slavery itself. He helped found the Society for the Mitigation and Gradual Abolition of Slaveryin , and was editor of its monthly publication, the Anti-Slavery Reporter from its launch in .His major contribution was the collection and collating of a huge volume of evidence showing the true scale of slavery # a role to which he was ideally suited as a skilled statistician with a meticulous approach and an exceptional head for figures.It was also during this period that MacAulay co-founded University College London.Publication of the Reporter continued until , but by the end the work had worn MacAulay out and he had got into debt.In  Selina died and, with his finances in disarray, MacAulay was exiled to Paris in  # the year the Slavery Abolition Act came into force which ended slavery throughout the British Empire.He ed to England once his debts were liquidated and died on May , . He was buried in a London cemetery, but after the site became a public park # St George#s Gardens # the exact location of his grave was lost.MacAulay is commemorated with a le-sized memorial bust in Westminster Abbey.To mark the th anniversary of his birth in , a memorial plaque was unveiled in the gardens, donated by the Royal Statistical Society, the Friends of St George#s Gardens, University College London and the Clan MacAulay Association.William Wilberforce said of Zachary MacAulay: #My sober and deliberate opinion is that you [Zachary MacAulay] have done more towards this consummation [abolishing slavery] than any other man.#For myself, I take pleasure in acknowledging that you have been my tutor all the way and that I could have done nothing without you.#"},{"url":null,"title":"a family passion for scotlands beauty","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Frances and Ross depict the ever-changing and often harsh weather conditions which frame their Argyll home.A Family Affair explores their shared artistic tropes as they both represent the landscape of Scotland’s islands and west coast, working in nature, directly inBoth use oil paint and other media, drawing with the brush or palette kne to make urgent, swt marks that capture the fleeting effects and drama of changing weather.They also share Crinan, where the Ryan family has run the Crinan Hotel since the mid-seventies, from where Ryan left for school, then art school and set out on extensive travels. But the beauty of Argyll # and his boat Sgarbh # drew him back.Earlier this year Ross held his second solo exhibition with The Scottish Gallery, but due to lockdown not a single person was able to attend.Frances has been a regular exhibitor with the gallery for years with her distinctive Hebridean seascapes and landscapes showing the repeated mots of Iona, The Mull of Kintyre, the bays around Crinan and the view across to Jura and the Corryvreckan.Like a good modernist Frances is reluctant to give any commentary on her works but Ross, on the other hand, makes extensive notes on his journeys allowing others to understand how hard-won the paintings are, particularly in winter when the harsh conditions create privations and huge physical problems. Each painting becomes a manestation and record of time and place.His affinity with the natural world is reflected in his long-term project of setting messages in bottles on the ocean, which brings him encounters as he journeys to meet the people who find them, and make new works at the location of the find.A Family Affair will be presented concurrently with Mark Hearld’s Menagerie, which will transport visitors to an animal-filled world with a series of prints, woodcut and linocuts inspired by the artist’s love of British flora and fauna.A Family Affair and Mark Hearld’s Menagerie will be at The Scottish Gallery in Edinburgh between Saturday November  and Wednesday December ."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column november 20 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

All representatives who are isolating or unable to attend must be able to speak up for their voters.We noted as early as June that the abrupt shut-down of remote participation was bound to leave communities unrepresented as the pandemic continued to rage. The Commons took a step backwards in ending this too early.MPs and voters need consistency and transparent standards for how these crucial democratic decisions are made.We can#t have ato the conga line chaos we saw in June, or the decisions simply being made on a whim by a minister.MPs need clarity about how they can continue to represent their voters during this stark second wave and beyond.There must be far greater transparency over how these decisions on participation are made, rather than ministers being forced to act at the last moment.Since some MPs may be isolating or not safe to travel in person, there’s a real threat for democratic representation and political equalityremote participation continues to be strictly limited or indeed denied. Virtual proceedings in the summer were a real success in bringing parliament into the st century. Let’s learn from that and ensure all voters are heard.Darren Hughes, chief executive, the Electoral Reform Society.Sir,SNP ministers must outline how they are planning for a Covid- vaccine rollout across Scotland.People are understandably feeling positive about a potential vaccine for coronavirus, which is why it is critical for the SNP government to lay out the detail of its roll-out plans as a matter of urgency.We can ill-afford to repeat the same mistakes we saw with the flu vaccination earlier this year.Ministers need to set out what infrastructure is being put in place right now so they are ahead of the game when it comes to rolling out any vaccine across Scotland when it becomes available, and doing so fairly and effectively.Getting this right will be particularly important for the Highlands and Islands with our dispersed population and challenging geography.We must be assured that our region does not end up playing catch-up with the central belt which is an understandable concern locally, given the track record of this government in other matters affecting us.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSP and Shadow Health Secretary.Sir,In the recent storms  houses at Bruach Gorm, Port Charlotte, using the communal West Highland Housing Association satellite dish lost half their sky channels including BBC  and STV.As I write, it#s been  working days since at least three of us that I know reported the issue to West Highland, but not a word of a fix date.The dish has done well for  years, but things degrade over time. I had an inkling this year there would be a dish problem and in the summer I bought a TV aerial kit for £ # a lot cheaper than fitting a dish.I put the aerial in the loft and there is a good reception, with BBC  and STV back. It is storm proof in the loft, though was disappointed with the lack of channels from the Bowmore transmitter.I Googled it and the mast is a Freeview Light and lacks channels other UK areas enjoy. I use Sky HD freeview channels but with Sky you have to navigate the TV guide through all the blocked subscription channels to find the one you want to watch. Via the Bowmore mast the TV guide just lists the the Freeview channels, which is great.Freeview said that there were more channels available on main transmitters than there was on relay transmitters, which play a vital role in providing more remote areas with TV coverage.There are a lot of aerials on houses and I think Islay#s TV transmitters should get an upgrade to the same channels as other areas expect.I will also raise this issue with those elected to improve our lives, including our MSP, MP, council leader Councillor Currie and Councillor Horn.Colin M Campbell, Port Charlotte, Isle of Islay.Sir,I think we all need a boost of positive news, so I would like to appeal to your readers to give a brave and special young person in your area the credit they deserve by nominating them for the  WellChild Awards.We are looking for inspirational children and young people who have defied the odds in the face of serious illness and the selfless nurses, doctors, brothers, sisters and friends who help care for them.This is your opportunity to give them the recognition they deserve at a prestigious event regularly attended by WellChild Patron, The Duke of Sussex.Nominations are open now so please get yours in before the closing date on Monday December  at noon.

The current bus stop and car park at the head of Glen Croe would also be bypassed. This is an important public transport link for local residents.The consultation launched by the Scottish Government’s Transport Secretary, Michael Matheson is a muddled exercise. It confuses the urgent need to decide on an alternative route for a new road through Glen Croe with the much longer-term strategic transport options for improving connectivity between Argyll and west-central Scotland.Most of the strategic options involve a number of new civil engineering challenges including the construction of bridges over Loch Long and Loch Fyne and extensive road building, both new and upgraded. For reasons of cost and complexity, none of these options are likely to be implemented within this decade.Whatever long-term strategy options may be investigated for their feasibility, there remains the urgent need to build a new road in Glen Croe. It will always be necessary to link the communities of Arrochar Tarbetwith Loch Goil, Cairndow, north Loch Fyne, Inveraray and beyond with the A.I note that both my local community council in Loch Goil and Argyll and Bute Council support the route that follows the existing forest track on the opposite side of the glen from the Rest and Be Thankful without a similar risk of landslides. Compared with the strategic options, this is a modestof road to construct.The sooner that steps are taken to realise this solution the better it will be for all who currently suffer the increasingly frequent road closures due to climate change and the unstable hill.Alastair R Moodie, LochgoilheadSir,Every year thousands of children contact Childline about being bullied online and tell us that they feel it is hard to escape from.Lockdown has intensied these feelings for many and since April we’ve counselled more than , children and young people across the UK about online bullying.Children have told us about people sending threatening or abusive messages and being pressured into engaging in sexual conversations. Others have shared that they’ve been excluded from online games by other children, while some spoke of online identities being stolen to embarrass or cause trouble while using their name.Before lockdown measures were first introduced this year, the average monthly number of counselling session with children about online bullying was . Between April and October that value increased by  per cent to a monthly average of .This is worrying, particularly as we continue to adhere to strict social-distancing restrictions across Scotland and children continue to spend more time online. Bullying can have a long-term impact on the mental wellbeing of a child and, as we mark Anti Bullying Week this month and beyond, it’s important to ensure that every child knows who they can turn to for support.If a parent thinks their child is being bullied online, it can be hard to remain calm, but it’s crucial not to overwhelm a child with questions. Taking their device away is likely to make them feel like whatever has happened is their fault instead, it’s helpful to listen to their worries, suggest they take some time away from certain apps, and provide them with reassurance.Adeniyi Alade, service head of Childline at NSPCC ScotlandSir,Boris Johnson’s comment that devolution has been #a disaster north of the border# and #Tony Blair’s worst mistake# should hardly come as a surprise to anyone.The Tories have never been great supporters of devolution, vehemently opposing both the referendums in  on establishing a Scottish Assembly and in  on the Scottish Parliament.Most recently the devolution power grab that is highlighted in the Internal Market Bill simply reinforces this stance.The Scottish Social Attitudes surveyon constitutional preference found that only seven per cent favour abolition of the Scottish Parliament and it found that trust in the Scottish Government sits at four times that of the UK Government. This points to it hardly being a disaster.For those accused of scaremongering that there is a threat to Holyrood, Mr Johnson’s comments are clear vindication. The irony of all this being that devolution has given new le to the Scottish Conservatives after its wipe out in  and it is now the opposition in the Scottish Parliament.Be under no doubt that the Scottish Parliament, which was hard fought for, is under threat and we must do all in our power to defend it.Alex Orr, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures november 27 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Businesses need to act now! This is true for retail, those trading in consumer goods, services and investment, construction and housing as well as vehicle and haulier firms. The UK Government has put a raft of measures in place for all firms across England, Scotland and Wales. Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Michael Gove said: “We are leaving the EU single market and customs union. This will bring both new challenges and new opportunities for businesses. We recognise this is a challenging time for everyone. We are determined to support businesses to be ready for  January  and beyond. ”These are actions to take now#Procurement expert Laura Hobbs has led the way for the construction industry to prepare for the end of the UK transition period. Laura is the UK and Ireland One Procurement Programme Lead at Royal BAM Group, which is among the biggest construction firms covering England, Wales and Scotland. She said: “We have created a snapshot to give a clear picture for the industry where we believe pinch points are.” Laura explained: “I decided to pull my peers together, all the other main contractors that are part of the Construction Senior Leaders Group which I chair. We decided to write one set of questions for the end of UK transition and also share the workload – to go to all those dferent product categories key to construction.“As main contractors we deal a lot with sub-contractors so we need to ensure the message gets further into the supply chain.”The Construction Senior Leaders Group also includes representatives from Skanska, Costain, Murphys, Laing O’Rourke, housebuilders Berkeley and clients including Highways UK and Clarion Housing Group. Manufacturers are employing new customs experts to help them get in position for the new start, creating more strategic programmes to negate any currency fluctuations. Laura worked with Build UK, receiving useful information around imports and exports from the UK Government. “Information is the key and preparation is essential. The organisations we work with have been preparing for this for a long time so they are on their final rehearsal now. “To be able to give your own business the comfort you are going into this in a planned, coordinated way, it is key for people to start the exercise sooner rather than later,” stressed Laura. She said the new start will bring opportunities to invest in the UK supply chain. “We always see the positives and, definitely for the UK, there are opportunities coming.”"},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast episode 18 follow me","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Surely to goodness we should have a plan.#I am also quite annoyed that Fyne View has closed, because it cost a lot to get it up and running, so that is money down the drain.#The public want to have facilities in their area and we cannot have decisions made without proper focus on figures before us.#Fyne View was a Lochgilphead-based care facility for dementia sufferers which was revealed to have closed its doors in November.Caroline Cherry, head of adult services with the HSCP, responded: #I totally hear Ms Rhodick’s concerns. But the purpose of this paper is not to go over decisions that have been made, it is to look at the audit trail.#Ms Rhodick then said: #Councillor Gary Mulvaneyhas said that the decision has been taken and the report reiterates that.#But it didn’t matter how many times people pled with the board to listen and understand, especially in a smaller area like this.#The consultation was not a consultation. People were asked along for their views and officers turned and told the public what they were doing. They were putting the cart before the horse.#The community will be really angry as nobody is listening. The decision was made months ago with one public consultation. It should have been two or three to get proper feedback.#Officers said what was happening and it was an option that nobody knew about.#Everything has been massaged for the IJB’s benefit. They are not listening.#Councillor Mulvaney said in reply: #This paper is reiterating what we have already decided and we are reopening a debate we had a number of months ago.#We now have a board member going back through things to which officers are in no position to respond.#I know Ms Rhodick feels strongly about this issue but the decisions have been taken and you cannot make comments like those.#It is just not appropriate for a board member.

Why  Because this modication very effectively protects moths from becoming bat-fodder.Butterflies are active during the day but moths are mostly nocturnal. And under the night sky moths make a tasty meal for insectivorous bats. These tiny mammals detect their prey by echo-location, a method of hunting that involves emitting repeated ultrasonic squeaks, generally with a dominant frequency range of - kilohertz . Their prey is then located from the direction of the ing echoes.Moths have evolved ious mechanisms to evade these predators: some have developed ears that detect bat echolocation calls, allowing them to take evasive action, but others, the earless moths, have to rely on passive defences – so-called acoustic camouflage # that is, their hairy thoraces.Comparing tomographic echo images from two species of earless moths with two species of diurnal butterflies, the Bristol scientists found very little effect on the ultrasound echoes from the thin layer of thoracic scales of butterflies. In contrast, the hair-like scales covering moth thoraces absorbed around  per cent of the ultrasonic sound energy in the broadband - kHz. This provides clear protection from hunting bats and consequently is a very signicant survival advantage.Addressing the mechanisms behind the ultrasound reduction achieved by moth thoraces, the scientists found that the hair-like scales form a connected network of air pockets, which act as porous ultrasound absorbers. Sound waves entering the network cause air molecules in the pockets to vibrate, thereby dissipating energy and reducing echo reflection.The overall arrangement and microstructure of hair-like moth scales closely resembles man-made fibrous materials designed to absorb sound but, interestingly, the Bristol team showed that the moth scales have a considerably higher absorption capacity. So perhaps we could learn lessons from these small hairy creatures.* J. R. Soc.

But, usually, it means yoursquoll find it more dficult to exercise your rights.This applies even where we see a rapid purchase of a company thatrsquos gone into administration, where on the surface it looks like itrsquos businesses as usual.Can Iitems to a retailer thats gone into administration It depends. Once a retailer goes into administration the administrators role is to try and save the company, and in doing so, it may take the decision not to accept s.But you could ask for a refundthe things you bought werent delivered, or you could claim for the cost of a repairthey were faulty.Do myrights still apply after a company has gone into administration If yoursquove been supplied with faulty goods and the company is placed into administration but is still trading, you may be able to get a replacement or a refund in the normal way under the Consumer Rights Act.If the company isnrsquot trading while itrsquos in administration, yoursquoll need to make a claim to the administrator as an unsecured creditor, so it may be unlikely that youll get a refund in this case.Butyou donrsquot submit a claim in writing to the administrators then it is highly unlikely that they will stand to get their money back. We think itrsquos worth at least trying.If you have a faulty item, you could register your claim with the administrators for the cost of fixing the item, or for a refundtheres still time to reject the item.Can I still use my warranty after a company has gone into administration If you bought an item thats faulty and it came with a warranty, you should be able to claim a refund or repair from the manufacturer under the terms of the warranty.You may be able to make a claim on an extended warrantythe cover was provided by a third party .If the retailer goes into administration and the goods are faulty, then your manufacturers warranty should cover you for at least the first year. Check your documentation to seethis is the case.Check the small print carefully to see who actually provided the warranty cover. Often itrsquos provided by a third partyin which case you shouldnrsquot be affecteda store ceases trading.If the cover was provided by the retailer in question, then it depends on what happens at the end of the administration period.If the retailer ceases to trade, then unfortunately you would lose the benefit of the extended warranty.Remember that youll usually get a manufacturerrsquos guarantee with an item that will provide some protection for the first year - sometimes even longer.Can I claim from my card company If you paid for goods that cost less than pound on a credit or debit card, you may be able to claim under chargeback.If youve bought something on your credit card costing more than pound, means the card provider is jointly responsible for any breaches of contract.You can claim under Section  of the Consumer Credit Actthe item is faulty.Write to your credit card company with details of your claim. You can use our template letter to claim a refund from your credit card companya retailer goes bust.Can I claimI only paid a deposit You dont have to have paid the full amount on your credit card ndash the card company is liable evenyou made only part of the paymenton your card.Its the value of the goods youre buying thats key, not the amount paid on the card.Under Section , as long as the value of the product is between pound and pound, then youll be covered, regardless of how much you paid on your card.So, for example,you ordered a new camera and paid a pound deposit with your credit card and paid the balance of pound by cheque, youd be covered for the whole poundthe company went out of business and you didnt get your camera.Can I still use my gt vouchers after a company has gone into administration A number of high street stores have refused to allow customers to use gt vouchers after going into administration. Unfortunately, this is within the law.But,the administrator takes this decision its worth waiting a few days to seeit will change its mind.If your gt vouchers are refused, you need to make a claim in writing to the administrators with proof of your vouchers.You can find the name of the administrator on the website of the retailer that has gone into administration.But theres no guarantee youll get all of your money back, and it could take up to  months to process the claim properly. And, not all administrators will take this approach.If you want to get your money back, you can use our template letter to claim a refund for vouchers from a bust company.Can I make a chargeback claim for gt vouchers If a company is accepting gt vouchers then chargeback claims will not be accepted.If gt vouchers arent being accepted and you bought gt vouchers on your card, you should be able to put in a chargeback request to your bank on the grounds that the vouchers are fundamentally dferent from what you paid for.This is because you expected to be able to exchange the vouchers for goods of a certain value and instead theyre worthless.If the vouchers were given to you as a gt, its trickier to make this argument. The person who received a voucher as a gt cant make a claim.But the person who bought the vouchers could put in a chargeback request to the bank. You can use our letter template to help you make a chargeback claim.Its worth noting though, that theres no guarantee the administrators will accept chargeback claims.Can I get my cashback If you were supposed to get cashback as part of your purchase, it depends on how the cashback offer was set up - you may still receive it.Check the terms and conditions to see whether the offer is backed by the manufacturer , or whether the cashback claim should be made to the retailer.If the manufacturer is providing the cashback, your claim shouldnt be affected.If its the retailer, you could still put in a claim and they would be in breach of contractthey didnt send the cash.If you didnt get the cash, unfortunately, you couldnt take court action against the retailer while its in administration.If at the end of the administration the retailer stopped trading, youd need to lodge your claim for unpaid cashback with the administrators."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-borders-recorded-nearly-300-cases-past-month","story":"NEARLY  cases of coronavirus have been recorded in the Borders over the past month.Data published by the Scottish Government at pm todayshows the Borders has recorded  new cases in the last  hours, bringing the regional total since March to .On November , a total of  cases had been confirmed since the beginning of the pandemic, meaning that, in the space of a month, the Borders has recorded  new cases.:Coronavirus: Borders school announces positive caseIn Scotland, the total number of cases since March now stands at ,.In the last  hours across Scotland, there have been  deaths where COVID-has been mentioned on the death certicate.In the Borders, the number of patients in hospital with the virus has increased since yesterdayfrom nine to ."},{"url":null,"title":"hawick-mcdonalds-reveals-number-jobs-available","story":"McDONALDrsquoS has revealed the number of jobs that will be created once its new Borders site opens.As reported last week, a new restaurant and drive-thru will be coming to Hawickafter plans were approved by Scottish ministers.The fast food giant has now revealed that ldquoat least  new jobs will be created.:Galashiels loses crown as happiest place to live in ScotlandA McDonaldrsquos spokesperson said: ldquoWersquore delighted that our plans for a new drive-thru restaurant in Hawick have been approved.ldquoWe look forward to opening our doors in the near future, bringing signicant investment to the local community and creating at least  new jobs.The Hawick site on Commercial Road, where the McDonaldrsquos is to be built, will also see a BM store added.There is currently one McDonaldrsquos store in the Borders, which opened in Galashiels in .You might also be interested in:Coronavirus: Borders recorded nearly  casesin the last monthTwo Borders high schools in top  in Scotland, says Sunday TimesCoronavirus: Borders school announces positive case"},{"url":null,"title":"selkirk-knowepark-primary-school-announces-coronavirus-case","story":"AN ENTIRE class at a Borders school has been forced to self-isolate following a coronavirus case.On Sunday , parents of pupils in the P P composite class at Knowepark Primary School, Selkirk, were informed of a positive case at the school.The NHS Test and Protect team identied the whole class as being in close contact with the case, and all pupils were therefore required to self-isolate.A spokesperson for Scottish Borders Councilsaid that three other schools in the Borders have also reported cases recently.:Two Borders high schools in top  in Scotland, says Sunday TimesHawick High School and Galashiels Academyhave each announced a single case, while Ayton Primary School has \"a small number of cases\", according to the spokesperson.The spokesperson said cases associated with Ayton Primary School have \"implications for a number of iniduals within the school\".\"Currently no [Ayton] pupils [are] required to self-isolate,\" the spokesperson added.Parents at Hawick High School and Galashiels Academy were informed of cases on November , and parents of children at Ayton Primary School were told about cases on November ."},{"url":null,"title":"covid-scotland-scotrail-offers-students-50-per-cent-discount-get-home-christmas","story":"SCOTRAIL has announced that students travelling home over Christmas will benefit from a fty per cent discount on tickets from Scotlandrsquos Railway.A mass testing programme of students planning to head home over the festive period is currently under way, in a bid to limit risk of transmission and provide reassurance to those travelling home to their families and loved ones.And now students will only need to pay half price for travel, on any ScotRail service until December .The train operator, run by Dutch firm Abellio, hopes the move will help students worried about getting home to their families under the current coronavirus travel restrictions.Students will first need to record a negative Covid- test before travelling, which could make it dficult to book specic train services due to testing appointments and the time spent awaiting results.Herersquos a little Christmas cheer for all of Scotlandrsquos university students.

actually paid to shareholders will reach around .%companies meet high incentive targets.Ofgem gives go-ahead to a pound billion+ investment programme for a stronger, greener and fairer GB energy system #https:t.co JbMCvaOJPr#GreenFairFuturepic jVIfcNcevmmdash ofgemDecember , It is Ofgemrsquos final say on the matter, and is slightly higher than the .% that energy networks were told they could be facing in Ofgemrsquos preliminary decision in July.The decision, taken with other measures that Ofgem has proposed, will save customers about pound per year on their energy bills. It includes billions of pounds for green investments.Alistair Cromwell, acting chief executive of Citizens Advice, called the decision ldquogenuine progress, even while arguing that Ofgem could have gone further in limiting s.ldquoFor too long network companies were able to make excessive profits, not because they were efficient firms, but simply because previous price controls were too generous, he said.ldquoThis settlement will, as we argued for, make sure companies can access funding for essential infrastructure projects quickly, while also making sure consumersrsquo money is well spent.Three of the biggest energy networks, SSE, National Grid, and Scottish Power, as well as the Energy Networks Association, said they needed more time to assess Ofgemrsquos full decision.But Scottish Power and SSE both expressed concern or disappointment with the plan.Scottish Power boss Keith Anderson said: ldquoThis is a large and complex document and we will now take our time to analyse it in full and consider our next steps.ldquoWe remain concerned that Ofgemrsquos proposals on the headline rate ofwill not attract the global investment our transmission business requireswe are to support the clear net zero ambitions of the UK and Scottish Governments.Ofgem chief executive Jonathan Brearley said: ldquoOur pound billion package massively boosts clean energy investment. This will ensure that our network companies can deliver on the climate change ambitions laid out by the Prime Minister last week, whilst maintaining world-leading levels of reliability.ldquoThese costs must fall fairly for consumers. We are reducing the amount paid to shareholders so that they are closer to current market levels. This means that companies can attract the vital investment we need whilst making sure that consumers donrsquot pay more than is necessary to achieve this.The networks reacted with fury in July after they were told the s may be halved, accusing Ofgem of putting climate goals at risk.At the time they threatened to fight the regulatorit stuck with the .% s. The energy networks themselves had accepted that the s would be slashed, but were generally hoping they would be set at between % and %.An industry source said on Tuesday that a large part of the Prime Ministerrsquos -point plan to green the economy will be built on the grid, and investment is key.ldquoThis is too important and the next  years are key. Boris Johnson is coming up with a massive plan, and we need to make sure the network is ready for it, they said.In July, both SSE and Scottish Power said they might ask the Competition and Markets Authority for a ruling after Ofgemrsquos final decision.The CMA has already this year gone against a plan proposed by Ofwat, the water regulator, which would similarly have slashed household bills, in this case by around pound per year.In a provisional finding in September, the competition watchdog said that Ofwat had been too strict in limiting the amount water companies can invest in resilience and reducing leaks.That decision put the s for water companies at around %, although it set a midpoint of .%.SSErsquos transmission arm said it is ldquovery disappointed that Ofgem has not fully reflected the robust evidence ndash particularly that from the Competition and Markets Authorityprovisional findings ndash in setting the financial parameters..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Ofgem ups planned investor s for energy networks"},{"url":null,"title":"dean wins mcdiarmid cup","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

It cost the lives of  British servicemen and severe injuries to many more but it made Blair a rich man, resulting from his popularity in America where many of my friends still think the sun shines from his posterior.I would agree, however, that allowing the electorate in Scotland to vote in favour of devolution, was undoubtedly Blair#s second biggest mistake.His motivation was to placate those crying for Scottish independence, following the discovery of North Sea oil, but the irony was that it led to a series of disastrously incompetent Labour Lib Dem coalition governments.These in turn resulted in the electorate choosing, in , a minority SNP government, enabled by support from the Greens.My letter would be far too long were I to dwell on all the areas of incompetence in Holyrood government since , so I#ll confine my evaluation to education, upon which the future of Scotland depends.In , Salmond#s election promise was primary school class sizes of under  but, two years later, Fiona Hyslop changed that target to fewer than  pupils. That was just before Salmond sacked her and Mike Russell admitted smaller class sizes might not be possible before .Those councils that did enforce the limit of  only did so by refusing places to children whose siblings were at the same school.The #attainment gap# between children from poorer backgrounds and those from more affluent areas has continued to widen rather than diminish, as Nicola Sturgeon promised, while older students cannot find places at Scottish universities because these have to be allocated to foreign students, whose fees are a necessity to fund the universities.Meanwhile, I hate to think what Scotland#s deficit is now. It was around eight per cent of GDP before Covid decimated so many areas vital to Scotland#s economy.Doubtless, Alex Orr will remind me Scotland cannot legally have a deficit, but an independent Scotland could and it would prevent the dream of Scotland rejoining the EU from ever being attained.Brian Gee, Carradale East.In the recent storms,  houses at Bruach Gorm, Port Charlotte using the communal West Highland Housing Association satellite dish, lost half our Sky channels, including BBC  and STV.As I write, it’s been  working days since at least three of us that I know reported the issue to West Highland, but not a word of a fix date.The dish has done well for  years, but things degrade over time. I had an inkling this year there would be a dish problem and in the summer I bought a TV aerial kit for £ – a lot cheaper than fitting a dish. I put the aerial in the loft and there is a good reception, with BBC  and STV back. It is storm-proof in the loft, though I was disappointed with the lack of channels from the Bowmore transmitter.I Googled it and the mast is a Freeview Light and lacks channels other UK areas enjoy. I use Sky HD freeview channels but with Sky you have to navigate the TV guide through all the blocked subscription channels to find the one you want to watch. Via the Bowmore mast, the TV guide just lists the freeview channels, which is great.Freeview said that there are more channels available on main transmitters than there is on relay transmitters, which play a vital role in providing more remote areas a TV coverage.There are a lot of aerials on houses and I think Islay’s TV transmitters should get an upgrade to the same channels as other areas expect.I will also raise this issue with those elected to improve our lives, including MSP, MP, council leader Councillor Currie and Councillor Horn.Colin M Campbell, Port Charlotte, Islay.I think we all need a boost of positive news, so I would like to appeal to your readers to give a brave and special young person in your area the credit they deserve by nominating them for the  WellChild Awards.We are looking for inspirational children and young people who have defied the odds in the face of serious illness and the selfless nurses, doctors, brothers, sisters and friends who help care for them.This is your opportunity to give them the recognition they deserve at a prestigious event regularly attended by WellChild Patron, The Duke of Sussex.Nominations are open now so please get yours in before the closing date on Monday December  at noon.

So there will be one window on st December , two windows on December  and so on – and they should stay in place until Twelfth Night.Everyone is invited to walk or drive around the parishes and spot the decorated windows.

Having access to toys and entertainment, when recovering or waiting for treatment, or using play as a distraction for procedures can help to alleviate pain, aid recovery and bring joy back into children’s lives.At the children’s charity Starlight, thanks to our supporters, we provide hospitals with boxes filled with toys, games and puzzles to be used on wards.This year, Starlight’s fundraising income has fallen due to many cancelled events, which is why we have started our Time to Play campaign. Our goal is to raise £, before the end of the year to help , children get access to play in hospital and limit the negative effects of illness on their childhood.It’s easy to support and our website has fun ideas of how to take part, including our Stream for Starlight fundraiser for computer gamers.Or,you are able to, please considering making a simple one-off donation. However big or small, it will help Starlight to continue to be there to support children and their families this Christmas.I’m hoping your readers will join together and help support Starlight, to bring back joy into the lives of the , seriously ill children living in the UK this Christmas.Please visit www.starlight.org.uk time to help us. Thank you.Every year thousands of children contact Childline about being bullied online and tell us that they feel it is hard to escape from.Lockdown has intensied these feelings for many and since April we’ve counselled more than , children and young people across the UK about online bullying.Children have told us about people sending threatening or abusive messages and being pressured into engaging in sexual conversations. Others have shared that they’ve been excluded from online games by other children, while some spoke of online identities being stolen to embarrass or cause trouble while using their name.Before lockdown measures were first introduced this year, the average monthly number of counselling sessions with children about online bullying was . Between April and October that value increased by  per cent to a monthly average of .This is worrying, particularly as we continue to adhere to strict social-distancing restrictions across Scotland and children continue to spend more time online. Bullying can have a long-term impact on the mental wellbeing of a child and, as we mark Anti Bullying Week this month and beyond, it’s important to ensure that every child knows who they can turn to for support.If a parent thinks their child is being bullied online, it can be hard to remain calm, but it’s crucial not to overwhelm a child with questions. Taking their device away is likely to make them feel like whatever has happened is their fault instead, it’s helpful to listen to their worries, suggest they take some time away from certain apps, and provide them with reassurance.Adeniyi Alade, service head of Childline at NSPCC Scotland.Boris Johnson’s comment that devolution has been #a disaster north of the border# and #Tony Blair’s worst mistake# should hardly come as a surprise to anyone.The Tories have never been great supporters of devolution, vehemently opposing both the referendums in  on establishing a Scottish Assembly and in  on the Scottish Parliament.Most recently the devolution power grab that is highlighted in the Internal Market Bill simply reinforces this stance.The Scottish Social Attitudes surveyon constitutional preference found that only seven per cent favour abolition of the Scottish Parliament and it found that trust in the Scottish Government sits at four times that of the UK Government. This points to it hardly being a disaster.For those accused of scaremongering that there is a threat to Holyrood, Mr Johnson’s comments are clear vindication. The irony of all this being that devolution has given new le to the Scottish Conservatives after its wipe out in  and it is now the opposition in the Scottish Parliament.Be under no doubt that the Scottish Parliament, which was hard fought for, is under threat and we must do all in our power to defend it.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.While this year Christmas is going to be dferent from usual for many of us, it is still a time for preparations and extra food.

This is true for retail, those trading in consumer goods, services and investment, construction and housing as well as vehicle and haulier firms. The UK Government has put a raft of measures in place for all firms across England, Scotland and Wales. Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Michael Gove said: “We are leaving the EU single market and customs union. This will bring both new challenges and new opportunities for businesses. We recognise this is a challenging time for everyone. We are determined to support businesses to be ready for  January  and beyond. ”These are actions to take now#Procurement expert Laura Hobbs has led the way for the construction industry to prepare for the end of the UK transition period. Laura is the UK and Ireland One Procurement Programme Lead at Royal BAM Group, which is among the biggest construction firms covering England, Wales and Scotland. She said: “We have created a snapshot to give a clear picture for the industry where we believe pinch points are.” Laura explained: “I decided to pull my peers together, all the other main contractors that are part of the Construction Senior Leaders Group which I chair. We decided to write one set of questions for the end of UK transition and also share the workload – to go to all those dferent product categories key to construction.“As main contractors we deal a lot with sub-contractors so we need to ensure the message gets further into the supply chain.”The Construction Senior Leaders Group also includes representatives from Skanska, Costain, Murphys, Laing O’Rourke, housebuilders Berkeley and clients including Highways UK and Clarion Housing Group. Manufacturers are employing new customs experts to help them get in position for the new start, creating more strategic programmes to negate any currency fluctuations. Laura worked with Build UK, receiving useful information around imports and exports from the UK Government. “Information is the key and preparation is essential. The organisations we work with have been preparing for this for a long time so they are on their final rehearsal now. “To be able to give your own business the comfort you are going into this in a planned, coordinated way, it is key for people to start the exercise sooner rather than later,” stressed Laura. She said the new start will bring opportunities to invest in the UK supply chain. “We always see the positives and, definitely for the UK, there are opportunities coming.”"},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast episode 18 follow me","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

There are probably no more than half-a-dozen casks of -year-old Scotch whisky in existence.It is the habit at Springbank to reserve small quantities of whisky for longer than normal maturity. Although  years is not so very uncommon,  years is exceptional.The particular cask was ‘refill sherry hogshead’ which was filled on December  , with Springbank at a strength of . over proof .It originally contained the equivalent of . proof gallons but more than  years later, maturation had taken most of the spirit away: there was only the equivalent of . proof gallons left, and the strength had dropped to . proof.The out-turn of the bottling operation was  cases and one bottle. These will have a special label and each numbered bottle will carry a certicate inidually signed by the company’s chairman Mr Hedley G Wright, whose great-grandfather founded the present company. Unfortunately it is improbable that any of this whisky # after all there are only  bottles # will be seen by the retail trade the price would be astronomical anyway.ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOIslay distilleriesLast working season was a prosperous one for the Islay distilleries, as well as for Highlands distilleries generally.During the summer great activity has been seen in the numerous arrivals of vessels with coal and barley and preparations were made for a resumption of distilling.Wet weather, scarcity of labour and a scarcity of carts made the securing of peats very dficult, and only the dry autumn relieved the situation and allowed the peats to be got home. At Ardbeg, Lagavulin, Laphroaig, Port Ellen, Port Charlotte, Bruichladdich, Bunnahabhain and Caol Ila work is now actively going on, and large deliveries are leaving the district.Highland distillers, however, have now to face the competition again of the distillers of grain whisky, which is now plentul on the market. The Distillers Co Ltd quotes its grain whisky at five shillingsper gallon and with all the high costs of wages, coal repairs etc which encumber the malt distillers, the competition is likely to be severely felt."},{"url":null,"title":"law book not just for legal eagles","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

This is especially dangerous when lorries are on the road as they take much longer to stop or slow down.This has frustrated me for some time but enough is enough.

I couldn’t do it in drag every day – it would be too inconvenient to get my make up done # but I suggested doing the last day in drag and she said fair enough, she#d sponsor me £.#Tom has raised between £ and £ in total.#People have been really generous,# he said. #I hoped I would raise £ but it spiralled and people started offering me more and more money, especiallyI did it in drag.#He received help from Beckie Shields, also from Shopper-Aide, who applied his glamorous make-up ahead of Monday#s walk.He added: #Finding the motivation to get out the house can be really dficult, so having this challenge was brilliant it did me the world of good.#I think I will keep up the walking – not seven days a week but maybe Monday to Friday.

The one thing we are not short of in Kintyre is cereal straw and once you#re set up, the biggest cost to growing mushrooms is boiling the kettle a few times.#My dad used to grow them and foraging for mushrooms was a regular thing for us. However, it#s vital you forage with an expertyou intend to eat them, as several ieties are poisonous.#In nature, mycelium connects all the elements of a forest and, with people having to isolate during the pandemic, I thought a shared interest could connect people again # we could take the form of metaphorical mycelium!#Ian approached Glenn Appleton from The Community Bureau charity and, between them, they created and gave away more than  grow-your-own mushroom bags.#When the pandemic is behind us, we are going to organise many more mushroom-related activities, from nature walks to art classes # the world is our oyster,# said Glenn, who is the charity#s chief executive officer and likes a pun. #If you come into our charity shop at  Longrow South, one word of warning: Ian will talk to you for hours about fungi and is being sent hundreds of mushroom photos that people take on their walks.#Katrina MacDonald was just one recipient of a grow-your-own bag, though for her, the medicinal properties of mushrooms were to become her main focus.#My dog Rogan was diagnosed with cancer and has been undertaking an intensive course of chemotherapy,# she explained. #The financial costs are so high, but as any dog-lover knows, a dog is family and worth every single penny.#After the chemotherapy, strengthening Rogan#s immune system is paramount and it appears extract of turkey tail mushroom may help him. I started a blog about Rogan#s journey and hopeful road to recovery and now he#s becoming a local hero with people stopping me in the street and asking about him.#Now comes the figurative mycelium part. After hearing from Katrina, Ian started looking for wild turkey tail mushroom and finally discovered some, growing on a log in a garden in Southend.He asked Frances Hill from Muneroy Tearoom whose house it was and she, in turn, asked the ownersome of the mushrooms could be harvested, explaining what it would be used for.The owners, Mark and Sadie, were only too happy for Ian to collect some, which he delivered to retired herbalist Kenneth Eames, who has been shielding for  months.Kenneth said: #I went on a mushroom hunt with Ian about  years ago and we#ve remained friends since. When he askedI could make Rogan a tincture, I was only too happy to help.#I came to Campbeltown  years ago and the people made me so welcome and since my we and I have been shielding, people have been as good as ever. I cannot tell you how pleased I am to provide some small help to Rogan.#People being connected and helping each another seems so apt.

Susan had been previously unaware of it and so decided to go find it with her husband.When they got there, the tide was helpfully out, revealing the pool. She took some photos and a film of it, but when she ed home and looked at the film, she felt sure she could see a ghostly image in the water of the pool.This led Susan to research images of Lady Helen Hall and she reckoned the image looked like her. Was it a ghostly apparition in the water or a trick of the light  Well, people can make their own mind up, but for me, Susanrsquos message made me curious to find this pool and learn more about Lady Hall, after which it is named.So we made it a family weekend trip of discovery, which usually take place within the boundaries of East Lothian even in the best of times so this was perfect. Bilsdean and nearby Dunglass are favourite places of mine, as you will knowyou read my column regularly. Despite the busy A passing through, the whole area has a fascinating history and the walk following the burn down Bilsdean Glen has an enchanting waterfall. Reaching this walk from the village is hazardous, however, as an unsafe crossing over the fast-flowing A is required, so much care is neededyou go this way.We didnrsquot have much time. The timetable of the tides was against us, as was the dying light of a winterrsquos afternoon. However, we managed to reach the beach with just enough light and time to have our adventure. Susan and David were waiting for us and we made our distanced greetings and they headed in front to seethe pool had been uncovered by the receding tide.This part of the coast is utterly fascinating. There is a lot of erosion here, and whenever I come I see new geological features and wonder about them. Irsquom no geologic expert, but Irsquom sure we spotted a chunk of ancient volcanic lava which seems to have solidied in mid flow a moment in Earthrsquos story from millions of years ago.It was from near here, of course, that the geologist James Hutton was taken in  by Sir James Hall, Lady Hallrsquos husband, on a boat ride to nearby Siccar Point, and the rest, as they say, is history.But it wasnrsquot to retell the story of already-well-known men from history that we made this trip. It was to discover a place associated with a woman who, despite her achievements and talents, was ignored by history, as most women have been until recently.It was indeed an adventure to find her pool, for we had to scramble over wet rocks to get there. Our young children took it in their stride and my youngest Lewis was looking out for evidence of dinosaurs. There are steps cut in the rocks nearby and so I suspect Lady Hall had a more convenient route to reach her pool, but we had no time to search for that.When we arrived at the pool, the tide was not fully out so it was still partly submerged, but enough was revealed of the cut rock to show the outline of Lady Hallrsquos Pool. I could just see what looked like the small steps cut by its side.Susan and David told me of the local tradition that she would come down to bathe in the sea water. Perhaps this was frowned upon, given it was the th century and she was a lady of high aristocratic status. But the story goes that her determination to regularly bathe in the sea led to the creation of this pool, which captures the sea as it goes out, making it a safer place to swim in this rocky coastline.I did not know of this pool before Susan contacted me, and I knew next to nothing about Lady Hall, she was just another aristocratic name. But now, as I stood on the edge of the pool which bears her name, I became intrigued as I listened to the story.I saw no ghostly image of Lady Hall in the water, yet I felt her presence in the twilight. The sun had already vanished from the sky and a beautul moon was rising above the sea. It was cold but calm a perfect moment for a ghostly introduction. While I had not seen Lady Hall with my eyes, I now felt we had been introduced by her story, thanks to Susan.We chatted on ourabout stories and the importance of enchantment and magic when growing up. Susan and her husband had given my family a winterrsquos afternoon of discovery and adventure. Two-hundred years separate Susan and Lady Helen Hall, but there was a connection between them. Two remarkable women from the area who shared a love of the landscape and the stories itrsquos steeped in.And now I must source the book Lady Hall ndash Lang-heidit Lady, written by another local woman, Sally Wilson.

Take time to remember your pets as well. Cats and dogs love to see the bright lights and decorations. Kittens are particularly adept at scaling Christmas trees and pulling down tinsel. Pups love to tear at wrapping, so beware of your presents.Please be aware that there are some everyday substances which are probably more likely to be around at this time of year that can be extremely toxic to your pet. Every year at Dunedin Vets, we treat many pets which have been inadvertently poisoned and see some very distressed owners who feel so upset that they were unaware of the hazardous substance.ChocolateMost owners are aware that chocolate is toxic to pets and chocolate poisoning in dogs is the most common poisoning we see. Dogs are more likely to be involved than cats, who are less likely to eat chocolate, as its flavour is less appealing to them. Be aware, though, of some gourmet chocolates with sea salt which are attractive to cats.Chocolate contains a powerful stimulant called theobromine. This is a similar substance to caffeine. Just as caffeine is a stimulant, causing your heart to race and beat strongly, theobromine causes this to a much greater degree.The first signs that your dog has chocolate poisoningare vomiting and diarrhoea. If this occurs, they will probably feel much better and recover and not go on to suffer the full effects of the theobromine. If the dog digests the chocolate then the more serious signs occur. These include hyperactivity, high temperature and blood pressure, a fast heart rate and heartbeat irregularities. Some of these signs can occur within a few minutes of your dog devouring the chocolate. The darker the chocolate, the greater the concentration of theobromine and therefore the more rapid the onset of serious signs. Remember that chocolate cake and chocolate sweets are harmful, too, not just bars of chocolate. If you know your pet has eaten chocolate, contact your vet immediately.Vine fruits Fresh grapes and their dried ieties are toxic to pets even in small quantities. During the festive period, think about all the places where these fruits can be found: in the Christmas cake, Christmas pudding, mincemeat pies and black bun. The cooking process does not reduce the chance of poisoning.These fruits can initially cause gastro-intestinal upsets such as vomiting and diarrhoea. However,the grapes are digested then a toxin enters the body which can cause kidney failure. This is likely to occur a few days after the initial ingestion of the food. Your pet is likely to be quiet and lethargic. They may be unwilling to eat. They may be drinking lots or not drinking at all.If you suspect your pet has eaten grapes or similar and is showing any of these signs then take them to your vet immediately. Your pet is likely to be given intravenous fluids and have a blood sample taken to check how their kidneys are working. It is likely that your pet will need to be hospitalised for a few days on fluids and given supportive treatment to help the kidneys. Regular blood samples will be taken to ensure the kidneyis improving.Holly, ivy and mistletoeHolly, ivy and mistletoe are often found in Christmas decorations and wreaths, and are all toxic to our pets.Holly ingestion can cause vomiting but,digested and the poisons absorbed into the body, nerve problems can occur. These can include loss of balance and wobbliness, tremors and even fits and seizures.The whole of the ivy plant is toxiceaten but the leaves and berries are particularly toxic.A species commonly poisoned by ivy is the rabbit. They seem especially attracted to its leaves. Initially, the rabbit may show signs of lethargy, diarrhoea and reluctance to eat. As the toxins are absorbed into the body, neurological problems such as twitching, collapse, fitting and paralysis can occur.Mistletoe berries are toxic. The juice of the berries is an irritant and can cause sores and ulcers in the mouth. If the berries are swallowed and the toxin absorbed, seizures and death can occur. Only a few berries are enough to be lethal for a puppy.If you see your pet eating any of these plants, remove any traces from the mouth. Try to make your pet drink, especially in the case of mistletoe. Take your pet to your vet as soon as possible. Your pet is likely to be admitted for intravenous fluids and medication to stop seizures,this stage has been reached.These plants are extremely toxic and, evenrelatively small quantities are eaten, they are iniably fatal.Onions, garlic, etcOnions and other members of the allium family can be toxic to your pets. The alliums contain the chemical disulphide, which damages the red blood cells in domestic animals. Toxicity can occur by ingesting a lot of onion at once or taking in a small quantity over a period of time. Two slices of onion eaten every week by a dog can result in toxicity after a few months. Dogs like cooked onions so be aware of thisyou have prepared caramelised onions or similar.The toxic chemical causes red blood cells to break up, resulting in anaemia and an inability to carry oxygen around the body.Signs that your pet may have onion poisoning include weakness, depression and lethargy. They may be panting and breathless. They may have pale gums and a weak pulse, or collapse.Please contact your vet immediatelyyou suspect your pet has eaten onions.Your vet will blood sample your pet to check the degree and extent of the anaemia and red blood cell damage. Your pet will be given intravenous fluids and may even require a blood transfusion.Most cases of onion poisoning recover but intensive veterinary care and treatment is required.Macadamia nutsNuts of any type are a potential choking hazard for small animals. Macadamia nuts are just the right size for causing blockages in cats. They are also toxic to both cats and dogs. Within a few hours of ingesting the nuts, lethargy, vomiting and an increase in body temperature can occur. This can progress as the nut toxin affects dferent organs of the body. There may be neurological signs, with weakness, wobbliness or tremors. There may be lameness and stf joints. Eventually, the animal may collapse.Again, contact your vetyou know your pet has ingested a macadamia nut. They will require supportive treatment and monitoring and hopefully will recover.In cats, where the nut has caused an obstruction, surgery may be required to remove the offending item from the intestines."},{"url":null,"title":"preston-lodge-high-school-supporting-need-christmas","story":"One of the appeals has seen the school organise its annual lsquoreverse Advent calendarrsquo.Typically,

Available nowReal, non-fetishised bisexual characters can be few and far between in literature, but You Exist Too Much isnt just worth reading for its efforts in representation. Its a stunning debut from Zaina Arafat, following the le of its nameless narrator: a -something Palestinian-American writer struggling with her identity. The story jumps between her memories of visiting Palestine as a child and growing up in America, and her present day dealings with failed affairs and love addiction. At its core is a troubled relationship with her mother, who refuses to accept her for who she is. Its a devastating portrayal of what its like to feel as though you never fit in - both in terms of the narrators sexuality and racial identity.

The resulting patchwork sketches the dizzying extremes well, from harrowing loss and danger to everyday drudgery. However, Owls commentary on the stories and his own le sometimes lacks the same personality and nuance. Throughout, letters from an unidentied literary translator arrive, and the revelation of their authors identity at the novels climax is one of its most effective moments. While Owl complains that Arab publishers find his prose too vulgar, for English readers the sexual frankness and profanity may no longer shock. At best, they show him dealing with the same banal frustrations and urges as everyone .Non-fictionA Promised Land by Barack Obama is published in hardback by Viking Books, priced pound .

In the first of a two-volume series, the th President of the United States chronicles his first two and a half years in office with a knack for simplying even the most complex political processes, and decades-long conflicts. A Promised Land is never hard going, but - inevitably for a -page tome - some chapters are more compelling than others. Where the brilliantly written book really comes to le is when Obama lets down his guard and gives us a glimpse of the swearing, cigarette-smoking, martini-drinking man behind the myth, offering deliciously acerbic assessments of world leaders. Exasperation is a recurring theme as the idealistic Obama butts heads with adversaries at home and abroad - its reassuring to learn that even the most powerful man on the planet felt helpless at times, and a delight to discover what was really going on behind that seemingly unflappable exterior.Childrens book of the weekWhere Snow Angels Go by Maggie OFarrell, illustrated by Daniela Jaglenka Terrazzini, is published in hardback by Walker Books, priced pound..Where do snow angels go  According to this beautully illustrated book, the impressions left in the ground eventually melt and fade to become our s looking on from above.

A small group of us gatherin the delectable converted barn, whipping up chocolate silk pies with pear and caramel, cherry crumble blondies and the best carrot cake Ive ever tasted. Here are some of the things I learned on the way.... If your cake batter curdles - or any mixture splits when using fat, pop it over a bain-marieand whisk vigorously. If youre using a KitchenAid, warm the bowl with a blow torch, and then whisk. Do this quickly though - you dont want your mixture lurking over the hot water for too long.. When putting pastry in the fridge, flatten it into a disk, rather than balling it into a boulder, so you dont have to turn a big ball into a flat disk later.. If your pastry shrinks in the oven, it means youve overworked it. Start again!. Use a toothbrush to create pretty splashes when youre icing a cake.. Roast damsons in the oven and use them to make jam. The stones squeeze out easily after being roasted, and you can use the juice in your cake frosting .. Use a hot kne to slice your cakes up - this works especially well for fridge-cooled gooey brownies. Warm your kne up by dipping it in hot water.. To stop an icing-sugar dust cloud, mix the butter and icing sugar with the paddle by hand, pressing it down, before turning your mixer on.. Use egg yolk, a tiny splash of water and a pinch of salt for the perfect egg wash.. Use acrylic rods when rolling out pastry to ensure its the perfect thickness all the way through.. Always leave scone dough to rest - it takes  mins for the baking powder to get to work, to relax the gluten and give you soft, pillowy scones.. Weigh your liquid ingredients - jug measurements arent always right.. When you make pastry or dough, mix it in your mixer to start with, but bring it together by hand for a perfectly smooth consistency.. When making sweet pastry, use sugar not icing sugar. Icing sugar can make the pastry rubbery.. Use white sugar when making caramel, not golden, because its more refined, so there are fewer bits in it that might crystallise.. Use rice for blind baking, not baking beans - its cheaper!. When making carrot cake , grate your carrots into a clean tea towel and squeeze out any excess water. Sprinkle a bit of sugar on the grated carrot to help absorb even more.. Use paperclips to secure your baking paper to the pans - this stops it blowing around in a fan oven.. If your pastry breaks when you roll it out, simply give it a very quick knead, then put plenty of flour down and roll it out again. Have a pastry brush on hand to dust off any excess flour.. Le is too short to make your own puff pastry. Use ready-rolled, so long as its all-butter.For more information on John Whaites Kitchen, or to book a cookery course, visit johnwhaiteskitchen."},{"url":null,"title":"five-things-stairways-heaven","story":"Whaligoe Steps, CaithnessIt was women who used to do most of the hard work of lugging creels up and down the clf-side zig-zag of between  and  steps to the Whaligoe Haven, Scotlandrsquos least accessible harbour.

A gt from John Lennon to the workers of the Upper Clyde Shipbuilders, who were waging a work-in.Jimmy Reid had made his impromptu speech the week before. You know the one. The speech that sent a current through the crowd: ldquoWe are taking over these yards because we refuse to accept that faceless men, or any group of men can take decisions that affect our livelihoods with impunity.Forty years ago tomorrow John Lennon was killed in New York. But therersquos another link between Lennon and Jimmy Reid. An unknown one.While transcribing hours of recordings with Jimmy for a planned book, that link resurfaced last week. Irsquod worked with him on his magazine, Seven Days, in June . Later that year we got down to work on a full-scale autobiography. The interviews flourished into fascinating reflections from a man whorsquod walked with history.Viewers of the documentary Imagine will recall an encounter between Lennon and American cartoonist Al Capp. It occurred during the bed-in for peace with Yoko Ono in . Capprsquos visit wasnrsquot exactly an exercise in solidarity. In fact, the ldquodebate made the Ali-Frazer fight look like a warm bath. If Capp considered the bed-in a plaything of self-publicists he wasnrsquot above playing to the camera himself. Intermittently witty, he swerves from theatrical snarls to ungallant slurs against Yoko. Lennon responded in kind.Jimmy Reidrsquos own encounter with Capp, at the American Embassy in November , was part of a World in Action special on Nixonrsquos re-election. Jimmy had admired his Lirsquol Abner cartoon strip as a kid. This was because as a young illustrator Capprsquos strip extolled the virtues of the New Deal. His targets  Wall Street wheeler dealers, robber barons, and Tammany Hall politicos.Now, however, Capp approached him wearing a Nixon badge. A sight so incongruous Jimmy mustrsquove wonderedreality-altering fumes were pouring out of the embassyrsquos wallpaper. Jimmyrsquos reputation preceded him. Chomping a cigar Capp railed against him for ldquoDestroying the England of Nelson and Churchill. A lively debate ensued. But in style and manner it was very dferent from the Lennon altercation.Lennon, after his heavyweight bout, referred to his fellow-combatant as ldquoAl Crapp, and, therersquos a theory his song When Yoursquore Crippled Inside was written about Capp, who was fitted with a prosthetic leg after a childhood accident. An example of Lennon nursing his wrath to keep it warm Jimmy, with his customary grace, sought common ground with Capp. Although hersquod recast himself as the scourge of student protests back home, Jimmy recognised Capp as a man whorsquod marched with Martin Luther King. Perhaps his volte face wasnrsquot so much ideological as generational. A desperate defence of a past long since vanished. Capp had grown up in the s, and struggled to understand a changing society, particularly on the campuses of the s and s.Although Jimmy believed the day the music died was when Count Basie vacated the hit parade, he never stopped encouraging young people to ldquostorm the heavens. His altruism recognised that change wasnrsquot only inevitable but desirable. Embracing the new helped build a Jerusalem here on Earth. Not utopia, but a society where human potential flourished.The Jimmy Reid I knew personied a joyous humanity. His kindness and decency werenrsquot a ploy to win public approval, but formed the core of his character.Imagine that became a trend Brian McGeachan is an author and playwright"},{"url":null,"title":"Iain Macwhirter  The loss of BiFab is a national humiliation","story":"BiFab should have had just the right skills and know-how to move into the renewable energy age by building turbine jackets for the wind farms that are bristling around Scotlands coast. But it was not to be.Last week, the Scottish Government effectively signed BiFabs death warrant. This in the very week that Boris Johnson announced a dramatic further increase in targets for the reduction of UK emissions, most of which will be achieved through offshore wind.:Over poundm of taxpayers money face being lost as ministers rule out nationalisation of collapsed BiFabSo much for the green jobs revolution. Scotlands major hope for getting a poundbn slice of the renewable energy action has gone south.This is a major political scandal, and rightly condemned by a vote of the Scottish Parliament last week. BiFab has not one but two major windfarms on its very Fe doorstep: the Seagreen array off Angus and Neart na Goailthe . These poundbn projects together had contracts out for at least  full Methil jackets.It beggars belief that BiFab was unable to get any of this work, despite a poundm bung to its Canadian owners JV Driver.Instead, the French state-owned energy giant, EDF, will build them mostly in Asian yards and have them dragged , miles by diesel tugs.A jaunty-sounding Fiona Hyslop, the Scottish Economy Secretary, told Good Morning Scotland that her hands were tied by Brussels competition rules. Too bad. Lessons to be learned etc.. But arent we supposed to be leaving the EU  Why would they have any say in the matter It would be ldquonaive, she replied, to believe that these state aid restrictions will not continue in some form. Well,so, why did the Scottish Government pony up so much cash in the first place If Scotland is the Saudi Arabia of renewables, BiFabs loss is surely a national humiliation. No other country would countenance such industrial defeatism, certainly not Norway which now has a substantial stake in renewables.The Scottish Government has merely acquired a track record for pouring public money into lost causes from Prestwick Airport to Ferguson Marine. This confirms that civil servants and politicians are just not very good at business. They dont understand it.They leap into action chasing favourable headlines by promising cash injections, only to stand aside thereafter as it gets burnt by private sector companies whorsquoll never turn away free money.What Scotland lacks is a coherent overall industrial strategy, or any industrial strategy. We hear homilies about building back better and making the economy work ldquofor people not profit instead of just making it work.The Scottish Government had the option of taking over BiFab at next to no cost, but declined on the basis that a nationalised BiFab would still be hamstrung by European competition rules.This is a reminder that however much SNP likes to talk left and talk green, at least when trying to enlist support at elections time, it is no more socialist than New Labour or even Boris Johnson.:Anger as part Scottish Government-owned BiFab files for administrationPerhaps less so, now that the Tory government has essentially taken half the British workforce onto the public payroll and borrowed more money faster than even Jeremy Corbyn intended.No one wants to live in a communist state, but we have the right to expect the Scottish Government to have an activist industrial policy that puts Scotland first.That may sound like Donald Trump, but he wasnt wrong about the need to challenge corporate globalisation and labour arbitrage ndash that is, companies exporting jobs to low-wage countries and destroying the domestic industrial base.Ms Hyslop lamented that Scotland couldnt compete with workers being paid pound. an hour in China or Indonesia. But it beggars belief that Scotland couldnt secure some guarantees from EDF that local, sustainable industry should be part of the supply chain. The Scottish Government has many planning powers and licenses these mega windfarms in the first place.Every year Nicola Sturgeon makes inflated promises abut a green jobs revolution.

As The Herald reported earlier this year, of the , direct green jobs promised back in , only , have actually materialised.We are now told therell be , new jobs in the great green rebuild. But where are they coming from  We may have % of Europes wind energy but it is being exploited by foreign state-owned companies, like EDF, employing workers in China, UAE, Indonesia ndash anywhere but Scotland. If the Scotland is incapable of exploiting our own environmental assets then people are going to ask: what is the point of leaving the UK What happened to the tidal power revolution in the Pentland Firth  That was what Alex Salmond was actually referring to when he first coined the phrase ldquoSaudi Arabia of Renewables ten years ago. The original Peterhead Carbon Capture and Storage project was going to use old mine shafts to sequester carbon dioxide. That was axed in  by the UK Government.Then there was Pelamis, which developed the first commercial wave power machine at the European Marine Energy Centre in Orkney. Gone. The UKs only wind turbine tower manufacturer, CS Wind in Campbeltown, effectively shut up shop in August.Few are aware that Scotland had one of Europes leading environmental bus manufacturers in Alexander Dennis in Falkirk ndash but not for much longer. The Scottish Government is very good at making bold pronouncements about net zero and banning petrol and diesel cars. But words are cheap.Where is the network of charging points for electric vehicles  What about replacing dirty diesel busses and trucks  Alexander Dennis designed clean hydrogen and electric buses, but has just axed  jobs.It rather looks asthe green jobs revolution is going to amount to more dodgy home insulation schemes, some trees, and a forest of green lobbyists surrounding shiny-bottom bureaucrats at interminable conferences on COP.We hear pious lectures from ministers about how we should be cycling and not using cars, while they travel around in their ministerial Lexuses. Local governments like Edinburgh are doing their best to reduce car journeys in the city through a campaign of permanent roadworks and guerilla pedestrianisation.Yet, bus travel has been declining fast, down % over the last  years, and that was before Covid. Until the pandemic, cycling was also in decline over the same period.Where is the smart public transport system with through ticketing and computerised, integrated rail and bus services  The only signicant urban transport investment recently was the ruinously expensive Edinburgh tram taking ldquohigh value folk from Princes Street to Edinburgh Airport.The Scottish Government will say that Scotland isnt an industrial powerhouse like America or China or UAE and cant just conjure dynamic world-beating industries out of thin air. Butthe nationalists cant deliver an industrial strategy that moves Scotland into the green age then their promises about an independent future may lack credibility.

Which  called each provider  times at dferent times of the day and days of the week.The consumer organisation said that call centres have faced challenges as they adapted to new ways of working due to the pandemic.However they said at the time of the investigation in September and October, it was clear that while some were coping well, others were \"struggling\" to provide an acceptable level of customer service.The consumer organisation said it was more important than ever that companies answer calls and respond to customer queries quickly, and strive to offer customers who may be struggling a good level of customer service.:One in nine Scots say energy bills are unaffordableAround a third of energy firms kept customers waiting for more than  minutes on average before their calls were answered - including three other large energy companies.Perth-based SSE typically took nine minutes and  seconds to pick up, while Glasgow-based Scottish Power took just two minutes and  seconds.On average, Npower took  minutes and  seconds to answer calls, while Eon only picked up calls after  minutes and  seconds. EDF Energy customers were left waiting  minutes and  seconds on average before their calls were answered.Natalie Hitchins, head of home products and services at Which, said: ldquoWe know the pandemic has made things dficult for call centres, but it is unacceptable that some firms are still wasting customersrsquo time with such long waits, especially at a time when consumers may need additional support from their provider.ldquoCustomer service is an important factor when choosing an energy provider. Those who face y waits just to speak with a customer service adviser should consider moving to a provider that can offer better service - customers could also save hundreds of pounds a year by switching.Together Energy, which recently acquired the domestic customer base of Bristol Energy, was the fastest energy provider to pick up calls, with customers left waiting for just  seconds on average. British Gas Scottish Gas said it faced challenges with staff at overseas call centres working home, such as broadband and connectivity issues, and power cuts. It said it is recruiting more staff and supplying home workers with new tech.A Boost spokesman said: ldquoWith our waiting times during the last quarter averaging  minutes, wersquore disappointed not to meet our usual high standards for our customers. During this period, we had a higher number of customers contacting us to ask for support.ldquoWersquore always looking for ways to improve and have planned for additional resources over winter.

It was Chekhov who is said to have maintained that a pistol hanging on the wall in act one should be fired at the end of act three sound advice for plays and short stories, no doubt, but a distinctly alarming prospect in real le.Chekhovrsquos point, however, was about eradicating the unnecessary. If only, in the real world, we could go back to act one and decide that certain bits of the storyrsquos set-up wonrsquot fit in with the happy ending we now have in mind, and tinker around with the original conditions.Alas, most things just drt along endlessly without a plot. But the talks between the UK and EU over our relationship after the transition period really will have a conclusion ndash though probably more like the end of a story arc in a never-ending soap opera than Charlton Heston spotting the half-buried Statue of Liberty.Hundreds of thousands of things will have to be hammered out or altered in the future, evensome sort of deal is announced this week. The same is true of the dramas in storeone isnrsquot reached. Itrsquos a real deadline nonetheless, and whatever happens, by next week people will be constructing all sorts of competing narratives to account for it.The UK Government will paint it as a triumph, naturally, or at least a plucky victory in the face of overwhelming adversity, whatever it is. If therersquos anything that could be, however implausibly, described as a deal, so will the EU. Everyone  will call it a cataclysm, a recipe for disaster, the worst of all possible worlds.Yet whatever story we tell about the point wersquove now reached, it will not follow on from any of the narratives we were expecting ndash like everything  that has happened since David Cameron decided he had no option but to offer a referendum. Itrsquos hard even to remember that itrsquos almost exactly a year since Boris Johnson won the election handsomely on a promise to ldquoget Brexit done.And while he has, after a fashion, it is clearly nothing like what was promised by the Leave side during the campaign ndash easiest deal ever, etc. Nor, however, has whatrsquos followed been much like what the Remain side predicted, either. There may have been meltdown, but it wasnrsquot Brexit that caused it.One big dference is that the tale of the UK and the EU is now almost exactly like any other foreign policy story. Everything is about the nitty-gritty of trade-offs : the economy, reciprocal rights, visa requirements and other boring stuff that comes up in the UKrsquos deals with Japan, Canada, New Zealand or anywhere . The great, mythic story of the EU and its manest destiny has been entirely forgotten. When was the last time you heard anybody talking about the ldquoinisibility of EU rulesor the inevitability of ldquoever greater union A few days ago, Peter Mandelson made the extraordinary admission that much of the responsibility for Britain being out of the EU on much harder terms than either side predicted lay with Remainers who tried to overturn the referendum result . Even Tony Blair has conceded that Brexit as a political argument ndashnot the wrangling about what happens afterwards ndash is over.The great pity of all this is that the option for which both arch-Europhiles and, judging by what they said back then, the leaders of the Leave campaign would probably have settled ndash something like EEA or Efta membership ndash is now a dead duck.Well, thatrsquos how the story turned out, evenit is clumsy scriptwriting ndash something we can blame not just on Lord Mandelson, but Theresa Mayrsquos moronic ldquored lines and the constantly changing demands of those, like Nigel Farage, for whom no Brexit would ever be hard enough. It may have been an unwelcome twist, but it wasnrsquot one that could be wished away or revised. Think of it as a bit like the moment in From Dusk Till Dawn when a fairly realistic crime film suddenly turns, with no warning at all, into a camp, blood-soaked vampire movie.As far as both sides of the English Channel are concerned, tidying up Brexit is now just one more thing on the list. Itrsquos not even all that firmly at the top of the list. The overwhelming reason for that is the Covid emergency.The apocalyptic warnings of Remainers about economic catastrophe now look pretty flimsy, since both the UK and EU are in the midst of much worse anyway. Covid has cost hundreds of times more than the worst predictions of Brexitrsquos impact. It may even concentrate both sides on finding mutually workable solutions, rather than preserving their own positions above all.The EU is more worried about keeping Poland and Hungary in line, and securing agreement on how much its southern members should pay towards dealing with coronavirus, than it is about the UKrsquos departure. The UK has spent so much that a total reconstruction of the economy is not just an aspiration, but a necessity. The issues in any EU deal are now aspects of domestic ones ndash restructuring, securing enough foreign workers, trying to maintain the Union, increasing trade and productivity ndash rather than the other way round.Most of us still hope for some kind of deal but itrsquos not now a question of no deal being better than a bad deal. Itrsquos that neither a bad deal or no deal seems like nearly as big a deal as it did this time last year."},{"url":null,"title":"bbc-iplayers-streamed-programme-2020-revealed","story":"The television adaptation of Sally Rooneyrsquos novel proved to be more popular on the  than other leading programmes including Killing Eve, MasterChef and The Split.There have been a total of . billion streams across all content on iPlayer this year, which is a % rise on the same period last year and is a new record for the BBC.:Most streamed programme of  on iPlayer revealed by the BBCKilling Eve was the second most-watched programme and was streamed a total of ,, times.Cookery programme MasterChef ranked third with ,,, followed by legal drama The Split with ,,.The single most popular episode of a programme on iPlayer was the series three opener of Killing Eve, which was streamed ,, times.The first episode of Normal People was streamed on ,, occasions.:Billy Connolly on his all-time favourite stand-up, and being stood up in PerthThe drama focuses on the on-again-off-again relationship between Irish teenagers Marianne and Connell, beginning in their school days through to their time at university.Dan McGolpin, the controller of BBC iPlayer, said: ldquoItrsquos been a tough year for so many of us but through two national lockdowns and many dficult months BBC iPlayer has been there to keep us entertained and well informed wherever you are throughout the UK, seeing five billion requests for the first time ever.ldquoItrsquos pleasing to see the sensational adaptation of Sally Rooneyrsquos Normal People take top slot as the biggest series of the year and there have been other brand new drama series among the most popular, such as Michaela Coelrsquos I May Destroy You, The Nest and The Secrets She Keeps, as well as hugely popular ers like Killing Eve and The Split."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/12115695.jpg?type=article-full","title":"like-ebenezer-scrooge---australian-newspaper-called-first-ministers-response-royals-flouting-travel-ban","story":"A row erupted yesterday after the royals decided to come to Scotlanddespite warnings fromthe Scottish Government about the strict rules over crossing the Border.The First Minister on Monday said the Scottish Government knew the couple wanted to come by Royal Train as part of a nationwide tour thanking workers on the coronavirus frontline.She refused to endorse the visit amidst a row that it broke Covid rules and said the Government ldquomade sure the royals were aware ldquoof the restrictions in place in Scotland so that could inform both the decision and the planning of the visit.Welsh Health Minister Vaughan Gethingcriticised William and Kates decision to travel to Wales as Covid cases rise, saying he would prefer itldquono-one was having unnecessary visitsMr Gething said he was not ldquoparticularly bothered or interested when asked during by BBC Radio rsquos Today programmehe thought the couple should still travel to Wales.But he said William and Katersquos visit, part of a national tour by royal train, should not be used by people as an ldquoexcuse to say they are ldquoconfused about coronavirus regulations.:Nicola Sturgeon says Royal household reminded of travel ban before William and Kate visitThe Australian, the only daily newspaper distributed nationally, whose editorial line has been described as centre-right, had a dferent interpretation of the events in reporting the row, describing the royals \"hearty dispensation of goodwill was interrupted by a bah-humbug\" from Nicola Sturgeon.It went on: \"In tones rivalling those of Ebenezer Scrooge in a Christmas Carol, Ms Sturgeon curtly reminded Prince William and Kate there were currently restrictions in place to try and control the spread of coronavirus, restricting travel in Scotland except for work purposes.\"Crossing the Scottish border was made illegal from the end of November and anyone caught entering or leaving Scotland without a reasonable excuse could be slapped with a pound fine.There are exceptions, including travel for work or to provide voluntary or charitable services, but only when this cannot be done from home.Royal sources said the trip was permitted under the work purposes exemption.The Royals arrived in Edinburgh on Monday morning to the sound of bagpipes serenading them with Christmas songs, before meeting workers at a Scottish Ambulance Service hub.The pair are attempting to spread festive cheer to frontline workers ahead of the Christmas holidays on their -hour train tour.

From the northern isles’ perspective, we see it rather dferently. The pandemic has shown us what is possible for other people because so many people in my constituency are left bumping along on speeds that are less than  megabits per second.“I joined the st century just a couple of weeks ago, when I bought myself an iPhone , which has G capability. I speed tested it as I was coming up for the debate today. I got a speed test of  megabits per second download and  megabits per second upload. We have spoken for years about a digital ide, but that ide is now a chasm.“For Orkney and Shetland, the idea that internet speeds and access to the internet should be more than  times greater in SW than in KW,  and , and ZE,  and  illustrates the nature of the problem we face. It speaks eloquently about the failure. Simply leaving it to the private sector is what has produced the situation today.“My hon. Friend the Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross [Jamie Stone] asked “Who is responsible for this ” We have this constantly in Scotland: on the one hand, there is the provision made by the Scottish Government and, on the other, we have schemes funded by the UK Government. The dficulty is that neither of them gives us what we need.“This House legislated for a universal service in broadband. Constituents of mine get quotes from BT for that and they hear of £,, £, or £, for a broadband connection to get them to  megabits per second. If that is only available to people who have a spare £,, £, or £, lying around the house, it is hardly a universal service.“However, my constituents are also frustrated at the lack of certainty and community consultation we see from the R scheme of the Scottish Government. We still do not know what they are going to deliver and when we are going to get it. All the signs are that the problems that we have had—a service to be deployed in the isles that is designed in Edinburgh what people in Edinburgh think we can get and we need—are going to be there again. The most remote and the most economically fragile communities in my constituency still risk being left behind.“It should not be rocket science. Surely, with a bit of will, the Governments could speak to each other and do better than this.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Another would involve a change to soft drink sales.She added: “We have a drinks chiller at the front but were looking at introducing a bar restaurant-style system where fizzy drinks come from mixer taps.“If we could get something like that, we would be saving not just on bottles but also the water used for these which is transported around the country and is another waste.“That is quite a big investment, though, so I wouldn’t be able to consider that without a grant.”Zero Waste Scotland has said it will administer a total of £, in grant funding provided by the Scottish Government and European Regional Development Fund to empower island shops to take the next steps in the war on waste by ditching single-use packaging and moving to reusable options.It says that the new scheme would see cash made available to existing small and medium-sized enterprises in the isles to make the transition to package free dispensers.“My shop is so small, it is not just about fitting in the new stuff but also about moving everything  around so I don’t lose the things that I sell which enables me to pay staff and support the local community,” she said.“We have tried to do what we can within our budget. We do glass milk bottles for people, we have dispensing units for refills for washing up liquid and laundry liquid.“There are things that I have looked at that we can do, and sothey had just given us that money I applied for then I would have been really happy!”The scheme opened on th October, but Nancy stressed that wasn’t a great deal of time for small business owners like her.“It sounds like a lot of time but when you are running a shop it isn’t very long. We had to get three dferent quotes for some of these things,” she said.“I’m in the shop five and a half days a week — and my afternoons off have been spent on the phone and the internet scoping out possible projects. I don’t really have the extra time it takes to do it.”She added: “If I can’t come out with a scheme then we don#t get anything is my understanding at the moment.“I know it is worth putting a bit of effort in, though, becauseit does work I can really make a dference to the shop and the environment.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/kate-forbes.jpg","title":"summit on future of gaelic as a community","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe summit on Tuesday st December, pm, will be co-chaired by Kate Forbes, constituency MSP for Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch.

This includes users of all ages and levels of mobility – cyclists, walkers, runners and wheelchair and mobility vehicle users.The route has been chosen to promote active travel, link communities, improve local access, and act as a springboard for an island-wide network of safe paths.The project group has lodged a planning application for the Skye Bridge to Ashaig Airstrip section of the route, following the old A road where possible. And they are now starting on a detailed consultation for a link between Ashaig and Broadford.In March the project group held a community consultation on the three possible routes for this section. It was concluded that the single track ‘committee road’ option running through Breakish would give the best compromise between a quiet, scenic, low-traffic area, and the straightest, most direct route. This was the link most favoured by public consultees. met with supporters of the project outside Breakish Hall to find out what the Skye Cycle Way would mean to them.Broadford Primary pupil Krista said a cycle path would allow her and other children to do what they loved without any worries.She said: “For little kids that want to do more cycling it would be safer because just a little slip off the pavement could lead to a road accidentthere’s a car coming, so I think the cycle path would be really handy.“It wouldn’t put me at risk of traffic and it would mean I just go out and cycle.”Breakish resident Lis Phillips felt the cycle way could help recapture the feeling of safety for cyclists experienced during the lockdown.She said: “I cycle back and forth to my work at Broadford surgery, and during the lockdown, I noticed people on bikes who I’ve never seen cycling before because there were hardly any cars on the roads.“There is obviously an appetite for people to be able to cycle but they don’t feel it is safe, so they don’t do it.”The project group has been working with engineering consultants and main funder Sustrans, to come up with a design proposal for the route that will meet their requirements.The plans involve separating cyclists from pedestrians and other users. Cyclists would share the single-track carriageway with motor traffic, and pedestrians would enjoy a new . metre wide footpath. that the safer environment would help pupils thrive.“There is no way to avoid traffic when you are living here in Broadford, it is so busy – all the traffic that comes through Skye comes through us. So for the children, it was quite daunting to let them out on their bikes through the village.“However, during the lockdown, they were out on bikes, and more of them were cycling than ever before. You are seeing fitter and healthy children with just that bit more independence and freedom.“The cycle way is a wonderful thing.”Kyleakin resident Ian Sikorski, who has a family house in the area, earmarked the best route between Ashaig and Broadford through the community consultation and said: “Hopefully people will see the necessity for it. We have the house at the end of the ‘committee road’ beside the cattle grid.“My auntie lived there, and at that time there weren’t many houses at all. Now look at the number, and in another  years there will probably be twice the number – and you have seen the state of the road, so it badly needs a footpath.“Highland Council should have put in a footpath really. It is definitely needed. If people with families are going to build houses then it would be greatthey are able to walk and cycle along to Broadford or Kyleakin.“I used to cycle up that main road, regularly. I haven#t cycled it for years now. It is too dangerous.”﻿‘Future users’ group to be launched to help shape design of cycle way﻿The Skye Cycle Way project group secured funding from Transport Scotland via Sustrans to develop the detailed design proposals for the whole route, secure access permissions, and planning consents, and work up its strategy for finding the estimated £. million required. Match funding will be needed as this accounts for  per cent of the overall project costs.This builds on earlier feasibility studies, concept designs, and community consultation undertaken during , also funded by Transport Scotland and Sustrans. that a ‘future users’ group will be launched in the new year to ensure that all sections of the community have the opportunity to help shape the design of the path.They added: “We want this to be a safe, shared-use path for everybody, an asset for our communities, our environment, and our economy.”Due to Covid restrictions, the group have been unable to hold any face-to-face public consultations since March but are hoping this changes in the new year..

As well as the council, the plan involves Highlands and Islands Enterprise and the Scottish Futures Trust.All three agencies will help identy funding, once the list of projects has been agreed under five broad headings: Strengthening communities, health and education, sustainable tourism, digital and transport infrastructure and a erse and green economy.This week, following an online area committee meeting, Skye and Raasay councillors welcomed the progress to date .Tourism body SkyeConnect also welcomed the potential for the plan to deliver material benefits for the island.A spokesman added: “The priorities for SkyeConnect are, unsurprisingly, additional toilet facilities, road improvements, car parking and a greater provision of ’stop-over’ locations for campervans with appropriate basic infrastructure. In addition, SkyeConnect is working with a number of bodies to develop a so-called ‘internet of things’ which will greatly assist in managing the flow of visitors around the island.”The ‘internet of things’ concept sees digital infrastructure providing real time information on traffic flow and footfall at key locations. This can then be used to send mobile alerts to visitors with suggestions for alternative sites that are not too busy.John Gordonwas pleased the plan was “progressing well” as it had been a priority for Skye and Raasay councillors for some time. He also thought that upgrading Portree harbour would be an ideal project.“This update is encouraging and is an exciting development for Skye and Raasay,” he added. “Over the last few years we have seen some great partnership working at ious tourist hot-spots that has attracted some investment which has made a signicant dference, but we acknowledge there is much to do, and major investment is still needed.“The local area committee and partners are ambitious for Skye and Raasay and this investment plan which spells out actions for coordinating and securing funding and for the implementation of the plan.”Calum Munro highlighted the redevelopment of Uig harbour as a possible candidate for inclusion.He added: “The development of the Skye and Raasay investment plan is at an important and exciting phase as over the next two months stakeholders gather to engage with all the potential projects which will be part of that plan. It will be great to look at projects and see which ones best achieve the outcomes we want to see for Skye and Raasay in terms of infrastructure, strengthening communities, health and education, developing a green and erse economy and sustainable tourism.“Looking at these projects and identying interconnectedness and partnership opportunities is crucial and it’s clear that to bring in the required investment there needs to be an approach which is strategic and cohesive.“We are now at the stage where virtually the whole of Skye and Raasay have formed community trusts so I’m really looking forward to seeing some of these communities building on the work they’ve already done and achieving some of their other ambitions over the next two-three years.”Calum MacLeod said: “I’d like to see a collaborative economic recovery plan continuing with all relevant stakeholders’ involvement that is essential to address the Covid impact, and also a continuing plan to address at pace more attainable affordable housing. “The plan would also be a great opportunity to improve sustainable green tourism including better public transport infrastructure and the Skye cycle path.“It is a necessity to see trunk road agencies working closer together in achieving better and safer measures for all road users and residents working with councillors. The good work and investment that has been established to date on improving ious key projects should continue going forward towards full development.”For John Finlayson, a place-based and joined up Skye plan is “long overdue” and it was essential that the public sector, businesses, community interests and the wider community “work together to support economic recovery and development taking account of the unique challenges and the unique opportunities” in the Eilean a’ Cheo ward.He added: “The key areas of focus in what has to be an outcome driven plan and which were included in the report to the area committee are strong starting points for further community discussion and engagement. But I doubt many willargue that strengthening communities, health and education, sustainable tourism, digital and transport infrastructure and a erse and green economy are not areas we need to focus on.“I personally have a strong commitment to ensuring the best for our young people. This of course means that we need to make sure that our children are educated in st century buildings which provide safe, healthy and modern learning environments and I will continue to champion the need to build new schools at Broadford and Dunvegan.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3513753.jpg--.jpg?1607082664000\n","title":"christmas trees switch on lights up ballyclug mews","story":"COVID- has failed to dim Christmas Tree plans at Ballclug Mews in Ballymena.Because of restrictions the Residents Group were unable to facilitate putting up a real tree.

Shops, hairdressers, restaurants, places of worship and hotels are among the places that will be able to re-open from December . Pubs selling drink onlywill remain closed and an additional financial package will be put in place. The Executive has also agreed Christmas household bubbling arrangements from December -. Three households will be able to come together for this period in domestic settings, outdoor public spaces and places of worship. One of the households will be able to include their existing household bubble. First Minister Arlene Foster said: “Through our collective efforts over recent weeks we gained enough space in the transmission of the virus to relax a signicant number of restrictions, including the opening-up of non-essential retail, close contact services, sport and leisure activities and our places of worship at the end of next week. “These decisions will give families, businesses and employees some much-needed certainty and comfort in the run-up to Christmas and beyond. “This is a special time of the year and we want to support people to have a good Christmas, but also a safe one. “Signicant work has been completed with business sectors, faith groups, local government and police on new mitigation measures to reduce the risk of transmission. “I urge everyone to be Covid-aware and to make careful and sensible decisions when out and about or mixing with others. We need to make sure we continue doing all we can to protect ourselves and our loved ones.” Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill said: “The Executive wants to give people as much notice as possible on what the situation will look like from next Friday when the current circuit breaker comes to an end. “We have given detailed consideration to which restrictions need tobe maintained, and what we can open up, in light of the scientic and medical advice. “A package of measures that will see signicant relaxations to the current restrictions has been agreed, with maximum mitigations in place to minimise risks to the greatest extent possible. An additional support package will be put in place for traditional drink-only pubs that unfortunately will not be able to reopen at this time. “We appreciate how important Christmas time is for many families and the Executive has agreed arrangements that will allow families and friends to come together in a limited way between  and  December. “It’s important for people to understand that with any increased contact comes increased risk. Everyone needs to think very carefully about the risks posed to them, and their loved ones, by coming together over the Christmas period, particularly to those who are vulnerable. Some may choose not to form a Christmas bubble but for those who do, we encourage them to keep their bubbles small and limit the numbers of people gathering, as much as possible.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3517048.jpg--.jpg?1607350157000\n","title":"work plan for cullybackey level crossing","story":"Translink, alongside our contractor Babcock, will be carrying out essential maintenance and resurfacing work at Cullybackey North level crossing as part of a wider programme of service enhancements at level crossings across the network.This work is essential in order to maintain the safety, reliability and resilience of the crossing and the new surface will also help reduce noise from traffic as it passes across it.This work will take place overnight on Wednesday th December.

Reflecting on their delayed wedding plans, Lauren, who is a professional wedding photographer, explained that the original idea was to reschedule their wedding for April  - but her diary quickly filled up with other couples reorganising their own weddings.We also said to ourselves, #What are we waiting for, we just want to get married#, so we decided to stick with a date in November that we had arranged when the original day was cancelled, she said.A stressful few months later and amid restrictions changing regularly, the couple eventually got their big day last week.Much to Jason#s surprise and delight, four fully kitted out leboat crew members representing the station, were waiting outside the Arcadia in Portrush following the ceremony to provide a socially distanced guard of honour to wish the couple well.We could only have  guests along with Jason, myself and our two children but we were able to set up a live stream that allowed everybody  who should have been there to watch, Lauren said. Everyone went to such efforts in getting dressed up for the occasion and to join us in the wedding virtually.She continued: When it was over, we went for takeaway coffee and sat on the harbour overlooking the leboat station. Then we went home, had a takeaway and had our first dance in the kitchen.With her husband on the leboat crew in Portrush, Lauren knows all too well how important it is for volunteers to have the right lesaving kit and personal protection equipment.I am very proud that Jason is a volunteer but I do also worry when the pager beeps and he is called out to save others who are in trouble, she said. There is always such a sense of relief when he helps to bring those in dficulty back to safety but also when he s home safely himself.From the moment I met Jason, the RNLI pager became a part of my le too. The leboat has always been in Jason#s blood and he comes from a long family line who have been involved in helping to save lives at sea for generations.Lauren urged people to donate to the RNLI#s Christmas appeal, while Jason added that any donation would make a huge dference to the charity as it provides lesaving services.The best Christmas gt RNLI volunteers like me can wish for is a kind donation to our Christmas appeal, he said.

Seems there#s a united Ireland in the Marvel universe.But DUP MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson told the Belfaston Sunday that it represented ignorance of history more than anything .The notion that the display of this flag depicts an all-Ireland demonstrates the ignorance of both the game makers and those who don#t know their history.The flag depicted was actually the one representing Ireland when it was part of the United Kingdom.Indeed even to this day the harp is included within the Royal coat of arms with the British Royal family and is used by a number of British Army regiments including the Royal Irish regiment.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseSir Jeffrey DonaldsonGetty Images FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueSir Jeffrey Donaldson Sir Jeffrey added: Northern Ireland#s future within the UK won#t be determined by what#s in a Playstation game - it will be determined by the votes of the people of Northern Ireland.The blunder follows on from the BBC using the Irish tricolour to represent Northern Ireland on an episode of their breakfast programme.It led to First Minister Arlene Foster demanding that the organisation investigate the disgraceful gaffe.She hit out after the flag of the Irish Republic was used in the graphic illustrating dfering travel quarantine restrictions in place in the ious UK regions.Presenter Naga Munchetty apologised for the error, but Mrs Foster urged the BBC#s new director general Tim Davie to establish what went wrong.The party also said that its North Antrim MP Ian Paisley had emailed Mr Davie following the error to demand an apology.Belfast Most ReadDUP man flags up gaffe in Spiderman gameCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Nine deaths and  new cases reportedSpy-cam Northern Ireland doctor#s le flushed down toilet after losing career and marriageNI company boss cleared of shoplting from Tesco as judge dismisses #nonsense# caseArmagh’s All-Ireland celebrations set to be probed by sports body as county denies IRA singingLatest NewsManarrested in Keane Mulready Woods murder probeBelfast man Atcheson jailed after brandishing kne at policePolice investigating Maghera #serious assault# Johnson: It will be very dficult to reach trade deal with European UnionPervert Murphy snared by Northern Ireland paedo hunter group is jailed,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

She would have given you the last penny in her purse. She would have loved putting on a big hat and playing Lady Bountul all over the place, and she’d have had the money given away faster than me.”Frances added: “For the anniversary of my mum’s death I was running a knitting company and I made packs of blankets and hats and jumpers for the premature baby unit. I’ve never turned my back where there was a need I came across my entire le.”To date, the Co Down lottery winner, who was speaking publicly for the first time, said they have given away half of their fortune to others in the biggest ever Lottery giveaway, helping “thousands” of people, with Frances having lost count of “the number of times I’ve cried my eyes out” following a recipient’s response to her generosity.Frances dismissed suggestions that new found wealth could be as much a burden as a blessing.“This is just love and joy on a permanent basis,” she said.“How could this be a burden  It’s just like winning the lottery every day.”Yet, Frances, who suffers from a medical condition that has her destined for a wheelchair, is also all too aware that fabulous wealth can’t buy you everything.“My auntie told me I had Perthes’ disease as a kid,” she revealed.“When I was a baby I had a big metal frame around my hips my dad used to be able to pick me up with the back of the frame.“I just managed. I’ve always done plenty of sport but about  years ago my cruciate ligament went and all of a sudden the joints went so my mobility is really poor.”She told how she spent years “sitting on a chair, unable to go anywhere or do anything”.“I actually spent about three years in Northern Ireland sitting on a chair because I couldn’t really go anywhere or do anything,” she confided.“I had an operation the year before we won the lottery and it has got me back on my feet again for a bit but I will eventually not be able to walk so I’m preparing for that.”But Frances told the Belfastthat it’s not something that scares her at all.The mother of three daughters — Katrinaand twins Natalie and Fiona— added: “What can you do about it  You just have to get on with it.”She also revealed to this newspaper that her health condition was a factor in her choice of home. Although she had her heart set on a bungalow, estate agents insisted on showing her a castle and a -bed stately home which came with an entire village “somewhere in the north east” of England.But she’s perfectly happy in her current abode — “a five bedroom, brick-built house with good sized rooms and a couple of acres of garden” which she “found on the internet”.The Connollys’ generosity was especially appreciated during the ongoing pandemic.In Northern Ireland, the couple bought new sewing machines for charity workers who were making PPE during Covid, as well as sending food parcels to many sheltering alone.The pair also paid for hundreds of elderly patients in nursing homes to have iPads to Facetime their families — including Frances’ great aunt Sheila Graham — and for young carers to be able to learn from home.“Sheila’s home in Omagh was one of the ones that got tables to keep people from being isolated she was able to talk to my -year-old father Frank in Essex over Skype,” Frances said.Being filthy rich does, however, take some managing.“I get up at am so I can answer all the messages and emails people have sent me before I start a day’s work,” she said.“Then Paddy gets up and makes me my breakfast.”When asked what a multi-millionaire has for breakfast she replied: “Pancakes and pineapple juice this morning...”Frances, now based in Hartlepool, spent a lot of time in Northern Ireland in the pre-Covid days, and admitted that she always has got a buzz out of helping others.The businesswoman added that she has “been doing voluntary work since I was nine”.“Obviously I’m able to do it now on a much bigger scale and the buzz is bigger because you’re actually making a massive dference,” she said.Apart from splashing out on “some nice bits of jewellery” and “more clothes than I need” Frances admitted that she still looks for bargains.One of her most recent purchases was  bottles of Bollinger champagne for people working on the front line.“Patrick and I watched a programme on Monaco recently, and somebody spent £, on a single bottle of champagne,” Frances, who doesn’t drink alcohol, said.“I found a special offer on champagne for £ a bottle, and I’m saving them to hand out to people who deserve some gratitude.”In the meantime, her plans for  include doing a PhD in clinical psychology — and writing a book about her good fortune.Frances said that while money hasn’t changed her as a person, “it does change how you live”.“We’re living in a nicer house, driving nicer cars, I can make a shopping list and, miraculously, my PA just has everything in the fridge for me and it’d be absolutely amazing,” she said.“If I want to go and stay in a hotel I can just do that but it doesn’t change who you are.“We have come into money late. If you’d come to it when you’re young, you’d maybe let it change how you live a bit more.”Belfast Most ReadDUP man flags up gaffe in Spiderman gameCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Nine deaths and  new cases reportedSpy-cam Northern Ireland doctor#s le flushed down toilet after losing career and marriageNI company boss cleared of shoplting from Tesco as judge dismisses #nonsense# caseArmagh’s All-Ireland celebrations set to be probed by sports body as county denies IRA singingLatest NewsBelfast man Atcheson jailed after brandishing kne at policePolice investigating Maghera #serious assault# Johnson: It will be very dficult to reach trade deal with European UnionOlivia Muldoon#s bridal business is hair to stay: #Stuck at home was hard and I broke down and cried.

Annemarie Bell’s father, Hugh, died suddenly while showing a worker from The Resource Centre his famous Christmas garden on December , . He was  years of age at the time and had experienced a tough year with infections but remained fit. Hugh loved to decorate the family home at Moyola Walk in Shantallow at Christmas time where there was a ‘real sense of community’. He became known for his impressive festive displays and was hailed as the ‘King of Christmas’. googletag.cmd.push  Just prior to his death, Hugh taught daughter Annemarie how to wire the plugs but, she says, ‘little did I know, I would have to do it again so quickly’. He was well-known in the local community for his walks to Knock and charitable work with the Foyle Hospice, and also helped to organise the first Derry marathons. Annemarie said: “My daddy has been the king of Christmas from I can remember. “When we were young my mother and father smoked and they wrapped fag packets up with wrapping paper and hung them up on the tree. “That’s the tradition that I grew up with and shoe boxes at the bottom of the tree for fake presents. googletag.cmd.push “Our crib was always the centre piece of our home and the main focus of our celebrations.” When the family moved to Mount Vernon in Culmore, Hugh became even more invested in the Christmas season, lighting up hedges and setting up inflatable reindeers in the garden. “I’ve just followed suit now and added new features the past two years,” Annemarie explained. As a youth worker in Pennyburn she erected the Christmas tree as soon as Halloween ended. The spiritual side of Christmas is of most import to the family and as such they would have attended a Christmas nativity event at Thornhill.     The year Hugh died they had around  nativities but Annemarie continued gathering and now has  around the house. A nativity picture is the oldest item in the family’s collection. Sadly, some decorations have been consigned to the past, Annemarie explained: “We had this big inflatable snowman and it was really, really strange. “A big fat giant snowman, we must’ve had it for at least  years and my daddy died on the th and that just went kaput on the st. So, it was strange, it was probably one of his first.” This year, Annemarie says, many people have experienced hardship in the city with a further announcement this week of job cuts. She believes it is important for everyone to get back to basics and think about family and the true meaning of Christmas.  With the pandemic it felt strange for children to be locked indoors all day long. Annemarie reflected: “I think this Christmas is going to be more special for people, we’re more used to living with one another during the pandemic, and young people won’t be looking to run here, there and everywhere. “I’d imagine this year will be more traditional, that family board games will come back. “And people won’t want their children going to other houses. “When you look at the row of houses lit up in Shantallow right now, that is community. “I was driving around after work last night and you see houses lit up that weren’t before and you think to yourself, isn’t that so beautul, so much hope and joy in the community. “For me, that’s why my daddy wanted to do it, to spread some joy.” She added: “The wains are at school at the minute but the binmen were shouting to me, ‘your garden is class, I’m so glad you followed on in your daddy’s footsteps!’ “Those kind of comments from someone out doing his job, that’s what it’s all about.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Greenhaw care centre has been the subject of a court order following an RQIA inspection on September . That required the Trust to relocate all  residents. Greenhaw is a -bed privately owned care home located on Racecourse Road which specialises in providing care to those with dementia. By October , it emerged that  residents had relocated, however, due to a Covid- outbreak the remaining  residents moved to Ward  at Waterside Hospital. Staff from the care home transferred to look after this group of residents. googletag.cmd.push Western Trust Chief Executive Dr Anne Kilgallen told Thursday’s Western Trust Board Meeting that throughout November ‘our own team in Waterside has played a fundamental role in overseeing standards of care in Ward ’. They mitigated ‘some early risks around the potential transmission of Covid’ to other parts of the hospital. Dr Kilgallen commended Ann Marie McIlmoyle who stepped in as a Ward Sister to manage Ward , and was supported by Infection Prevention and Control , estates and support services team. All  residents moved to a local care centre on December , she concluded. In March, health watchdog RQIA was made aware of a leak within Greenhaw’s plumbing system, affecting the hot water temperature and pressure to a number of bedrooms and sanitary accommodation in the home. googletag.cmd.push It was then discovered that the dangerous bacteria legionella was in the home, however, none of the residents had Legionnaires’ disease. The direction to temporarily move residents from the home came as a result of the ‘very major refurbishments’ required, according to an RQIA spokesperson. That includes the provision of sufficient handwashing facilities and reinstating water supplies to bedrooms which would make it very dficult to provide the necessary standard of care.      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Education Minister Peter Weir tweeted a picture of the paintings after he visited the school last week, and the portraits quickly went viral, appearing on BBCs The View programme. Titillated Executive ministers praised the childrens artwork on social media, with Justice Minister Naomi Long adopting the painting as her Twitter profile picture. The Alliance MLA felt the work captured her essence perfectly. “I love my wonky eyebrow! It looks like Im a bit cross about something which I usually am! Fantastic work and say thanks to all the young artists!” she said. googletag.cmd.push Finance Minister, Sinn Feacuteins Conor Murphy, took time to write to the pupils and express his gratitute, saying the painting was an improvement on the real thing. Mr Murphy also told the children that one of their local heroes had held pride of place in Stormont for years. “The late Martin McGuinness, who was Deputy First Minister, had in his office a large photograph behind his desk in Stormont Castle of someone who attended your school,” he wrote. “It was of the  All-Ireland winning captain, Henry Downey. In an office which had photographs of world leaders including Nelson Mandela, the photo of Henry Downey of Lavey had pride of place.” googletag.cmd.push After the paintings were beamed around the airwaves, requests began to make their way to South Derry and the children have been busy. The Blame Games Tim McGarry, Jake OKane and Colin Murphy got the full treatment from the Mayogall Monets, along with local councillor Sean McPeake, who helped arrange the visit. Principal Mary OKane said the paintings, and associated publicity, had created a great feeling of positivity around the school. “Its created a great buzz, which is very important at this time,” she said. “Following lockdown and the long period of absence from school, its important that children get a wee boost now.     “Its important for the whole school, but particularly those children who are getting a real buzz out of it at the moment. They see themselves as being pretty famous artists.”  Another famous local artist, Kilreas Conor Larkin, agreed to give the childrens paintings a professional artists scrutiny for us this week – and he was very impressed!  Aoe and Charley Arlene Foster: The artist has captured Arlenes ‘lockdown cofure’ – a large, thick plumage of black hair. Arlene is looking away from the viewer, maybe deep in thought or dreaming of an easier time. They have captured a fantastically sombre and meditative state that many artists strive for!  Lisa and Maria Michelle O’Neill: The subject has been caught in a moment of contemplation or reflection. She appears to be gazing just below the viewer’s eye-line. Thinking hard and remaining very tight-lipped, giving no clue to her inner-thoughts. Her hands are clasped, asplaying her cards close to her chest.  Isabelle, Christopher and Charlie Naomi Long: The artist has gone for a bold palette of contrasting colours. The subject is looking a little bewildered or deflated. She appears to have one hand behind her back, asnot wanting to show the viewer her crossed fingers. Or have we purposely been left wonderingNaomi’s hands are tied   Ella, Shannon and Dara Nichola Mallon: The subject appears very happy or comfortable in her own skin. She stands up straight with her hands by her side, portraying a certain pride. This could be the Mona Lisa of political portraits, with her confident gaze following the viewer around the room.  Serena and Chloe Caraacutel Niacute Chuiliacuten: Simple and effective brush strokes have been used to capture the subject’s vibrant hair and expressionless face. The subject stares directly from the canvas, almost straight through the viewer. The artist has done well to capture this moment of determination.  Anna, Riacutean and Molly Conor Murphy: The artist has captured this subject well, leaving the viewer wondering ‘what has he just been asked ’. His bottom lip juts out in a moment of deep concentration, staring past the viewer in search of an answer, as the viewer begs to know what exactly the question is.   Emily Rose and Isla Diane Dodds: A subtle palette of greys has been used to portray the subject’s face, perhaps an indication as to how she is feeling. The subject appears to be smiling, but also looks panicked as she scans her surroundings.  Charley, Don and Seamus Oacuteg Peter Weir: This subject is portrayed as being happy and almost laughing, leaving the viewer asking ‘what is so funny ’. But, looking behind the glasses and gazing further into his eyes, the viewer soon realises there is no joke here.  Amber and Riacuteonach Robin Swann: The artist has really taken the time to depict someone under extreme pressure. His fists are clenched tight, his mouth opened wide asshouting for someone to listen. But, his eyes look sad and his cheeks tear-stained. His gaze is directed straight at you, asto say ‘I have more bad news.  Johnny, Callum, Cathal and Conan Edwin Poots: This painting shows someone who appears to be very happy with themselves, but look deeper into the subjects eyes and you can see that one eye is looking hard at the viewer for approval and the other is looking back at himself in some doubt.  Sean, Conor and Donnacha Sean McPeake :The Artist has captured the subject wide eyed, maybe in disbelief. The pale hue used for his lips, blend into his skin tone – perhaps the artist is sending the subliminal message that the subject is lost for words. The silvery grey hair gives the subject a ‘worldly wise’ appeal.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Lynn, , made his championship debut in Derrys  defeat to Monaghan, after previously making his debut with a man of the match performance against Armagh in the McKenna Cup the previous season. He was the longest serving player in the Derry squad, ahead of current skipper Chrissy McKaigue and this news casts a shadow over the Greenlough mans inter-county future. Barring his cruciate injury last year, he missed just two games in all competitions for Derry in the last three seasons, the  qualier win in Waterford under Damian Barton and a league win over Wicklow under Damian McErlain two years later. googletag.cmd.push Recent speculation suggested Lynn had been dropped from the senior . Yesterday, without making any further comment, manager Rory Gallagher confirmed to the County Derry Post that the Greenlough man was no longer on the . Also, when contacted, Enda Lynn, chose not to make any comment on the matter. He is concentrating on fully getting over his knee injury that caused some concern during his clubs run to the intermediate title last season. U players Ronan McFauland former minor Iarlaith Donaghyhave attracted Gallaghers attention. They are currently following a programme under senior Strength and Conditioning coach Peter Hughes. Donaghy is also recovering from a shoulder injury sustained in club action. googletag.cmd.push “We havent a senior  finalised, but they are players definitely on our radar...they are the two we have on top of what we have at the minute,” Gallagher admitted. The Derry boss is hopeful defender Karl McKaigue will make anext season and that surgery on his Achilles injury went well. “We are hoping he will be back around March April but it is still very early days,” Gallagher said. “We know the type of character Karl is and he is a physio, so has an understanding of his body. Wed be hopeful, but well have to take it easy with him.”      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Breandaacuten McNally, from Greenlough, died last week and many tributes have been paid to him since. Fr Seamus OConnell told mourners at St Oliver Plunketts Church that the -year-old was a proud Greenlough man. “Brendy was quiet, good mannered, good looking and liked fun,” he said. “Brendy was born in Greenlough, baptised in Greenlough, went to school in Greenlough and played football with Greenlough boys. “Were celebrating the funeral mass of a Greenlough man, where he was well-respected and had fun.” Local GAA club, St Oliver Plunketts GAC, led the tributes paid to a sorely missed club man. googletag.cmd.push “Brendy as we all knew him liked nothing more than lining out for the wee reds on a Sunday afternoon and was a regular on the scoresheet for our reserve team too,” they said. “His passion and infectious smile will be sorely missed but never forgotten by all involved with Greenlough GAC. “We would like to pass on our sincere condolences to the McNally and Downey family circles at this sad time.” The widespread nature of the tributes paid to Breandaacuten highlighted how many les he had touched throughout the world. Breandaacuten celebrating success with Wolfe Tones GAC, Melbourne. He spent time in both Australia and America, and local GAA clubs with whom he was involved posted messages of support for the family on social media. googletag.cmd.push St Pats Donegal GFC in Philadelphia said there was deep sadness within the community following news of his death. “It is with deep sadness that we learn of the passing of Breandaacuten McNally. Brendy had a great summer in Philadelphia in  and enjoyed some great times with the club,” they said. “We extend our deepest sympathy and condolences to Brendan, Patricia, Ruairiacute, Aoe and extended family and friends at this sad time.” Wolfe Tones GAC in Melbourne, where Breandaacuten starred for their football team in , also extended their condolences. “Everyone at Wolfe Tones has been saddened to learn of the passing of one of our former players, Breandaacuten McNally,” they said.     “Breandan played for the Wolfetones men’s team last year and was a huge part of the team and all their success throughout . “On behalf of everyone at Wolfe Tones GAC we would like to extend our deepest condolences to all of Breandans family and friends.” The McNally family business, B McNally  Sons Car Sales, are former sponsors of Watty Graham GAC, Glen, who also sympathised with the family. “Watty Grahams are saddened to learn of the untimely passing of Breandaacuten McNally, son of our former senior football team sponsor, Brendan,” they said. “Condolences to Brendan, Patricia, Ruairiacute, Aoe and the entire McNally family at this very sad time.” Everywhere he went, the young Greenlough man has touched lives, Fr OConnell told mourners at his funeral mass on Friday. After Breandaacuten travelled to America to receive treatment for his condition, he made such an impression on the hospital staff that they kept in touch. “The trip brought a host of new friends, real, caring people and was unbelievable the care that the family received and especially their son,” said Fr OConnell. “It was delightful, so delightful that the nurses and one of the surgeons kept in touch, so impressed were they by Brendy and his family, and his mother in particular.” Mourners heard how family was so important in Breandaacutens le. Fr OConnell also paid tribute to Breandaacutens familys devotion to him at his funeral mass last Friday, and described them as extraordinary. “All of them were in America at one time or another, supporting one another. Thats how the family became known. “As far as Im concerned, his family were pretty normal people. They did ordinary things and did them well, but truthfully, they had become extraordinary.” The night before his funeral, Breandaacutens sister Aoe appealed to friends and family to write down their memories of him along with any photos to be posted in a special memory box at the chapel. Fr OConnell ended his homily with a story that summed up the relationship between the McNally siblings. “Wed a concert one time in Greenlough. There were all kinds of people involved and Patsy was there with this wean on her knee,” he said. “Low and behold, when her brother appeared on stage, off she went like a scalded cat, leaving granny wondering where she was going. “Where did she go  She didnt settle until she got onto the stage and claimed her brother. Aoe was that wean. “She now claims him even more than ever. Family is important. Family is signicant,” he added.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The deferral by Causeway Coast and Glens Councils planning committee is to allow an alternative application to progress to the same stage so a decision can be made. The controversial proposal would see a single storey McDonalds restaurant with car parking and drive through facilities erected at a section of the existing Asda site alongside the towns Ring Road. Representatives of the Lodge Hotel, which backs onto the proposed site, have stated their objection to the application. After the initial application was deferred at Octobers Planning Committee meeting, a second application was lodged showing the location of the restaurant on the East side of the car park. googletag.cmd.push At a meeting of the Planning Committee, Causeway Coast and Glens councillors heard objections from a representative of the Lodge Hotel which is situated close to the proposed site. The spokesperson said noise and disturbance from the development would have an adverse impact on residents at the hotel and the knock-on effect could cause the hotel to go out of business. Representatives of the Lodge Hotel have raised objections to the proposal. The points were echoed by some councillors, with Alderman William Duddy citing anti-social behaviour arising from the existing McDonalds site in Coleraine. “Some residents have told me they can hear the revving and the music, and some of those are three quarters of a mile away,” said Alderman Duddy. googletag.cmd.push “We cannot leave the hotel out of this. Its  years in operation and is the only tourist asset we have in this town in regards to accommodation. “We have an obligation to secure and maintain that as a planning committee. The noise, the smell, the fumes, the litter and the strong likelihood of anti-social behaviour taking place in that car park. “The police have yet to be able to resolve the issues at Riverside, which has been ongoing for years. It is imperative to take into account the impact on those using the hotel.” The committee have voted to defer the current application until the alternative planning application reaches a stage where both can be reviewed at the same time.      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

One local councillor described the news as a Christmas present for Derry City and Strabane District Council. Details of the financial support secured were outlined during a meeting of the councils Governance and Strategic Planning committee on Tuesday. At the meeting, Alfie Dallas, the councils Lead Finance Officer, presented a report on the situation faced by the council in the first half of this financial year from April  to September . Mr Dallas said the councils planned budget for   was poundm, with % of that money coming from rates collected. googletag.cmd.push However, Mr Dallas said the councils finances had been very signicantly impacted by the Covid crisis. He said that the council had lost approximately pound.m during the first half of the financial year. These losses included: - pound.m as a result of the closure of council facilities, including leisure centres- pound, due to the closure of council-run car parks- pound, as a result of the loss of building control income- pound, loss of income from cemeteries due to non-charging during the pandemic Mr Dallas said the council had also faced huge unplanned costs as a result of having to respond to the pandemic. googletag.cmd.push These included health and safety costs, costs associated with new working arrangements, communications and IT costs to enable home-working. However, Mr Dallas said that thankfully the councils losses had been completely mitigated by the financial support received from a number of government departments. He said the council had recouped pound.m of its losses from the Job Retention Scheme Furlough. He said the Department of Finance had provided support of pound.m as part of a package for all  councils in Northern Ireland, while the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs had allocated pound, to the council for waste management losses. Mr Dallas said the government had also provided pound.m to cover the losses at City of Derry Airport which means that this financial burden will not fall on the council.     Government support has therefore been critical in ensuring Council finances have remained stable and has enabled signicant decisions around services to be avoided, said Mr Dallas. However, he added that there remained signicant risk and uncertainty over the councils finances because of its reliance on rates income for its annual budget. Speaking at Tuesdays meeting, Sinn Fein councillor Mickey Cooper said that back in March April of this year, the situation had been scary in relation to the financial situation facing the council. Given the government support, he welcomed that the council could continue to look at major infrastructure projects that had been planned pre-Covid. DUP Alderman Hilary McClintock said given the doom and gloom earlier in the year, the news that the councils losses had been completely mitigated was like a Christmas present. This is an absolutely fantastic outcome, she said. SDLP councillor Martin Reilly paid tribute to the council officers for their efforts in recent months. It is such a good position to be in in comparison to where we thought we would be six months ago, said Cllr Reilly.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

St Mary’s Limavady and Limavady High School have been selected as part of a UK-wide programme which was announced in October. Testing will initially be offered to all staff and students in Years ,  and  across both schools. Rapid lateral flow tests will be used for the scheme, similar to those used in the recent Liverpool pilot scheme. The tests were recently criticised in a study published in The British Medical Journal, which raised concerns that the tests missed over % of cases. googletag.cmd.push The study warned the tests may give a  sense of reassurance. However, Dr Susan Hopkins, chief medical adviser to NHS Track and Trace, said the lateral flow tests could identy many cases of infection in people without symptoms. She told BBC Radio s Today programme that the tests were helping to diagnose tests that would otherwise go undetected. What we are doing here is case detection. We are not saying people do not have the diseasetheir test is negative, she said. We are trying to say [to people who test positive] You do have the disease and now we want you to go and isolate for  days. That is a whole dferent game-changer. googletag.cmd.push We are also very clear that until we get a much lower prevalence of disease in this country that we shouldnt be changing our behaviours, she added. Health Minister Robin Swann thanked the two schools for their particpation in the scheme. Work is progressing with a iety of local partners and experts on New Testing Interventionsfor a range of settings including this schools’ initiative, he said. “The learning arising from the NTIswill help us to better understand how new technologies can be implemented and extended more widely across settings. It is important to be aware that these NTIs are still at an early stage of development, and consequently these new tests must be rolled out with careful planning and evaluation.     “I would also like to take this opportunity to thank Limavady High School and StMary’s for their participation, and I would particularly like to thank the team in the Public Health Agency who have developed and are leading this NTI and colleagues in the Education Authority who continue to be instrumental in driving this important work forward.” Education Minister Peter Weir said the tests would cause minimum disruption to lessons. I welcome this initiative where pupils and staff, without symptoms, will be tested on a voluntary basis andI want to thank both schools for taking part, he said. The test will be supervised by trained staff and I expect there to be minimal disruption to lessons. Keeping our schools safe during the pandemic remains my top priority and I will continue to support schools in the months ahead.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The explanation, of course, was a simple one. Santa Claus was visiting the boys and girls in the countys schools to raise spirits ahead of what will be a very dferent Christmas. Mr Claus was operating in partnership with local company Specialist Joinery Group, who organised the fly-by, as well as ensuring all the pupils received a Christmas treat. The operation was day one of the companys ten days of festive fundraising where money will be donated to more than  charities over the next nine days. googletag.cmd.push A spokesperson said they were hoping to spread some Christmas cheer. “We completed a Santa Fly-By over a number of the schools to help increase Christmas Cheer as part of our  Days of Christmas Giving,” they said. “Every bubble in each of the schools received a sack of selection boxes for each child. There was a sense of fun and enjoyment at the schools we visited and it was fantastic to see the Christmas spirit.” While on their journey, the crew also found time to collect food donations for local food banks The Link in Maghera and Hope Magherafelt. googletag.cmd.push  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Hugh, arguably the clubs biggest supporter over the years, followed Derry City home and away for decades, and worked in a number of dferent volunteer roles with the club in his time. A member of Brandywell Pride, Hugh ferried City fans to games around Ireland and was well known and liked throughout Ireland. Norman Shongo, a fellow Brandywell Pride member, said he would be badly missed. Everyone knew Hugh and everyone loved Hugh, said Norman. He took us all over Ireland in his mini-bus and even the away fans knew him. He was always so kind and would always help anyone. googletag.cmd.push He was Derry City through and through and it will be so strange not seeing him at the matches now. He loved watching Derry, even this year, with the fans not allowed in, he took a ladder and stood looking over the walls. There are so many memories from over the years, including dressing up as Santa in Paris and banging the drum at the Brandywell. He will be badly missed.         googletag.cmd.push  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

You enjoy playing and you take any opportunity you can get.ldquoI was nervous going into it but I probably had one of the best games I ever played. I was going out an expressing myself and I was named player of the match.However, her world came crashing down when she suffered an injury while playing for the NI U- team when what looked like a normal stress fracture in her foot was to keep her out of action for four years.ldquoIt should have healed naturally within eight to  weeks and I kept getting told it would heal with rest, she recalled.ldquoIt came to a year but it hadnrsquot healed fully, so I got a second opinion and the consultant said I should have had surgery straight away on it.ldquoI had the operation and went through the full rehab period, but I was still having quite a lot of issues, so I had a second surgery and it was back to square one.Caragh recalls ldquocrying day after day at the prospect of never playing football again and said every time she took a step forward ldquoit felt like five steps back again.She went on: I had thought about going to England or America when I left school, but being injured at that age there was no point trying to chase that.ldquoHaving a lot of success at a young age, I just didnrsquot know le without football.Caragh made herto action almost four years on from her injury and after a year with Glentoran she spent a season in Iceland with Fylkir.She says Reykjavik was an ldquoamazing place to play and live and after being introduced to CrossFit in her rehab, it was in Iceland her interest in the sport grew.ldquoI was totally hooked on it and progressed quite quickly in it. I started to do a few local competitions and for a while I was balancing the two.ldquoBecause I enjoyed CrossFit so much, my love for football waned slightly. I got to the point where I didnrsquot have the same desire as before.She ed to Glentoran after her year in Iceland, lting the Irish Cup with the east Belfast side and representing Northern Ireland before halting her time in the sport to focus on CrossFit.In her break from football, Caragh said her priorities changed away from the pitch when she married her husband, Michael, in .At the turn of  she was set to compete at high-level CrossFit competitions in Asia, Egypt and the Netherlands before the Covid- pandemic intervened.ldquoI hadnrsquot planned to come back to football. Gail Redmond at Glentoran heard the competitions were scrapped and saw it as an opportunity to get me back playing, she explained.ldquoInitially I was a bit hesitant but she said about the Glens challenging for the title. I think that pulled on my heart stings a bit.Caragh netted four goals in six Womenrsquos Premiership matches to set Glentoran on course for the title before an ldquounexpected call from NI manager Kenny Shiels saw her reintroduced to the international fold.ldquoKenny was watching out first game against Cltonville. After being away from football I donrsquot think he knew who I was but I got  minutes at the end and must have impressed him.Shiels invited Caragah to train with the senior squad and was named as a stand-by for Northern Irelandrsquos trip to the Faroe Islands in Septemberrsquos Euro  qualier.She was drafted into the squad when midfielder Marissa Callaghan pulled out and made her internationalas a second-half substitute in a - win.Despite her sensationalto the NI set-up, Hamiltonrsquos season was ended prematurely by a knee injury sustained days before the victory away to Belarus.She adds that while she is disappointed to be on the sidelines, she is thankful to both Glentoran and Shiels for their support to keep her involved in club and country as much as possible.She admits she is undecided whether she will focus on CrossFit orto the football pitch after her recovery.ldquoThatrsquos the million dollar question, she said. At the minute I am focusing on getting as fit as possible to make sure Irsquom able to do the best that I can in whatever I do.ldquoI want to be healthy and injury-free so I will make that decision closer to the time depending on how things are going.Going into last nightrsquos crunch tie, Northern Ireland were hoping to secure a play-off place in the European Championships for the first time.Despite her absence for the remainder of the campaign, Caragh says she has no doubts Northern Ireland can secure second position in Group C and make history.She credits manager Shiels with instilling a strong belief in his side. ldquoHe has brought out something that was always there but a lot of it is belief and confidence, she said.ldquoPreviously we would have played within ourselves to avoid defeat, but now there is an attitude that we can go and win this game.ldquoThere is a hunger and desire to push on. To think we are in with a possible play-off space in such a short space of time is incredible..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2nd December 2020 Christmas.jpg","title":"Christmas cup finals  ","story":"NEWCASTLE League officials have put in place what they say is ldquoone final attempt to play last seasonrsquos Harry Clarke Cup and Bobby Dalzell Cup finals.The Harry Clarke Cup final between Celtic Bhoys and Ballynagross has been rescheduled for Ballyhornan on Tuesday, December , with a pm kick off.The Bobby Dalzell decider between Killough and Ballynahinch Olympic Town is to be played at the same venue the following day with a .pm kick off.Itrsquos the latest attempt by the Newcastle League to play the fixtures, which have been postponed on a number of occasions owing to the Covid- pandemic.The Bobby Dalzell final is traditionally played on Boxing Day, while the Harry Clarke final is usually held over the Easter period.League secretary Alan Craig said he hopes the finals can at last get go ahead.However, he warned that there will be no further reschedulingthe matches are unable to be played.He said: ldquoDiscussions have taken place with the clubs concerned and agreement has been reached that should we find ourselves in a further lockdown, or unable to play the finals on these dates due to further restrictions, then we are at a stage that the finals will not be rescheduled.ldquoWe as a league have tried our utmost to give the players an opportunity to be involved in a cup final, but there comes a time when we need to make a decision on the values of the cup.

The concerts are due to be broadcast on Sunday, December , and Tuesday, December .News of the concerts comes after festive lights were switched on in Downpatrick last weekend, with others due to be illuminated over the coming weeks at local towns and villages including Ballynahinch, Newcastle, Killyleagh, Saintfield, Crossgar, and Castlewellan.Both Downpatrick and Newcastle will have articial trees, with a cut tree erected in Ballynahinch with the local authority illuminating festive lights at up to  sustainable Christmas trees across the district as well as  so-called street trees.Council chairwoman Laura Devlin said that Christmas  will be like no other.She said the local authority wants to acknowledge the impact that Covid- has had on so many peoplersquos lives and sharing a message of light and hope for better times ahead.ldquoWhile we couldnrsquot hold our traditional Christmas events and light switch-ons, we still wanted to come together as a district and I hope many will join us from their own homes to watch the upcoming light and hope concerts, she continued.ldquoI am delighted we have secured artists of such calibre and proud of the homegrown talent from Newry, Mourne and Down on display.Cllr Devlin said that as the Christmas lights are switched on across the district, she wants to acknowledge the particular dficulties faced by the retail sector this festive season.She added: ldquoFollowing the latest restrictions announced by the Northern Ireland Executive, our lsquomake it local Christmas campaign will now be launched at the safe and appropriate time.ldquoThe message from council is always to shop local and shop safely and this will be emphasised during the campaign..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2nd December 2020 Down(1).jpg","title":"Down have title in sight  ","story":"ldquoWErsquoVE been knocking on the door for years now, and it is really exciting that we may finally do it.Those are the words of Down captain Karen McMullan ahead of Saturdayrsquos clash with Antrim in the All-Ireland Intermediate Camogie Championship final at Breffni Park, Cavan.Down were beaten finalists two years ago, before making the semi-finals last year. Once more they have gone right to the business end of the competition, but this time they are determined to carry off the silverware.ldquoFrom a neutralrsquos point of view, it should be a really exciting match, the Castlewellan woman said. ldquoIt is also great for Ulster camogie that two northern teams are in the final.ldquoWersquove been so close over the last few years and it would be great to be able to get over that final hurdle now.With Down teams performing strongly at schools level in camogie for a while, it was always felt that would ultimately translate to success higher up the age groups. And so it has proven to be. McMullan says a number of factors have come together to allow Down to prosper, including manager Derek Dunnersquos influence.ldquoDerek has been brilliant for us, she said. He is passionate and committed to the team. In his preparation, he leaves no stone unturned. He has definitely gone above and beyond the call of duty for us.ldquoHe has brought the best people into the off-field team around us, and he has invested in us. When someone does that, it makes you want to repay their faith by bringing success. It is a time-consuming role for him too, he does a lot as well away from the matches and the training ground, so the fact we have made it to the final is brilliant for him too.In what has been a year when sportsmen and sportswomen have been left unsure about what would happened because of the coronavirus, Karen and her team-mates are revelling in being able to anticipate the excitement around an All-Ireland final.ldquoWersquore delighted to be there, first and foremost. We are buzzing with excitement. And the other thing is too, especially with the dficulties that so many people are going through, we are able to feed off the excitement of others.ldquoSo many people have been affected badly by Covid-, but you can see the dference sport can make.It can help communities come together and that is certainly something we can feel heading into this game.Down booked their spot in the final with a - to - semi-final success against Meath in Clones. It was a match where the Mourne girls looked fairly comfortable and had a gear or two to spare.McMullan concurs, saying they could have racked up an even more convincing winning margin.ldquoWe should have scored more, and could have done. But Meath held out well, and then it became more of a case of seeing the game out and protecting the advantage. We knew Meath are a very dficult team to overcome.ldquoBefore the match, we spoke about how close we had come before going all the way. We absolutely did not want to experience those feelings again. A lot of players, to be honest, were not over last yearrsquos loss to Westmeath. It hurt a lot.ldquoSometimes it can take you to lose a game of that importance to toughen you up, make you ready to go that bit more the next time. There is no doubt the girls have the hunger and are driven to win this now. As for the challenge posed by Antrim, the Down camp are certainly not under-estimating the task at hand, as Karen admits.ldquoItrsquoll be a tough one against Antrim. They are a very young, very fit, quick team. They have some of their top players from the likes of Loughgiel and Ballycastle. Itrsquos a local derby which obviously adds a bit more spice to things. Honestly, on the day, it is anyonersquos game.Anyonersquos game indeed, but Down will know they have weapons in their team that they will look to on the day to make the dference between the pain of coming runners-up again, and the glory of being crowned All-Ireland champions.Paula OrsquoHagan is someone the team will certainly be looking towards to presenting a threat in front of the Antrim goal. She was a constant thorn in the side of Meath in the last four, accounting for seven points.Sarah-Louise Graffin is also a threat going forward. She ably dovetailed with OrsquoHagan in the last four, weighing in with three points. When those two click going forward, they can be a handful for even the most miserly of back-lines.Fionnuala Carr is the glue that held that line together so well in the success over Meath, and no doubt she will be the bedrock that Down will try to build their success on again.As well as that, Dougan has the team well-drilled in defence. And ahead of them, they have a midfield prowess that can take a grip on a game against the best. Niamh Mallon is a constant danger to the opposition, full of busy running and creativity. Alongside her, Saoirse McCartan is another wily operator.Undoubtedly, Down possess the tools in their armoury to carry off the title this time around. In terms of talent, and the experience of being there before and knowing what to expect on the big occasion, they know the drill.Now Dougan, and the players will be hoping they can shake off the lsquonearlyrsquo tag and be crowned camogie queens of Ireland.The throw-in for Saturdayrsquos final is .pm.

In these strange and dficult times, even the strongest and most resilient among us are not exempt from occasionally feeling weary and despondent.During the early months of lockdown back in the spring, how many of us enjoyed the slowing down of the hamster wheel of le and took time to enjoy nature at its finest and to reflect on what our priorities really are It all seems much harder this time around as people face the harsh reality of a huge economic downturn and the virus pandemic takes on a dferent guise.We need all the help we can get to keep ourselves as positive and hopeful as possible. This is where mindfulness can come in. It is a term that has become popular in recent times and often is wrongly used.It can get a bad press and seem shrouded in mystery mdash something that requires a knowledge of Zen beyond the reach of lsquoJoe Publicrsquo while others claim it to be some kind of panacea that can cure all ills. It is neither of these things.As a practitioner for several years and a Mindfulness in Schools Project trained teacher for five, I can honestly say it is a tool that can help some peoplefocus on the present and not let the mind wander into unnecessary places, whether that be worries or distractions.The analogy of thoughts being like buses is one I like. We donrsquot need to jump on every single one, instead just watch them pass by.An example of a mindful experience could be when a musician is playing a piece and sensing the music, rather than reading the notes.It is flowing completely naturally and no thinking is involved. Sport is another great example. Novak Djokovic and Jonny Wilkinson are two advocates of mindful practice and both claim their focus and steady performance can be attributed to the discipline.Interestingly, two of the most mindful sports are golf and cricket. Being at one with the little white ball as it gets smacked about the greens is said to be as good for mental health as much as physical.Our own Rory McIlroy summed it up well when he said: ldquoIrsquom not about to go and live with the monks in Nepal or anything like that, but Irsquom making sure that I centre myself and put my head in the right place.Cricket is similar.When you are bowling an over, the focus is on the line of the ball, the position of the field and the feel of the wicket under foot. The batsman is equally focussing on the ball and the fielders woe betide they lose their concentration.The halcyon days of local cricket as a mainstream sport appear to be over at the moment and there are multiple reasons offered for the demise mdash schools having less time for summer sports in the final term, the attention span of young players not being what it was and fewer people willing to commit to what could be a full day.Which leads me nicely back to the beginning.Remember those lovely, slower days of lockdown when we realised being busy wasnrsquot necessarily all it was cracked up to be and that many of the things on our mental lsquoto dorsquo list are not that important after all Maybe we really need to take time to smell the autumn leaves, the way we did for the daffodils of spring. Maybe we need to slow it down and find things to hope for.Local cricket clubs donrsquot have the crowds around the team boards any more on a Thursday evening after the selection committee when the team lists were pinned up.There isnrsquot that excitement of ldquodid I make it from the thirds to the seconds   or for me, ldquowhere am I serving the sandwiches It is a dferent era for the game, but those who love it, really love it. If anyone reading this has their whites from a bygone time hidden in an attic somewhere, why not retrieve them and dust them down for next spring If you played a bit at school and just feel like revisiting the sport for a bit of exercise and a bit of craic with new people, then please do it.Evenyoursquove never played, but have walked down the Strangford Road and loved that beautul setting, then it might be worth a go.We all need things to look forward to and we all need hope. Downpatrick Cricket Club needs that hope too.Maurice Irvine, a dear friend and colleague and master of cricket at Down High School, is also a former player for the school and the club.He strongly recommends anyone to take up the bat again or try it out whatever level you are at.When I asked him how he felt at the possible closure of Downpatrick Cricket Club, he said:ldquoIt is with great sadness that I learn of this possibility. I have many memories of playing there under the guidance of Roy Briggs, Ken McCammon and many others, developing my love of the game. ldquoCricket is a great game educating young people especially in respect, fair play, how to win and lose with dignity and team spirit.ldquoDownpatrick Cricket Club, along with Saintfield and Dundrum, is also a great place for Down High cricketers to gain valuable experience and the opportunity to learn from more experienced cricketers.ldquoDownpatrick have also been very generous to Down High, allowing us access to nets when they were not available at school and I would add my encouragement to anyone in the area to become involved to help the club at this dficult time.For me, the Linehan family are synonymous with cricket in Downpatrick.Alfie and Hugh will remain heroes of mine always, while current club chairman Paul Linehan hopes thatanyone can assist to keep the club going they will contact him on   or email paul.k.linehan@gmail..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2nd December 2020 Drumaness.jpg","title":"Drumaness green space plans  ","story":"A NEW amenity area is to be created in Drumaness by Newry, Mourne and Down Council.An area known locally as the lsquoBack Fieldrsquo where a play park was located a number of years ago is to be redeveloped.The news has been welcomed by Slieve Croob councillor, Cathy Mason, who is pleased that a raised area made of bricks and concrete is to be flattened and reseeded with GAA and football posts and nets to be provided.The local politician, who has been lobbying for the work to be carried out, said it is now possible as the village has two play parks, explaining that the remnants of bricks and concrete at the back field can now be removed, with this particular work long over due. ldquoThe area will be flattened and seeded so it can be safely used, with a set of GAA and soccer nets provided, said Cllr Mason.ldquoWe all know how vital it is to get outside into the fresh air, especially our children during these unprecedented times.

The scheme is finally moving in the right direction and now is the time to commit the money to ensure its delivery.Cllr Terry Andrews also welcomed progress in the bypass which he said can make a signicant dference for not only Ballynahinch, but the wider East and South Down areas.Rowallane councillor, Robert Burgess, said people in Ballynahinch look forward to the delivery of the scheme, urging consideration be given to farmers whose land has ben set aside for  years to accommodate the planned bypass.ldquoThese farmers have been unable to do anything with these areas of land which will probably be vested. The situation they fund themselves in is not fair, he added.The Department for Infrastructurersquos network manager, James Kelly, said while a previous roads manager was minded to proceed with the Ballynahinch scheme, it did not reach the point of going ahead.He said there was now an opportunity for roads officials to refresh the schemersquos environmental assessments before presenting them to the minister again.Mr Kelly said with the scheme expected to cost between poundm and poundm,Mrs Mallon wishes for it to proceed, the bypass will have to enter a process where it will be competing for finance with other schemes.He added: ldquoWe cannot guarantee that the money will be available next year..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2nd December 2020 New.jpg","title":"New bus at Knockevin Special School following £28k donation  ","story":"KNOCKEVIN Special School in Downpatrick has taken charge of a new bus thanks to the generosity of the Lordrsquos Taverners and the schoolrsquos parent staff association.The PSA donated pound, towards the cost of the new wheelchair accessible bus which was provided by the Lordrsquos Taverners, which provides support for people with disabilities.The bus was recently handed over to the school by PSA members, who will also fund its running costs.The PSA was formed in  when parents and staff came together to fund music therapy for the pupils which was no longer being funded by the relevant authorities.The associationrsquos goal is to support all of the pupils at Knockevin Special School in Downpatrick and Knockevin Early Years Centre in Dundrum.PSA chairperson Kelley OrsquoReilly said: ldquoSince we formed we have raised considerable amounts of money through ious events and projects, such as the Sparkle Project in , with our previous chairperson Paula Dillon at the helm, which saw the local community come together to raise money for the refurbishment of two sensory rooms and the hydrotherapy pool.ldquoWe smashed our target of pound, to raise a staggering amount of over pound, and we were able to provide the school with a bicycle track and new bikes.ldquoWe funded a Memory Tree, which the school had wanted for some considerable time, designed and constructed by local artist Kevin Killen, to remember pupils who passed away while attending Knockevin.Kelley added: ldquoWe also have recently agreed to fund the refurbishment of the soft play area in the Profound and Multiple Learning Disabilities unit within the Downpatrick school site. Our next aim is to provide funding for outdoor gym play equipment which is essential at this time.Due to the Covid pandemic the PSA was forced to cancel or postpone many fundraising events such as the annual  and k runs and family fun walk.The bag pack at the Asda supermarket Downpatrick also had to be cancelled, although the PSA received a generous donation from Asda for its Christmas raffle.The tenth anniversary ball, which was to have been held in the Burrendale Hotel, has been put back until October .A drive-in movie screening of the Christmas film Elf at Letrsquos Go Hydro in Carryduff this Sunday has also been cancelled, but there are hopes that it can be rescheduled for a later date.Said Kelley: ldquoWe are always so grateful of all the support we receive not only from our parents, carers and school staff, who all volunteer their time to organise and carry out events, but also the local community.ldquoWithout everyonersquos help we would not be able to continue to support our amazing children and young adults, which is our purpose.She added: ldquoBoth school sites are held in such high regard by the local community and by parents and carers.ldquoWe look forward to a time when we can resume fundraising as a community again.

Five others were also wounded in the sectarian attack.Northern Irelandrsquos Lord Chief Justice, Sir Declan Morgan, welcomed the fact a settlement had been reached between the parties.ldquoWe congratulate the parties on finding an answer to this interesting and dficult, but also important case, he told lawyers in Belfast High Court.Last year, Sir Declan and other senior judges ruled search warrants used by police to search the journalistsrsquo home and their offices at Fine Point Films had been ldquoinappropriate, resulting in the criminal probe into Mr Birney and Mr McCaffrey being discontinued.The original police operation had been undertaken by Durham Constabulary at the request of the PSNI amid conflict of interest concerns.In the summer Chief Constable Simon Byrne issued an unreserved apology to the two men.Reacting to the settlement, Mr Birney said it marked an end to the legal process he began in a police cell at the end of August  after being arrested and his home and offices raided by dozens of PSNI and Durham police.ldquoWe launched a Judicial Review in the face of the PSNIrsquos most egregious attack on journalism to protect our journalism, our sources, and press freedom itself, he said.ldquoOver the past two years, thePSNI fought our attempts to protect our journalism and sources every step of the way.ldquoThey sought to defend their indefensible attack on press freedom right up until the judgment delivered by the Lord Chief Justice in July this year.Mr Birney said he and Mr McCaffrey have welcomed the Chief Constablersquos apology, but said no such apology has been received by Mr Byrnersquos predecessor, Sir George Hamilton, under whose leadership the PSNI arrested the two journalists.Mr Birney added: ldquoJournalists in this jurisdiction now need to see Simon Byrne take all steps necessary to ensure accountability for the PSNIrsquos despicable attack on press freedom and to assure the press that lessons have been learned..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/12099304.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This again sends out the message that Mid Ulster District Council is a cold house for the Unionist minority.“It shows that their views are not taken into consideration. It is totally unacceptablethat there has been no response to my question at last month’s meeting.”Chair of the Council, Councillor Cathal Mallaghan said directors are available online to answer questions.At this point, Council’s acting Chief Executive, Adrian McCreesh said: “The Decade of Anniversaries was taken to the development committee on October .“It was a report that was very detailed and it was a hard earned process of a lot of consultation between our officers and a lot of members from two parties in particular.“That was subsequently ratied on October  by full council.”Mr McCreesh continued: “The Decade of Anniversaries was designed and put together with a view of meeting the requirements of the funders – the Community Relations Council and the National Lottery Heritage Fund, under the principles of remembering and support.“That is what the NI celebrations will be about and that is what the funding is going to shape.”Mr McCreesh also said a community support grant will be available to all interested parties across Mid Ulster.“I stand over the fact that no paper that I, or my officers, present to Mid Ulster Council can identy one group only.“Cllr Cutherbston asked for inidual discussion with my team, he is entitled to do that and I was delighted to facilitate that.“However, now is not the time to identy the actions of one group. There is a programme within that which will go out to the public and I would imagine multiple groups will want to apply from all over the district.“I would hope and expect the group Cllr Cuthbertson refers to will also be an applicant, that is how we do our business.“My role in all of this is to ensure we are consistent in our approach, trouble arises when criteria is applied inconsistently.”Sinn Fein councillor Sean McPeake said “it was a bit rich” of Cllr Cuthbertson to make this accusation.“Essentially what has been put here isCouncil does not jump to the beck and call of a certain community group it is in the wrong,” said Cllr McPeake.“I think that would be a very dangerous precedent to start going down.“We are at a very early stage in this and are going down the route of best practice, taking an educational view and taking all perspectives into account.“That is the way it should be and the way it was previously.“I just think it is a bit rich but I am not surprised coming from the same councillor.“It is absolutely hypocriticalfor a member to be castigating this council because somehow, the Council is not acting to the whim of a certain community group.”In response, Cllr Cuthbertson said he would “not take any lectures about being hypocriticalfrom a Sinn Fein member” and reiterated his stance that it is not for an officer to decide what community feedback is included in a report.“Are we saying now that ratepayers in Mid Ulster have no say in any policy coming forward. Does community feedbackmean nothing,” asked Cllr Cuthbertson.“Is it now the case any consultation this Council does is simply a paper ticking exercise as community feedback means nothing ”The Council’s Chair described this suggestion as “rubbish” and “not the experience of any other member in this council.”Maghera author signs up top scriptwriter - read hereEditor’s messageThank you for reading this article.

When a bubble is formed it is fixed, and must not be changed or extended further at any point.bull Each Christmas bubble can meet at home, at a place of worship or an outdoor public place, but existing, more restrictive rules on hospitality and meeting in other venues will be maintained throughout this period.It is important that everyone respects and abides by the rules of each nation wherever they choose to spend the festive period.Where there are any iations in our approach, these will be communicated by each administration accordingly.Further guidance will be provided in due course.The winter holiday period is a time often spent with family and friends, with schools and offices closing and people travelling over the bank holidays.Many have already begun making their plans, and we are today providing clarity to help people make the right choices for them, and enjoy time with those closest to them while staying within the rules to protect us all. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

These centres have already been decided by health boards and are in the process of being prepared.The development process for coronavirus vaccines has been as stringent as any other but the process in the face of the pandemic has been sped up by prompt, world-wide funding and a reduction in paperwork.Theof the trials have not been shortened, and the usual safety measures remain in place.The vaccine will not be mandatory and people will be able to choose whether they take up the vaccine or not.Information will be provided to people before vaccination to reassure them about patient safety and robust consent processes will be in place.Vice-chairman of the Covid- Vaccine Programme Board, Richard Roberts from Public Health Wales, said: ldquoIt is a signicant achievement that only  months after WHOannounced the global pandemic that we now have the first safe and effective vaccine available for use in Wales, and other vaccines to follow.\"Everyone has been preparing for months to deliver the Covid- vaccine programme, and it is very exciting that we will be able to begin, once the final steps have been put in place so that the programme can be delivered safely. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Shops, hairdressers, restaurants, places of worship and hotels are among the places that will be able to re-open from December . Pubs selling drink onlywill remain closed and an additional financial package will be put in place. The Executive has also agreed Christmas household bubbling arrangements from December -. Three households will be able to come together for this period in domestic settings, outdoor public spaces and places of worship. One of the households will be able to include their existing household bubble. First Minister Arlene Foster said: “Through our collective efforts over recent weeks we gained enough space in the transmission of the virus to relax a signicant number of restrictions, including the opening-up of non-essential retail, close contact services, sport and leisure activities and our places of worship at the end of next week. “These decisions will give families, businesses and employees some much-needed certainty and comfort in the run-up to Christmas and beyond. “This is a special time of the year and we want to support people to have a good Christmas, but also a safe one. “Signicant work has been completed with business sectors, faith groups, local government and police on new mitigation measures to reduce the risk of transmission. “I urge everyone to be Covid-aware and to make careful and sensible decisions when out and about or mixing with others. We need to make sure we continue doing all we can to protect ourselves and our loved ones.” Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill said: “The Executive wants to give people as much notice as possible on what the situation will look like from next Friday when the current circuit breaker comes to an end. “We have given detailed consideration to which restrictions need tobe maintained, and what we can open up, in light of the scientic and medical advice. “A package of measures that will see signicant relaxations to the current restrictions has been agreed, with maximum mitigations in place to minimise risks to the greatest extent possible. An additional support package will be put in place for traditional drink-only pubs that unfortunately will not be able to reopen at this time. “We appreciate how important Christmas time is for many families and the Executive has agreed arrangements that will allow families and friends to come together in a limited way between  and  December. “It’s important for people to understand that with any increased contact comes increased risk. Everyone needs to think very carefully about the risks posed to them, and their loved ones, by coming together over the Christmas period, particularly to those who are vulnerable. Some may choose not to form a Christmas bubble but for those who do, we encourage them to keep their bubbles small and limit the numbers of people gathering, as much as possible.”  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_cbcdbfbcacaaaf   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_aededbd   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
