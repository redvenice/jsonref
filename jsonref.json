God dammit! I thought the b***h was white! F**k! she roared in the video, posted to herYouTube page with the caption: \u0027Roseanne, like always, cuts through the bullsh** and gets the heart of the matter.\u0027The clip comes two months after Roseanne\u0027s eponymous reboot was axed when she tweeted that former Obama advisor  Jarrett, who is African American, looked like the \u0027Muslim brotherhood \u0026amp planet of the apes had a baby\u0027.Scroll down for video           Roseanne Barr has posted a bizarre new video where literally screams her defense of why she posted the racist tweet about Valerie Jarrett which got her show cancelledThe 65-year-old immediately backtracked in the wake of furious backlash, claiming it was a \u0027joke\u0027, blaming her Ambien sleeping tablets, and claiming she didn\u0027t know Jarrett was African American but believed she was Jewish and Persian.In a since deleted Twitter rant from May, she says she told President of Disney-ABC Television Group Ben Sherwood: \u0027I thought she was white, she looks like my family!\u0027\u0027I bought the Chicagoist just to run you racist b*****s out...Papa Johns is hit with second scandal as bosses are accused...Share this article    Barr followed through with her promise when she posted the bizarre video of her speaking about the tweet on her YouTube page on Thursday           The actress looked disheveled and increasingly agitated, smoking a cigarette and repeatedly running her hands through her hair as she was interviewed by someone off camera          \u0027I thought the b***h was white!

In the early hours of May 30, just 24 hours after posting the racial slur, Roseanne claimed in two tweets minutes apart she believed that Jarrett was Jewish and Persian, or white   Contextual: Her son  shared text messages that he and his mother purportedly exchanged in which Barr writes that she thought Jarrett was \u0027white\u0027 and \u0027Iranian,\u0027 posted eight hours after the show was cancelled          On May 30, Barr claimed she had begged Ben Sherwood, then president of the Disney-ABC Television Group, to not cancel her show and let her \u0027make amends\u0027          She said that she thought Jarrett \u0027was white, she looks like my family!\u0027 she tweeted          The shamed star also blamed her racist rant on sleeping pill Ambien.

There is no set release date or name for the show.Barr has apologized for her tweets, saying she didn\u0027t mean to hurt anyone and that she\u0027s regretted the tweets, even before saying in an interview she \u0027lost everything.\u0027She later stated that she would not be speaking to the media any more, but would be addressing her fans \u0027directly\u0027 to \u0027cut out any middlemen who use for clickbaitad revenue while seeking to ide rather than unite.\u0027Barr followed through with her promise when she posted the bizarre video of her speaking about the tweet on her YouTube page on Thursday.    It was during this rant that Barr made the comment \u0027muslim brotherhood and planet of the apes had a babyvj\u0027, using Valerie Jarrett\u0027s initials, that would see her show axed.Barr subsequently deleted the tweet but not before it had been copied and shared across social media, leading to swift calls for her show to be pulled from the air.          After Barr\u0027s now-infamous Planet of the Apes tweet had been sent, Clinton replied around 9am to say that she was not in fact married to a Soros, though she admired the work his foundation does.Barr subsequently sent a Tweet apologizing to Clinton for the mistake, though launched another broadside at Soros by claiming he was a \u0027Nazi\u0027 who betrayed Jews during the holocaust.The actress also launched a salvo at Clinton\u0027s actual husband, Marc Mezvinsky, saying: \u0027HER HUSBAND IS THE SON OF A CORRUPT SENATOR.\u0027Clinton\u0027s father-in-law is a former congressman and convicted felon who in March of 2001 plead guilty to 31 of 69 felony charges of mail, bank and wire fraud.            But as the Clinton saga wound to a close Barr\u0027s tweet about Jarrett was catching a massive amount of attention, forcing the actress to brand her remark \u0027a joke\u0027.She also defended herself against allegations of racism by countering that Islam \u0027is not a race\u0027.The remarks were not enough, however, and around an hour later she offered a full apology to Jarrett and announced that she would be leaving Twitter.Shortly after midday Wanda Sykes, an African-American comedian and writer working on the Roseanne reboot, announced that she was walking away from the program.Around an hour later ABC broke its silence over the controversy to say that Roseanne was being cancelled.We now know that the network spent this time contacting Jarrett to apologize and inform her of the cancellation.Barr later said that the network had bowed to pressure amid calls for a boycott of Roseanne\u0027s advertisers, though ABC did not immediately respond to her remark.In its statement, ABC said Roseanne\u0027s remark was \u0027abhorrent, repugnant and inconsistent with our values\u0027.                          "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/21/00/4E72530100000578-5976287-image-a-38_1532129021809.jpg","title":"Revealing portrait Prince George fifth birthday","story":"    Prince George attends the Maserati Royal Charity Polo Trophy at Beaufort Polo Club, Tetbury          A photograph taken in London on July 2, 2014, to mark Britain\u0027s Prince George\u0027s first birthday           Prince George looks at his sister Princess Charlotte  in her pram on the Sandringham Estate          President Barack Obama, Prince William and First Lady Michelle Obama talks with Prince George          George enjoys weekends at Anmer Hall, visits to farm parks and country showsIt is an image of George, however, that friends of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge insist belies the happy, confident child their firstborn is developing into.

The Queen hails the \u0027tenacity, skill and...Share this articleThe past year has been a formative one for George the family moved back to London from their cloistered life at Anmer Hall, on the Queen’s Sandringham Estate in Norfolk, and he started school.His nerves on his first day at Thomas’s Battersea, in West London, were apparent, despite his parents arranging for a discreet, five-strong group of media to capture the moment, as opposed to the hundred-plus assembled to document William’s arrival at prep school at the same age.The duke admits his own experiences as a young boy — the mass photocalls and what he views as an overwhelming public interest in himself and brother, Harry — had been hard to deal with.He has made clear that he will be much more cautious with his own children, striking a careful balance between allowing people to share in their growing up, without making the youngsters feel they are constantly in the public eye.Some have questioned whether William and Kate’s understandable protectiveness of their son, plus their instinctive wariness of the media, may have inadvertently rubbed off on George. But friends insist he is no different from other young children. ‘Just because he reacts more cautiously than Charlotte when there is a camera around isn’t an indication of what he is like behind closed doors,’ says one. ‘Your first day at school is a big enough deal without all these strange people watching you. He is a very happy little boy.’William and Kate hope their choice of school, albeit one in the heart of an affluent area of the capital that has been dubbed Nappy Valley, will offer their son the chance to develop in a more rounded environment than other young royals.‘They thought long and hard about where George should be educated and really liked Thomas’s, which has a lovely nurturing atmosphere,’ a source said.‘The school focuses as much on helping develop the character of pupils, as what they learn. William and Kate are keen to allow George to spread his wings and make friends at this stage.‘They know there will come a time when they will have to sit down and talk to him about the implications of his royal status and why so many people are interested in him. He is becoming more aware of the cameras. But they are determined to do that at George’s own pace and feel that can all wait a bit.’          Prince William with Prince George on his son\u0027s first day of school on September 7, 2017Carole, 63, and her husband Michael, 69, play a hugely significant role in their grandchildren’s lives — as their current Caribbean holiday together shows. She has taken George and Charlotte to work at the family’s Party Pieces HQ, a short drive from the Middletons’ Berkshire mansion, where they play at being shopkeepers.One visitor spotted George sitting in the ‘front of house’, exclaiming excitedly ‘Oh my gosh!’ as his indulgent granny gave him a bag of sweets for being a good boy.Kate understands only too well that it is a grandparent’s prerogative to spoil their grandchildren — and still laughs about how she once called home from a foreign tour to speak to her mother, who was looking after George, only for him to tell her earnestly that his granny had given him ‘chips, again’ for dinner.With a loving, extended family around him, determined to protect him from the pressures of royal life for as long as they possibly can, it’s no wonder that George is growing into such a settled little boy.And who knows, one day he still may be able to become a pilot — just like Papa. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/21/16/4E751C3E00000578-5977667-image-m-5_1532185198431.jpg","title":"Dream homes today Cotswold gem lifted darkness","story":"    Bedrooms: 6.

Others say such doom-laden forecasts are a continuation of Project Fear, the label pinned to warnings during the 2016 referendum.Until we actually leave the EU, we won’t know the truth. But with the prospect of a hard Brexit or ‘No Deal’ growing daily, Project Fear is turning into Project Near.Today, The Mail on Sunday looks at the possible impact of a ‘No Deal’ or hard Brexit on a wide range of issues, from flights to food – and even travelling musicians.Economic damagePrivately, many Brexiteers admit the UK is in for a ‘bumpy ride’ when we leave the EU, but argue we will be better off in the long-term. Some experts have claimed Britain will lose up to £400 billion in lost economic growth by 2030.Pro-Brexit Cabinet Minister Liam Fox says the EU would face ‘catastrophic economic consequences’ in the event of ‘No Deal’ – and Ireland’s economy could collapse by 8 per cent. The International Monetary Fund says ‘No Deal’ could cost the EU nearly £200 billion in lost output.European giant Airbus, which employs 15,000 people in the UK, has warned it may have to cut British operations under a hard Brexit.AviationIrish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar was called an ‘airhead’ by Tory Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg after threatening to ban British planes from the skies above his country.Michael O’Leary, Ryanair chief executive, has said: ‘There is not a legal mechanism in which the airlines can operate in a hard Brexit or No Deal outcome.’Chancellor Philip Hammond says while it is ‘theoretically conceivable’ flights could stop straight away, ‘no one thinks that’s where we will end up’.PortsThe Port of Dover says a ‘two-minute delay’ in the time taken to process lorries if there is ‘No Deal’ could result in ‘17 miles of tailbacks’.Customs chiefs say customs declarations at ports such as Dover could increase fivefold to more than 250 million a year.Brexiteers say the current trouble-free handling of £80 billion of goods a year at Felixstowe, Britain’s busiest port – including to and from non-EU countries – shows such claims are ‘scare stories’.          Britain\u0027s Minister for Europe David Lidington will be sent to France to carve out a deal while others visit Germany, Italy and SpainCarsThe Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, which represents UK car makers, has said a ‘cliff edge Brexit’ is its ‘biggest fear’. It is claimed tariffs could increase the cost of imported cars by £1,500 on average.British motorists face having to apply for international permits to drive on the Continent.London’s Japanese Embassy – which represents 1,000 Japanese companies with UK operations, including Nissan, Toyota and Honda – says a ‘No Deal’ Brexit would be ‘impossible for us to accept’.The CityAccording to some estimates, up to 35,000 jobs in the financial sector could be at risk, as well as about £4 billion of tax revenues.Brexiteers dispute claims that Paris or Frankfurt will replace London as Europe’s financial HQ, but Bank of China UK boss Sun Yu said a ‘No Deal’ would threaten London’s status as a hub for international banks.MedicinesThe British Pharmaceutical Industry says more than 1,000 medicines made in the UK would need to be relicensed elsewhere in the EU so they can carry on being sold. ‘This is not like transferring a filing cabinet from one location to another,’ said a spokeswoman.The supply of drugs and medical supplies could be affected by changes to current European regulations, overseen by the European Medicines Agency. MPs voted last week against plans for Britain to quit the EMA.FarmingOnce the UK is out of the EU, animal and food products can be exported to France only via Le Havre and Dunkirk. There have been reports that neither can cope with the amount of UK exports which currently do not need checking. The National Farmers’ Union has warned of ‘huge disruption in terms of cost’.Food and drinkUnder a Brexit ‘Armageddon’ scenario, some supermarkets could run out of food within a couple of days. Nearly a third of food in UK supermarkets comes from the EU and reaches shelves in two days.Some estimates say food prices could go up by 20 per cent. The British Retail Consortium says the average tariff on EU food imports would be 22 per cent.          Wine could rise in cost by a quarter according to some analysts if Britain fails to make a Brexit deal with the European Union AlcoholBritain imports 1.8 billion bottles of wine a year worth £2.8 billion – with more than half from the EU. According to some experts, tariffs could help push the cost of French, Spanish and other EU wines up by a quarter after March – sparking the resurgence of alcohol smuggling.A spokesman for the Wine and Spirit Trade Association said: ‘There must be mechanisms to allow cross-border trade of wine and spirits the moment we leave the EU.’ If not, wine and spirits may ‘not get on to the shelves’ and there could be ‘an influx of bootleggers’.

I can see they think homeless people are hopeless or they have problems.’Sheila Scott, co-founder of Shelter From the Storm, told the programme that, on average, 30 per cent of people they help will be in employment.‘A homeless person can be anybody,’ she says. ‘It’s the woman who looks after your granny, people working as teaching assistants in schools. The sums just don’t add up. If you are on a minimum wage, it’s almost impossible to find a place to live.’Homeless charity Shelter says 300,000 people are officially registered as homeless in this country – a figure which has increased by 13,000 in a year. But the true extent of the issue is thought to be much worse as this figure doesn’t include those staying with friends or sofa-surfing.Dispatches says many of those homeless are also on council waiting lists for social housing.Connie Cullen from Shelter said: ‘We are at crisis point. We really need social housing available to people on low income. Without that we are going to continue to see people who are in work and who are homeless.’Heather Wheeler, the Government’s Housing Minister, refused to be interviewed by Dispatches. A spokesperson for the department told the programme: ‘This Government is investing over £1.2 billion pounds to help and introduce the homeless reduction Act.’Dispatches will be screened on Channel 4 on Monday night at 8pm"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/03/09/4DDEDC4900000578-0-image-a-11_1530606342861.jpg","title":"Susanna Reid says Twitter trolls wont drive Good Morning Britain","story":"    Good Morning Britain presenter and  Susanna Reid has hit out at those who abuse her online\u0027This is like Mao’s China\u0027: Piers Morgan compares schools...\u0027Who\u0027s giving him PR advice?\u0027 Princess Diana\u0027s former butler...‘I’ve changed my mind about Meghan’s dad – he’s just a shy,...Share this articleBut Ms Reid has insisted she is unmoved by the abuse.

I just want the best for him.\u0027Wallace, aged 11, lives in Dursely, Gloucestershire, with two donkeys and another mule, which was so badly abused it could not be ridden.          Against the odds: Wallace became the first ever mule to compete under British dressage          Hot to trot: Wallace makes his way round  at Summerhouse Equestrian Centre, Gloucestershire          Riding high: Wallace scored 67.4 per cent and came top against eight, fully horse competitorsHe was found wandering around a village in Ireland and rescued by the Donkey Sanctuary, where he was fostered by Christie\u0027s friend, Lesley Radcliffe.But for the past six months, Wallace and Christie have been training together and the mule\u0027s aptitude for dressage became clear.Christie says that as he measures 14 hands high, it is \u0027exactly the same\u0027 as riding a horse.And Wallace proved he was more than equal in ability and intelligence when he scored 67.4 per cent in the competition.He was rewarded with his favourite treats, Stud Muffins.          Eyes on the prize: Proud Christie gives Wallace his favourite treats, Stud Muffins, after his win          Months of training for dressage have paid off, as Wallace impressed his way to first placeChristie added: \u0027I didn\u0027t sleep all last night, I was awake at 3am.\u0027People were so behind him and me, and I just want both of us to be the best we can be.\u0027It is like a mule version of Babe the pig. Babe wanted to be a sheep dog, and Wallace is the mule that wants to be a horse.          Tears of joy: Christie McLean is visibly moved after her rescue mule won his dressage event\u0027I think this shows that mules are equal in ability. I believe Wallace wants to do this. \u0027It\u0027s a double achievement - he\u0027s made history for mules, and British Dressage.\u0027It is a historic day which will never be repeated, a landmark.\u0027Some 14,000 people are members of British Dressage and compete in 2,000 competitions every year.Dressage began in the 17th Century when it was used by the cavalry to train horses in preparation for battlefields.It officially became a sport in the 1960s.

They orced after his extramarital affarisThe spotlight was thrown on his family life after he crashed his SUV into a tree and a fire hydrant outside his home in Windermere, Florida.  Over the next few weeks reports emerged of multiple extramarital affairs, which he eventually admitted and which led to his orce from wife Elin Nordegren. He did not return to golf until the 2010 Masters and next won a PGA Tour tournament in 2012. His career faced further struggles through injury as Woods had back surgery in 2014, missing the Augusta National the first time, and again in 2015 after missing the cut at three of the year\u0027s four majors. In late 2016 he competed for the first time in 15 months at the unofficial Hero World Challenge in the Bahamas. He makes 24 birdies but finishes 15th out of 18 players.           In 2009 Woods left home after allegedly taking an Ambien and crashed his Cadillac Escalade (above) into a fire hydrant, a tree and several hedges - damaging the front of the vehicle          The golfer\u0027s mugshot after he was arrested and spent several hours in Florida jail Things took a turn for the worse last year when he was arrested for driving under the influence in Jupiter, Florida, where police said they found him asleep at the wheel of his Mercedes. The golfer had to be woken up by an officer according to the Probable Cause Affidavit, which stated that the car was running at the time and Woods\u0027 right blinker was flashing. The document said Woods then failed four field sobriety tests, saying he was on four prescription drugs. Last October Woods pleaded guilty to reckless driving and received a fine, a year of probation and and 50 hours of community service. Between 1997 and 2008 he won 14 major championships, and in 2001 became the only player in history to win all four of them in a row, a feat nicknamed the Tiger Slam. A new book about Tiger\u0027s checkered past was released in March this year.Based on more than 250 new interviews, the book — simply entitled Tiger Woods — has been hailed as the most comprehensive glimpse yet into the golfer’s private world.Written by Jeff Benedict and Armen Keteyian, the book painted Woods as a sociopathic narcissist.‘Even the most basic human civilities — a simple hello or thank you — routinely went missing from his vocabulary. A nod was too much to expect,’ say the authors. According to the book Tiger had a tough childhood. The authors revealed  his father, retired army lieutenant-colonel Earl Woods, not only instilled in Tiger a ruthless determination to win at golf, but also appeared to pass on his weakness for womanising.The book reveals how, in his later years, Woods Sr turned Tiger’s childhood home into what one employee called ‘a house of horrors’.The house in California had cupboards and drawers overflowing with sex toys, while pornography played continually on the TV. It was populated by a small army of young female retainers recruited to cater to Earl’s insatiable sexual demands."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/22/17/4E7DB48600000578-5979921-image-a-52_1532276468232.jpg","title":"Karlie Kloss Joshua Kushner loved display Italy","story":"    A bikini-clad Karlie Kloss and her long-time boyfriend Joshua Kushner were spotted soaking up the Italian sunshine on Saturday as they sailed around Capri on a luxury yacht  At one point, a cheeky Karlie grinned as she stuck her middle finger up in the direction of a photographer before her shocked boyfriend tried to intervene          The couple, who have been together six years but are rarely spotted out in public together, shared an intimate moment together during their sailing trip with friendsThe pair were spotted taking a dip just off the yacht before cozying up alongside each other to soak up some of the sunshine. At one point, a cheeky Karlie grinned as she stuck her middle finger up in the direction of a photographer before her shocked boyfriend tried to intervene and stop her.Kushner, who is Ivanka Trump\u0027s brother-in-law, very quickly started laughing along with his girlfriend as their friends watched on.The loved-up couple were also spotted chatting intimately and hugging each other throughout the sailing trip.Kushner also took several photos of his Victoria\u0027s Secret model girlfriend as she posed in her bikini at the front of the boat.

When Bushra finally did remove her veil, Khan adds: \u0027I was not disappointed, and now I am happily married.\u0027Back in the 1980s, when Khan lived the life of a socialite, playing with the same energy both on the field and in London nightclubs such as Annabel\u0027s and Tramp, it would, he admits, \u0027have been unthinkable if someone had told me I would marry someone whose face I hadn\u0027t seen.

I have great respect for my wife\u0027s intellect and character.\u0027I met Khan at his villa at Bani Gala, outside Islamabad. He normally avoids any public statements about his personal life but agreed to discuss it, even briefly alluding to his marriage to Reham, the author of a sensational memoir published earlier this month.According to her book, Khan is bisexual, takes hard drugs, and has fathered at least five children out of wedlock – some by Indian women. It is a scandalous claim for the Pakistani audience for which her claims have been tailored.As for Khan\u0027s marriage to Jemima, who is of Jewish descent, Reham claims this took place because he is close to \u0027active Zionists\u0027. The marriage reportedly broke down because Jemima found life difficult in Pakistan, especially when her husband\u0027s political career took off. But Jemima has furiously rebutted Reham\u0027s claims, and has threatened to sue her for libel.EXCLUSIVE: Radical Islamist preacher who has said he ‘does...Fury over vile Facebook video of racist spraying Muslim...Battle of Imran Khan’s exes: Jemima Goldsmith threatens to...Share this articleOne of Khan\u0027s closest advisers told the MoS: \u0027This book is simply a farrago, a pack of absolute lies.\u0027 The source added that during Khan\u0027s ill-starred liaison with Reham, he had \u0027never seen him so unhappy\u0027. The man himself would never stoop to comment on the book in detail, the adviser added.He was right. But in his interview, Khan was prepared to go further than he has before. \u0027Normally I don\u0027t say anything about Reham, but I will say this: I\u0027ve made some mistakes in my life, but my second marriage has to be the biggest.\u0027As for Jemima, they are \u0027of course\u0027 still good friends.Khan\u0027s new marriage is just one aspect of an extraordinary personal and political trajectory. Ranked as one of the best-ever Test all-rounders, he may now be of pensionable age, but superficially he is little changed.He still has a mane of dark hair and retains the physique of an athlete. This is all the more remarkable because during Pakistan\u0027s last election in 2013, he suffered a fall from an unstable platform, leaving him with a punctured lung and fractures in his skull, a rib and several vertebrae.          Jemima Khan (R) ex-wife of Pakistan\u0027s cricket legend turned politician Imran Khan reads a statement in local Urdu language          Imran Khan with his bride Reham Khan, praying during a ceremony at his home in Islamabad          Pakistani cricketer Imran Khan (L) and former wife Reham Khan pose for a photograph during their wedding ceremony at his house in Islamabad in 2015          Reham Khan was married to Imran Khan for a matter of months before their romance fell apartAfter retiring from cricket, he raised £20 million to build Pakistan\u0027s first specialist cancer hospital, which opened in Lahore in 1994. Two years later, he founded the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), or Movement for Justice. Slowly it has made electoral gains and is currently the third-largest party in the national assembly.If PTI wins the election, it will be partly due to the imprisonment earlier this month of the former Muslim League prime minister Nawaz Sharif on money-laundering charges. Sharif was in power from 2013 until he was legally barred from office last summer.It was Khan who campaigned for an investigation into the Sharif family\u0027s London property empire, which the MoS revealed is worth at least £33 million. He was convicted and jailed for ten years for failing to account for the funds he used to purchase four luxury Mayfair flats. In advance of the election, his party – now led by his brother, Shehbaz Sharif – has suffered a wave of defections to the PTI.The PTI\u0027s manifesto promises not only to stamp out corruption but to turn Pakistan into a \u0027welfare state\u0027. A Khan government would also have a very different attitude to the War on Terror. For years he has been an outspoken critic of British and American policy in Afghanistan, which he says has had disastrous consequences for his country, triggering home-grown terrorism. Only last week, a series of deadly bombings took place.\u0027We had nothing to do with 911, no Pakistani was involved,\u0027 Khan says, anger in his voice. \u0027But suddenly we were in the eye of the storm.\u0027I remember George Bush\u0027s words, \u0027We will not abandon Pakistan.\u0027 But after losing 70,000 of our people in militant attacks, and £75 billion from the economy, now we have been made scapegoats for the Americans\u0027 futile Afghan war.\u0027Apparently a few thousand Afghans supposedly operating from Pakistan are the reason why 150,000 Nato troops plus 250,000 Afghans could not win.\u0027Meanwhile, Pakistan is currently the biggest recipient of UK aid, receiving more than £450 million from British taxpayers last year alone. This, says Khan, must end. \u0027Right now, we are sinking in debt, so we need breathing space until we correct our governance system and raise our revenues. Beyond that, aid is a curse. You become dependent on it. Long-term aid is like heroin addiction.\u0027Pakistani analysts say that while PTI is likely to become the biggest party, it is less likely to win an overall majority, so will need support from others, probably from several small religious parties.No one believes Khan is still the playboy of 40 years ago. But, say cynics, this means that however attractive her character, his main reason for marrying Bushra was that it was politically astute.It is a charge Khan denies. Once, he admits, he was \u0027a totally non-spiritual person\u0027, but his \u0027spiritual journey\u0027 has already lasted decades. Moreover, driving it has been Sufi mysticism, a branch of Islam that focuses on the inner self.\u0027My interest in Sufism started 30 years ago. It changed my life,\u0027 he says. \u0027Sufism is an order with many levels, but I have never met anyone who is as high as my wife. My interest in her began with that.\u0027          A famous face: British actress Elizabeth Hurley (R) and Pakistani politician and former cricket hero Imran Khan (L)          Imran Khan and Jemima Khan relax with their son Suleiman Khan at the HACAN Charity Cricket Match on Ham common in 2007          Saira Khan, ex-Apprentice contestant with Imran Khan in 2007.

She is known as a leader of pilgrimages to the shrine of the Sufi poet Sheik Fariduddin Ganjshakar at Pakpattan – one of the holiest sites on the subcontinent. Since their wedding, the couple have also been on a pilgrimage to Mecca.Khan says Bushra\u0027s sister is a PTI member, and introduced the couple when he was struggling to understand the teachings of a 13th Century Sufi saint. He says he used to visit Bushra\u0027s house to listen to her explain these and other religious complexities: \u0027I would go and meet her and read the books she would recommend.\u0027Gradually, the visits became more frequent, and they began to grow close personally. But he says he would never have dreamed of proposing marriage had Bushra not, last autumn, got a orce.After a short interval, it was in January \u0027when I proposed to her without seeing her face\u0027. He had to wait several weeks for an answer \u0027because of family issues: as anyone who marries once they have a family knows, it\u0027s difficult\u0027. However, Khan\u0027s sons by Jemima have met Bushra, and he has begun to get to know her children, too.Khan says that if he does win the election, Bushra will not attend official functions. The one-time nightclub habitué insists he does not mind. \u0027She meets very few people, but it suits me fine. I am past the age of socialising. I am quite happy with this life.\u0027In this, as in many other ways, a Prime Minister Imran Khan would be unique.          Imran Khan and Jemima Khan at a charity dinner in Lahore, Pakistan.

I can see they think homeless people are hopeless or they have problems.’Sheila Scott, co-founder of Shelter From the Storm, told the programme that, on average, 30 per cent of people they help will be in employment.‘A homeless person can be anybody,’ she says. ‘It’s the woman who looks after your granny, people working as teaching assistants in schools. The sums just don’t add up. If you are on a minimum wage, it’s almost impossible to find a place to live.’Homeless charity Shelter says 300,000 people are officially registered as homeless in this country – a figure which has increased by 13,000 in a year. But the true extent of the issue is thought to be much worse as this figure doesn’t include those staying with friends or sofa-surfing.Dispatches says many of those homeless are also on council waiting lists for social housing.Connie Cullen from Shelter said: ‘We are at crisis point. We really need social housing available to people on low income. Without that we are going to continue to see people who are in work and who are homeless.’Heather Wheeler, the Government’s Housing Minister, refused to be interviewed by Dispatches.

And what better image to capture that moment of explosive joy on the last day of term than this chaotic and colourful image by French photographer Aurore Valade, a graduate of the elite Beaux-Arts school in Bordeaux.Valade, whose work is one of the official exhibitions at the international Rencontres d’Arles this summer, seeks to examine the idea of liberation, transgression and revolt.This 2010 picture, from the series We were bored…, features a class of 13- and 14-year-olds at a school in the Yonne region south-east of Paris.Valade, 37, says she asked the teenagers what they would secretly like to do when bored, but did not dare because it was not allowed. When most admitted they wanted to throw something, she suggested they bring in a selection of harmless projectiles, including old pens and stuffed toys.“I like to work collaboratively, so I wanted them to choose the objects they would like to throw, then got them to throw them at the same time,” says Valade. “I wanted to capture this sudden and out-of-the-ordinary burst of adolescent energy. It was about exploding, expressing and exploring something in themselves. The idea was for them to revolt to do something unexpected, especially in a space like a school that is normally strictly controlled.“Suddenly, all is possible...including transgression and private rebellion.”More artistic than documentary, the photographs in the series – in this case a collage of three separate images – were meticulously staged.

The company cited “exceptional shortage of rainfall” and a surge in usage during the prolonged hot weather. A spokesperson for United Utilities said: “We deliver a range of benefits and long-term value for customers, the environment, and shareholders ... Between 2015 and 2020 , we are investing over £3.5bn in essential infrastructure.”Cat Hobbs, the director of the campaign group We Own It, which campaigns for public ownership of utilities including water companies, said: “This shows exactly what’s wrong with the water industry. Dividends to shareholders have been prioritised over investment in infrastructure we all need.”Thames Water suspended idend payments to investors last year, saying the money would instead be spent on long-term investment plans such as getting its leakage target back on track and on its water and waste treatment plants.The change in policy came after 10 years in which about £1.2bn was taken out of the company in the form of idends. Its owner over that period, the Australian investment bank Macquarie, sold its final stake in 2017, landing Thames with more than £10bn of debt financing.Last month, the water industry regulator demanded Severn Trent, Southern Water, South East Water and Thames Water submit detailed plans by 28 September that outlined how they would improve service for customers during difficult weather conditions. Ofwat set the deadline after a review found tens of thousands of customers had water supplies cut for days during the “beast from the east” weather events earlier this year. The report criticised poor advance planning, inadequate communication with customers and a lack of basic support during the cold snap. The regulator said it would take further action against any water company that provided an unsatisfactory response.Responding to the imminent payout to United Utilities shareholders, a spokesperson for Ofwat said: “The decisions some water companies have made on idends, financial structures and top executive pay have damaged customer trust. We have looked in detail at the incentives we give water companies. Through measures we announced earlier this month, we are strengthening the incentive on companies to improve their performance for customers and cutting the rewards that come from financial engineering.”It said it had asked the companies to cut down on leakage by 170bn litres a year, enough to meet the yearly needs of everyone in the cities of Birmingham, Leeds, Manchester, Liverpool and Cardiff combined. According to the Consumer Council for Water, United lost just over 133 litres per property a day in 2017, a fall from 138 litres the previous year but still making the company the second biggest offender in the UK behind Thames Water."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c6d4ca9055f44cbdfeb4d07219067b2e31f6b87/0_100_1500_900/master/1500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ed8e20decab54821a5ce68b756321e5a","title":"shoreditch east end london art hub big business gentrification","story":"It is the home of hipsterism, the birthplace of a thousand bushy beards, but has Shoreditch outgrown its cool? Has it become an urban victim of its commercial success? It’s a familiar cycle: a neglected inner city neighbourhood is colonised by artists, a cafe culture flourishes, new businesses move in, then rents go up, and the original inhabitants who gave the place its character are priced out of the area.This week sees the closure of the Red Gallery, the idiosyncratic event space, and its sister establishment, the symbolically titled pop-up food and music venue, Last Days of Shoreditch. They are to be cleared away for the construction of an 18-storey, 300-bed hotel by upmarket chain Art’otel, by the multinational Park Plaza group.As if marking the passing of an age, Hackney council, going against the findings of its own consultation process, announced an extension of the special policy area in Shoreditch that makes it harder to open new bar premises. It also brought in across-the-borough restrictions on opening hours, with midnight curfews for all new venues.“It’s the Leicester Squarification of Shoreditch,” said Jonathan Downey, the owner of Dinerama, one of the area’s popular street-food markets.That’s a sentiment echoed by Yarda Krampol of Last Days of Shoreditch. “Hackney Council are following an agenda of cultural cleansing,” he said.But on the streets of Shoreditch and nearby Hoxton, it was hard to find many skinny-jeaned groovers crying into their flat whites. The place was still thrumming with energy, or at least a lot of attractive young people walking from bar to cafe to boutique and back again.When I worked here in the late 1980s and early 1990s, it was something of a cultural and culinary desert. Back then, only a raver who’d taken too much ecstasy would have predicted that the area would house a Versace shop, as there is now on Redchurch Street. There were just a few greasy spoon caffs, one half-decent pub and a car wash (which is still there). That was pretty much it for daytime entertainment. At night, there was the Bass Clef, a surprisingly sophisticated jazz venue for the time (it served food!) that seemed to have been plonked down from another universe.“You’d go there and you could smell the future,” says the Red Gallery’s founder, Ernesto Leal.And aside from that, there was the rather outlandish gay bar, the London Apprentice, which drew a number of celebrities like Freddy Mercury to east London. But the rest was an eerie silence.By then, as Leal recalls, artists and photographers had already moved into the studios vacated by the departing textile and tailoring businesses. In 1993, a group of Young British Artists, including Tracey Emin, Gavin Turk and Gillian Wearing, took part in a Fete Worse than Death in Shoreditch, in which they sold their wares on stalls, as though they were at a village fete.Leal would rent spaces for illegal warehouse raves from photographers, or sometimes just break into empty ones. “I can’t even think in those terms anymore,” he said, leaning back in his cramped office. “But they were exciting times.”That kind of edginess has little place in the now thriving and increasingly wealthy area. Instead, there are plush, ironic versions of a furtive underworld, in which clientele have to say a password or go through a wardrobe door to enter artfully hidden cocktail bars. But, as Leal points out, it would be wrong to look back with any great nostalgia. Not only was it hard to buy a pint of milk, there were so few local shops, but the area was also infamous for its far-right politics. The National Front’s headquarters were on Great Eastern Street until the early 1980s. At that time, I was going to college in Shoreditch, and I remember the local pubs were not always welcoming. “There was still a big white working-class community,” said Leal – whose parents escaped from the far-right in Chile – when he first came to Shoreditch from Edinburgh in the late 1980s, “and you’d still see evidence of fascists around in pubs”.But several factors helped transform Shoreditch. Far-right politics were roundly defeated. And Downey believes that Westminster council’s decision at the turn of the millennium to restrict bars in Soho and Covent Garden helped create the need for a new social quarter. “All of the up-and-coming bar owners came east,” he said. Around the same time, tech businesses arrived and the area around Old Street was dubbed Silicon Roundabout. It was, after all, the cross fertilisation of bespoke bar culture and tech-savvy millennials that produced the particular genus of homo sapiens we now know as “the hipster”.Inevitably, the species has evolved over the years. In his sharp suit and with a hairless face, Imran Younus doesn’t look a classic of the type. But the marketing company executive seems completely at home in Shoreditch, a neighbourhood “that has a little place for every type of person”. He disagreed that it had lost any of its dynamism or creativity.Not far from the Versace shop, I meet Tim Traynor, who – with his full and perfectly coiffed black beard and dark sunglasses – looks like the platonic ideal of hipsterism. He’s even a marketing manager for a specialist brewery. Originally from New York, he saw his old neighbourhood of Brooklyn go through the same process as Shoreditch.“The good thing about cities like New York and London is that the cool places move on. If you get tired of the white-guy-hipster thing, then there are other layers of the onion to pull back,” he said.Although sad to be evicted from Shoreditch, Krampol thinks he and his partners might take their community-flavoured project elsewhere. “Maybe Deptford,” he said. “There are loads of interesting things happening around there. Tottenham is quite nice as well. Ten years ago, I never thought I’d be looking for spaces in Tottenham. But here we are.” Tottenham, you’ve been warned. The hipsters are coming!"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c80e7b74b1e499bd4dcb123febccedc958957877/0_1003_3840_2304/master/3840.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3edc347e561c628b94d73f459c9afc5b","title":"earth wind and air filters how our environment affects our wellbeing","story":"Incorporating nature, water and the right colours and lighting into our built environments can have an immeasurable impact on our health, happiness and productivity – Gemma Askham explains whyVitamin NBiophilia may or may not be a word you’re familiar with, but it’s the reason that everything from your yoga studio to your accountant’s office has a peace lily in it. It was the title of a 1984 book by biologist Edward O Wilson, who claimed humans are genetically drawn to seek out and feel more zen in nature. In 2005, author Richard Louv proposed that not seeing your greens could cause Nature Deficit Disorder (NDD), a low-mood condition similar to Seasonal Affective Disorder (Sad).“Nature is good for us because humans are part of nature,” says Dr Miles Richardson, director of psychology at the University of Derby and founder of the Nature Connectedness Research Group. The science of why is down to a three circles model, where wellbeing is a delicately weighted balance between drive, contentment and threat. “Being constantly driven at work can mean our threat response is overactive, positive emotions are reduced, and we become anxious. Nature reduces sympathetic nervous activity associated with drive, and increases parasympathetic nervous activity associated with calm,” he says.  Relaxation comes whether you bathe in a forest or simply look at some roses – so it’s not necessarily being in nature that relaxes you, but feeling connected to it. “Simply noticing three good things in nature every day, such as a flower growing on the pavement, increases connectedness and, therefore, wellbeing,” adds Richardson. Light rightThere’s a reason that getting the window seat is such a big deal – it is, in fact, scientifically good for us. A study in the Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine found that sitting by a window during your working day results in 46 minutes more sleep every night.Where windows-for-all isn’t an option, architects are plugging into the new trend for circadian lighting: LED systems that mimic the angle and colour of the sun to sync with our bodies’ awake and sleep cycles. “Evolution has led us to expect a bluer light in the afternoon and a redder light in the morning and evening. Manufacturers are starting to produce systems with wavelengths to echo this,” explains Joe Croft, head of environmental and sustainability at Overbury, a wellbeing-focused fit-out firm. Air-ratedPolluted air doesn’t just create temporary physical symptoms such as problematic skin, and irritated eyes, nose and throat, it also contributes to the risk of chronic illnesses – but new tech is assisting the fightback against bad air. “The world’s first smartphone with air-quality sensors was released in February. Soon, more and more people will have the technology in their pocket to measure the quality of air around them,” says Croft. Colour of creativityThe psychology of shades has been a talking, dressing and wall-painting point ever since psychologist Angela Wright identified how colour influences our reactions back in 1984. Today, much of the focus is on how our environment spurs creativity. Sensory “triggers”, such as different textures of materials, are thought to keep the brain engaged, improving our ability to access knowledge. The significance of colour is also now thought to vary depending on where you are. According to the Human Spaces report, creativity is best boosted by green and purple colours in the UK, red design accents in India and water features in Brazil. Immersed in waterThe effect of urban water on wellbeing is the very latest area of environmental research. While the value of green space is in no doubt – the charity Fields in Trust equates the health benefit of the UK’s parks to around £34bn – water features, such as rivers, are less well examined. A special project will look at how 18,000 Europeans’ lives are influenced by water, meaning we could soon be splashing around a new buzzword: blue health.Look out for Clinique’s “purity patrol” fleet, carrying commuters around London, Manchester and Birmingham in air-purified rickshaws from 19-21 July.

When I saw that a giant statue of Jeff Goldblum in sweaty, semi-naked repose had been unexpectedly erected near Tower Bridge, my pulse did not quicken. My palms did not bead with sweat. My desire – for a new Facebook display picture, or otherwise – did not pull me compulsively towards the Thames. I was left cold by “Sexy Jeff Goldblum” – which is not to say I am left cold by Jeff Goldblum. I have a pulse, and a formative memory of him attempting pick-up artistry on Laura Dern from the back of a Jeep in Jurassic Park.Online appreciation for his sultry turn as Dr\u0026nbspIan\u0026nbspMalcolm in that film has seen Goldblum go from cult figure to fully realised sex symbol in recent years, with many memes made of his open-shirted form. It is as the “chaos theorist” that Goldblum appears rendered nearly 10ft (3m) tall and 23ft long on the South\u0026nbspBank. “Jurassic Jeff”, a stunt by Sky’s subscription service Now TV to mark the 25th anniversary of Steven Spielberg’s blockbuster, has received adulatory coverage since it was installed last week. Goldblum himself awarded it the highest of accolades: “1010\u0026nbspGOLDBLUMS”.I’d put it at two or three, at most. Viewed most generously, Jurassic Jeff is a totem to the female gaze, a modern riposte to centuries of women being put on pedestals. It is also no small physical feat, reportedly having taken more than 250 hours over six weeks to construct. But ultimately, it is a publicity stunt, and a very successful one at that.That may be enough for many to enjoy the statue at bare-chest value and “bask in its nonsensical glory”, as someone put it on Twitter. But some defining images of our time have been advertisements (and some defining artists advertisers). Its commercial imperative is no reason not to ask what Jurassic Jeff and the rapturous response to it says about popular culture. And, Goldblum fan though I am, I would argue it’s nothing good.It does not comment on or subvert the sly and often surreal use of Goldblum’s image at the centre of his cult online following it just reproduces one of its main symbols. The statue is nothing more than a meme made manifest, a one-note statement that says: “Hey, you’ve seen this on the internet!” We should ask for more, even of our publicity stunts. Weeks of construction aside, it is lazy, the result of mining the internet for ideas and lifting them wholesale. Yet Adweek hailed it as an “instant classic”.Jurassic Jeff represents a tired extension to the life cycle of a meme, which – one could fairly argue in light of the $25 T-shirts printed with “big dick energy” on them – was already longer than what could be considered tasteful or humane. Once, memes began their lives in an online subculture such as 4chan, Reddit or Tumblr and ended them weeks or months later on Facebook, where they’d wash up, spent, to await the final blow: being shared by your mum, or a police force page.Today the final resting place for an internet joke is the South Bank, or on the side of an apartment block, immortalised in a public space. I’m regrettably reminded of the work of Lushsux, an Australian Banksy aspirant who has made his name with large-scale reproductions of internet culture. Which is to say, he paints a meme on a wall. Apparently he calls it “memefiti”.Like Jurassic\u0026nbspJeff, Lushsux’s paintings – of Kim\u0026nbspKardashian’s naked selfie, Taylor Swift, one-hit viral wonders such as Harambe the gorilla and the “Cash Me Ousside, Howbow Dah” woman from Dr Phil – often generate media coverage, creating a banal feedback loop: meme is born online, injected into the world, and returned whence it came in the form of breathless news stories. At one point of 2016, entire walls of Melbourne’s famous street-art alleys were given over to spray-painted memes: crying Michael Jordan, Arthur’s clenched fist, approving Drake.Online, these memes are used widely but deliberately, to communicate meaning – barely repressed devastation, simmering anger, permissiveness and denial – in an infinite variety of contexts, from relatable everyday observations to principles of urban planning. On a wall, they say nothing. Corporations co-opting symbols and subcultures is nothing new, but it’s particularly self-defeating in the case of memes, which are self-perpetuating and, fundamentally, fleeting. Their meanings are mutable – look how the lovable downbeat Pepe the frog cartoon was moulded into a symbol of hatred by the alt-right, even as its creator launches a legal challenge to prevent it. Digital culture is rich and nuanced, and has the potential for real-world impact. It deserves to be dug into and engaged with meaningfully, not just skimmed off the top for a punchline.But, in part because of the social media chatter and column inches generated by large-scale, facile stunts such as Jurassic Jeff, these hollow displays of cultural literacy are everywhere – in Hillary Clinton tweeting at Trump to “delete your account”, hashtags on everything, a book deal for Grumpy Cat, a TV show developed from a Twitter account, and a modern language reduced to a “contemptible and manipulative” film.How to record internet culture poses a challenge for today’s archivists, but lifting it wholesale, without context or analysis, benefits no one (bar, often, the corporations). Landing memes writ large on the Thames reflects a flattening of culture, a subtext-free call and response. We see Jurassic Jeff, we recognise him from the internet, and we send him back there on our Instagram stories and Facebook feeds.Better to give our attention to art and spectacle that actually mean something, and leave memes in their natural habitat online, to live, morph and – eventually, thankfully – die.• Elle Hunt is a commissioning and communities editor with  Cities"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/adb65bfb73578400d5c4f4ae73fb7a334f733f9d/0_4_2362_1417/master/2362.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2838dfff11938d2fe6b51bd3fa5e8ba7","title":"snake oil medicine politics andrew wakefield","story":"There is a classic Mitchell and Webb sketch in which two doctors working in a “homeopathic A\u0026ampE” treat a patient who has just been hit by a car. “Get me some wolfsbane, also known as monkshood, in here!” shouts Webb over the gurney. “And a whole tray of flower remedies!” Mitchell winces: “Oh … his chakras are fading. He needs some crystals.” Webb responds: “Nurse – fetch me some purple-tinted quartz! All right, make that aquamarine quartz!”The dialogue is as funny as it is because it parodies a form of delusion and superstition that – far from fading – is gaining traction at a deeply alarming pace. Pseudoscience is nothing new, but its scale and proliferation most definitely are. And the consequences are real and frightening (full disclosure: I am a trustee of the Science Museum Group). Last week, a study by scientists at Yale University of 1,000 patients with breast, prostate, lung or bowel cancer showed that those who used so-called complementary treatments were twice as likely to die as those who did not. The study, published in the journal JAMA Oncology, concluded the primary reason for this was that the subjects seeking “alternative” cures were more likely to delay or refuse conventional cancer therapy.Meanwhile, it has been reported that Andrew\u0026nbspWakefield – a disgraced doctor whose claims that there is a link between vaccines and autism have been comprehensively and repeatedly discredited – is dating Elle Macpherson, an Australian businesswoman and supermodel. Though not of much scientific importance in itself, this liaison symbolises the appalling success with which Wakefield has turned his academic infamy into a form of celebrity. Struck off as a medical practitioner in the UK, he has reinvented himself in the US as a populist guru and protector of children, fighting the wicked establishment of the pharmaceutical companies, government and supposedly corrupt doctors.The extraordinary spread of pseudoscience chimes with the spirit of the age: expertise, once a claim to authority, is now often regarded as a liability. The medical research community is increasingly distrusted as just another mendacious elite seeking to control the more open-minded public. Not surprisingly, social media has been the principal engine of change, weaponising bogus medicine, fakery and charlatanism of all sorts. Conspiracy theorists scuttle over the web, encouraging disdain for conventional medical practice and (most recently) alleging that what we call science is just another western “social construct”.And fighting back is not straightforward. William\u0026nbspDavies argues in his brilliant forthcoming book, Nervous States: How Feeling Took Over the World: “Phoney science can be demolished. The problem is, it takes time.” The scientists are making a complex case, the pseudoscientists merely mobilising opinion and appealing to public sentiment by digital means.I don’t want to close down spas, ban herbal tea and charcoal balm, stop people buying botanical products or enjoying reiki. Many modern pharmaceuticals have their roots in ancient herbal treatments: the precursor to aspirin, for instance, was found in willow tree leaves. But as Tim Minchin has joked: “Do you know what they call alternative medicine that’s been proven to work? Medicine.”Once again, the gag captures a genuine peril. What so many pseudoscientists and champions of “complementary medicine” do is to undermine trust in treatments that are actually effective – with terrible real-life consequences. Since Wakefield’s campaign began, the incidence of measles has risen appallingly, with many losses of life. The Yale study should give pause to every person who, hearing that a friend or loved one has been diagnosed with a tumour, is minded to send them a leaflet about an amazing new diet, or tell them a story about the aunt of a neighbour of a colleague who was “cured” by a shaman in Streatham.It is a particular irony in the case of cancer that, precisely at the moment that pseudoscience is on the rampage, we stand on the brink of a historic breakthrough in oncology. I recently met a cancer specialist who refers to himself as an “algorithmist” because his work entails the development of super-specific drug treatments, computerised protocols based on genetic mapping. Immunotherapy and related practices should soon turn what is all too often a terminal disease into, at worst, a chronic condition like diabetes. It is hard to exaggerate the potential benefits to humanity that may lie in the not-too-distant future.The catch, of course, is that such treatments will require funding, and lots of it. But researchers I have spoken to say the challenge will be one not only of regularised resources, but of public education. A decade from now, the traditional trinity of surgical resection, radiotherapy and chemotherapy will look very old-fashioned. As cancer treatment becomes more complex – a lot more complex – it will be ever more important that patients have some idea of how to navigate these new shoals.Yet modern culture loathes complexity. Populism – the claim that there are easy answers to difficult problems – is surging around the world. Build a wall, leave the EU, ignore doctors: this is the high season of snake-oil salesmen selling bogus tonics off a cart to punters who crave an easy solution to problems of great subtlety and nuance. The desire for simplicity is a natural human instinct. Confronted by the kaleidoscopic multiplicity of contemporary life, we heed those who promise to make everything better with the flourish of a wand. But one of the tasks of true leadership – in all fields – is to explain that simplicity is not always possible, decreasingly so.It is part of the maturation of our species that we accept that immigration is not the cause of our social ills, that the Earth is not (as a growing number of people believe) flat, and that carrot juice absolutely cannot cure cancer. It is time to put aside childish things."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fde237f595d8ac4d4db85e52f3fabd4ab0b46019/0_0_3035_1819/master/3035.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3480581a2bf5b0b021b3def0fa0277a8 700w","title":"denver nuggets where to eat and drink in colorados capital","story":"From the best pizza to the finest brewpubs, if there’s a restaurant or bar worth knowing in the Mile High City then chances are that local food doyen Kade Gianinetti has tried it out.

That they are not more widely known is partly because the amount of money going to schools for pupils under 16 was protected until 2015. Only by taking into account large reductions in spending on sixth forms, and by local authorities, was the independent Institute of Fiscal Studies able to present a more complete picture of the budget pressures faced by schools, in a report this\u0026nbspmonth.Damian Hinds had only been education secretary for a month when his Labour shadow, Angela Rayner, reported him to the UK Statistics Authority for making the incorrect claim that “real-terms funding per pupil is increasing across the system”. The mistake was corrected, and six months into the job Mr Hinds has now recognised not only that school budgets are being cut, but that such cuts are unsustainable and destructive. Last Friday he told the  he is fighting for additional funds from the Treasury amid ongoing negotiations about a pay rise for teachers, who have fallen behind those in other developed countries as public sector pay has been squeezed under the government’s austerity programme.Mr Hinds is correct that there is a “special case” to be made for school funding because educating the next generation is so important, and his frankness about problems, including teacher workload and exam stress, is welcome. Chancellor Philip Hammond should pay more attention to his measured bid than to recent grandstanding by the defence secretary, Gavin Williamson, who is similarly eager to secure a bigger budget. Teachers should get a pay rise not only because they deserve one, but because schools are dealing with a recruitment and retention crisis, with the Ofsted chief, Amanda Spielman, among those highlighting the risk of experienced staff “burning\u0026nbspout”.It is a relief that the focus has shifted to the more urgent problems confronting schools across the country. But the promise to let grammar schools expand, and allow free schools to operate highly restrictive admissions policies, must not be forgotten. Austerity has caused serious problems in education. But so has the government’s ideological, market-based approach, with its explicit drive to create winners and losers, and drive improvement through competition rather than cooperation. Free schools, and in particular studio schools, have been a fiasco, while the academies programme has consumed vast resources and failed to deliver.The flagship coalition policy of the pupil premium meant poorer and more vulnerable children were offered some protection from these effects. Recent rises in exclusions and “off-rolling”, whereby children are voluntary removed at a school’s urging, along with cuts to special needs provision and moves against inclusive education, show the extent to which such protections have been stripped out, while the extent of mental illness and unhappiness among young people is deeply worrying. Mr Hinds may have grasped some of the problems facing schools. But he has offered no solution."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cc98ecc5b65354e78f5c99acede4880ea5cbfdc3/0_400_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5cf4c646a2fe7f4446a44f867dd2c775","title":"mamma mia here we go again review","story":"This slick sequel delivers sharp one-liners, joyously contrived plot twists and an emotional punch that left our critic reeling…Watching the original Mamma Mia! in 2008, I had something approaching an out-of-body experience. Having initially scoffed at everything from the contrived join-the-pop songs plot to Pierce Brosnan’s unique vocal stylings, I felt my feathery inner self depart from my dour exterior and start dancing in the aisles. One minute I was a miserable critic the next, everything had gone pink and fluffy. As I said at the time, never before had something so wrong felt so right.A decade later, this sequel-prequel hybrid (a surprisingly smart combination) produces similarly head-spinning results. In the 1979 sequences, Lily James plays the young Donna, graduating from Oxford (via a High School Musical-style rendition of When I Kissed the Teacher) before heading off on an endless holiday wherein she will try on a pair of dungarees and a trio of handsome suitors. Meanwhile, in the present, Amanda Seyfried’s Sophie is striving to fulfil her mother’s vision (she had a dream!) with the newly renovated Hotel Bella Donna, while wrestling with the prospect of history repeating itself on this idyllic island.As we flip-flop through the singalong hi-jinks, Hugh Skinner, Josh Dylan and Jeremy Irvine grow up to become Colin Firth, Stellan Skarsgård and Pierce Brosnan, while Jessica Keenan Wynn and Alexa Davies prove dab hands at essaying younger incarnations of dynamic duo Christine Baranski and Julie Walters.Taking over the directorial reins, Ol Parker (who made Imagine Me \u0026amp You and the underrated Now Is Good) delivers a slicker package than Phyllida Lloyd’s record-breaking original, full of elegant camera moves, snappy choreography and mirrored shots juxtaposing disparate frames, both temporal and spatial. Alongside Parker, the credited writers include Richard Curtis, who may or may not be responsible for such post-Four Weddings zingers as “Be still my beating vagina” and “It’s called karma and it’s pronounced ‘Ha!”’Yet as before, the real pleasure comes from the sublime agony of hearing your favourite Abba tunes crowbarred into the narrative in increasingly preposterous ways. Occasionally the twists are subtle (the whoopingly affirmative “woh woh woh” of Waterloo briefly becomes a commanding “whoa” – as in “stop!” – during a restaurant seduction scene). More often they’re laugh-out-loud ludicrous (the scene in which Cher calls Andy Garcia’s Señor Cienfuegos by his first name evokes Ben Elton’s script for We Will Rock You). Crucially, such creaks appear to be entirely knowing, encouraging us to laugh with the story, rather than at it – something I’m not entirely sure was true of the original stage musical and film.It helps that the ensemble cast are extremely likable and admirably game the lyrics to Dancing Queen may insist that “you can dance, you can jive”, but the fact that many of the men can do neither of the above doesn’t stop them from having the time of their lives anyway. By contrast, the women are on top form – from Lily James, who could charm the birds from the trees with her song-and-dance skills, to Julie Walters, whose brand of note-perfect physical comedy (it’s all in the expressions and gestures) proves a reliable delight. Meanwhile, Omid Djalili is a scene-stealing hoot as a withering customs and passport control officer (NB: stay to the very end of the credits).None of this would mean a thing if Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again didn’t also pack an emotional punch, and I feel duty-bound to report that I came out of the screening an utter wreck. The tears started early, as James and co danced around a cameoing Björn Ulvaeus, then flowed freely as the hits continued, climaxing in a Dunkirk-style flotilla routine complete with a cheeky nod to Titanic, the film that the original Mamma Mia! famously outperformed at the UK box office.Yet having always believed that Abba’s greatest song was a melancholy gem from the Arrival LP, it was the spine-tingling reworking of My Love, My Life that hit me hardest. I wasn’t just crying – I was convulsing with tears, desperately trying to stop myself from audibly sobbing. Seriously, the end of Apocalypse Now proved less traumatic.Much has changed in the 10 years since Mamma Mia! challenged my ideas of “good” and “bad” film-making. I have certainly mellowed, and perhaps my critical faculties have withered and died. But I simply can’t imagine how Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again could be any better than it is. I loved it to pieces and I can’t wait to go again!"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db395978ad1bef6be6669cfdb44a7f3404226ea4/0_0_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d7191d7d497e289ecf55b6246e348002","title":"france croatia final trophy russia 2018 ends on high world cup football daily","story":"Max and co discuss France’s World Cup final triumph over Croatia, another penalty, another controversial VAR incident, the tournament’s highs and lows and players taking shots to the conkers"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58d353e78a8bff6b999e8e367cb556f60251e6d8/0_53_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8cd5631c0d0bb309ae0a944720f14332","title":"branching out how four years of woodwork transformed an east london home","story":"Birch ply, spruce and cedar have rekindled a warm wooden glow in this old London terraceSee that yellow bucket,” says Jemima Garthwaite, pointing to a photograph on her screen. “Every time I had a shower or washed my hands in the bathroom, I’d have to come downstairs, carry it outside and pour it down a drain in the garden.” We are flicking through a folder of images called “During”, as Garthwaite recalls the gruelling process of renovating and extending her home in east London. The bucket sat under a waste pipe in the middle of what is now her kitchen. “It went on for weeks. That was the least fun element of living here.”“And this – believe it or not – is when the builders left.” She shows me a sorry image of the kitchen extension: unplastered, unfurnished, unfinished. “I’d run out of money. I had to do the rest myself.” Garthwaite trained as an architect (“the most over-glamourised industry ever”), so she had a clear sense of what needed doing. Even so, it took her four years to finish what the builders had started. “I worked evenings and weekends. I’d even come home during my lunch break to chisel for half an hour.”When Garthwaite bought the house seven years ago it was a small two-up, two-down Victorian terrace with a dog-leg kitchen. The previous owners had kept many of the original features and managed to legally double the size of the garden by “squatting” an unused patch of land behind the property for years. With such generous outside space, it made sense for Garthwaite to add a full-width extension to the ground floor.At the time, her friend Tom Kaneko was living with her. He specialises in small-scale residential projects. Together, they started to think about what that extension might look like. Garthwaite – who is the founder and director of the creative agency This Here – would spend her lunch breaks with a roll of tracing paper, perfecting the floorplan, which she would take home and share with Kaneko.Natural light became a major preoccupation. With every full-width extension, there is a risk that the centre of the house – the room that connects the old with the new – becomes dark and uninhabitable. To overcome this, Kaneko introduced the idea of an interior garden that would pool light on three sides. But this proved too expensive. “It was cheaper to have one roof light than three walls, so the space is now used as a bright office.” A further two roof lights, bi-fold doors and a picture window were added to the extension, which was clad internally with spruce and externally in cedar.Sightlines were another guiding principle. Kaneko wanted the garden to be visible from the front door, so there is a generous passageway that connects the original building with the new extension. Even the bespoke birch-ply kitchen was designed in such a way that it doesn’t obstruct the picture window. The result is a seamless flow between the two spaces.Though connected, there is a distinction between the original Victorian rooms and the new addition. Garthwaite has furnished the living room with eBay finds and items handed down from her family. The furniture and floors are warm and wooden, the sofa and chairs have been re-upholstered in linen and leather, the open fire is flanked by fitted cupboards lined with layers of exposed original wallpaper and Penguin classics. By comparison, the kitchen extension has a concrete floor. A deep window seat is upholstered in a loud palm print and a set of copper chairs glints around the dining table. House plants creep up the exposed timber rafters towards the pitched roof. It’s a relaxed, summery foil to the formality at the front of the house.Throughout, there’s evidence of Garthwaite’s hard graft. She has sanded and repaired the original floorboards, exposed brick walls and repaired the pointing with porous lime mortar. The unpolished concrete floor in the kitchen was poured by hand. (“When a crack appears, I’ll sit down with a bag of cement and a chisel and a hammer, and I’ll fix it.”) The result is not only a happy, handbuilt home: the whole experience has become the genesis of a new business idea.“Building this house has made me realise the issues with the British wood industry,” explains Garthwaite. “I was broke when I did this, so my kitchen was clad in cheap, imported Sitka spruce and cedar, because finding a British alternative was almost impossible.” Like the crack in her concrete floor, Garthwaite is fixing this gap by creating One Thing Well, an online marketplace for British timber that connects woodland owners with sawmills, who can then sell their stock directly to contractors and architects.Her research has led her to the discovery of a thermal-treated British wood ideal for external cladding. “I keep thinking I’d like to have some here,” she muses. “It would only take a day to reclad the extension. It’s not complicated…”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6776f4031b8ba02b2076404d120865af373d5fd8/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f2630fff7dde6ad5a13d6d3ca5edacf3","title":"i was taunted for having two mums in the 1980s","story":"It was a dangerous time, but my lesbian parents paved the wayJeers of “Lara the Lezzie” accompanied me as I walked down the hallway. A girl at school had outed my family to the entire class. It wasn’t easy being the daughter of lesbians in the 1980s. Many of my friends’ parents had married right out of high school and started families shortly thereafter. LGBT families were just starting to become visible and my family was one of the first. This was before the first child was conceived through in vitro fertilisation in Manchester in 1978. Back then, children of LGBT parents were mostly the result of heterosexual unions, or occasional liaisons between lesbians and gay men with the intent of procreation.In my case, my father and mother orced when I was still in nappies, for reasons that had nothing to do with my mother’s sexuality. She went back to college and became active in the feminist movement of the 1970s, and once she found her voice she couldn’t imagine going back to a subservient role with a husband. She calls herself a “political lesbian” because for her, dating women was as much about finding her own feminist strength as it was about anything else. When I was three, my mother fell in love with Pat, a woman who had known she was gay since she was 12, if not earlier. In terms of the “born gay” versus “become gay” argument, I have one parent in each camp.We all moved in together in 1977, when I was three. It was not a great time to be a lesbian in upstate New York. We had good reason to hide. One threat that was always hanging over our heads was that of custody – in the 1970s, courts routinely took children away from lesbian and gay parents. When my father fell behind on his child support, my mother didn’t dare take him to court. She had much more to lose than he did. So we tied our shoelaces back together and reused our lunch bags. Dad never complained about my mother’s sexuality, and for that we were grateful.Pat once appeared in an interview on TV and was identified as a lesbian, though her face was blurred and her name wasn’t given. However, they didn’t disguise her voice and she was fired from her job the next day. My parents couldn’t risk that happening again. My brother and I had to lie to school friends and be very careful about who we invited over. It was a heavy weight for us to bear, and I for one didn’t do a very good job of it. I had told different stories to different people, and I couldn’t keep them all straight. Every time I confided in someone, I felt as if I was betraying my family. But there are always two ways to look at a situation. Most people had never encountered lesbians before, or, if they had, they didn’t know it. Yet, both my mothers were welcomed at school concerts. No one ever told my mother’s partner that she wasn’t allowed to attend parent-teacher meetings. Most of the girls at school were allowed to play with me – and even spend the night at my house. I’m sure some, if not all, of the parents knew what was going on, but by and large people gave us the benefit of the doubt. Children, however, seem prone to notice any differences or inconsistencies and to pounce on them. By the time I was eight, the holes in my cover story were showing, and by the time I was 12 everyone at school knew the truth. I was already an outcast for my unstylish clothes, braces, glasses and bad hair. My mothers’ sexuality just gave my tormenters a better way to harass me. This was a time when gay slurs weren’t even considered foul language by most people. So it wasn’t surprising that teachers didn’t get involved when the other kids called me a lezzie, lesbian, lesbo, or fag. To them, it wasn’t any different to calling someone an idiot.To me, it was very different. I was a girly-girl: I played with dolls and loved the colour pink and wanted to be a princess or a ballerina. I wrote fan letters to Beau and Luke Duke of The Dukes of Hazzard, which I sprayed with perfume before mailing. Being called a lesbian seemed patently unfair, yet I had no defence against it. “Maybe you really are a lesbian, just like your mother.” These words were spat at me in the locker room after gym class by someone I considered one of my closest friends. Her words echoed the same questions my high school friends’ parents – mostly fathers – asked me, “Do you ever think you’re a lesbian like your mother?”I always had a boyfriend to offer as proof of my heterosexuality. I didn’t tell anyone that I felt a tingle when I looked at female models on the cover of fashion magazines or that I secretly feared I was a latent lesbian or at least bisexual. I fought against any feelings that might mean I wasn’t entirely straight. In my young mind, being gay was about the worst thing that could happen to someone. All I knew was that I wanted to feel safe and just as good as everyone else. I wanted to blend in.At 20, I married the most stereotypical male I could find – a bald biker who played hockey and watched football. I took his last name and tried to fit into his world. I was mainstream, just like everyone else, and I thought I had finally found someone who would protect me from the world. I didn’t realise that aspiring to be just like everyone else wasn’t my better self, and that while he protected me from other people, there was no one to protect me from him.In 2000, I got orced and moved to Key West, Florida, where my mothers and brother were then living. It was a welcoming community made up of gay and straight people. No one particularly cared about my parents’ sexuality or even found it very interesting. For the first time, I could be proud of my family. My mother wrote a column in the gay newspaper, and everyone knew they were a couple. We went to a gay church, attended weekly bingo at a gay bar. I told my boss and my friends at work about my parents’ sexual orientation. No one cared – gay or straight. It was only then that I allowed myself to even question if I liked girls or not. When there was no pressure to be straight, I was able to come to terms with being bisexual. I dated a few women, but in the end, married another man. At our wedding, both my mothers walked me down the aisle.Now that I’m in my 40s, several childhood acquaintances have contacted me on Facebook. They want me to know how important it was to them to have known a queer family, and how it helped them be more open when members of their own family – sometimes their own children – came out to them. I like to think families like mine helped pave the way for the ones who came after. I do believe that the world is changing. I have two sons, and none of their friends or their friends’ parents have made any negative comment about the two grandmas at their birthday parties or school concerts. My kids don’t understand why anyone would even care. But they are growing up in a different time.In 2000, the Netherlands became the first country to legalise same-sex unions. Belgium was next in 2003, then Canada and Spain in 2005. Soon Iceland, Norway, New Zealand, England, Wales and Scotland joined in. By 2017, Australia, Germany and Austria followed suit. As of December 2017, 29 countries have legalised same-sex marriage. As soon as Canada legalised same-sex marriage in 2005, my mothers drove across the border to legally marry in Niagara Falls, Canada. My eldest son, still in nappies, played with his trucks at my mothers’ feet during the ceremony. Ten years later, same-sex marriage was legalised in the United States as well.Research is beginning to show that being raised by parents in same-sex marriages does not have the negative outcome that people feared. As the Washington Post reported in 2014, according to researchers at the University of Melbourne, “the quality of parenting and families’ economic wellbeing was more important than sexual orientation”.The world isn’t perfect, and many children of LGBT parents still suffer from bullying. But as adults’ attitudes change, kindness is trickling down to the next generation. The change in attitude is best reflected in a conversation a lesbian friend overheard between her 12-year-old and his friend.“So, I hear your mom’s a lesbian,” the friend said.“My mom’s queen of the lesbians!” the son responded, and they went off to skateboard with no further conversation needed.Girlish: Growing Up in a Lesbian Home by Lara Lillibridge is published by Skyhorse Publishing at £18.99"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/604ad61332ee65d3e71133edb0c19babc8d1b298/0_73_1732_1039/master/1732.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f60de76ef032bd89e591f3b5996cc427","title":"the plays the thing five fabulous audio dramas not to miss this summer","story":"With audio content exploding in popularity, a raft of gripping stories told by multiple narrators is just a few clicks away. Coco Khan picks out some of the bestA conversation can speak volumes and in the world of audio dramas, they often do. The audio drama – a piece of fiction told using several voices – is in the midst of a renaissance. Previously consigned to rare radio slots on rainy Sundays, audio dramas are now ubiquitous, buoyed by audience tastes for podcasts, and attracting some of the world’s most exciting writers and actors.These are professional, high-quality productions – think Netflix for your ears. And like Netflix, Audible has begun commissioning original audio dramas, making them free for members, putting an end to the bottleneck in which many creatives vie for one radio slot (and a broadcaster therefore has to pick the one with broadest appeal). Audio dramas run the gamut, whether you want a tear-jerking tragedy, an edge-of-your-seat thriller, or a heart-fluttering romance. With such variety, they make for perfect accompaniments to your summer holidays, whether you’ve got a long-haul backpacking trip planned, or a short and swift city break lined up.But with so many options, where do you begin?We picked out five of the best audio dramas from Audible, so you don’t have to. All you have to worry about is whether or not you can resist binge-listening your weekend away.The Child “My name is Simon. I’m 10 years old. I’m a serial killer.” So begins Sebastian Fitzek’s chilling tale of a boy who claims to have killed in a previous life. Set in Berlin, the story follows the child and the only people who believe his cryptic utterings – his mother and a lawyer she has hired. But when Simon’s knowledge leads to several bodies being discovered, the police start to suspect the lawyer. He must solve the crimes before the police put him in the frame, no matter what it takes. Fitzek is one of Germany’s most lauded crime-thriller writers and has seen his work translated into 20 languages. His talents are at their height in this intricate, spine-tingling adaptation. The fabulous narrators include Emilia Fox (Polanski’s The Pianist) and Rupert Penry-Jones (Spooks).Northanger Abbey If audio dramas are having a renaissance, Northanger Abbey might be the Sistine Chapel. A slick, star-studded adaptation of Jane Austen’s classic, this ambitious production has redefined audio storytelling – which is to be expected, given the cast. National treasure and Bafta award-winning actress Emma Thompson tops the bill, bringing Austen’s dry wit to life, while supporting performances from Lily Cole and Jeremy Irvine elevate the series to GOAT (greatest of all time) level. This coming-of-age story follows 17-year-old Catherine Morland through love, danger and intrigue, satirising the gothic tales that were popular at the time of writing, while taking a shrewd look at the British class system. Such skewering of high society feels as fresh as ever. Even those put off by historical drama will find joy in this.Neverwhere Nobody anticipated the impact the BBC’s 2013 adaptation of Neil Gaiman’s cult novel by the same name would have. Broadcast over six days, the production was a smash hit with Gaiman fans and non-fans alike, propelling the audio play into the public eye and showing just how exciting the form can be. Download to listen to Benedict Cumberbatch, David Harewood, James McAvoy and Natalie Dormer telling the story of Richard Mayhew, the unassuming Londoner who finds himself in London Below, a magical version of – and coexisting with – the real city, known as London Above. Originally conceived as a television series, Neverwhere lends itself to episodes, and so its separation into six parts feels natural and seamless. And on Audible it includes over 25 minutes of additional unbroadcasted material, including extended scenes, bloopers and outtakes.Rudyard Kipling’s The Jungle Book: The Mowgli Stories One for the slightly older kids (and also the parents), The Mowgli Stories brings together all of Kipling’s tales about the boy raised by animals in the jungle. Though the average listener might think they know all there is to know about Mowgli from the much-loved Disney film, his adventure takes many more twists and turns. This retelling of the timeless classic stays true to Kipling’s darker side and the well-known cast, including comedian Bill Bailey and actors Richard E Grant and Celia Imrie, make this one unforgettable audio drama. A must-listen for anyone who has seen the film, and a brilliant, truthful, introduction to the work of Kipling for those who haven’t.Locke \u0026amp Key One of Audible’s first forays into commissioning original audio dramas is still among the most ambitious undertakings the form has seen. Locke \u0026amp Key began life as a graphic novel – so translating the form from highly visual to solely audio was no small feat. To do so, Audible drafted in Locke \u0026amp Key’s creators, Joe Hill and Gabriel Rodriguez, to ensure the adaptation stayed true to its dark, terrifying roots. And it worked, assisted no doubt by the voice of scream queen Tatiana Maslany (Orphan Black) and Haley Joel Osment of “I see dead people” fame. Locke \u0026amp Key follows a family who, starting over after a tragedy, set themselves up in a quiet town that is also frequented by demons. A sharp production that will have you jumping out of your skin and sleeping with one eye open.Your first audiobook is free with a 30-day trial from Audible - £7.99 a month after 30 days.

That position is echoed in Berlin and Paris, among other EU capitals.Article 50 can only be extended by the unanimous agreement of the 27 other member states, and on the request of the withdrawing state, which May has already said she is not prepared to do.On Friday, Barnier picked apart the UK’s white paper, complaining that it would leave the EU open to fraud and burden European businesses with extra bureaucracy.He told reporters he had offered to hold intensive talks with the new Brexit secretary, Dominic Raab, to find a solution to the problem of avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland, without which there will not be a withdrawal agreement. understands that during a meeting of EU ministers with Barnier on Friday, astonishment was expressed at May’s comments in Belfast earlier in the day in which she accused the EU of seeking to constitutionally and economically “dislocate” the UK.“We want to de-dramatise this, talk it all down, and so there was surprise at the aggressive tone,” one diplomat said. “It just gives her even less room for manoeuvre. If she wants to give up, she should just say so.”But while the negotiations have rarely looked so in danger of failing, senior EU officials and diplomats do not see any purpose in an extension to article 50, the two-year negotiating period set aside for a member withdrawing from the union, unless there is a change in British politics that can offer genuine hope of a better outcome.“If it is time just for the sake of putting off an inevitable no deal, then it will not happen,” one senior diplomat involved in the negotiations said.Charles Grant, the director of the Centre for European Reform thinktank, said that following his discussions with French government officials and the commission it was clear that a high bar would be set for an extension.“If there is a very good reason for it, then fine,” he said. “But if it is just because a deal hasn’t been agreed, then that’s not going to be fine. The commission and the French government say they are relaxed about a no deal, although I am not sure they are.”The issue had yet to be formally discussed among those involved in the EU-UK negotiations, but informal discussions suggest there is limited appetite for such a development, sources in Brussels added.“You have 27 member states who have to agree to it and I can’t see them all doing so. There will always be someone who is awkward, and wants something out of it. Spain might want to make a point about Gibraltar, for example,” said one diplomat involved in the Brexit negotiations.“We have spent the GDP of Greece in terms of manpower in trying to first of all keep the Brits in and now negotiate on their exit. Even if the UK asked for it, and that seems unlikely, it would need a compelling reason to be given.”Mujtaba Rahman, a former Treasury and European commission official, and now head of Europe for the Eurasia Group risk consultancy, said: “An extension can’t be an end in itself. It would need to come with political change in Westminster, a referendum, change of leader or general election, otherwise negotiations would risk remaining deadlocked. That’s the view of the commission, the European council, Berlin and Paris.”Rahman said the European parliament would be opposed to an extension as it would play well for European populists, including Ukip, who could point to the failure of the political classes to respect the 2016 referendum result.Officials in the parliament have taken legal advice, which suggests that extending article 50 beyond the next European elections in May would not only give 73 British MEPs a right to sit in the chamber until the UK leaves but for the full five-year term.Asked about the possibility of an extension of article 50, a senior British cabinet source said there had been no conversations within the government on the topic. He added that ministers were aware that such a request would likely prompt a collective “cardiac arrest” among leaders of member states."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9dd3d75545e666f5c1d7c1bbf857a0db2e55376d/185_34_6352_3811/master/6352.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=097802b7d535f9e34bc92bddcc7ebaa0","title":"jacob rees mogg second irish fund scm","story":"New fund was created to meet demand from international investors, according to SCMA second investment fund has been set up in Ireland by the City firm co-founded by Jacob Rees-Mogg, after it warned earlier this year about the financial dangers of the sort of hard Brexit favoured by the Conservative MP.The fund, which is backed by $50m (£38m) in seed money from the Swedish national pension plan, was created to meet demand from international investors, according to Somerset Capital Management (SCM).Uncertainty over the UK’s stance on withdrawal from the EU and the potential impact on banking and related services has led asset managers based in London to establish new financial products in European financial hubs including Dublin and Frankfurt.A spokesperson for SCM said that for many years it had plans to launch a dedicated strategy for UK and European investors, saying: “Our decision to choose Ireland as a domicile had absolutely nothing to do with Brexit. We have funds domiciled all over the world including in Europe, the US and Australasia, and we will continue to offer a global service to our client base.”In March, SCM described Brexit as a risk in a prospectus to a new fund, which has been marketed to international investors who want to keep their money in the EU long-term.The disclosures have been used by political opponents of Rees-Mogg, who has been working part-time at Somerset Capital in addition to his work as an MP and who has repeatedly dismissed the concerns of those worried about the financial risks of Brexit.On Saturday, Rees-Mogg said Britain was heading for a no-deal exit from the EU but said falling back on World Trade Organization terms was “nothing to be frightened of”.Rees-Mogg chairs the European Research Group, which continues to put pressure on the prime minister to adopt a more antagonistic stance towards Brussels as the UK negotiates its exit from the EU."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/740e7c639c686198606dee304d857ec70b3e26d8/0_390_5772_3466/master/5772.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ccd50516aa3f68343053ea965fbf746d","title":"labour should drop action against margaret hodge mcdonnell","story":"Jeremy Corbyn defends inquiry into Hodge for calling him antisemiticLabour should drop its disciplinary inquiry into Dame Margaret Hodge for calling Jeremy Corbyn an antisemite, the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, has said.As Corbyn defended the inquiry, McDonnell, his close friend and ally, said that if it could not be abandoned, the Hodge investigation should be resolved very quickly because it was best to “move on”.“Sometimes you can express anger – I’m one of these people who has in the past – and basically you have to accept that sometimes people can be quite heated in their expressions. Let’s understand that and just move on.”Hodge called Corbyn an “antisemitic racist” in an angry row in the House of Commons on Tuesday after Labour’s national executive committee refused to abandon a controversial new code of conduct on antisemitism. The code features the internationally accepted International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) definition of antisemitism, but does not replicate in full a list of examples of antisemitism published by the IHRA alongside its definition.After Hodge made the comment, a spokesman for Corbyn said it was unacceptable and that action would be taken. This provoked anger from Corbyn’s critics in the party, not least because Hodge, a former minister and former chair of the public accounts committee, is a respected figure.McDonnell told Sky: “Someone has made a complaint so that’s being investigated. My view is let’s resolve this very, very quickly, almost drop the complaint, and let’s move on. Or if someone wants their complaint investigated, let’s get that done quickly.”Corbyn took a less conciliatory view when he was asked about the Hodge incident in an interview at the Tolpuddle Martyrs festival in Dorset.“I felt not pleased about it,” he said. “I felt upset about it, but as always I am very calm and treat people with a great deal of respect. I don’t shout at people, I just listen to what they have to say.“A complaint has been registered and that will have to be dealt with by the party, but that is independent of me.” Labour’s code of conduct includes a section listing only some of the examples of antisemitism published by the IHRA alongside its definition. The four missing examples are: accusing Jewish people of being more loyal to Israel than their home country claiming that Israel’s existence as a state is a racist endeavour requiring higher standards of behaviour from Israel than other nations and comparing contemporary Israeli policies to those of the Nazis.But Labour says it is wrong to say that these examples have been left out, because all of them are covered by other parts of the code. For example, there is a section that specifically states: “It is wrong to accuse Jewish citizens of being more loyal to Israel, or to the alleged priorities of Jews worldwide, than to the interests of their own nations.”At a meeting of the parliamentary Labour party on Monday some MPs and peers are planning to push an emergency motion saying the PLP should adopt the full IHRA definition of antisemitism, “including all of its accompanying examples”, in what would be seen as a rebuke to Corbyn.The Labour leader said he hoped the debate would be delayed until the autumn because, with the summer recess starting on Tuesday, attendance might be limited.“I’d rather they delayed that discussion until September because there will be a full attendance at meetings in September,” he said. “I also think MPs should get full notice of that issue, but obviously the parliamentary party is quite free to debate it but, as with all functions of the Labour party, ultimately, standing orders must be approved by the national executive committee and that cannot happen until the autumn.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8d250079751d1ee89e3daf134b579ddceb545d61/0_358_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=97e68ebdd9c7568b99194c38424d3390","title":"thats when i lost my temper ash sarkar on her clash with piers morgan","story":"The activist who confronted the Good Morning Britain presenter talks about her fears over Brexit, the future of communism in Britain and her passion for SpursWriter, lecturer and activist Ash Sarkar, 26, grew up in north London and got two degrees at UCL. She is now senior editor at radical leftwing website Novara Media, focusing on race, gender, class and power. Footage went viral last week after she appeared on ITV’s Good Morning Britain to discuss the Stop Trump march, telling presenter Piers Morgan: “I’m literally a communist, you idiot.”How is your newfound fame?Surreal. I’m punch-drunk but still alive. Before, I’d maybe get recognised a couple of times per week now it’s most places I go. What if I’m really hungover and gross one day? Or having a PMS cry on the bus? But everyone’s unerringly lovely and just wants to chat about politics, which is encouraging. It shows there’s a real desire for engagement and conversation that doesn’t treat people like they’re stupid.Do you think there’s a trend towards shouty, adversarial media?Yes, although there’s a huge contrast between Newsnight, where you can make a point clearly, and Good Morning Britain, where you’re entering a bear pit to get savaged. Piers Morgan and the production team have tacked quite hard towards the alt-right. A leftwing Muslim woman is like throwing chum to them.How did you feel when Piers Morgan kept talking over you?He kept trying to pin me down on Obama’s presidency, even though I’d come on to talk about Trump, with the presumption that I was a diehard Democrat. That’s when I lost my temper. I hadn’t planned to call him an idiot or go in hard about his journalistic record. I was just frustrated with being barracked for something I’m not.Have you had more TV offers?Celebrity Big Brother asked me to go on. I said, “Listen, there are much easier ways to see me get drunk, alienate people and have an ill-advised dry hump. Just find me on a Saturday night out.” I could become a tap-dancing poodle in the culture wars, but is that going to get more people participating in politics or just make me a discourse clown?Do you feel you should capitalise on your higher profile?It’s not about personally profiting I want people to support the media organisation I work for. Since Good Morning Britain, I’ve had lots of emails from weird men asking if I can “fin-dom” them – financially dominate them by spending all their money. It’s unsettling, so I’ve been replying with the link to our donations page. We’re selling “I’m literally a communist” T-shirts to help keep the studio running.It was also on placards at the Stop Trump march. How was that?I bumped into some of them. This is what people have been missing: politics shouldn’t be about the dour cultishness and pomposity that dominated the left for decades – it should be joyful and exuberant. Your Twitter bio uses the phrases “anarcho-fabulous” and “luxury communism”. Can you explain?It’s partly poking fun at how people accrue adjectives and put them in their bios as if they’re a meaningful badge. But also, my communism isn’t about authoritarian bureaucracy, suppressing freedom or everyone wearing burlap sacks. It’s about the desire to see the coercive structures of state dismantled, while also having fun. It’s not about driving everybody down to the same level of abjection, but making aesthetic pleasures and luxuries available to all.How do you envisage communism working in 21st-century Britain?As a long-termist, I acknowledge there are more pressing causes than the abolition of private property. This is why I’m a Corbyn supporter. We have the opportunity for a socialism that says austerity is a deliberate political choice. We can more equitably distribute wealth through taxation. We can borrow to invest in housing, railways and healthcare, making them publicly owned and managed assets. That’s what we’ve got room for in this country right now. Communist vision can help guide that and give people a say in every decision that affects their lives.Is it possible to support Corbyn but still feel betrayed by him over Brexit?I voted Remain but the cost of losing twice would be catastrophic. It would make life difficult for people of colour or anyone perceived as an immigrant. If you want any hope of staying in the EU, or having a Brexit that doesn’t mean capitulation to ethno-nationalism, you’ve got to tie it to a wider vision of political and economic transformation. Which, at this point, means backing Corbyn.You’re a big football fan, right?Huge. I’m a diehard Spurs supporter who gets her heart broken again and again. I love terrace culture, the flow of the game and those moments of beauty like Zidane’s volley where you just think: “That is God speaking through you, my son.” I became obsessed with Jordan Pickford during the World Cup. Mainly how he looked like Thomas Turgoose from This Is England.Is it true you’ve never knowingly kissed a Tory?Absolutely. I make it my business to check.

Tim Farron, the former Lib Dem leader, was also absent.It is understood that no MPs from other parties, and no donors, were at the dinner, where Cable and others were engaged in a wide-ranging discussion on how Brexit was contributing to a realignment in UK politics – an issue of particular interest to the Lib Dem leader.In his interview, Cable said reports claiming the creation of a new centre-ground party was discussed at the dinner were “not correct”. But he defended talking to people in other parties, saying it was “part of the job”.Without going into details of what was discussed, Cable said he was sceptical of the case for setting up a new party.“It’s much better to work constructively with people in other parties.”Asked if he would ever join a new party, he said he would not “because I’ve got a very good party of my own which is winning some of the key arguments”. But he said he was in favour of parties collaborating, as the Lib Dems and the Greens did in Richmond, his local council, where they struck a deal over seats at the local elections.Cable said his priority was to work with other parties to stop Brexit but that in the longer term he expected to see a realignment of politics.He continued: “The tensions building up in the Labour party and the Conservative party are so severe that it’s difficult to see them surviving in their present form, and we have to think ahead a little bit. And my party will play a key role in whatever happens.”In his interview, Cable described as “ridiculous” claims that his leadership of the Lib Dems was at risk. Some Lib Dem activists are reportedly planning to discuss replacing Cable at a meeting this week, but Cable dismissed the notion that his position was under threat, saying this was “the last thing” he was worried about.“Unlike Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn for different reasons, I’m in the fortunate position of having a united, cohesive team of people,” he said. Under his leadership, the party was going forward, he said.“It’s not spectacular, but I think we’ve made very good, solid progress, and my colleagues recognise that. And we’ve had record levels of membership which has held up and is still growing, as far as I’m aware. So it’s a good story.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2bfba946b166e255f8a32236a4547a122ec26e89/255_46_3245_1948/master/3245.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5f12c2eaa20b47abf8eb2956ef9142c0","title":"universal credit it system broken service centre whistleblowers say","story":"Service centre staff say glitches having harmful effect on huge number of claimantsUniversal credit is so riddled with design flaws and process faults that it is practically guaranteed to generate mistakes and delays that would push vulnerable benefit claimants into hardship, according to whistleblowers.Service centre workers have told the  that glitches and errors in the “cobbled-together” system have commonly led to claimants’ benefit payments being delayed for weeks or wrongly reduced by hundreds of pounds.One said: “The IT system on which universal credit is built is so fundamentally broken and poorly designed that it guarantees severe problems with claims.”He said the system was overcomplex and prone to errors that affected payments and often proved slow to correct. “In practical terms, it is not working the way it was intended and it is having an actively harmful effect on a huge number of claimants.” Universal credit (UC) is the supposed flagship reform of the benefits system, rolling together six benefits (including unemployment and benefits, and tax credits) into one, online-only system. The theoretical aim, for which there was general support across the political spectrum, was to simplify the system and increase the incentives for people to move off benefits into work.The project was legislated for in 2011 under the auspices of its most vocal champion, Iain Duncan Smith. The plan was to roll it out by 2017. However, a series of\u0026nbspmanagement failures, expensive\u0026nbspIT blunders and design faults\u0026nbsp means it is six years behind schedule and rollout will not be complete until 2023.The original design set out\u0026nbsp a\u0026nbspminimum 42-day wait for a first payment\u0026nbspto claimants when they moved to UC (in practice this is often up to 60 days). After sustained pressure, the government announced in the autumn 2017 budget that the wait would be reduced to 35 days from February 2018. This will partially mitigate the impact on many claimants of having no income for six weeks. The wait has led to\u0026nbsprent arrears and evictions, hunger (food banks in UC areas report\u0026nbspnotable increases in referrals), use of expensive credit and mental distress.\u0026nbspMinisters have expanded the availability of hardship loans (now repayable over a year) to help new claimants while they wait for payment. Housing benefit will now continue for an extra two weeks after the start of a UC claim. However, critics say the five-week wait is still too long and want it reduced to two or three weeks.Plenty.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspMultibillion-pound cuts to work allowances\u0026nbspimposed by the former chancellor George Osborne mean UC is far less generous than originally envisaged. According to the Resolution Foundation thinktank, about 2.5m low-income working households will be more than £1,000 a year worse off when they move to UC, reducing work incentives. Landlords are worried that the level of rent arrears accrued by tenants on UC could lead to a rise in evictions. It\u0027s also not very user-friendly: claimants complain the system is complex, unreliable and difficult to manage, particularly if you have no internet access. And there is concern that UC cannot deliver key promises: a critical study found it does not deliver savings, cannot prove it gets more people into work, and has plunged vulnerable claimants into hardship.Mistakes and delays can add on average an extra three weeks to the formal 35-day wait for an initial benefit payment, pushing claimants into debt, rent arrears, and reliance on food banks. Campaigners warn that the problems could get worse next year when more than 3 million claimants start to be “migrated” to the new system.Growing concern over universal credit, which is six years behind schedule but will eventually handle £63bn of benefits going to 8 million people, is matched by disquiet over what critics say has been a defensive and insular approach to managing welfare reform by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP).The department came under withering fire last week from a cross-party group of MPs who accused it of a “culture of indifference” after it had repeatedly ignored warnings of basic process errors that led to 70,000 disabled benefit claimants being underpaid an estimated £500m over six years. The work and pensions secretary, Esther McVey, sought to limit the damage in a speech on Thursday in which she admitted there were problems with universal credit, and promised to listen to campaigners, claimants and frontline staff to find ways to change and improve the system.One whistleblower said many of the design problems with universal credit stemmed from the failure to understand claimants’ needs, especially where they lacked digital skills and internet access. “We are punishing claimants for not understanding a system that is not built with them in mind,” he said.The DWP said it would not comment on the whistleblowers’ specific claims but insisted the system was being constantly improved. “Universal credit is a flexible and responsive benefit and we continue to listen to feedback and make any necessary improvements during the rollout with our test-and-learn approach.Bayard Tarpley, 27, who left the Grimsby service centre last week after two years as a telephony agent, told the  that he had been dealing with distressed claimants every day. “My hope is that by speaking out I can help explain why these processes have such a significant, harmful impact on claimants.”To help us further understand the issue, we\u0027d like to hear from people who have experience working with universal credit claims or claimants.

Officials are told to advise claimants who are in hardship and who do not qualify for cash advances to contact charities or their council for help. Many councils have closed local welfare provision as a result of cuts. A second whistleblower, Joanne Huggins, who was until recently a case manager at the Grimsby centre, said that high staff caseloads and a high volume of calls to the service made it difficult to keep track of and prioritise claimants’ problems. “The system is set up in such a way that people don’t get support,” she said.At least £1.3bn has been spent since 2010 developing universal credit. Although it is heralded as a streamlined digital replacement for the existing benefit system, a recent National Audit Office report concluded it was still in many aspects unwieldy, inefficient and reliant on basic manual processes.The DWP says it operates a “test-and-learn” approach to constantly improve the system, although the whistleblower said in his experience staff suggestions were ignored and “top down” adjustments tended to follow media or political controversies, such as the scrapping of call charges on universal credit helplines.Mark Serwotka, the general secretary of the Public and Commercial Services union that represents DWP staff, said: “The findings from the whistleblowers are in line with the ongoing feedback we get from our reps and members who struggle to deliver a service to universal credit claimants in the face of mounting cuts and increasing workloads.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e68a4100775c6631c6d06caee31bc90a37b06578/79_64_4817_2890/master/4817.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d2635c141dc89c51d1dd1df6a1c2bb84","title":"lewis hamilton sebastian vettel f1 german grand prix report","story":"• British driver wins in Hockenheim after starting in 14th• Sebastian Vettel crashes out while leading the raceLewis Hamilton won the German Grand Prix with a remarkable and unlikely victory from 14th on the grid. He drove a superb recovery but was aided when his championship rival Sebastian Vettel crashed while leading the race. Hamilton’s Mercedes team-mate Valtteri Bottas was in second in front of the Ferrari of Kimi Raikkonen. The win for Hamilton means he has now retaken the lead of championship from Vettel, with a 17-point advantage, the sixth time the lead has changed hands this season.Hamilton’s victory was placed in doubt after he was summoned to appear before the stewards on Sunday evening – but the Mercedes driver only received a reprimand and held onto the race victory. Hamilton was alleged to have crossed the pit-entry line when he decided not to pit for tyres under the safety car.It is the first time in his F1 career that he has won from lower than sixth on the grid and would have far exceeded his expectations after a mechanical failure in qualifying saw him starting in the midfield. Mercedes had stuck to their strategy of keeping Hamilton out long but the crucial moments came when it rained in the final third and Vettel lost grip and went off. Vettel apologised to his team but was left slamming his steering wheel in frustration at his error, with the win and his championship lead gone.It is Hamilton’s fourth win at the German Grand Prix, matching Michael Schumacher as the most successful driver at the race. Hamilton has won three times here and once at the Nürburgring. The record will be of little import, however, compared to his elation at coming back from what had appeared to be a lost cause when his car suffered a hydraulic failure in qualifying.This 66th career win is his fourth of the season, equalling Vettel and once again making the title fight impossible to call. After disappointment in claiming only second at the last round in Silverstone, he and the team will be buoyed by an unlikely victory and a one-two. Hamilton was pushed to the limit to take the win but if indeed it is tiny margins that are likely to decide the title this season, this is one of the moments that may make all the difference.It had for so long looked to be in Vettel’s hands. He made a clean start from pole and held his lead into turn one and immediately put some distance on Bottas in second, out of DRS range by the third lap. Hamilton had made it to 12th by lap two and promptly went one better and breezed through up the inside of Fernando Alonso and with Charles Leclerc the next to fall he was in the points by lap four but already 16 seconds back from Vettel.Hamilton had started on the harder, soft tyres and made short work of the slower midfield cars but progress proved slightly slower when he came up to the Haas, Force India and Renault entries. But he persevered and had made it to eighth by lap eight.Kevin Magnussen’s Haas was the final midfielder to fall and he moved up to fifth on lap 14, 16 seconds behind Max Verstappen in fourth. Raikkonen, however, had pitted early, opting for a two-stop which brought the Finn out just in front of Hamilton. Vettel, in the meantime, was in control out front maintaining a solid three-second gap to Bottas. Raikkonen had good pace on his fresh rubber and Hamilton matched him and when Vettel pitted on lap 26 he emerged behind his team-mate and just in front of Hamilton.With the leaders having all pitted, Hamilton stayed out. However Vettel was suffering running in the dirty air behind Raikkonen and Ferrari could have been more ruthless in switching their drivers, given they were on different strategies. They finally ordered Raikkonen to move over on lap 39 but he had lost time and given his rubber a hammering.Mercedes had to pit Hamilton on lap 42 and he took the fastest ultrasoft rubber to run to the end, they had kept him out as long as possible hoping to take advantage of anticipated rain which duly arrived only a lap after he had stopped. Hamilton was 20 seconds back from Vettel but was gaining between one and two seconds a lap, with the localised rain at turn six not enough to use wet tyres, his rubber was the best on the track.But the rain was shifting across the track and making for a difficult greasy surface. It proved too much for Vettel who was locking up and unable to find the grip to turn in, went straight on at turn 13, ending his race in the barriers.The safety car was deployed and, with Bottas and Raikkonen both pitting, Hamilton stayed out and then inherited the lead with 14 laps to go. When racing resumed on lap 58 crucially the rain was abating and the track drying.Hamilton made the most of his advantage, although under a fierce attack from his team-mate who was subsequently ordered by the team to hold station. He had done enough and held his place to the flag.Verstappen finished in fourth, with the Renault of Nico Hulkenberg in fifth. Romain Grosjean in the Haas was in sixth in front of the Force India’s of Sergio Pérez and Esteban Ocon. Marcus Ericsson in the Sauber was in ninth with Brendon Hartley in the Toro Rosso in tenth."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3205fbe6e6e1c0715da7c86d55329d098fabd69a/19_0_3462_2078/master/3462.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f1a703a4b18d1e28264f63015fc51565","title":"magnus cort nielsen wins stage 15 of toue de france in sprint finish","story":"King of the Mountains 1.

Ahead of Thomas and the other main contenders, a breakaway move climaxed with victory for Denmark’s Magnus Cort Neilsen in his first Tour de France, and completed a successful weekend for his Astana team, which also won Saturday’s stage to Mende.But yet again the atmosphere on the road towards Thomas and his fellow Sky team members was poisonous. Further criticism from across the French media rained down on Sky over the weekend, targeting in particular Thomas and his teammate Chris Froome.“It’s not a nice situation because this is a highlight of my career,” Thomas said of the continuing hostility towards him. “It’s a massive honour and a privilege to be wearing the jersey and it’s been an incredible race so far. There’s obviously been a bit of negativity which isn’t nice, but you have to stay strong in your head and crack on.“The way I see it, I would rather be in this jersey, having the race of my life and getting booed for whatever than being dropped on the first climb and everyone cheering you.”Meanwhile, the outcome of the race is still in the balance, but the reception of the locals to the prospect of another Team Sky success is no longer in doubt. Effectively there are two races being run side by side, one focusing on the leadership intrigues at Team Sky and the other arguing that this Tour, tainted by suspicion and spectator hostility, represents a new low point in the popularity of the race.While French television coverage preserves, through gritted teeth, the myth of camaraderie and celebration, the Twitter feeds of leading riders tell a different story, as do the declining TV ratings.“What I saw from the fans on the final climb towards Team Sky was disgraceful,” the Australian rider Luke Durbridge said after Saturday’s stage to Mende when Froome was showered with an unknown liquid. “If you don’t like cycling don’t come to watch.”“Obviously we would prefer everyone to love us,” Thomas said, “but I’m not sure it’s anything we’ve done – or especially that I’ve done – to deserve it. You would have to ask the public, and maybe it’s a reflection of the way we’re perceived in the French media.”The first Pyrenean stage on Tuesday will surely test the legs of all the major contenders, but it is the 65-kilometre mountain stage to the Col du Portet on Wednesday that is most likely to turn the screw.“For sure they are hard stages,” Thomas said. “A lot can still happen. I’m expecting a big fight on Tuesday and some long-range attacks. The 65km stage is up down, up down and then up. It’s two and a half hours of full-gas racing.“I might seem close to Paris in days, but look at all the climbs and racing we’ve got to go. So I’m keeping my feet on the ground. There are three big, big days to come.”There was little real action among the overall favourites on the road from Millau to Carcassonne, beyond a lone sortie from Dan Martin and an impetuous move on the descent of the Pic de Nore from Romain Bardet.Thomas was dismissive of Martin’s attack. “It was 40km to go from the top but it didn’t make much sense really. The wind wasn’t enough to do anything but it was a bit of stress.“Bardet tried on the descent which was a bit crazy. We just made sure we were in front. The last 15 kilometres were a bit of stress with the wind, but we were always in the right place.“Days like today you want to try and recover as much as possible,” Thomas said, while insisting that final victory in Paris had not crossed his mind. “I\u0026nbsptake it day by day and just worry about the next stage, the next climb and keep going.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8566b79bebab8f88d44037b572f1a7123addcd8b/0_757_3610_2166/master/3610.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8570675a9634ae0310d8fc4eb206bc62","title":"nike shoes vaporfly sport","story":"Your first instinct might be to rush out and buy a pair – especially as a separate study in the journal Sports\u0026nbspMedicine on elite athletes estimated that the shoes could take six minutes off a three-hour marathoner’s time. Good luck with that. The shoes appear to be almost permanently sold out, and often go\u0026nbspfor double their retail price on eBay.A more pressing task is to ask whether the shoes – and other forms of cutting-edge technology – go too far. Do they, in effect, turn what is supposed to be a level playing field in one that more resembles the slope of the Eiger?A case can be made that the Vaporflys have already created at least one major sliding-doors moment in elite sport. Roger Pielke Jnr, the director of the sports governance centre at the University of Colorado Boulder, notes that in the 2016 US Olympic marathon trials, Kara Goucher finished in fourth – missing out on the plane to Rio by just one place. Yet the winner, Amy Cragg, along with the third-placed runner, Shalane Flanagan, were both wearing early prototypes of the Vaporflys, which he believes could have made all the difference to the result.The kicker? If Goucher had not left the Nike Oregon Project after raising concerns about its use of TUEs and thyroid medication, she may indeed have been wearing those shoes.So where should we draw the line? On the one hand you cannot blame companies for striving to break new ground. They have profits to chase, consumers to satisfy, competitors breathing down their neck. We\u0026nbspwant these products, too. Only the most\u0026nbspmasochistic of runners attempts marathons in bare feet or old‑school trainers.The International Association of Athletics Federations, the world governing body, also insists that Nike’s game-changing shoe meets all its requirements and “does not require any special inspection or approval”. Yet elite competition also requires a semblance of fairness. At some point the IAAF will have to rule on the permissible amount of energy return allowed from cushioning materials and whether carbon‑fibre devices in midsoles should be banned.Some inside the system concede that it would take other nations vast sums to replicate such technology. Elite competition is about winning, they point out, and if the rules permit the skinsuits what is the problem? Similar technology was also used to help Team GB win three skeleton medals in Pyeongchang – much to the delight of the nation.Yet it is only natural to also feel a bit queasy about this, because it means that a cyclist from a smaller nation has almost no chance of an Olympic medal in a track sprint. While they will wear an off-the-peg skinsuit, British cyclists will have been 3D-laser scanned before being provided with suits made with cutting-edge materials, including polyurethane derivatives.Those suits will, crucially, contain near-invisible “trips” that disrupt the\u0026nbspflow of air and create a turbulence effect that reduces the amount of wind resistance acting on the body.When I spoke to someone who uses the Vaporfly Elites\u0026nbspthey raved about them providing more “bounce and forward momentum” and said they also helped them go faster for longer. “Oddly you feel them most when standing still or walking in them,” they said. “They\u0026nbsptip you forward slightly so it’s like you are always\u0026nbspjust about to ‘take off’ at speed.”But now we know how well the shoes work, is it time to power down their afterburners?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/03562e79e0138c9e7ad2af3e05f1034658f69a46/328_287_4110_2466/master/4110.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b33d8cc50bbe4c9dff8c91abdf25aa63","title":"the open 2018 report francesco molinari","story":"• Italian finishes with closing 69 to claim Claret Jug at Carnoustie• Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy fall away as Italian steams to winFrancesco Molinari became Italy’s first major champion after firing a closing two-under-par 69 to win the British Open at Carnoustie on Sunday.The 35-year-old underlined his status as the hottest player in world golf by finishing with an eight-under total of 276.Molinari, playing alongside the former world number one Tiger Woods in the final round, produced a joyful first-pump and hugged his caddie after holing a five-foot birdie putt at the 18th hole.It was the Italian’s third victory in five starts.

Perhaps the head coach knew all along that Trinity were capable of something this remarkable.Ryan Hampshire kicked 12 goals from 13 attempts as Hull endured their worst defeat in Super League, trailing 72-0 before scoring the last two tries of the match.After finishing fifth last season, the hope around Wakefield was that Trinity, one of Super League’s perennial strugglers, could mount another unlikely play-off push this year. Their inconsistency in 2018 will probably scupper any such hope, but this Trinity side remain comfortably one of the league’s lowest spenders and are one of only three sides that do not stretch to the limit of the competition’s £1.8m salary cap.So for this victory to guarantee a third-successive top-eight finish for Wakefield underlines the progress being made here.“The pressure has been ridiculous,” Chester said afterwards. “The Catalans and Huddersfield doing as well as they have and Leeds getting the result on Friday put a load of pressure on the boys but they handled it really well.“It’s been a tough couple of weeks, but it’s like someone has stuck a pin in me and all the pressure has been relieved. It takes all the pressure off us going into the Super\u0026nbsp8s.”Despite Leeds ending a nine-match winless run against Widnes, to keep their fading top-eight hopes alive, wins elsewhere for Huddersfield, Catalans and now Wakefield means the reigning champions will battle it out against the Championship’s best this summer to secure their Super League status. Against remarkably poor opposition, Wakefield led 20-0 five minutes before half-time then marched into the break with tries from Pauli Pauli, Reece Lyne and James Batchelor making it 38-0 on a pivotal afternoon for Hull.With two of the top four clubs losing earlier in the weekend, this was a chance for Hull to resurrect their own Super League play‑off hopes – and with that in mind Lee Radford gambled on the fitness of a number of key players. It backfired spectacularly, a point not lost on their head coach afterwards.“What could have gone wrong, went wrong,” Radford said afterwards. “We got the opposite of what we asked for and I take full responsibility for that defeat. I felt we had nothing to lose, our season was on the line.”And, with the derby looming, Radford added: “We’ve not got much chance to fix it on the field. It’s a short turnaround against Hull KR but we’ve got to salvage some pride.”The best any Hull fan could hope for after half-time here was some semblance of fight – and while they eventually got that with two late tries in the final quarter, by then Wakefield had already scored another 34 points – including two for the outstanding Ben Jones‑Bishop – to register their highest score in Super League history.With eight games now remaining, Wakefield are eight points off the top four – but afternoons such as this suggest nothing is impossible in the final months of the season."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/827bf58a998c7773fddb2166694173abcb433505/262_260_3188_1913/master/3188.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=093dc38555bf210d4cd369bbb2d8fdd1","title":"county cricket lancashire v yorkshire notts v surrey and more live","story":"And that was a quite ridiculous batting performance by Lancashire.

Stoneman 28 not out, including 6 fours.At Guildford Southern Vipers have just lost 2 wickets in an over in their chase of 142, and they’re big wickets too - Danni Wyatt and Suzie Bates both back in the hutch thanks to Marizanne Kapp. Bates went to a Lizelle Lee juggle-catch - the ball was hit so hard it knocked her over and she fumbled it, but eventually managed to cling on. 32-2 now after 5 overs.Over in Taunton Western Storm, having been 0-1, are now cruising along at 10 an over - India’s Smriti Mandhana currently 45 not out off 17 balls!

That recovery was spearheaded by 20-year-old Sophia Dunkley, who made a 42-ball 66 before being caught at deep midwicket. A brilliant innings and just what Stars needed - she’s certainly doing what she intended and making a name for herself in this competition. Southern Vipers have a ridiculous amount of firepower in their batting so it’s difficult to see them not chasing that down, but at least Dunkley’s made a game of it.Out in the West Country Australia’s Delissa Kimmince has also hit 50, for Yorkshire Diamonds in Taunton, as they finish their 20 overs on 162-5 v reigning champions Western Storm.Meanwhile up in Southport Lancashire Thunder (current holders of the KSL wooden spoon) have been rather embarrassingly bowled out for 72 by Loughborough Lightning - Jenny Gunn finishing with 3-10. Not the start to the competition they will have been hoping for...A wicket at Hove - Salt for 48. And 53 not out for Gary Wilson at Chesterfield. Derby 214 for 8 and scrambling away.Never mind, for a moment, Jordan Clark, how about Darren Stevens?

As they mended he discovered it was easier to bowl off-spin when they were fully recovered he was able to bowl legspin again. Now? Who knows - but a cruel blow after being in such sensational form, and leaving Lancashire in a pickle for the remainder of the Blast.Another one down at Old Trafford: Patterson c Jennings b Bailey 22.

A wicket for Anderson at last - caught Jennings again, at slip, and a handsome round of applause for Lyth, who batted beautifully for his 70 - 119 balls, 12 x 4More from Raf:Dane van Niekerk having some fun here at Guildford and getting the home crowd able to finally do some flag-waving - she’s 28* with Stars having recovered to 62-4 after 11.Spare a thought for Lancashire Thunder, though, who are suffering their own collapse up in Southport against Loughborough Lightning - 5 down after 8 overs with only 36 runs on the board. Premier overseas signing Australia’s Nicole Bolton has, embarrassingly, gone for a duck while England’s Jenny Gunn has just taken 2 wickets in an over.Derbyshire lose another couple - 1838: Viljoen and Palladino.

For Southern Vipers, England quick Tash Farrant currently has figures of 2-11 and at 19-4 after 5 overs. Dane van Niekerk and Sophia Dunkley have some rebuilding to do. Dunkley was hoping for an opportunity to stake her claim for England during KSL but I’m guessing she won’t have expected (or wanted?!) to be doing so quite this early!And some serenity in the pink ball game. Sussex 45-0 at Hove - Salt 35 not out. Phew. Derbyshire crawling out of the mire at 161 for 6, Gary Wilson 23 not out, Hardus Viljoen 8 not out. Hoseien out for a nicely-played 58, one of Sanderson’s 4-40.An update from Raf Nicholson who isn’t at Taunton but is at Guildford:Southern Vipers captain Suzie Bates has won the toss and chosen to field first.The big team news is that England left-arm quick Katie George is out of today’s game with a sore hamstring. Sussex’s Paige Scholfield will make her Vipers debut in her place. Otherwise all is as expected.There’s a good smattering of spectators, some of whom have brought their own chairs.

Stop press: Vettel says it was a small error and so he won’t struggle to sleep tonight, but it was a positive weekend and he didn’t need the rain. He apologises to the team who he says made the right calls - I wonder if he means that - and is still confident himself and his car. So that’s about us - what a race! Join us again in a fortnight for the Hungarian GP ... your guess is as good as mine. Mercedes, meanwhile, lead the constructors’ championship by eight points from Ferrari. Celebration time. Hamilton now leads the Drivers’ Championship by 17 points from Vettel. Raikkonen is third, Bottas fourth and Ricciardo fifth despite retiring here. And here comes Hamilton prancing and bouncing along the dais - as well he might! This has got to be one of the greatest wins of Hamilton’s career - of anyone’s career. And here comes the rain again, absolutely hammering down now. “Has there ever been a driver who has made adversity work so well for him, as Lewis Hamilton?” emails Peter Groves. “He even seems to have derived energy from the hate he complained about yesterday. Superb.”Hatred - and anger, probably partly at himself. He imposed himself from the start here, and the little bit of jockeying with Bottas was great. Slam! Here’s our report of a bazzer for the ages...He also says that conditions were perfect and when it started raining he knew he had a chance. He hanks his team and allows himself one indulgence: “For those who don’t know me, now you do!”Hamilton says he believed he could win, and though it was unlikely, you’ve always got to believe. He said a really long prayer before the start, “kept pushing, kept believing and it happened ... I achieved my dream today ... thanks to God.”Hamilton rushes towards his team, jumps in, and has a little jog down the track. Incredible. That was phenomenal - and might it also be pivotal? If Vettel had won today, it would’ve seemed a long way back for Hamilton, but suddenly he’s achieved the impossible, he on a buzz, and will believe in himself and his team like never before.

But it’d best get a wriggle on...Lap 6467: There’s a threat of rain, but it’s not going to matter. The leaderboard now reads:Lap 6267: Hamilton’s lead is up to 2.561s. What a drive, set up by how quickly he moved through the field at the start and elevated by the perfect tactics for the circumstance. Lap 6167: It starts to rain again, but the gap from first to second is up to two seconds. And behind them, Raikkonen isn’t within DRS range, which makes this an incredible weekend for Mercedes. Lap 6067: well who expected this?! Maybe not even Lewis Hamilton! Bottas has been told to hold his position now - with an apology, which I’m sure made him feel so much better - so as long as Hamilton stays on the track, he’s going back on top of the drivers’ championship! Lap 5967: DRS is back involved at the end of the next lap, but Hamilton is going to be too far ahead for that!Lap 5967: Sainz is under investigation for overtaking while the safety car was out, while Hamilton extends his lead to 1.960. Lap 5867: With Bottas looking to overtake Hamilton, Raikkonen closes and that’s great for Hamilton who bousts out of DRS range. Lap 5867: And off we go! Hamilton has his team-mate Bottas behind him which might help ... or not as Bottas has a go and they’re wheel to wheel! Lap 5767: The safety car is off at the end of the lap ... what a race this has been! What a race this now is! Lap 5667: Sainz is up into eight, Ocon is seventh, Perez sixth, Hulkenberg 5, Verstappen fourth, Raikkonen third, Bottas second ... and Hamilton first. The safety car will surely depart now...Lap 5567: We’ve still got the safety car on, so it’ll be a sprint for the line. Hamilton, whose tyres are the oldest, will have to fight to maintain his lead, but surely he’ll have enough from here! Lap 5467: They reckon in commentary that Vettel was too cautious, and I wonder if the strategy was part of the problem - obviously it didn’t overshoot the corner, but it did cause an unhappy driver. Lap 5367: So Raikkonen leads ... but pits, and now Hamilton leads! Oh I say! Raikkonen comes out behind Bottas, and Hamilton is literally going to win isn’t he! I cannot believe what I’m typing here! This is incredible, ridiculous, and every other such word! Mercedes have got their strategy absolutely bob-on here, even if they did need a serious error to bring it home. Lap 5267:Vettel made an error heading into the Saxe Turn, going too wide, and found himself unable to correct - there wasn’t the room - so into the barrier he went, and oh dear me! Lap 5267: Hamilton is gaining on Raikkonen now - AND VETTEL IS OUT OF THE RACE! HE CRASHES INTO A BARRIER! Lap 5167: Bottas attacks Raikkonen, who shuts the door, while Magnussen and Perez duel and the latter spins off! Then Raikkonen has to move over and Bottas powers past! Lap 5067: There’s a bit more rain, but only a bit. Lap 4967: My guess is that Vettel will be able to hang on, but Mercedes seem to have read the conditions better, saving their pit til the last possible moment and giving Hamilton the best chance of moving the furthest through the field.

It was a tough day today. It was a matter of grinding it out. Par was a good score. I’m really pleased with my week’s work, and my form going into the final major of the year. It was fun to be out there. When Tiger was in the lead on his own, we thought wow, this is going to be a dogfight all the way! And so it was. I was encouraged how I putted down the stretch. I stayed aggressive, and made full, committed swings. I don’t leave here with any regrets. I played a good tournament, it just wasn’t good enough.”A philosophical Tiger Woods speaks! “I played my way back into it. Looking at the scores, there was only one good round today. So there weren’t a lot of low scores today. I figured I could get to -9, I might have a chance. I hoped to get that number, but I could not. I was playing consistent, solidly all week. I was right there. Unfortunately I made some mistakes early on the back nine today that cost me. It was close to really being good.”Here’s our snap report:Now the new champ gives his first interview, to Sarah Stirk from Sky. “It is absolutely amazing. It will take a long time to sink in. It’s been a great week. The course bit me a few times the first couple of days, but then to go bogey free over the weekend on a course like this is incredible. I was as composed as much as you can be on the final round of the Open. But for the first time I felt like I was ready for it. Playing with Tiger makes it even more special. I couldn’t have written it any better. It’s been a long journey, and holding this trophy changes a few things. It’s been about confidence. Winning at Wentworth after coming close so many times. Then even more winning in the States, because not a lot of Europeans have done it. And here we are!”“What a week!” he begins with a laugh. He thanks his wife and his family back home in Italy. And then his manager and caddy. “Congratulations to the runners up, it’s been a tough fight. Unfortunately in golf there’s only one winner, this time it’s me! But they played very well, and congratulations to them.” He thanks the R\u0026ampA and the greenkeepers. Then the volunteers and the fans. And he hoists his prize high, as the love pours down from the stand!“And with a score of 276, the winner of the gold medal, and champion golfer of the year, is Francesco Molinari!” The 35-year-old from Turin takes possession of the auld Claret Jug, raises it modestly in the air, smiles broadly, and makes off to the microphone to give his winner’s speech.“Ladies and gentlemen, the leading amateur, and the winner of the silver medal, Sam Locke!” The 19-year-old Aberdonian, a protege of 1999 Carnoustie champion Paul Lawrie, comes up to collect his medal. Recent winners include Rory McIlroy, Matthew Fitzpatrick ... and one Tiger Woods. Congratulations to Sam!Francesco Molinari - the Open champion, a major winner, Italy’s first Open champion, Italy’s first major winner - takes to the 18th green. Huge cheers greet a very popular player! The chap from the R\u0026ampA thanks everyone for coming remembers the great Peter Thomson, who passed away last month and won this title five times in the 1950s and 1960s and bigs up the Carnoustie staff and volunteers. He probably needs to pick up the speed, tell the truth. But eventually he gets round to thanking the players for “a wonderful week of golf”. Damn straight.The new Open champion is having a very relaxed chat with the silver-medal winner Sam Locke. While they wait for the prize-giving ceremony, here’s how the final leaderboard looks:The tears are threatening to come. But the new champion is in a mellow place right now. He’ll be mentally and physically exhausted: on an afternoon when the wind picked up and gave many of the world’s top players immense heartache, Molinari battled and battled, making 13 pars in a row, knocking in a couple of big savers around the turn. Then on the closing stretch - Carnoustie’s notorious closing stretch - he made a couple of stunning birdies to seal the deal, at 14 and 18. It’s a magnificent performance. And make no mistake: even though Jordan Spieth, Xander Schauffele and Kevin Kisner went backwards today, Molinari won this, seeing off late charges from Justin Rose and Rory McIlroy. And he held off Tiger Woods all the way round, too. No mean feat! Molinari, understandably, doesn’t quite know what to do with himself. He hugs his caddy. He goes back in the waiting room. He puts his head in his hands again. He allows himself a little smile. His mind must be whirling. On the 18th, pars for Spieth and Schauffele. It’s a 76 for the defending champion, and a 74 for the young man from San Diego. It’s probably worth pointing out that both of these super-talented players are 24 years of age. What a contribution they’ve made to a glorious Open!FRANCESCO MOLINARI IS THE 2018 OPEN CHAMPION! Schauffele’s short iron in is straight at the flag, but it checks 12 feet from the hole, and that means Molinari is the deserved winner of this tournament after a stunning blemish-free round of 69!Molinari is out on the putting green, keeping himself warm. He’s counting no chickens. If Lombard can eagle the hole, so can Schauffele. Spieth sends his drive into the rough down the left, then knocks his second over the back. Schauffele splits the fairway. He’s left with a 136-yard Hail Mary. He takes aim, cocks the club back, shoots, and ...Up on 18, Kevin Kisner signs for a closing 74. He was never at the races today. He ends the week at -6. Meanwhile his partner Kevin Chappell puts his name to a close-but-no-cigar 73: he’s -5. OK, he can have a cigar. They can both have a cigar. And a glass of fine wine. They’ve both come up short, but both have contributed to a sensational Open Championship.Nope. It’s a good effort, but he doesn’t hit it. Bogey. Which means that, unless Schauffele holes his second from the fairway - and only one man in Open history has done that at Carnoustie, Zander Lombard yesterday evening - the 147th Open Championship belongs to Francesco Molinari! Bogey for Spieth, too, as he drops to -4.Schauffele takes a while to think about his chip. Someone mutters something in the crowd, causing him to back away. The young man doesn’t get mad, though, turning and smiling warmly. That’s a nice moment, with his Open chances hanging in the balance. He eventually sends a gentle flop high over the bush and past the bunker, landing his ball as softly as he can. It’s a lovely shot. But he’s got a left-to-right 15-foot slider for par, and he really needs to make it if he’s to deny Molinari.From the centre of the 17th fairway, Schauffele tightens up. He slices towards the Kevin Chappell Memorial Gorse Bush, and gets a little stroke of fortune: the ball stops short of the killer plant. He’s still left with an awkward chip over it, and there’s a bunker between his ball and the flag too. And not much green to play with. Meanwhile in a small waiting room, Molinari, so close to his dream, holds his head in his hands. Then he sits back and blows out hard. Then he holds his head in his hands a bit more, and sips from a bottle of water. He’s fidgety, in short. Wouldn’t you be, if you were this close to your dreams, to the famous auld Claret Jug?Francesco Molinari makes no mistake, though! He rolls in his birdie putt, his second of the back nine, and that’s a blemish-free card of 69! He ends the week at -8, and he celebrates accordingly, pumping the air with his fist and allowing a huge smile of relief and excitement to play across his face! He’ll be the 2018 Open champion golfer, and Italy’s first major champion ... unless the 24-year-old Californian Xander Schauffele makes a birdie at one of the final two holes! Because on 17, Kevin Kisner can only make par, while Kevin Chappell’s bid expires as, having found that gorse bush, he runs up a double-bogey six to slip to -4.Tiger can’t make his short birdie putt, the ball dying off to the left. That’s a 71, and the dream died just after the turn with that double bogey  bogey whammy. Still, he’s -5. And though he didn’t win, Tiger’s back, baby. Tiger’s back! “Who ever the idiot was who intentionally tried to distract Tiger on his drive on the last hole, I hope is never allowed into a sporting venue, anywhere, forever. Why would anyone spend £80 to wait five hours just to sound like a howling tit on TV?” Hubert O’Hearn speaks for me, and all of us, I’ll be bound.Schauffele’s putt on 16 stays high on the left. What a chance to take the lead with two holes to play! But it’s gone. He remains at -7 Spieth tidies up for his par and stays at -5. Meanwhile back on 18, Tiger and Molinari pepper the flag! Both will have five-footers for birdie! What glorious wedges. But that means Tiger’s bid is effectively over. Number 15 will have to wait, for another three weeks at least.Spieth’s shot into 16 is on the dancefloor, too, but a long way away. He leaves his lengthy putt six feet short. On 17, Chappell’s tee shot is short. He goes full pelt with the second, and shoves it into a gorse bush down the right. There’s some terrible trouble found at exactly the wrong time. Kisner finds the heart of the green but his birdie putt will be a long one. And on 18, some eejit shouts during Tiger’s downswing, causing a rare old fume, and rightly so. What a clown! Fortunately for Tiger, his ball still careers down the fairway.Schauffele sends a simply sensational tee shot straight at the flag on the long par-three 16th. His ball trundles up the green and stops ten feet past. That’s as good a shot as we’ve seen on this hole all week. Remember: the five-time Open winner Tom Watson jokingly refers to it as a good par-four. If he goes on to win his first major today, that might be the shot that sealed the deal. Or will it be the nigh-on perfect drive Molinari crashes down 18, leaving himself a short wedge in?Spieth’s par putt on 15 stays high on the right. That may be an end to a very brave title defence. He slips to -5. Schauffele does very well to get up and down from the back: he stays at -7. As does Molinari, who can’t make his birdie putt but continues on his blemish-free way. Tiger keeps his hopes alive by nearly hitting the flagstick with his chip up onto the green, then slotting away the six-footer that remains. On 16, Kisner goes over the back, but Todd Hamiltons with his rescue club to four feet, and tidies up for his par. Chappell pars too, in a more disappointing way, after creaming a lovely shot into the heart of the green, then failing to hit the birdie putt.Spieth drives into sand down 15. That means he’s wedging three into the green. He sends that one pin high to 12 feet, and will have a great chance to save his par. Schauffele’s second is hot, and flies over the back. On 17, Tiger’s second is short, but Molinari’s is a seize-the-day arrow straight at the flag. He’ll have a 20-footer for a birdie that could go a long way to winning Italy’s first Open! “If several players (i.e. more than three) qualify for a playoff, do they split into pairings?” wonders Justin Horton. “Or if ten or eleven players all tie on, say, five under, do they all go round four holes together?” The R\u0026ampA haven’t announced that yet. They may have to soon, the way things are going. Chances are, any more than three will be split into two groups of two, or two and three. There’s never been anything more than a four-man play-off at the Open: that happened in 2002, when Thomas Levet and Steve Elkington, and Ernie Els and Stuart Appleby, were split in two groups of two.Rory’s wedge into 18 isn’t all that. Very average. Pin high, but a good 25 feet to the right. He tries his best to make the birdie putt, but it’s always staying out on the left. He taps in for a 70 and the best he can hope for is a play-off now. At -6, he shares the clubhouse lead with Rose! Meanwhile on 16, Tiger takes two putts from distance, while Molinari pitches up to six feet and completes his up-and-down.Rory crashes a huge drive down 18. He’ll be wedging in from 100 yards. Pars for Molinari and Woods at 15: the former’s tee shot at the long par-three 16th falls down the bank to the right, but the latter finds the heart of the dancefloor. Tommy Fleetwood signs for a 73 and ends the week at -3. And on the par-five 14th, Schauffele arrows his second to 20 feet, but his eagle putt somehow performs the wall of death, clockwise, and stays teetering on the edge! So unlucky! But he taps in for birdie and a share of the lead. Spieth however takes three putts from distance, a four footer lipping out, and he only pars. This is going to the wire!A huge up and down by Rory McIlroy at 17! His second finds the bunker front right of the green. It jumps out of the plughole and onto flat sand. That allows him to splash to six feet, and nail a putt he couldn’t afford to miss. He celebrates with another excitable spin. For the first time in a long while, he’s involved at the business end of a major. One more solid hole, and he could either be joining Justin Rose in the clubhouse lead at -6, or setting a new mark himself!Kisner is an inch away from draining a long eagle putt on 14. He rejoins the group at -6, one behind the new leader Molinari. Chappell scrambles a par after finding a gorse bush with his drive and then a deep greenside bunker. He celebrates almost as much as Rory did his eagle: every shot is crucial now, in this nip-and-tuck Open!... up on 18, Justin Rose lashes a huge drive down the track, then wedges his second to three feet! In goes the birdie putt, and a man who had to birdie this hole on Friday to survive the cut is the new clubhouse leader! And the way things have been going, that mark might take some matching!Though he’s on the huge double green, Tiger opts to take a wedge. It’s the best part of 60 yards, after all. He’s basically on the 4th hole. He chips, but leaves himself well short. He’s got the best part of 20 feet left. He really desperately needs to make his birdie putt ... and in it goes! He’s -5. But still two off the lead, because his partner Francesco Molinari birdies the hole as well, in a much more calm, considered fashion, and he goes into the lead at -7! There’s the way to break a run of pars! Up on 16, Rory rolls a delicious putt up the hill onto the green, to a couple of feet. He saves his par! That’s quite special. He’s taken a lot of criticism, plenty of it justified, for his erratic putting this week, but that’s a touch of genius. New leaderboard in a minute, because ...Tiger’s tee shot at the par-five 14th finds the rough down the left. His second takes a flyer, all the way to the back of the big double green. He’d be miles away from the other hole, the 4th as it is, he’ll have the monster putt to end all monster putts. If he manages to birdie from there, it’ll be some result. He walks up the hole with the air of a man who knows this is coming to the crunch. It’ll be a 170-foot putt!!! McIlroy finds the centre of the 15th in regulation, but he’s a long way from the flag. He can’t find two monster putts in succession, but par will suffice. He stays at -6. And now the testing long par-three 16th. He pulls his tee shot down the swale to the left. It rolls on, way past the back of the green. That’ll be testing all right. Par will be some result from there.Tiger gives himself half a chance for birdie from the fringe of the par-three 13th. But his effort from 20 feet slides by. Par. And it’s a 13th par out of 13 for Molinari, whose tee shot nearly found a bush at the back. But he chipped up well to ten feet, and nailed the saver. Bogey for Kisner at 12, the result of finding sand from the tee. He slips to -5. Chappell remains one of the joint leaders at -6 with par.Sensational eagle for Rory McIlroy on 14! He sends a left-to-right slider into the cup from 40 feet! The crowd go bananas as he spins round through 360 degrees, punching the air and skipping! His Open bid looked utterly kaput not so long ago ... but it’s very much back on now! He’s one of the many co-leaders of the 147th Open Championship! Meanwhile birdie for Tommy Fleetwood at 15. The odds on a four-hole play-off can’t be too long, can they.A 71 for Tony Finau, who ends the week at -4. This will be his third top-ten finish at the majors in a row! Meanwhile Tiger can only thrash his third to the back of 11 two putts later, that’s another stroke gone. His #15 dream is falling apart right now. Yet another par for Molinari-Faldo.Schauffele finally gets something positive going. He crashes a big drive down 10, and sends his wedge to six feet. A much-needed birdie, and despite going out in 40, he’s co-leader of the Open again! Par for Spieth. Meanwhile on the par-five 14th, Rory drives into filth down the left, but uses every sinew to whip a long iron into the heart of the green. He’ll have a long look at eagle.Some great quotes here from Eddie Pepperell, explaining how he prepared ahead of the 67 that has launched him into surprise contention.I was a little hungover. I had too much to drink last night. I was so frustrated with yesterday that today was - I wouldn’t say a write-off, but I didn’t feel as though I was in the tournament.I just had some wine with my coach. We drowned our sorrows for about half an hour. It was enjoyable. I didn’t really think I had that much to drink. I’m just a lightweight!I wouldn’t always have a drink the night before, sometimes I have a few. It depends how you feel. I’ve done it all different ways. It depends on how you feel. I like to socialise in the evenings if I can. It takes some of the sting out of competitive golf at this level. It’s stressful.So there you have it, kids.

It’s been an intriguing day, in which Magnus Cort Nielsen announced himself with a fine climb and a strong sprint, and in which the big GC battle was postponed for another 48 hours at least. Bye for now! Geraint Thomas is re-presented with his yellow jersey. How long will he keep it for? Tomorrow is a rest day, which is followed by three mountain stages with one flat stage snuck among them, an inidual time trial and a procession to Paris. It’s amazing. Something I’ve been dreaming of. This is my first year here on the Tour and I’m so happy to take my first victory. It really was perfect. They said this was the stage for me, and I should go out in the breakaway, and everything worked out perfectly. Here’s our first-take report on today’s stage:The GC favourites cross the line in a big group, positions again unchanged, 13min 10sec behind Cort.Team Sky are all together at the front of the peloton, with Froome and Thomas riding side by side, chatting.The peloton is 1.7km away from the finish line, and in no kind of hurry.There was a nasty crash as the bulk of the breakaway came through to cross the line, with Damien Howson and Arthur Vichot among them. All recovered to cross the line.The peloton is still over 10 minutes away from the finish line.Michael Valgren comes in fourth and receives a hug of gratitude from his compatriot and team-mate.That’s a first ever Tour de France stage win for the 25-year-old Dane!350m to go: Nielsen still in the lead, waiting for someone to challenge him.1km to go: Magnus Cort Nielsen is absolutely bossing this. Can either of the other two outsprint him at the end?2km to go: Into Carcassonne they go, and it’s one of three for victory: Izagirre, Mollema or Cort Nielsen.5km to go: Ion Izagirre, Bauke Mollema and Magnus Cort Nielsen have gone ahead, assisted by some team-mates who contrived to let them go, and they seem set to fight for first.8km to go: The leaders are being battered by a savage crosswind as they head towards Carcassonne. It has turned a little tactical at the front of the group, where positioning for the final sprint is more important than outright speed at this point.10km to go: Majka has stuck with the seven riders who caught him, and one of the eight will win the stage.13km to go: A helicopter shot shows a strange pattern of yellow lines on the old walls of Carcassonne. On ITV4 they’re puzzled about what they’re there for, but if you stand at precisely the right spot it all makes sense.15km to go: Majka is going to be caught in the next minute or two.16km to go: So, in short, there’s a terrific culture of trufficulture in Villeneuve-Minervois. 17km to go: The leaders have just gone through Villeneuve-Minervois, the last town before the finish. “Our village, with its rich history of viticulture, trufficulture, and forestry is turning resolutely towards the future,” apparently.18km to go: This is what the final kilometre of today’s stage looks like. Will Majka still be at the front when he gets there?23km to go: There is now a seven-man group chasing Majka, composed of Magnus Cort Nielsen and Michael Valgren Andersen of Astana, Bauke Mollema and Toms Skujiņš of Trek-Segafredo, Domenico Pozzovivo and Ion Izagirre of Merida and Lilian Calmejane of Direct Energie. They are just 15sec behind the leader.26.5km to go: Majka is about to reach Cabrespine, famous mainly for a giant cave. “The background and the lighting effects make it a spectacle like no other,” apparently. 31km to go: Rafal Majka has a lead of 25sec over Mollema and Cort Nielsen, and they are screaming down the hill towards the finish line. Daniel Martin is just about to crest the Pic de Nore, exactly a minute ahead of the peloton.40km to go: Bauke Mollema and Magnus Cort Nielsen have gone on their own to chase Majka down. They are 29sec behind the leader.41km to go: It is barren and exposed towards the top of the Pic de Nore, with a howling wind to deal with. Majka has just completed the climb.42km to go: Rafal Majka continues on his own, at the front of the race. There’s 2km of climbing to go, and the remainder of the race is mostly downhill. There’s an eight-man group, currently led by Domenico Pozzovivo, attempting to catch him, but they’re currently 41sec behind. 44km to go: Dan Martin was 6min 54sec behind in the GC classification at the start of the day. Despite that disadvantage, Team Sky have decided not to let him get away from the peloton, and are accelerating to pull him back.45.5km to go: Halfway up the Pic de Nore and Rafal Mijka has not just caught the leaders, he’s overtaken them. 46km to go: Here’s a photo of Michal Kwiatkowski, with telltale eagle livery:46km to go: Rafał Majka has set off at the front of the breakaway group, trying to catch the leaders. And Dan Martin has broken off the front of the peloton. 47km to go: “Who’s the Sky cyclist with red on helmet, shirt and what’s that for? Aggressive performance?” wonders Paul in Holland. That’s Michal Kwiatkowski, who has special bespoke kit as Polish champion. The clue is the eagle emblem, which you can see if you get close enough.49km to go: Magnus Cort Nielsen, who has never won a Tour de France stage but certainly has the ability to do so, is at the front of the group now.50km to go: So those in the breakaway who want to win the stage have to start working on catching the leading pair. They have thus upped the pace, and the 24 riders involved have stretched out along the road. Ion Izagirre is at the front of the group, and Sagan near the back. Whether that’s because he’s tactically biding his time, or because he’s not feeling at his best, remains to be seen, and probably will be seen in the next 10 minutes or so. 51km to go: With 10km of solid climbing to go before the leaders reach the peak of the Pic de Nore, the leading pair have a two-minute lead over the rest of the breakaway, and a 13min lead over the peloton.54km to go: The sprint points in full:1. Julien Bernard (20 points)2. Fabien Grellier (17)And then, a minute or so later:3. Peter Sagan (15)4. Greg Van Avermaet (13)5. Pawel Poljanski (11)6. Rafal Majka (10)7. Daryl Impey (9)8. Arthur Vichot (8)9. Damian Howson (7)10. Silvan Dillier (6)11. Imanol Erviti (5)12. Sonny Colbrelli (4)13. Daniel Bennati (3)14. Romain Sicard (2)15. Magnus Cort Nielsen (1) 58km to go: And so to the Pic de Nore, which in profile looks something like this:60km to go: Bernard is first to the line in Mazamet, with Grellier just behind.61km to go: The intermediate sprint to Mazamet is just 1km away, with the front two, as they are now, 50sec ahead of the rest of the breakaway, and the peloton another 10 minutes back.68km to go: Julien Bernard has almost caught up with Grellier. The rest of the breakaway is about 25sec behind. 69km to go: Grellier is still on his own, with a small lead over the rest of the breakaway. The peloton is increasingly distant, though, almost 10min behind the leader now.74km to go: Fabien Grellier, a Direct Energie team-mate of the last person to do so, Lilian Calmejane, has set off alone at the front.75km to go: The breakaway group has a lead of 9min 20sec over the peloton.83km to go: As the riders head up another small but inconvenient bump in their path, the Cold de Caunan, Sagan has attempted to split the leading group. It looked on for a while, but he didn’t quite succeed.86km to go: Maybe Sagan was just peckish, as Brassac also holds the feed zone. 88km to go: “Why do Sky do all the hard work at the front of the peloton?” wonders Jobin on Twitter. “Surely other teams like Dimension Data have an advantage by not doing any turns at the front?” I think the great benefit is that it gives the impression that Sky are totally in control, bending the race to their will. 92km to go: There has not been a lot of action of late, but Peter Sagan has just had the first whiff of sprint points fill his grateful nostrils, and has thus taken the lead of the leading group.102km to go: And in a couple of minutes the gap disappeared entirely. Calmejane has been caught by the rest of the breakaway pack. At the other end of the group, Daryl Impey is one of three riders that have slipped a little behind the rest. 104km to go: Calmejane, about 45sec ahead of the rest of the breakaway, has a lengthy chat with the Direct Energie team car.105km to go: Now they head up the Col de la Bassine, which is just a little bonus bump today. From here it’s largely downhill to the day’s sprint at Mazamet. The Col de la Bassine is at 903m above sea level, and Mazamet at 234m. 18.5km of tough climbing after Mazamet they crest the Pic de Nore, at 1,205m.111km to go: Calmejaine heads into Lacaune les Bains. This is the second most exciting Sunday’s entertainment in Lacaune les Bains this month: they have a festival of charcuterie on next week, which starts with spit-roast hams at 8am and gets better from there.116km to go: Calmejaine is first over the hill, over a minute ahead of anyone else.Serge Pauwels, Toms Skujins and Arthur Vichot hoover up the remaining points."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/143780333c85c99dea28d3fdf857740f123616e9/930_589_2760_1656/master/2760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e7db08d25584a581917a3ae6360c1741","title":"can you do comedy about natalie palamides thinks so edinburgh best newcomer","story":"The LA comic, who won best newcomer at last year’s Edinburgh fringe, has tested her electric new material on American audiences. But how will Nate – her ‘douchebag’ male alter ego – go down in Britain?We should know, after last year, to expect the unexpected from Natalie Palamides. Who could have foreseen that the buzziest comedy in 2017 would come from an unknown LA actor making performance art about fertility, parental anxiety and eggs? But so it proved. In a blizzard of yolk and shattered shells, her show Laid wowed Edinburgh and poached the Comedy award for best newcomer. So we should have been braced for more surprises. But this? A cross-dressing comedy show for the #MeToo era that workshops, with audience participation, the idea of consent?The show is called Nate, after a male character the 28-year-old has played since college. “He does come off as a douchebag, as we say in America,” says Palamides, speaking by phone from Los Angeles, where she has been developing the show with her director, the cult clown and previous Edinburgh Comedy award champ Doctor Brown. “At first you think Nate’s a jerk,” she adds. “But people warm to him because he’s sweet – a sweet lovable idiot.”Having created the character as an experiment in male drag, then revived him in sketches since, she felt it was time to give Nate his own show. But not because, as per the cross-dressing cliche, she felt liberated by posing as a different gender. “It’s not about ‘getting away’ with certain things,” says the Pennsylvania native, “because I pretty much do anything on stage anyway.” It was more that she wanted to explore “love, relationships and masculinity” from a male perspective, and knew there was comic mileage in satirising casual sexism. But the show had teething problems, that Doctor Brown – real name Phil Burgers – helped her overcome. “I was dancing around the subject of consent,” she says, “because I was scared. I was really frustrated. Finally Phil was like, ‘What do you really want to do?’ And I said, ‘I want to put rape into the show.’ I didn’t want to trigger anyone or handle it the wrong way, though. But it needed to be in there.” And so, having tried out the material in front of LA audiences, she added a new strand about Nate’s adventures in sexual consent. I’m sworn to secrecy about how that all pans out on stage. But, given the current climate, and bearing in mind the brutal, brittle brilliance of Laid, it is likely to be electric.She insists, however, that this isn’t “issue comedy”. It’s a bit like Laid, she explains. In that show, Palamides hatched from a giant foam egg and spent most of the show frying her “babies” and eating them. “It’s really dumb and stupid and fun,” she says. “It’s important for comedy to speak to issues, while providing the relief that everything’s going to be OK. I want people to leave laughing.”They probably will: Palamides built up a lot of audience love in Britain last summer – and the feeling is reciprocated. Having grown up in a country where improv is practically the national sport (Palamides is well versed in it), she finds the LA crowd rather too keen to join in. “I prefer British audiences. They are more patient and allow me to guide them through it, rather than having someone who’s too excited to play with me on stage.”Another reason why Edinburgh appeals is its tradition of hour-long creative comedy, which Palamides prefers to the quick-hit standup culture of LA. “My set is very different to everything else that is going on there,” she says. “It always throws a little wrench in the works. Which is fun.” But not so lucrative that she can give up her sidelines: starring in a regular insurance ad on TV, and a voiceover gig on popular tween cartoon The Powerpuff Girls. Asked about her more long-term career plans, Palamides says: “Eeeugh! I don’t know what I’m going to do. I would like to make my own TV show. But often I think, ‘Oh jeez, who’s going to want me?’ That’s why I have to make my own stuff.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/42c7d848eedfeb44c7e06037f475ea94d3934b90/0_374_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=688ff991c0d1b41024eb36bbe607ea5f","title":"why donegal is the coolest place on the planet","story":"The long-overlooked north-west corner of Ireland has finally started getting its dues. In 2017, Donegal even topped National Geographic’s list of the coolest places on the planet. Anna Hart rounds up the 10 best things to do on a Donegal road trip Ireland’s most rugged and ravishing county has been a much-loved retreat for artists, bohemians, outdoorsy types and holidaying families for decades, but it’s only now that the rest of the world is waking up to the charms of traversing Donegal by car. Dramatic, secluded beaches, craggy coastlines, soaring peaks, shimmering lakes, verdant valleys and time-warp harbours – all dotted with atmospheric country pubs and quaint seafood restaurants – recently propelled this north-west county to the top of National Geographic Traveller’s Cool List. “It’s a warm-hearted place, but wilderness always feels just a stone’s throw away,” says National Geographic Traveller editor Pat Riddell. “And it is wilderness – world-class wilderness.” It’s definitely the coolest place on the planet right now if you’re a Star Wars fan. The region’s Inishowen peninsula was spectacularly showcased in Star Wars: The Last Jedi, with Malin Head being used to represent bits of Luke Skywalker’s isolated retreat, planet Ahch-To. This only added to the buzz around this long-overlooked corner of Ireland, further embellishing its hip credentials and making it the stuff of road-trip dreams. If you’re taking your car to Ireland by ferry to explore the attractions of Donegal, make sure you hop out at the following must-do spots.Sink a pint at McGrory’sUnassuming but atmospheric, 1920s family-run McGrory’s hotel in Culdaff has long been a local favourite, thanks to its open fires, a dazzling range of Irish craft beers and traditional music sessions. So much so that Daisy Ridley and the Star Wars crew had a night out there around filming, leading to a steady stream of Star Wars-struck visitors. Making the most of the welcoming atmosphere and seafood-heavy menu is now even more of a must.Swap four wheels for two While Donegal rewards road-trippers with sublime coastal scenery, isolated castles, private estates and ancient forests, it’s also a great spot to jump on a bike and blast some of that Atlantic sea breeze into your lungs. The peninsula at Horn Head, forming part of Sheephaven Bay, is perhaps the most scenic of all the Donegal peninsulas, where the cliffs rise to 180 metres (600ft) on the ocean side and provide breeding grounds for seabirds such as the European shag and razorbill. The Hornhead loop can be walked or driven, but biking is the best way to drink it all in, speeding past quartzite cliffs, mud flats, dunes and the salty New Lake area, complete with exceptional views of the Atlantic Ocean.Scale Mount ErrigalThe stark, striking quartzite mass of 751-metre Mount Errigal looms as you head east on the N56 from Gweedore. This is the tallest peak in County Donegal, and along with Mweelrea, is considered one of the most satisfying climbs in the county. Alternatively, drive to the coast and take a bracing walk at the highest sea cliffs in Europe – Slieve League. They stretch 600 metres (2,000ft) above the Atlantic Ocean at the highest point, with impressive views of the rugged coastline and Donegal Bay. Lose yourself in Letterkenny With a population of nearly 20,000, Letterkenny is Donegal’s most populous town, a confident and vibrant former market town famous for gothic-style St Eunan’s Cathedral – and its Hindu temple too. Donegal County Museum, housed in a 19th-century workhouse building, is a great place to get clued up on the county’s former industrial history, and, just south-west of town, the Newmills Corn and Flax Mills have a huge working waterwheel powered by the River Swilly.Picnic at Glenevin waterfallGlenevin waterfall is found at the top of a short hike of just over a mile through the woods in Clonmany, with nicely landscaped picnic areas, footbridges and stepping stones adding to the magic of this beautiful spot. Stock up on sandwiches, quiches and sweet treats at Claire The Bakers in Carndonagh beforehand.Explore Malin Head on the Inishowen peninsulaMalin Head, Ireland’s most northerly point, offers spectacular views, and the northernmost tip, Banba’s Crown, is one of the most photographed spots in the county. Sip a flat white from the Caffe Banba coffee truck (which also has a standalone cafe in Carndonagh) and see if you can spot scenery that made an appearance in Star Wars: The Last Jedi.Take a trip to Tory IslandTory Island, just 8.5 miles off the mainland, is an island steeped in history and folklore, where Irish is spoken and the locals elect a king, who acts as the community spokesperson. Seventy-four-year-old musician Patsy Dan Rodgers has been king for two decades now, ruling over this island of 150 inhabitants, a single road, one church, one grocery store, one lighthouse, one hostel and a social club.Surf the AtlanticThe Wild Atlantic Way is studded by tiny surf towns and beaches that have become legendary among the European surf community. Bundoran is widely considered one of the best surfing spots in Europe, and is fantastic for all kinds of water sports and horseshoe-shaped Magheraroarty Strand and sand dune-backed Ballyhiernan Bay are both suitable for windsurfing and surfing. Beginners can get to grips with the sport at Inishowen, which has some of the most consistent waves in Ireland, due to its exposure to rolling swells. Its long stretches of golden sandy beaches make for safe surfing conditions and a pleasant environment for newbies.Cook your catchCatch and cook your own dinner on a fishing trip with An Duanai Mara Boat Charters, based in the fishing town of Killybegs. On these deep-sea angling trips (combined with sightseeing trips around Donegal Bay), you’ll have the chance to reel in a cod, ling or turbot, watch the skipper fillet it, and then feast on it at nearby Kitty Kelly’s restaurant.Hike Glenveagh national parkGlenveagh national park is one of six in Ireland, encompassing some 16,000 hectares in the heart of the Derryveagh mountains. These lands were managed as a private deer forest before becoming a national park in 1975, and this is now bona fide wilderness, home to a lot of indigenous wildlife and rare plant species.Explore Ireland from the comfort of your own car with Irish Ferries.

Should you step in? Parents reveal the contrasting conflicts of instant fameWhen Charlotte D’Alessio was 16 she accidentally became a social media influencer. The Canadian-born teen had recently moved from Toronto to Los Angeles with her family when, in the spring of her first year in LA, she attended the music festival Coachella with a few of her new mates.While at Coachella, Charlotte and her friend Josie changed outfits several times, taking a few pictures of themselves in bodysuits, bikini tops and jean shorts (the typical Coachella nouveau-boho uniform) and posted them on social media. So far so normal. But when the successful LA photographer Bryant Eslava took some photos of the girls and tagged them on his account, their images began to go viral. Soon the girls were seeing themselves everywhere, featured in roundups of the festival and in the “popular” galleries of Tumblr and Instagram. They were gaining hundreds and thousands of followers by the minute and being followed by strangers who’d comment “I found them!” and then tag their image to their followers in turn.For Charlotte, a quiet, studious girl from Canada with ambitions to attend UCLA, it was entirely surreal. “I was honestly freaking out,” she says. And given what happened to her life after that, it was an appropriate reaction.BuzzFeed picked up the story with the headline: “Meet the 16-year-old whose Instagram made her Coachella famous,” and by the time Charlotte returned to high school on Monday morning, she was officially a new media It Girl. Her following on Instagram soon hit 100,000 – placing her firmly in the category of “micro-celebrity” – ie someone who is famous for being famous on social media. Today, her following is more than half a million and climbing.A modelling contract with Wilhelmina Models followed soon after and within a couple of months Charlotte had decided to drop out of school to pursue a career as a professional model and social media “influencer” (the line between the two professions can be blurry at best), and continue her studies by correspondence.She was not the only one to be surprised by this sudden turn of events.Watching from London was her mother, Christina Ford, a former commercial producer who had recently moved there with her new husband. Now in her early 50s, Ford had some experience with the world of show business and had always been determined to keep both her daughters well out of it until their education was complete. After years of carefully managing Charlotte’s homework and activities back in Toronto, she found that one trip to Coachella with a smartphone had rerouted her daughter’s entire life journey. “I was stunned,” says Ford, “I tried to talk her out of it. I flew to LA, but she wouldn’t see me or talk to me. She was absolutely determined to follow it through. We didn’t speak for more than a year.”Ford recounts how during this time she couldn’t bear to monitor her daughter on Twitter or Instagram, where her following continued to grow. Tensions also arose with her ex-husband, a commercial director with whom Charlotte lived, who was much more encouraging about their daughter’s new career. Friends would alert Ford to events in her daughter’s life (like the time she got a tongue piercing), all of which were being documented forensically by way of a long series of glamorous, often scantily clad, selfies. These photos, in turn, would be instantly “liked” by tens of thousands of people, the majority of them anonymous strangers.Then one day Ford walked into a London clothing boutique and saw a floor-to-ceiling in-store advert featuring her daughter. Her eyes well up remembering the moment. “I felt like I’d lost her completely and yet suddenly she was everywhere.”So how much do these influencers actually get paid and how do their “brand partnerships” work? It’s complicated. According to the influencer analytics platform Captiv8, the numbers range from very little or contra (in exchange for free stuff) to fairly impressive – at least at the top end of the business.YouTube is the pinnacle, with the highest earners – 7m subscribers or more – able to demand $300,000 for an ongoing video brand-partnership.On Instagram and Facebook, the biggest influencers are taking home anywhere between $150,000 to $187,000 per post. And even smaller “micro-influencers” with followings around 100,000 are able to command up to $5,000 per sponsored post – a pretty good living when you add it up at the end of the day.Christina Ford and her daughter have since made up. Charlotte flew back to Toronto for her maternal grandfather’s funeral and, after many months of stormy relations, mother and influencer were reconciled. But the whole experience has still been deeply strange for Ford. She recounts how, just last summer, she picked up Charlotte and a teenage girlfriend at Toronto airport. Unbeknown to Ford, the friend was also a social media star – the YouTube singing phenomenon, Madison Beer.“They were in the back of the car, chatting away and checking in on social to say they were in Toronto just like normal teenagers, and then suddenly Madison was like, ‘Oh God, it’s Drake Facetiming us. Should I answer?’”As Ford drove on, listening to her daughter and her friend chatting away in the back seat with one of the biggest hip-hop stars on the planet, she felt the world as she knew it shifting under the wheels of her car. “I thought: OK, she’s hanging out with Drake. I guess this is for real.”Ford is not the only influencer parent to have found herself flummoxed by the reality of her child’s new status. John Rivera, father of the American YouTuber and Instagram star Brent Rivera (who has more than 10m followers on the two platforms combined) tells the story of how, before he knew Brent was famous, he took his son and his brother to a local hockey game. They were watching the game when a mother approached and asked if Brent could look up and wave at her daughter a few rows back. “My daughter’s having a birthday party,” she reportedly explained. Brent obliged and all the girls started screaming.It was then that his father knew something was up. But with overnight – even accidental – fame comes responsibility and for many influencer parents navigating the murky waters of new media, show business can be confusing at best and terrifying at worst. What sort of advice can you give your kid about building a career in a world you barely understand? And how do you protect them from the legion of creepy “manager” types who are keen to get a cut of their earnings without offering much in return?Kelly Eastwood, a London-based influencer who started her style blog the London Chatter nearly 10 years ago, says parents should be wary of anyone offering their teen representation without a proven track record. She says she has an experienced manager herself now, but that’s only after almost a decade of building her following. “It’s actually the hard work of my generation of early bloggers which has paved the way for the new wave of Instagrammers coming up overnight. We worked for many years for no money at all and these new kids are just exploding on to the scene.”It makes sense, of course. As recently as five or six years ago, Eastwood’s job description was almost a laughable concept – and now it’s industry standard. “I remember once, years ago, going to a brand luncheon and all the women there were working at magazines and when I said what I did they literally looked at me like I’d just poured toxic waste in the salad. Now those same luncheon tables are mostly filled with bloggers like me who are big on Instagram.”Eastwood says her parents have been supportive of her work, even if they don’t always fully understand it. And she’s glad she found success as a social media star later in life (in her ripe old 30s), rather than in her teens. “Everyone in this world talks about their ‘brand’, but the truth is I know my brand because I know myself. You can fall into things when you’re young because it seems fun and free stuff is on offer, but you need to actually know who you are and what you want and what you like. Also, you should see the number of offers for free plastic surgery I get – it’s terrifying.”Most adults have a pretty linear notion of what “achievement” looks like: money, power and influence. But with children, the concept is far more ambiguous. Is a child who gives up their education in favour of making money or amassing a following actually more successful than the child who thrives in school? Moreover, what sort of values does a child actually learn from experiencing overnight success – and could you even shelter them from it if you wanted to? (Answer: only if you locked them in their room without a phone until they became old enough to vote.)As Tiff Lewis, the mother of Madison Lewis (a singing star on Musical.ly with more than 2.6m fans), recently mused in an interview: “You think you’re doing right by your child, but it’s hard when you don’t know what you’re doing. She’s just on here having fun as a kid, but then you realise, well, she could make a lot of money off this. Is that a smart thing we should do? It was scary as a parent not knowing who to turn to. Then, a little over a year ago, she let management start to take over, and again I had to wonder whether that was the right move. How do you know if any of this is what’s really best?”Personal security is another serious issue for the parents of teen influencers to consider. Christina Ford says she “went crazy with worry” when Buzzfeed published the name of her daughter’s LA high school. And she’s right to be concerned.Last November, the Dolan Twins (two American teens with more than 5m followers on YouTube) tried to organise an informal meet-and-greet with fans in London’s Hyde Park. The day before, they jumped on Twitter and announced to fans where they’d be and when. Shortly after doing so, they realised it was Remembrance Day, so they cancelled the gathering and apologised – but it was too late. Thousands of teenage fans gathered at the park the following day, only to be disappointed. The angry adolescent mob then erupted into a mini-riot in which several people were trampled and injured, and the police were forced to intervene.While some parents (like Ford) instinctively want to protect their children from the spotlight, others happily step into it themselves. Inspired by his daughter’s success, Charlotte D’Alessio’s father is reportedly starting his own Instagram magazine. Other parents leverage their kids’ fanbase even further, becoming professional influencers in their own right.Greg Paul and Pam Stepnick, the super-gregarious parents of Jake and Logan Paul (two of America’s biggest teen influencers on the planet, with more than 28m followers combined), regularly appear in their sons’ videos and have amassed huge followings themselves on YouTube and Instagram respectively. Pam and Greg regularly make “reaction videos” to their son’s vlogs, take part in pranks and feuds, stirring drama into the vlogosphere – and, of course, adding to the family income. The result is an exhaustive, 247 archive of the minutiae of family life that makes the Kardashian clan look shy and retiring by comparison.You won’t encounter many profound insights into the human condition watching the Paul brothers on YouTube, but you will find a certain amount of self-referential musing on just how strange it is to be a successful teen influencer in 2018. After moving from their home town of Westlake, Ohio, to Los Angeles, the teens branched out into other media, appearing in various TV shows and films, and even starting a company called TeamDom, which aims to be a “modern-day media conglomerate focused on building powerful brands, stories, celebrities and businesses around teen entertainment and media”. Or, as Jake Paul himself put it loftily: “I want to be the Dr Dre of social media.”As time moves on, the first generation of under-age influencers is now coming of age. Today, Charlotte D’Alessio is 20, signed to a new management company and attempting to “monetise her brand”. Her first serious boyfriend, Presley Gerber, the model son of Cindy Crawford and a fellow influencer (Insta following: 601,000 plus) also helps to keep her in the public eye. Paparazzi regularly tail the teen couple around Los Angeles and elsewhere.When Charlotte came to visit her mother in London over Christmas last year, she was stopped several times on the street for photographs by starstruck teenage fans. To Ford, who recently started a blog of her own about being a North American in London, her daughter’s overnight success is still difficult to grasp. “It’s hard for me to actually believe that she’s ‘famous’ because to my mind she hasn’t really done anything yet,” says Ford. “But she’s said to me: ‘Mom, I’ve got this window,’ and I get that.”Today, Charlotte is doing some modelling, but mostly she exists in the nebulous new world of Instagram models – a global league of (mostly) attractive and uninhibited young women with a substantial online following which leverages the eyeballs of their audience in exchange for glamorous party invitations, free trips, designer clothing, accessories, make-up and beauty treatments – and, at the highest levels, actual cold hard cash.How does her mother feel about it? Ford shrugs and smiles, her expression philosophical. “She’s an adult now and it’s her life, her choice, so I respect it. But I do sometimes think about all the money and time I spent on her education and, you know, carefully selecting her lessons and activities, all so that she could just become… famous for being famous. And that’s a job? It all seems so random.”How do parents teach their kids values in the era of overnight influencers? Not very easily. But here’s to one mother for trying."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/85e11c7dbe00ee43665b186629a67b5012756e92/0_260_4216_2530/master/4216.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=66b0812999f160cf0d8253a896ede2da","title":"porto portugal second city culture cafes shopping","story":"A decade ago, the city’s historic centre was badly rundown. Now, having been carefully restored, it’s filled with culture, cafes and unusual shopsSomething odd is happening in Porto’s most famous bookshop. We arrive in the middle of the morning, after a leisurely breakfast of coffee and custard-filled pastéis de nata. The queue to get inside runs around the next block. At the ticket office, where access to the bookshop can be achieved by purchasing a ticket for €5, we are assured that it will take only 30 minutes until our turn. You read that correctly: people pay €5, and wait half an hour, just to get into a bookshop.Mind you, Livraria Lello is not any old bookshop, which helps to explain the partyish atmosphere among the people waiting, with a busker playing jazz on the steps of a neighbouring department store.Built in 1906, the shop’s architecture is a startling mix of neo-gothic and art deco, with a stained-glass skylight and a red-painted twisting staircase that supposedly inspired JK Rowling when she started writing Harry Potter (Rowling worked in Porto as an English teacher from 1991 to 1993).Potter fans, leaping on this connection, were so keen to see the fantastical original that the shop couldn’t cope. The only way to deal with the flood was to charge for entry, with the price redeemable against a book if visitors choose to purchase one.Suddenly, a bookshop that was struggling with huge crowds who didn’t buy much became, in effect, a museum. And with well over a million visitors each year, a museum that is doing very nicely. It’s also caused a pleasing rebound in book sales. But it’s not the most relaxing place to browse for books: amid the swarm of visitors taking selfies and filming entire movies on their phones, it’s a bit like hoping to pause before the Mona Lisa and take your own sweet time examining Leonardo’s brushstrokes.Happily, other parts of Porto are not so overwhelmingly crowded, though locals report a massive change from around 2005 when much of the old town centre was deserted.Richard Zimler, author of the bestselling Last Kabbalist of Lisbon, moved to Porto from San Francisco with his husband in 1990. It was very different then. Today, he’s something of a celebrity here: in 2017 he was awarded the city’s Medal of Honour. Describing the enormous change the city has witnessed over the past decade, he cuts through the queue from Livraria Lello to show a colourful historic street with bunting. This street, like many others, was empty and sad until a thriving movement of pop-up shops, and a determined mayor, revitalised the city centre.Cheap flights increased the number of tourists, and large areas overlooking the beautiful Douro river, previously used by industries such as the port wine trade, became available for renovation.The department store where the busker is playing provides a beautiful example of the newly confident city. A Vida Portuguesa, housed in a 19th-century warehouse, sells an inspired edit of Portuguese products – soaps, classic toys, ceramics, linens and more. In a globalised market where it can feel at times as though all products available anywhere are exactly the same, it’s wonderful to see so many exquisite things that are utterly unfamiliar.And big brands from outside are keen to be part of Porto’s moment. The city’s grand and atmospheric hotel, Infante Sagres, has been painstakingly renovated. Next door, it has opened a Vogue Café (only a few cities around the world can boast one of these). We happened to be in town when guests arrived for the grand opening, from all over Portugal and beyond.Throughout the city, threaded together by charming old wooden trams, Beaux Arts buildings are being renovated so that new cafés and boutiques can blossom. The Majestic Café, the city’s most famous café, was saved a few years ago from decay and is now back to its former glory. Newer buildings are added with great care, such as a complex of shops entirely covered with a living roof, creating a new city park with trees.Porto is a good-looking city, its granite buildings packed into a hilly landscape, many of them decorated on the outside with azulejos, the stunning blue and white tiles that are a defining feature of this place. The entrance to the São Bento station is particularly memorable, covered in some 20,000 of these tiles depicting key moments in the history of Portugal.We wander down the recently pedestrianised Rua das Flores with its pretty balconied houses and azulejo-clad Igreja da Misericordia. In a side alley there’s a striking blue and white mural of a cat on a wall several storeys high. We stop off for a craft beer and a plate of organic cheese and salamis at the Mercearia das Flores.Here we find Claus Porto, Porto’s most famous soap brand, founded 130 years ago. Claus Porto is the brand that soap connoisseurs have bought as much for the beautiful packaging as the delicious soaps inside. The Porto shop opened last year, designed by the renowned Portuguese architect João Mendes Ribeiro. Upstairs, a museum traces the history of the brand, the distinctive wrappers redolent of the 20th century’s changing fashions in illustration.Porto is hilly but walkable. From the Infante Sagres, it’s an easy stroll through the historic Ribeira district, classified by Unesco as a World Heritage Site. Climbing through the tangle of medieval streets to the old Jewish quarter, we find ourselves on a high terrace and admire the view across the city to the Douro. On the opposite bank in Vila Nova de Gaia, huge signposts among the riverside restaurants emblazon names of the iconic port lodges: Taylor’s, Sandeman, Croft, Fonseca, Symington, Calem...Just below we find Armazém (warehouse in Portuguese), a vintage market full of fabulous antiques and a great place for lunch. Then a drink on the riverbank, which is splattered with brightly coloured houses in reds, blues and yellows. We wander across the bridge, built by a disciple of Gustave Eiffel. There’s one crossing just above the river, and another immensely higher: there can be few better places to get a sense of the city, and the powerful river.On the far side, in Vila Nova de Gaia, we look back on Porto from the terrace of the Yeatman Hotel (part of the same group that owns Taylor’s and the newly restored Infante Sagres) where we enjoy a chilled white port. Below us, extensive building work is taking place to build a World of Wine – there are to be cafés, restaurants and museum space dedicated to the history of the city of Porto, Portuguese fashion and the amazing natural material that is cork.We cross back into Porto, past the imposing cathedral, and hear the evening bells of the landmark Torre de Clerigos as we approach our hotel. We’ve time before dinner to climb the 225-step spiral staircase to the top, and catch the best view of all over the city.• Claus Porto for fabulous handcrafted soaps and skincare, plus hot towel shaves.

The final document, which could include changes, will then be put to a national referendum.The draft omits a clause in the 1976 constitution on the ultimate aim of building a communist society, instead simply focusing on socialism.“This does not mean we are renouncing our ideas,” the president of the national assembly, Esteban Lazo, was quoted as saying by state-run media. Cuba had simply moved into a different era following the fall of the Soviet Union, he said. “We believe in a socialist, sovereign, independent, prosperous and sustainable country.”Unveiling the new constitution to lawmakers on Saturday, the secretary of the council of state, Homero Acosta, said it included the recognition of private property, a principle long stigmatised by the Communist party as a vestige of capitalism.That change should give greater legal recognition to the micro-businesses that have flourished following market reforms to the ailing state-run economy. They have fostered a small but vibrant private sector and attempted to attract more foreign investment.Cuba’s current constitution recognises only state, cooperative, farmer, personal and joint-venture property.The draft also appears to strengthen political institutions and create a more collective leadership structure, after nearly 60 years of rule by the late revolutionary leader, Fidel Castro ,and his younger brother, Raul Castro.Castro, then 86, handed over the presidency in April to his mentee Miguel Díaz-Canel, 58, although he remains head of the Communist party until 2021. He also heads the constitutional reform commission.Under the new constitution, the president will no longer be the head of the council of state and council of ministers. Instead, it creates the position of prime minister and designates the president of the assembly also as head of the council of state, Cuba’s highest executive body.One of the other top items at the assembly on Saturday was the recognition in the draft constitution of marriage as being between two iniduals rather than a man and a woman.The draft also sets age and term limits for presidents, stating they must be under 60 when they first take office and can carry out no more than two consecutive five-year terms.Reflecting the desired gradual generational transition in Cuba’s leadership, Díaz-Canel named his cabinet at the start of the assembly meeting on Saturday, promoting two officials in their 50s to become vice-presidents alongside two sitting octogenarians and a septuagenarian.Díaz-Canel kept a majority of ministers from Castro including in the key posts of defence, the interior, trade and foreign relations, in line with his April promise to provide continuity.Marino Murillo, the head of the Communist party’s reform commission and previously one of the council of ministers’ vice-presidents, was the only senior figure omitted from the new lineup.Under Castro, Murillo spearheaded changes to the state-run economy and he remains head of the reform commission and a member of the political bureau.The reforms have slowed in recent years amid fears they have allowed some Cubans to enrich themselves, fostering inequality, and weakened the control of the state.This month Cuba issued regulations tightening control of the private sector and limiting business licences to one per person."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/764170617b7c5a13aeb4cfe8993bcc0af1c3bc22/0_25_4122_2473/master/4122.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4a6a4825f085dbf40042086e3f5b5319","title":"german leftwingers woo voters with national social stance","story":"Opponents adopt each other’s policy angles as left launches movement to counter AfDLeftwing politicians are singing the praises of border control while rightwingers call for expanding the welfare state. Old political certainties could be turned upside down in Germany this summer as the far ends of the country’s political spectrum both moot a “national social” turn.A new leftwing movement soft-launching in Germany in August aims to part ways with what one of its founders calls the “moralising” tendency of the left, in an attempt to win back working-class voters from the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD).The as-yet-unnamed new populist movement, partly inspired by the British Labour party’s Momentum and Jean-Luc Mélenchon’s La France Insoumise, and spearheaded by the leftwing party Die Linke’s chairwoman, Sahra Wagenknecht, will include former and current members of the Social Democratic and Green parties, and prominent academics such as the sociologist Wolfgang Streeck.According to one of the movement’s founders, its defining feature is likely to be its adherence to “the materialist left, not the moral left”.“When people live in social conditions that make them feel secure, they are usually prepared to act generously and tolerantly,” said Bernd Stegemann, an author and dramatist at the prestigious Berliner Ensemble theatre who is working with Wagenknecht on the movement’s programme.“When they live in increasingly precarious and atomised conditions, however, they are also likely to react to challenges in a tougher and colder manner. Brecht summarised it wonderfully. Grub comes first, then ethics.”As well as rallying around traditional leftwing causes such as disarmament and a reversal of Germany’s Hartz IV labour market reforms, an unsigned position paper circulating around Berlin political circles in recent weeks suggests the movement will also advocate law and order policies and a tougher stance on immigration. “Open borders in Europe means more competition for badly paid jobs,” says the paper, which is headed “fairland”.Stegemann, who is not a member of any political party, said he was frustrated with middle-class leftwing intellectuals lecturing working-class Germans for their sceptical reaction to Angela Merkel’s decisions at the height of the refugee crisis.“We are dealing with an absurd situation when the winners of neoliberalism tell the losers that they must be more humane. And it galls me when politicians think it is enough to pass down moral judgments. No, politics must act.”The launch of the new movement, which will start as an online forum where supporters can upload and visualise policy proposals, comes as the AfD is trying to win over disappointed Die Linke supporters in the former states of East Germany. It is doing so by occupying positions on social welfare usually associated with the left.Non-Germans are largely excluded from the AfD’s newly discovered welfare initiatives. A proposed “state resident’s pension” of €190 a month could only be claimed by German citizens who have worked in the country for more than 35 years.Björn Höcke, the far-right politician who has emerged as the leading architect of AfD’s “national social” identity in the east, has argued that “the German social question of the 21st century” is not primarily the redistribution of national wealth from top to bottom, or old to young, but “inside to outside”.For both Die Linke and the AfD, the new “national social” formations – as a recent article in Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung dubbed the new political initiative – face opposition from within their own parties. There are fears among the former’s strategists and activists that the new movement’s launch proper in early September could backfire and destroy Die Linke’s already low chances of entering parliament at Bavarian state elections in October.Wagenknecht is a widely recognised politician whose rhetorical gifts have made hera regular presence on Germany’s political talkshows, but critics inside her own party say her popularity is an illusion. Unlike Labour’s Momentum, her new movement has so far mainly attracted older white men. In terms of policy, she runs counter to the successful socially liberal, pro-refugee Berlin branch of Die Linke, which is leading polls for state elections in 2021.Inside Alternative für Deutschland, calls for higher pensions and rallying cries against labour market deregulation clash with the official positions of the party’s upper ranks, where its leader, Alice Weidel, advocates Swiss-style pension funds as the model for Germany to follow, and its deputy leader, Beatrix von Storch, rails against high taxes on Twitter.Manual workers who used to vote for the far right or far left in protestare increasingly solidifying their identification with the AfD, Dörre said. “They used to be a fluctuating protest movement, but now they follow the party line.”One of the anonymous case studies quoted in the study, a previously “exemplary” union activist who had fought for solidarity with Czech temporary workers, expressed views that crossed over from “national social” to national socialism: “In my view, the refugees have to go away ... I wouldn’t have a problem if they opened up Buchenwald again, put barbed wire around it, them inside, us outside.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/445b8bd82f99e44f59a17f3253207d89be027554/0_374_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a8c53965e962fc0ff194a54a2333e062","title":"heatwave northen hemisphere uk algeria canada sweden whats the cause","story":"Last week, authorities in Sweden took an unusual step. They issued an appeal for international aid to help them tackle an epidemic of wildfires that has spread across the nation over the past few days.After months without rain, followed by weeks of soaring temperatures, the nation’s forests had become tinderboxes.The result was inevitable. Wildfires broke out and, by the end of last week, more than 50 forest blazes – a dozen inside the Arctic circle – had spread across Sweden.A nation famous for its cold and snow found itself unable to cope with the conflagrations taking place within its border and so made its appeal for international help, a request that has already been answered by Norway and Italy who have both sent airborne firefighting teams to help battle Sweden’s blazes.Nor is the nation’s fiery fate particularly unusual at present. Across much of the northern hemisphere, intense and prolonged heatwaves have triggered disruption and devastation as North America, the Arctic, northern Europe and Africa have sweltered in record-breaking temperatures. In Africa, a weather station at Ouargla, Algeria, in the Sahara desert, recorded a temperature of 51.3C, the highest reliable temperature ever recorded in Africa. In Japan, where temperatures have reached more than 40C, people were last week urged to take precautions after the death toll reached 30 with thousands more having sought hospital treatment for heat-related conditions. And in California increased use of air conditioning units, switched on to counter the scorching conditions there, has led to power shortages.But perhaps the strangest impact of the intense heat has been felt in Canada. It too has been gripped by ferocious heat, with Toronto recording temperatures that have exceeded 30C on 18 days so far this year. This figure compares with only nine such days all last summer.Dozens have died in the withering heat – with startling and grim consequences. Montreal’s morgue has been swamped with the bodies of those who have died because of the heat, and many corpses have had to be stored elsewhere in the city. Montreal coroner Jean Brochu said it was first time the city’s morgue had been overwhelmed this way.Britain’s scorching weather – which has melted the roof of Glasgow’s Science Centre and parched the lawns of the nation’s historic homes – may have made regular UK headlines. However, it has been relatively mild in impact compared to those experienced in many other parts of the world.Far from being a parochial problem, the current heatwave is clearly an issue that affects vast stretches of our planet: a global concern not a local one.But why is so much of our world currently being afflicted with blisteringly hot weather? What is driving the wildfires, the soaring temperatures and those melting rooftops? These are tricky questions to answer, such is the complex nature of the planet’s weather systems. Most scientists point to a number of factors with global warming being the most obvious candidate. Others warn that it would be wrong to overstate its role in the current heatwaves, however.“Yes, it is hard not to believe that climate change has to be playing a part in what is going on round the globe at present,” said Dann Mitchell of Bristol University. “There have been some remarkable extremes recorded in the past few weeks, after all. However, we should take care about overstating climate change’s influence for it is equally clear there are also other influences at work.”One of those other factors is the jet stream – a core of strong winds around five to seven miles above the Earth’s surface that blow from west to east and which steer weather around the globe. Sometimes, when they are intense, they bring storms. On other occasions, when they are weak, they bring very calm and settled days. And that is what is occurring at present.“The jet stream we are currently experiencing is extremely weak and, as a result, areas of atmospheric high pressure are lingering for long periods over the same place,” added Mitchell.Other factors involved in creating the meteorological conditions that have brought such heat to the northern hemisphere include substantial changes to sea surface temperatures in the North Atlantic. “These are part of a phenomenon known as the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation,” said Professor Adam Scaife, of the Met Office.“In fact, the situation is very like the one we had in 1976, when we had similar ocean temperatures in the Atlantic and an unchanging jet stream that left great areas of high pressure over many areas for long periods,” said Scaife.“And of course, that year we had one of the driest, sunniest and warmest summers in the UK in the 20th century.”However, there is one crucial difference between 1976 and today, added Professor Tim Osborn, director of research at the Climatic Research Unit, University of East Anglia. “The baseline on which these effects operated is very different today. Since 1976 we have had several decades of global warming – caused by rising carbon emissions – which has raised baseline global temperatures significantly.”As a result, any phenomenon such as the weakening of the jet stream is going to have a more pronounced effect than it did 40 years ago.And as global carbon emissions continue to rise and predictions suggest the world will be unable to hold global temperature rises this century to below 2C above pre-industrial levels, widespread heatwaves are very likely to get worse and become more frequent, scientists warn.Nor is the problem of increasingly severe heatwaves confined to the land. “We have marine heatwaves as well – all over the globe,” said Michael Burrows, of the Scottish Marine Institute, Oban. “For example, there was a major marine heatwave that struck the coast of Australia last year. It devastated vast swathes of the Great Barrier Reef. More to the point, marine heatwaves are also becoming more and more frequent and intense, like those on land, and that is something else that we should be very worried about.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/36615a1beffe79c4e2932c69bc2a2cf6f564c5d7/0_0_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4b25f89ba07e6bcb7a6e37105f3a548b","title":"price of peace calm returns to damascus as assad eyes victory","story":"Syria’s civil war seems to be nearing end amid government advances - but at appalling costCrossing into Syria from neighbouring Lebanon, visitors are greeted by giant posters of the country’s president, Bashar al-Assad. The signs proclaim: “Welcome to victorious Syria.”In the capital, Damascus, many of the checkpoints that for years have snarled traffic are gone. The city is again connected to its sprawling suburbs, once held by the opposition, and many former residents and visitors from other parts of Syria have returned.There’s a new feeling of hope that an end is near to Syria’s seven-year civil war.“It is almost over,” said Nazeer Habash, 60,as he walked home near the Hijaz train station in central Damascus. “It is like a child when he starts to walk, taking one step after another, and victory will always be on our side.”Half a million people have been killed in Syria’s civil war, the vast majority of them by the Assad regime, according to independent monitors. Half the country’s population has been displaced.UN investigators have blamed Assad for atrocities including chemical attacks using nerve agent and chlorine, including a 2013 attack near Damascus that killed more than 1,000 people. Thousands remain in arbitrary detention in the regime’s dungeons, and government forces have conducted starvation sieges in various parts of the country to force the opposition into surrender.Backed by the firepower of the Russian air force and on the ground by Tehran-funded militias, the Syrian regime has clawed back much territory throughout the war-torn country and forced the capitulation of rebel groups, who have surrendered the momentum in the war.The celebratory mood in government-controlled areas stems from successive military advances in the past year.It is fed by a feeling that Assad, thanks to unwavering support from allies Russia and Iran, has won — or at least has defeated those opposition fighters trying to topple him.The country has suffered catastrophic damage and some aspects of the conflict are far from over. Still, many Syrians — even some among the opposition — are hoping for some degree of security and stability.The government now controls major opposition strongholds and key cities such as Aleppo, Homs and even Deraa, the southern city where the uprising was born from protests in March 2011.The vital border crossing with Jordan, sealed for years, is expected to reopen soon after troops recaptured Deraa province, and hopes are high for the resumption of trade and Syrian exports to Arab countries.Syrians can now drive all the way from the Jordanian border in the south to the central province of Hama on one of the country’s most important highways, which was severed by insurgents for years in several locations. There is talk that the railway from Damascus to Aleppo might resume operations later this year.The latest government triumph came this week when rebels agreed to surrender their last pockets of control in Quneitra province in the south-west, opening the way for Assad’s forces to re-establish authority along the Israeli frontier.“The direct threat to Damascus has ended. And since it’s the capital, its conditions affect all other parts of the country,” said Rami al-Khayer, 27, as he sipped a hot drink with a friend at the famous Nofara cafe in the capital’s old quarter.The scene in devastated areas once controlled by rebels outside Damascus is starkly different. But even amid the ruins there, life is slowly returning to normal, with more businesses reopening and people tricking back.In Douma, the largest town near Damascus and the site of an alleged chemical attack in April, trucks and bulldozers work around the clock to clear the remains of destroyed buildings, sending up clouds of dust.The operation in Douma is the start of a long process to clear debris from eastern Ghouta, the towns and villages east of Damascus that were held by rebels and under siege by government forces for five years. Until the rebels surrendered in the spring, the residents suffered under food shortages, with cases of malnutrition reported. Now, almost everything is available, although prices are still too steep for many.Two months ago, Mohammed Sleik reopened his sandwich shop near Douma’s badly damaged Grand Mosque. During the siege, he had to search for supplies now they are brought to his door.“Things are getting better but slowly,” Sleik said as he prepared a sandwich of french fries in pitta bread for a customer at his shop, named Zaman al-Sham, Arabic for “Era of the Levant.”He said he sells about 170 sandwiches a day, more than three times what he sold before government forces captured the area. Sleik has six employees at his shop, where the menu includes beans, falafel and fries.Stores are reopening on Douma’s main Jalaa street, and shoppers on a recent day were buying farm produce, clothes and shoes.In nearby Ain Terma, a town that suffered much heavier destruction than Douma because it is closer to the capital, residents complain that electricity and running water are still scarce. They must rely on generators for power and tanker trucks to deliver water to their homes.The International Committee of the Red Cross, the Syrian Arab Red Crescent and NGOs such as Oxfam have placed giant red plastic tanks of drinking water every 100 metres in the streets of Ain Terma and Douma so residents can fill containers for free.“Now we have a state here,” said Taha Aboud, 60, owner of a shoe repair shop in Ain Terma. Every day, he said, government trucks distributed bread for free.After being hemmed in for years, Ghouta residents can travel to and from Damascus, although they must register at checkpoints when they enter and leave. “We were living underground, and now we are above,” said Samih Hanafi, standing outside his barber’s shop in Ain Terma.“We see that victory will be very near, and we see the end of the conflict coming soon,” she said as her daughter ran around the garden.“I hope that my daughter will become a teacher like myself so that she teaches the future generations to love their country.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/81b81d6d4dd78c199371ab0c239479643722076a/0_84_2982_1789/master/2982.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1f67dd44857d14a4331d3bf198615dfa","title":"spanish peoples party shifts to right with new leader","story":"Pablo Casado elected in poll as conservative party faces string of corruption scandalsSpain’s conservative People’s party (PP), which was cast out of government at the beginning of June after a string of corruption scandals, has shifted further to the right by choosing an outspokenly traditionalist MP as its new leader.Pablo Casado, who served as the party’s communications vice-secretary and was also chief of staff to the former prime minister José María Aznar, was elected in a poll of PP members on Saturday. Casado, 37, said he would not disappoint those who had backed him.“Today, a new and ambitious stage in our future has begun,” he said after his victory. “The PP will try to win back the hearts of all Spaniards. We need to return to the core of Spanish society so that our work cannot be undone.”The task, however, will not be easy. Casado’s predecessor, Mariano Rajoy, was forced from office two months ago after the socialist PSOE party seized on mounting anger over PP corruption to call a successful vote of no confidence.Questions have also been raised about the some of Casado’s qualifications, after it emerged that the postgraduate degree he claims to hold from Harvard had in fact been earned by attending a four-day course in Madrid. He has also admitted that he was awarded a master’s degree in public regional law by a Spanish university despite not being required to attend classes or take exams.The PP’s traditional place in Spanish politics has come under heavy attack from the Citizens party, which outflanked Casado’s party on the right at the height of the Catalan crisis and could become the country’s biggest rightwing party.Marking out his territory on Saturday, Casado said the PP was the party “that defends life and the family”. He has criticised the new PSOE government’s plans to introduce a euthanasia law and said that abortion “is not a right”.He has also ruled out negotiations with the pro-independence regional government of Catalonia over the unity of Spain and the country’s constitution.In an interview with OKDiario, he said: “There’s nothing to negotiate and I think the recent past has shown that they always deceive you.”Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, congratulated Casado on Twitter, wishing him luck “with the task ahead”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/877d1ce5ee1b9c313f831d8ec371f2be9ef25cf0/740_905_3551_2130/master/3551.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=61e127931cf038fff1a9f0dd21c505e3","title":"the black man in the ku klux klan","story":"The local KKK leader thought he’d found an enthusiastic new recruit. In fact, he’d inadvertently signed up a black policeman. Ron Stallworth reveals the often hilarious saga that has now become a Spike Lee filmIt is late October, 1978, in Colorado Springs when Ken O’Dell, a closet member of the newly resurgent Ku Klux Klan, receives an encouraging sign that his strategy of placing ads in the personal section of the local paper for new recruits has met with some success. Ken has been sent a letter from a man called Ron Stallworth. Ron, he says in his letter, wants to “further the cause of the white race” – and to join the Klan. Before long the two men are in enthusiastic telephone contact. Ken, who loathes blacks, Jews, Catholics and any other minority he can think of, sees Ron as a kindred spirit. Indeed, Ken is so impressed by Ron that, over the coming months, he will not only make sure that Ron gains membership and full access to the Klan, but he’ll even tout him as a future leader of the local chapter. Unfortunately for Ken, there are a couple of things about Ron he doesn’t know –and won’t know until 28 years later when Ron reveals them in a newspaper interview. First, Ron is an undercover police officer. Second – and this never fails to crack Ron up every time he thinks of it – Ron is black. “I was having a lot of fun,” he says.The story of how a black police officer infiltrated the KKK is at first so hard to wrap your mind around that you may question how it can possibly be true. But once you’ve taken account of the state of late 1970s technology, it becomes easier to understand how such an audacious and thrilling police sting could ever have come into being. No internet, no smart phones: resurgent underground terrorist organisations have to rely on letter writing and telephone calls for their secret communications. Ken has no way of knowing, for example, that the voice on the other end of the telephone line, fulminating against “slaves” and “mud people” belongs to anyone but what Ken likes to call “an intelligent white man” – like himself. Ken falls for it.“Fortunately the people I was dealing with weren’t the brightest bulbs in the socket,” Ron says. What happened next is the proudest, most off-the-wall moment of his career in law enforcement. “It was so hilariously funny that this was even taking place. But funny as it was, it was an investigation that we took seriously – because the Klan’s intent was very serious.”I stumbled across Ron’s story last year in an article written in 2006 in the Desert News, a Utah newspaper. Ron was well known for having set up the state’s first Gang Task Force, but when asked to name his most significant career achievement he dropped a bombshell and said: “The year I went undercover with the KKK.” The story went viral.I tracked Ron Stallworth down in El Paso, Texas, the border town where he’d grown up. Ron, now 65, is living a comfortable married life. He is retired, though still deeply loyal to the police force, and there is a grouchy rebelliousness to him: “I don’t care what they think,” he says calmly when I ask him what his former colleagues, his parents, the KKK, the world make of his surveillance work, or anything else. Ron was 21 when he joined the police as a patrol officer – the only black person working in the entire department. The Klan investigation came out of the blue, four years later – what a gift to a spirited and ambitious young cop. At one point in our conversation he opens his wallet to show me a memento: his Klan membership card, issued in 1979. He was ordered, on its termination, to destroy all evidence of the investigation, but it’s typical of Ron’s rebellious nature to have kept the card anyway.There’d been talk over the years of his story being made into the film – it had never happened. But shortly before I first made contact with Ron, the director Spike Lee had finally given the project the green light. Ron tells me he is very excited, “somewhat overwhelmed”, that the film director is flying him to New York for a read-through of his film adaptation of Ron’s life. “Spike has been very respectful, he has said he values my opinion.” BlacKkKlansman is going to be a return to form for Lee, predict critics: a strong contender for film of the year when it’s released next month. Lee cast John David Washington as the younger Ron. The older Ron admits that, as an admirer of Denzel Washington, he is excited to see what the actor’s son will make of the role.It’s baffling that it has taken more than two decades for such an astonishing story to be adapted. “It wouldn’t have been made if Trump wasn’t occupying the White House” (Ron won’t dignify the present incumbent with the word “President”): Charlottesville, where last August neo-Nazis and white nationalists clashed with anti-fascist demonstrators, accelerated Lee’s race to get the film finished. The question arises, how could Ron, a black man, have possibly embedded himself in a white supremacist organisation? What happened when he had to meet these people in the flesh? “I called my friend Chuck,” Ron says.It was never actually intended to be a sting, explains Ron. The police were worried at the time, and wanted to find out more about Klan activities, so Ron did some homework. “When I saw that ad in the newspaper I wrote back, thinking they’d just send me some pamphlets.” Instead, Ken O’Dell called him directly, identifying himself as the local organiser of “The Cause”. Ron hadn’t been prepared for that phone call, but he’d had the presence of mind to include in his letter an untraceable number which fed directly into the police department. That said, he also made two howling errors: he’d signed his letter to the KKK ad with his own name, and “I broke the most basic rule of all and that was going into a case without a plan of operation.” Talking to Ken that first time, Ron improvised as best he could: “My sister was recently involved with a nigger,” Ron angrily told Ken during the phone call, “and every time I think about him putting his filthy black hands on her pure white body I get disgusted and sick to my stomach.” “You’re the kind of person we’re looking for,” said Ken. “When can we meet?”Chuck now enters, stage left. Ron decided there needed to be two Ron Stallworths: the black version (himself) who would continue written correspondence and manage the untraceable phone line and the white version, Chuck, a friend of Ron’s who worked in the narcotics department, who would deal with the KKK’s cloak-and-dagger meet-ups when they arose.Chuck was game but senior staff were against the idea, arguing: “They’ll know you’re a black man from the sound of your voice.” Ron explains how US law enforcement was at the time somewhat confused between its own prejudices and its determination to crack down on race hate crimes. It didn’t want a replay of the riots of the late 1960s and early 70s. White supremacist groups and, at the other extreme, Black Panthers, covertly or not, advocated armed combat. In Denver, the Klan had recently burned several 14ft crosses in strategic locations a black man escorting a white woman to the cinema had been shot dead antisemitism was on the rise. African-Americans did not take well to Ron joining the police force, he says: “I was too ‘white’, too ‘blue’” his white colleagues, meanwhile, gawped at his Afro.“I didn’t care, and I still don’t care what anyone thought,” says Ron. He charmed and bulldozed the powers-that-be that not every black person “shucked and jived”, or engaged in criminal behaviour. “They harboured no bigotry against me personally, but hadn’t reached the point where they could see past their stereotypes.”The grocery and bicycle store on Main Street, Colorado Springs, are no longer there, but the Kwik Inn is still standing. A 1950s diner, it looks exactly as it did when Ken chose it as the location for his first meeting with Ron. He was to turn up there at 7pm where he’d be met by a skinny, cigar-smoking white man with a Fu Manchu moustache, who would take him to a secret location to discuss Ron’s eligibility for membership of the Klan. Chuck, the “white Ron”, set off, wired up, with the black Ron and a second narcotics investigator called Jimmy trailing his movements from a surveillance vehicle.A mile or so later, the skinny cigar smoker pulled up outside a e bar that the local Klan used as its recruitment centre. Ken was inside with another man, and a Klan membership form for Ron. Ken was 28, short and stocky – an army man. The military base, Fort Carson, was a short drive away. Ken boasted that, under him, the Crusader, the Klan newspaper, was now widely circulating in Colorado prisons and military staff were secretly joining in droves. What is certainly true is that many white military men resented the new black presence among their officers – a perfect opportunity for the Klan to widen its base. Ken was satisfied that Ron didn’t have “any Jew in him”, and explained that membership cost $10, but new recruits had to pay extra for a robe and cloak.It was often, says Ron, very hard not to burst out laughing at the credulity and the petty officiousness of the Klan members. Back at the police station, he recalls, “My sergeant would sometimes be laughing so hard he’d have to excuse himself from the room.”Only once did any members of the Klan get suspicious. “Chuck had been to a meeting with the Klan members and there had been something I wanted to follow up on so, a couple of hours after Chuck left the meeting, I called Ken. He immediately said: ‘What’s wrong with your voice?’ So I coughed a bit and said I had a sinus infection. Ken proceeded to prescribe me a remedy. He said: ‘I get those all the time.’”The deeper the investigation probed, the less laughable the inept Klansmen became. Soon after that first meeting, Ken called Ron to invite him to his house. Ken and a small group of “losers” (Ron’s words) were assembled in the living room, including the group’s second-in-command, its treasurer and a bodyguard. Plans to burn four 17ft crosses were discussed and finalised: everyone in the group agreed it would be a deeply moving religious experience. Publicly, the Klan were against violence. Ken gave White Ron the tour of his own personal arsenal, which included 13 shotguns, plus the weapons he carried in his vehicles.As special guests at his next rendezvous, Ken invited the leaders of a powerful Nazi survivalist group, Posse Comitatus. Together they watched a screening of a nationalist film and discussed collaborating on terrorist activities.David Duke, the white supremacist politician and a holocaust denier, is still an influential person in American political life. In May, he accused Trump of “stealing” his Build The Wall slogan, which he’d coined in the 1970s. At the time of Ron’s investigation, Duke was the Klan’s newly appointed leader or Grand Wizard: a clean-cut and reasonable-seeming man “He was a Dr Jekyll but he’d turn into Mr Hyde in private conversations,” remembers Ron. In the pivotal breakthrough in the case, Ron was put on to Duke to check the status of his membership card.Duke is a PR man to his core. In the view of the Far Right, his greatest achievement was conferring respectability on the KKK, banning his members from wearing hoods and robes in public, and aligning “The Cause” with fundamental Christianity and dissatisfaction with the government. “Duke was a con artist,” says Ron. “His appearance was that of an all-American boy every mother would want as a prom date for her daughter.” “Racial Purity Is America’s Security” is the slogan he used when he ran for Louisiana state senator – as a Democrat. Ron established a friendly relationship with Duke over the phone. He describes him as “a very pleasant conversationalist”. Duke presided over Chuck’s solemn candle-lit naturalisation ceremony. “I laugh all the time about our investigation, especially about making a fool of David Duke, who likes to think I don’t have the intelligence of an ape because he thinks I’m genetically inferior,” says Ron. “How I conned the Grand Wizard, David Duke, and his coterie of followers… It has defined me in ways I never could have imagined.”As fascinating as Ron’s story is, what did he actually achieve? The sting never resulted in any arrests and when, months in, the Klan unexpectedly nominated Ron as its local group leader, he was forced to shut down the investigation. If the story got out, Colorado police worried it would be misconstrued: in the 1920s, Denver’s head of police was a Klansman. But through their work, Chuck and Ron had foiled a Neo-Nazi plot to nail-bomb a gay bar and identified seven Klansman army personnel. They’d discovered where the local Klan kept its money. Ron also uncovered intelligence regarding violent plots among black extremists. In mid-1979, the investigation was terminated. A year later Duke left the Klan to form the National Association for the Advancement of White People. Ron followed his career in law enforcement to Wyoming, Arizona and Utah, specialising in gangs. When he retired in 2006, he gave that bombshell newspaper interview. The FBI called him after the piece went viral: Ron’s name, picture and alleged home address had been published on white supremacist websites. “After that, I started carrying a gun again,” he tells me. Was he frightened? “I have never had a fear of white people. As a child, if anyone called me a nigger, my mother would say: ‘I hope you whipped his ass!’” As for the film, he says: “Spike’s take on the book is pretty accurate,” Ron says. “I got a lot of joy from telling my story.” I can hear him smiling on the other end of the phone.Black Klansman by Ron Stallworth (£7.99, Arrow) will be published on 29 July. Spike Lee’s film BlacKkKlansman is released on 24 August. Special nationwide screenings and Live Satellite Q\u0026ampA with Spike Lee on is on 20 August (blackkklansmanscreening).

Flash floods, carving through a layer of ochreous clay, have deepened its bed decade by decade, so that the tangle of fuchsia bushes arching from its banks now hide and muffle its day-to-day passage below.At the umpteenth day of drought I took binoculars across the road to look at the stream in the open ravine that ides the sheep’s rocky meadow. Down among mossy boulders, a slow gleam showed.Like our neighbours, we once depended wholly on the stream, piped to the house by gravity from one of its higher pools. Ours needed a tight little dam of rocks and sods to keep water above the pipe’s end. A flood of rain could sweep the dam away a drought could leave the pipe sucking air.Either way meant a long trudge up the hill. In summer sun that could be blissful: a big blue sea and chirping wheatears. Backside to the wind, in Paul Durcan’s treasured phrase, it was often more of a penance.Today we have the luxury of pumped water. With a well drilled down to 240ft (73m – at the deeper range of some 100,000 such wells in the nation), why should I bother if the stream is still running?It gathers itself in a small stretch of bog in the lap of the ridge. I have seen this, perhaps too breezily, as our upland reservoir. If months of drought dry it up, what then? An accomplished worrier, I choose to discount the endless, squelching abundance of the spring.I also try to picture what it’s like, down at the well pipe’s end. A big pond full of water, replenished by trickles from above? Or a crevice that will just keep flowing, so long as we don’t flush too often?The man with the rig, from Donegal and an excellent judge of these things, stopped the remorseless rumble and chatter of the drill when enough of the right-coloured water came gushing up. Then the health people had to test it, or we wouldn’t get a county grant. But no iron, sulphate, arsenic or E coli just sometimes, in a frosty winter, a bit cold to drink from the tap.According to the map of The Geology of South Mayo, our hillside wedge of bedrock is “grey-green lithic turbidic sandstones with blue-grey slates with black laminae”. They came from the seabed of the vanished ocean of Iapetus and were fractured and cracked in the big heave into mountains,.But there’s sandstone and there’s sandstone. The Environmental Protection Agency says: “In contrast with most other EU countries, the bedrock aquifers in Ireland have fissure permeability only.” Water flow, it insists, “is predominantly through fissures or fractures and not through pore spaces in the rock itself”. That’s clearly true of much limestone, but some dense, fine-grained Irish sandstone can also be as hard as steel.For much of the natural world, meanwhile, the trials of drought are recurrent and familiar. A holiday in Provence once showed me little snails clustered together at the top of tall, dry stems at the roadside. They were aestivating – hibernating, staying dormant – clear of the baking soil and up in the wind.In much of Ireland, our earthworms have been aestivating (Latin aestes  summer), wrapping their bodies into knots at the bottom of their holes and sealing their chamber with mucus to keep in some humidity. And snails, rather than climbing, work their way into the soil and exude more mucus as protection while they sleep.Our woodshed swallows are flying overtime to catch midges for their young: a depleted generation is missing, as their eggs dry out in the dwindling of bog pools, marsh and mud. Dragonflies eat midges, too, but exceptional droughts can threaten their own populations of aquatic larvae.Bats need midges for food, but also night-flying moths. In Britain, which shared with Ireland the three-month summer drought of 1976, the withering of specific wild food plants and loss of caterpillars brought a crash in some species of moths and butterflies.In rich ecosystems, such as streams, droughts can have complex effects. Studies of hill streams in Scotland and Wales have shown that even when a long drought has killed all the trout, many invertebrates survive in the moist gravel of the streambed. Timing can be critical in deciding what lives and dies, but a couple of years will bring back vagrant mayflies, stoneflies, caddis flies and the rest, along with questing trout, to lay their eggs and colonise."},{"url":null,"title":"that s going to be special top us intelligence official surprised by news of putin visit","story":"  July 20, 2018Trump says discussions already under way for Putin visit   July 22, 2018US director of intelligence issues statement to control damage over \u0026lsquoawkward response\u0026rsquo   July 17, 2018Review: No musical staffed by actors who sing like suffering badgers had any right to be so much fun   July 18, 2018Ireland\u0026rsquos new online-safety action plan is underwhelming.

industry environment","story":"Created with Sketch.Upmarket British label has destroyed £105m of unwanted stock in past five yearsClick to followThe Independent OnlineBurberry burns £28.6m of clothes and cosmetics \u0027to protect its brand\u0027Burberry\u0026nbspdestroyed £28.6m of clothing and cosmetics last year as part of efforts to\u0026nbspprotect its upmarket brand and guard against counterfeiting.The luxury British label incinerated the equivalent of\u0026nbsp81,000 of its signature plaid scarves, according to its latest annual accounts, in a practice said to be rife among fashion houses.Industry insiders\u0026nbspsay high-end brands burn\u0026nbspunwanted stock to prevent their clothes being sold at knockdown prices and worn by the\u0026nbsp“wrong people”.But the fashion houses\u0026nbspsay surplus goods are incinerated to prevent them falling into the hands of counterfeiters.Burberry destroyed more than £90m of products over the last five years, and the amount burnt annually has increased dramatically. In 2013, Burberry incinerated £5.5m of unwanted stock, less than a fifth of last year’s total.“The stuff that Burberry is burning is not waste – it is surplus, which is a very different concept. It is perfectly useable stuff,” said Orsola de Castro, cofounder of Fashion Revolution, a not-for-profit group that campaigns for greater transparency in the supply chain.The fashion designer told The Independent clothing brands destroying “vast quantities” of stock was a “massive, massive issue” that was “absolutely not unique to Burberry”.“In the case of the big brands, it’s absolutely very negative for them to suddenly have the same product with slashed prices,” she said.“Burberry, I can imagine, is particularly concerned about this because we all know that it went through a huge image change from sort of shabby to high gloss, high fashion. So they are probably worried about making things cheap and rolling back the clock.“It is brand protection, in this case. They don’t want it to go to the wrong people.”Burberry’s clothes are priced at the high end of fashion retail, with men’s polo shirts selling for as much as £250 and its famous trench coats priced at around £1,500.The company also sells perfumes and cosmetics, which accounted for £10.4m of the products destroyed last year.Fashion Revolution in picturesDestroying stock has become common practice for the industry, with retailers describing it as a measure to protect intellectual property and prevent illegal counterfeiting.Burberry\u0026nbspsaid it only destroyed items that carried its trademark and only worked with specialist companies who were able to harness the energy from the process.A spokesman said: “Burberry has careful processes in place to minimise the amount of excess stock we produce.\u0026nbspOn the occasions when disposal of products is necessary, we do so in a responsible manner and we continue to seek ways to reduce and revalue our waste.”\u0026nbspBurberry\u0026nbsprecently joined the Ellen MacArthur Foundation’s Make Fashion Circular initiative to help prevent waste in the industry, he added.Last year it emerged a Swedish power plant was burning unwanted H\u0026ampM clothes instead of coal.\u0026nbspThe plant in Vasteras, northwest of Stockholm, incinerated 15 tonnes of the retailer’s products in the first 11 months of the year.H\u0026ampM stressed it did not burn “any clothes that are safe to use” and said much of the destroyed stock was mouldy\u0026nbspor contaminated with lead.Ms De Castro called on the industry to be more open about the amount of clothing that was going to waste.She added: “We need to slow down. It doesn’t need to be drastic but it does need to happen, because whatever Burberry does with this stuff is not going to be environmentally friendly. There is no way of disposing of this amount of clothing in a way that is not environmentally invasive.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

They are named as a Schedule 1 animal in the 1972 Wildlife Protection Act –\u0026nbspmeaning those who abuse them can face up to seven years in prison.Yet the fate of around 3,500 captive elephants remains a grey area in India’s laws. Licences to keep them can be obtained from the state’s chief wildlife warden, and in 2016 the Supreme Court observed that the animals could be kept as long as owners are not “unkind to elephants”.Mr Satyanarayan said international tourists and the public in general “need to understand what goes on behind the curtain, the ugly, vicious, evil trade that this whole thing inculcates”.\u0026nbspWoman mauled by lion after entering enclosure to take photographThousands more scientific experiments being carried out on horsesBadger cull exercise cost taxpayers £76,000 for each animal killedCircus elephant falls into audience in GermanyCommercially successful elephant attractions “create a demand that drives more poaching, more brutality, more illegal elephant trafficking and more captive elephants”, he said.“Every person who rides an elephant must know that, for a few minutes of their joy, it’s a life of nightmares for that elephant.”In a statement to The Independent, TripAdvisor said its 2016 policies to improve animal welfare standards in the tourism industry “focused on the experiences sector”, while Jungle Book was classified as accommodation on its website.“We do not have a direct booking relationship with all accommodations on our site, the booking options are often provided by partners, and therefore we are not currently in a position to vet them in the same way,” a spokesperson said.“That said, our commitment doesn’t stop with experiences.\u0026nbspWe are always considering the evolution of this policy, including exploring ways in which TripAdvisor can drive positive change in the tourism accommodation sector too.” Travellers who were unhappy with animal welfare standards at their accommodation should “write a review to warn others”, the spokesperson said.Thomas Cook said the review mentioning its rep was from 18 months ago and that the agency “does not sell that excursion and has not for some time”.A TUI spokesperson said at the time of publication that they would not be able to provide a full statement until they can “investigate this thoroughly with the resort”.The company that operates Jungle Book, Goa Ecotourism Adventures, did not respond to multiple requests for comment by email. A person manning the phones at the resort said they were unable to comment on the elephants’ welfare, and that director Joseph Barreto was out of country. Calls to a man identified as the manager of the hotel went unanswered.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Since then, areas like\u0026nbspPeckham and Frome\u0026nbsphave taken the message on as their ownClick to followThe Independent OnlineFrom Bristol to LA: The anti-gentrification posters sweeping through our citiesLast summer, stickers and posters began to appear on the walls of Bristol. In a gnomic parody of Trump’s “Make America Great Again“ they read “Make Bristol Shit Again”, and were plastered over the city’s gentrifying high-tide areas, such as Stokes Croft and St Pauls.\u0026nbspThe city talked. Vice magazine did a piece about it, and MBSA went viral as both an exemplar of the city’s mordant humour and a plea against gentrification.“My hometown is becoming an extension of London, and losing its crappy edge,” wrote Vice’s Angus Harrison in a bittersweet excoriation of Bristol’s new-found glossiness.\u0026nbspMBSA might have been a one-off valedictory howl, but in an act of synchronicity, other “Shit Again” activity arrived.In Peckham, the southeast London district previously known for being the location of Only Fools and Horses and latterly for being a hipster hotspot, a “Make Peckham Shit Again” landed\u0026nbspin March, as did a Twitter account called “Make Frome Shit Again” along with a few MFSA hashtags of the same vintage.\u0026nbsp(In an odd circularity, much of Only Fools and Horses, although set in\u0026nbspPeckham, was actually filmed in Bristol.)\u0026nbspBristolStreetWearUK)Then, this spring an international brigade of “Shit Again” warriors\u0026nbspin Los Angeles in the form of “Make Venice Shit Again” (Venice the hippyish LA district, to be clear, not the Birmingham of Italy).Such was its clout that Hollywood actor Josh Brolin sported a MVSA baseball cap, part of a local atmosphere so heightened that a recent LA Weekly story found cause to lament that in Venice, “You’ll sooner find a $200 (£150) wool poncho than a $12 pair of flip-flops.”\u0026nbspSo the “Shit Again” tag somehow hit the mark, both as a lament to the new and deracinated world of overpriced and socially exclusive development, and as a great merchandise idea in its own right. So there’s a MBSA hat, T-shirt and even “laptop skins”, while MVSA baseball caps retail at $30 and MPSA baseball caps a snip at a tenner.\u0026nbspAs Tumbleweed Parker puts it (not his real name) his Make Peckham Shit Again hats were a response to Trump’s MAGA cap as well as a way to protest the gentrification of Peckham, which has deep roots but has gathered pace in the last five years as a domino in what you might call the “de-shitting” of London.“Before Trump I’d been thinking about doing some merchandise to kick back against all the happy-clappy local pride movements that seemed to spring up after the London riots in 2011,” says Parker.Peckham-based rockers Fat White Family (centre) wears a ‘Make Peckham Shit Again’ cap with siblings Sasha and Vida Adamczewski (Morbid Books)“It’s delusional to think London’s the best place in the world when its homegrown youth are so desperate to burn it down, and Sadiq Khan’s idiotic marketing of London is used to sell it off to developers.”Moreover, he adds, “people can’t afford to live in this so-called paradise”. So in its own way, the hats and T-shirts are a kind of Situationist protest or, as he puts it, “a barricade against the unhelpful narrative that Peckham is, was, or ever could be a great place for property speculators. I think it’s important that we say, it’s actually not that great.”So is this ‘Shit Again’ activity really a hankering for the days of shuttered high streets without good coffee: a kind of “Fings Ain’t What They Used to Be” for disgruntled millennials? Possibly: the creator\u0026nbspof Make Bristol Shit Again, Bristolstreetwear, bears the legend “Say no to sourdough” on its website, and certainly, there’s a sense of loss about gentrification’s march through the neighbourhoods: the sticky-carpet pubs turning into homes, the chain stores pushing out independents, and £3-a-cup flat whites and avocado-on-spelt ousting the chipped mug of tea and sausage sarnie.Frome\u0026nbspis known for its independent shops and cobbled street\u0026nbsp(Shutterstock)The protestors are also needled by endless proclamations of arrival, such as Frome’s topping the charts as a good place to move, and Bristol winning The Sunday Times’ “best place to live in the UK” gong: the kind of boosterism that gives some locals the impression their towns are forgotten backwaters just itching to be discovered.It’s rattled further by development that piggybacks on existing “bohemian” infrastructure, such as Stokes Croft in Bristol, where the loss of artist-occupied warehouses and office blocks like Hamilton House have sparked long battles.Yet perhaps there’s something else afoot too: a nostalgie de la boue for the old townscape of sticky boozers and crap shops where people supposedly felt a sense of belonging.The term “gentrification” was minted in 1964 by British sociologist Ruth Glass with reference to Islington, then attracting the middle classes into areas full of multi-occupied late Georgian and early Victorian houses, where they set about losing the net curtains and exposing the floorboards, hence the contemporary jibe, “stripped pine-eers”. Indeed, today’s neo-gentrifiers still like their decoration “raw”, although these days it’s more about bare bricks, old shops and and cocktails in jam jars. And there has long been a missionary-like flavour about the process, whereby gentrifiers comes into an unreconstructed urban district, “discover” it anew and turn it into a mirror of their own taste.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspWoodage  Twitter)But the idea of what gentrification constitutes has shifted, says Loretta Lees, a professor of human geography at the University of Leicester and author of several books on the matter, including Planetary Gentrification. “I’ve noticed that anti-gentrification has become more performative in the last two to three years,” says Lees. “The traditional class aspect of it has given way to a more complicated scenario, full of internal conflict, where critics of gentrification are often gentrifiers themselves and where the discussion is more about consumerism more than class.”The 2017 book Gentrifier by John Joe Schlichtman, Jason Patch and Marc Lamont Hill also works this theme with a look at how gentrification\u0026nbspis now commonly used as a means to describe clothing choices, food and art, often centred around the cipher-like figure of the “hipster“ and part of a battle for the authentic soul of a place.Shoreditch (Jamie OsmanTwitter)“Imagined realities and physical realities collide in gentrification,“ they wrote. This aspect became apparent in 2015, when a demonstration against a branch of the Cereal Cafe in London’s Brick Lane bought a sense of pantomime to the debate, while in 2016 Montreal’s local government introduced a by-law that no more than one in six businesses can be a restaurant: a move that has been seen as a way of moderating gentrification.\u0026nbspAlamy)So the new symbols of gentrification – the cortados, chachka shops and themed restaurants – began to seemingly represent a force that was making Bristol want to be shit again, as well as rippling out anxiously to other corners of the country. It’s a phenomenon that Lees says has seen “gentrification move on from key world cities to rural areas, market towns and ‘edge cities’ – places on the margins of urban areas”. One of the key differences between the Ruth Glass era and now is that gentrification has been globalised and also exists in miniature.\u0026nbspTenants’ lives ‘at risk’ after government fails to act on safety rulesDonald Trump has been scared off by a big balloonLondon to get first permanent LGBT+ homeless shelterAs for Frome becoming “shit again”, she says that the actual long-term locals want a post office, a good supermarket and a Peacocks: all things that\u0026nbspmight not be the grails of a “down from London” person’s eye.\u0026nbspThere’s also a streak of self-deprecation that runs through a certain British mentality, as seen in Crap Towns, the 1990s hit, bringing the “declinism” of the 1980s up to date. Then, things could only get worse. And surely gentrification can sometimes be good? Lees draws a moral distinction between the “gentrification that displaces people, and the good regeneration that keeps people in place”, but struggles to think of a good example of the latter.In 2015, research from the US magazine City Lab concluded that gentrifying neighbourhoods don’t actually lose low-income residents at a substantially lower rate than any other neighbourhood. Plus, it should be said, there’s nothing gentrifiers scorn more than other gentrifiers. It’s fun to have a pop.\u0026nbspPerhaps “shit again” means affordable housing and a regaining of convivial civic life, or perhaps it’s an aesthetic of urban decline. Whatever, a “shit again” cap is the perfect self-abnegating gift for an uncertain age. “It seems to be resonating with a lot of people who feel alienated by the discourse of positivity around urban redevelopment, which is most people I know,” says Parker. “Even the local estate agent ordered one. I hope he wears it when he hangs himself.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Do they actually earn money?When the influencer marketing industry began (around 2008-10, attest the form’s historians) the notion took hold that like celebrity endorsement before it, aspirational people could become marketing tools, accessing the consumer mind as if a recommendation from a friend.YouTuber with 139,095 subscribers, was refused a free hotel stay (YouTubeElle Darby)As one observer put it:\u0026nbsp“They emerged almost overnight and in 10 years have gone from a small network to a worldwide community.” Some sources suggest that there is now a baseline of 1.1 million influencers worldwide.\u0026nbspMediakix estimated\u0026nbspthe industry was worth more than $1bn\u0026nbsp(£750m)\u0026nbspin 2017. Malcolm Gladwell’s coinage, “the tipping point”, was used a lot in meetings.\u0026nbspBy about 2014, a baffled world had started to understand influencer marketing, but the industry’s breakthrough year was probably 2016 when, as Hamda Issa-Salwe of Bravado, part of Universal Music Group, found when she did a research thesis called Investigating the Use of Influencer Marketing on Social Media.“It began to soar,” she says. “Google classified ‘influencer’ as a breakout keyword with a 5,000 per cent month by month increase in the number of times the search term ‘influencer marketing’ was typed.”Also in 2016, it was established that Kendall Jenner was paid an estimated $300,000 per social media post. Advertising agencies took more careful notice of influencers and Instagram –\u0026nbspfounded in 2010 – became the key station of the social media cross, along with other key platforms\u0026nbspsuch as YouTube, Snapchat and Pinterest.Even the fustiest legacy-media type can now see the point. The barrier to entry is low. All you need is a smartphone and a certain brio. And the research seems to add up. According to Nielsen, 84 per cent\u0026nbspof consumers trust opinions from people they know, while 70 per cent\u0026nbsptake action based on other consumer’s opinions online.vlogger Zoella reportedly has a net worth of £2.5m (InstagramZoella)The Association of National Advertisers found that 75 per cent\u0026nbspof members already work with influencers, and the growing industry will take 20 per cent\u0026nbspof the total global marketing budget by 2023.No wonder that 82 per cent\u0026nbspof millennials hope to become influencers at least, according to a survey by London-based dating app CLiKD.\u0026nbspSo the money’s talking, and influencers can do well.It seems a great life but you don’t want to be that person with a fridgeful of isotonic drinks and unable to pay the rentAs Anthony Svirskis, CEO\u0026nbspof TRIBE and a juror on the\u0026nbspSocial and Influencer award says:\u0026nbsp“On a post by post basis, brands should expect to pay £50 for someone with 3,000 followers and upwards of £300 if someone has more than 100,000 followers.” Small wonder the market is seething with aspirant influencers.\u0026nbspYet influencers are still derided as being without any particular skills: even that they’re the apotheosis of the entitled “Me” generation, spreading paid-for blandishments in vocal-fry vlogs on YouTube.While it’s hard to blame someone who travels the world in return for Instagram snaps, is there an influencer bubble waiting to burst? Paul Dyer, of marketing company Lippe Taylor, believes it will, as trust has disappeared from the sector in the sceptical Facebook-Cambridge Analytica era.“There is tremendous value in influencer marketing,” he said recently. “However, many current practices are only speeding us to the precipice where the bottom falls out.”Indeed, there have been several influencer #epicfails, perhaps the most notable being\u0026nbspFyre\u0026nbspFestival, the ill-fated 2017 Bahamas musical festival that paid Kendall Jenner and Bella\u0026nbspHadid\u0026nbspto drum up support.\u0026nbspFyre\u0026nbspbombed and the repercussions are ongoing.There’s also an undergrowth of freebie-hunting influencers harassing hotels and providers. Some hotels – the\u0026nbspDusit\u0026nbspThani\u0026nbspresort in the Males among them – now use weeding out processes. “When they work hotels love them,” says one travel PR.\u0026nbspThe influencer economy … is a market irrationality. Companies are self-correcting in the face of so much wasted money“Influencers are uncritical and often share films and photographs that would otherwise be paid for. But there’s a trust problem.”There are other cracks in the influencer edifice as brands begin to ask questions about the business efficacy of influencers. As publicist Mark Borkowski says:\u0026nbsp“More brands are beginning to realise that influencer activity doesn’t necessarily drive ROI.”And the pain is on both sides, he adds. “It seems a great life but you don’t want to be that person with a fridgeful of isotonic drinks and unable to pay the rent.” Anti-influencers are coming of the woodwork –\u0026nbspand they’re not all crusty oldies with a grudge.“The influencer economy … is a market irrationality,” wrote Sam Biddle of Gawker in 2016. “Companies are self-correcting in the face of so much wasted money.” As for bots and fake followers, that’s a real problem.Fyre Festival attendees locked in airport ‘for their own safety’At Cannes, Unilever’s chief marketing officer Keith Weed called for industry action to clean out the influencer stable, and vowed never to use influencers found to be buying followers.So the sands are shifting. Hamda Issa-Salwe says that while influencer activity remains hard to define and audit, it’s still growing. Although trust and authenticity (the great influencer bon mot) are major factors, brands still spend a lot on influencers: after all,\u0026nbspInstagram has more 800 million monthly active users.And the influencers themselves are fighting back. It’s a new industry: of course legacy dinosaurs wouldn’t get it. It’s just another marketing tool. And what are –\u0026nbspsorry, were –\u0026nbspnewspapers half the time, but a vehicle of paid-for information?“Indeed, there’s a growing distrust of traditional media advertising,” says Harry Hugo, cofounder at The Goat Agency, Europe’s leading influencer agency, which claims to be growing at a rate of 600 per cent\u0026nbspa year.“Just look at the rise in ad blockers, investigations into media transparency and big networks like WPP struggling. Influencers can be one of the most trusted, and therefore highest converting, information sources for people.”\u0026nbspAlso, we jeremiahs just don’t get the craft and graft that goes into an influencer’s brand persona, adds Florencia Lujani, influencer marketing manager at agency We Are Social London.“People struggle to see why brands would pay money to partner with influencers for something which appears relatively simple,” she says. “But it takes time and effort, talent, passion and commitment.”\u0026nbspAnd even the thorny issue of disclosure –\u0026nbspthat is, whether you should know what someone is being paid to promote –\u0026nbspis a smaller issue than is often supposed, says Svirskis. “Influencers are very compliant of requirements to disclose and are often represented by an influencer agency.”There is tremendous value in influencer marketing. However, many current practices are only speeding us to the precipice where the bottom falls outMost importantly of all, influencers make money for clients. Currently, the average ROI of influencer marketing is £7 back for every £1 spent, says Amelia Neate of Influencer Champions.\u0026nbspSo,\u0026nbspdo you have to be pretty? “It’s definitely not reserved for those with looks,” says Svirskis. “The cheesy smiles are long gone.” It’s about style and tone, he says, and as the industry matures it’s moving beyond lifestyle products like travel, beauty and fashion to finance, automotive –\u0026nbspeven dog food.“There are new influencers emerging every day, in every single vertical,” says Lujani. They’re marshalling themselves into communities: mummy bloggers, healthy eaters, sports fans – why, possibly even news organisations.\u0026nbspWith the maturation of the influencer world comes a shakeout: Influencer 2.0, if you will. Sheer numbers don’t matter so much anymore.\u0026nbspThe smart talk is now about engagement and micro-influencers,\u0026nbspthose with fewer than 100,000 followers and possibly as low as 5,000, but with proper peer recognition.\u0026nbspYouTuber Alfie Deyes came under fire for his recent video, ‘How I lived off £1 for a day’ (YouTubePointlessBlogVlogs)“Data shows that influence by measure of engagement actually increases as the audience size reduces,” says Svirskis. In a hedge-betting strategy, brands now prefer to work with 50 micro-influencers rather than one mega-influencer, and brands are taking influencer management in-house as influencer marketing moves into the mainstream.If children are obese then blame food manufacturers, not ZoellaInvestigation promised into Trump campaign data firmThree arrested after Facebook group raid cannabis field – only to Sexist men who abuse women on Facebook and Twitter are compensating“Most new industries go through periods of turbulence as they form foundations,” says Svirskis, who thinks that many of today’s influencers will become tomorrow’s creative directors and entrepreneurs.He has a point. Beauty influencer Emily Weiss now has a cosmetic company, Glossier, and within the last couple of weeks M\u0026ampC Saatchi bought a stake in two influencer agencies. There’s even a new trade body, the Influencer Marketing Association.Circle the wagons and don’t be a #filterfaker\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspthe wild influencer west is being tamed.Cannes Lions International Festival of CreativityEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Some 98 of 204 households from\u0026nbspGrenfell\u0026nbspTower and Walk have not yet moved into a permanent houses, more than a year after the blaze that killed 72 people, according to a statement released by housing secretary on Thursday.“Some survivors still remain without a home of their own, and the council has accepted that a significant number of other households affected by the disaster are not likely to have their housing needs met potentially for years,\u0026nbspMr Diner continued.“These vacant properties could be vital to rehousing Grenfell survivors and those whose lives have been changed forever by the disaster. The council must therefore urgently get a grip on its vacant housing stock and bring it up to standard to address the chronic housing need in the borough.”Grenfell Tower Inquiry: photos of inside the flat where fire beganKitchen in flat 16 where the fire startedThe kitchen from flat 16The kitchen from flat 16Hallway in flat 16, leading to the kitchen where the fire startedThe kitchen from flat 16The kitchen from flat 16Bedroom in flat 16Living room in flat 16Toilet in flat 16Living room in flat 16Bedroom 2 of flat 16Bedroom in flat 16Bedroom 2 of flat 16The kitchen from flat 16Kitchen in flat 16 where the fire startedDoor to flat 16 from the lobby on floor 4Living room in flat 16Hallway in flat 16Kitchen in flat 16 where the fire startedThe kitchen from flat 16The kitchen from flat 16Hallway in flat 16, leading to the kitchen where the fire startedThe kitchen from flat 16The kitchen from flat 16Bedroom in flat 16Living room in flat 16Toilet in flat 16Living room in flat 16Bedroom 2 of flat 16Bedroom in flat 16Bedroom 2 of flat 16The kitchen from flat 16Kitchen in flat 16 where the fire startedDoor to flat 16 from the lobby on floor 4Living room in flat 16Hallway in flat 16Shadow housing minister John Healey said: “It is shameful that council homes sit empty while fewer than half of the families who survived the Grenfell Tower fire have been rehoused, more than a year on from the fire.“Government ministers could and should have taken over this failing council but have chosen not to.“What was a national disaster is becoming a national disgrace and the Government must now step in to ensure all survivors have permanent homes so they can start to rebuild their lives.”The Independent\u0026nbsphas contacted the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea\u0026nbspfor comment.\u0026nbsproyal borough of kensington and chelseaEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

claim that Bank study shows no deal outcome \u0027worse for EU\u0027Dominic Raab is under fire after partially retracting a claim that the Bank of England believes the EU will be hit harder than the UK by a no-deal Brexit.The Brexit department\u0026nbspadmitted\u0026nbspto The Independent\u0026nbspthat the Bank’s analysis referred only to one aspect of financial services – not to each side’s overall economic performance.The embarrassing concession sparked accusations that Mr Raab was trying to keep voters in the dark about the impact of crashing out of the EU without a deal.The row blew up after he refused to explain the no-deal planning the government is making – despite insisting the UK would “thrive” in those circumstances.“Dominic Raab tried to claim that a no-deal Brexit would be worse for the EU than for the UK,” said a spokesperson for the anti-Brexit People’s Vote campaign.“Now he says he only meant derivatives, so he must know that for manufacturing, services and every other sector of our economy, no deal is the worst possible outcome.”Derivatives are financial instruments typically traded by hedge funds to speculate on the future direction of interest rates, or the value of commodities.Last week, Mark Carney, the Bank of England governor, warned the EU against failing to put in place a contingency plan for tens of trillions of pounds of outstanding derivatives after Brexit.Such a failure would hurt the EU more than Britain because its banks and corporations trade mainly in the City of London and would be left scrambling to make alternative arrangements.However, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned the overall UK economy would suffer more than the EU’s – losing 4 per cent of national output, compared with 1.5 per cent across the Channel.Brexit Resignation: July 10th 2018 Maria Caulfield MP Conservative Party\u0027s vice chair for women July 10th 2018Brexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Conservative MP for Bolton West Chris

organisations have reached similar conclusions, including, before the referendum, the OECD, which estimated a 5.1 per cent hit over 15 years from a no-deal Brexit.The government’s own leaked internal analysis of a falling back on World Trade Organisation rules estimated a loss of up to 10.3 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP).On the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show, Mr Raab was asked if he accepted the “really dramatic decline” for the UK’s economy, forecast by the IMF.In reply, he said: “Well, there’s been all sorts of analysis done.Brexit will allow tighter controls on sale of real fur in UK, say

groupMinisters will be sent across Europe to rescue Brexit plan“The Bank of England has produced an analysis which showed that it wouldn’t be the best outcome for either side, but it would – in a material way, aspects – be worse for the EU side.”Asked which analysis Mr Raab was referring to, a spokesman said it was the comments made by the Bank’s governor in evidence given to MPs last week.Asked if he could point to any study predicting a bigger overall loss for the EU, he replied: “The Brexit secretary was referring to Mr Carney’s comments about derivatives.”During the TV interview, Mr Raab condemned “hair-raising stories” that food will be stockpiled, and motorways turned into lorry parks, if Britain crashes out of the EU with no agreement.However, he declined to say what preparations are being made, beyond the hiring of extra border staff, while hinting the public would be told more in the coming months.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with

Across the English countryside, agricultural workers have been abandoned by the shameful decision to scrap the Agricultural Wages Board.“The struggle of the Tolpuddle Martyrs sowed the seed for the modern trade union movement and the Labour Party itself.“The best way to honour that noble struggle is not just to remember why it took place, but to secure in our time what those workers fought for: the right to fair pay and decent working conditions.”UK news in picturesExiting the European Union Secretary Dominic Raab on The Andrew Marr ShowGreat Britain\u0027s Tom Bosworth poses after winning the men\u0027s 3000m race walk with a new World Record time at the IAAF Diamond League athletics anniversary games meeting in LondonBritish Prime Minister Theresa May delivers a keynote speech at the Waterfront Hall in Belfast.

Trade unions called the delays “scandalous” and suggested minsters were trying to brush the issue under the carpet.In 2016, ministers announced plans to crack down on exploitative practices by banning or restricting employers taking tips that are given to staff, and making a voluntary code of practice for employers legally binding.It followed The Independent’s Fair Tips, Fair Pay\u0026nbspcampaign, which revealed that a number of large restaurant chains were taking staff tips and using them to top up the wages of workers who were being paid less than the minimum wage.UK news in picturesExiting the European Union Secretary Dominic Raab on The Andrew Marr ShowGreat Britain\u0027s Tom Bosworth poses after winning the men\u0027s 3000m race walk with a new World Record time at the IAAF Diamond League athletics anniversary games meeting in LondonBritish Prime Minister Theresa May delivers a keynote speech at the Waterfront Hall in Belfast.

Others, including Italian chain Strada, take a proportion of tips paid on card as a “handling charge”.Some firms, including Jamie Oliver’s Italian chain, have also been found to charge waiting staff a proportion of the bills paid by the people they serve, which is then distributed to other staff.The official consultation on clamping down on the practices closed on 27 June 2016 but the government is yet to respond to it.Ministers do not appear to have even started work on a response. Asked whether the government\u0026nbsphad\u0026nbspa copy of any\u0026nbspdraft response to the consultation, a Department for Business, Enterprise and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) official said: “Following a search of our paper and electronic records, I have established that the information you requested is not held by this department.”Pushed on why it has still not published a response to the consultation, a BEIS spokesperson said: “The government is still considering options and will respond in due course.”Announcing the plans in 2016, Sajid Javid, then the business secretary and now the home secretary, said: “We’ve been very clear. As a one nation government we want workers who earn a tip to be able to keep it. That’s why I, like many others, was disappointed by the tipping practices of some of our well-known chains. This has to change.”Ministers were prepared to make legislative changes to protect workers, he added.An earlier government call\u0026nbspfor evidence had found more than 80 per cent of people thought staff should be allowed to keep the tips they earn.Commenting on the lack of government action, Ms Peacock, who recently introduced a Commons bill on protecting workers’ rights, said: “This month marks two years since the government closed its consultation on fair tips. The Tories promised it would lead to action, yet they now admit that they haven’t even started drafting a response.“While ministers drag their feet, workers and customers alike are being ripped off by rogue bosses who are grabbing tips that were intended for staff.She added: “It is appalling that staff, often in precarious employment, are going into another busy summer season without the basic protection they deserve, with workers at TGI Fridays worked to take strike action to demand their share.“Government inaction will only fuel the suspicion that they have quitely abandoned their promises and\u0026nbspwant to let rogue bosses off the hook. Ministers should come clean, and if they’re going to take real action to stop this scandal, they need to get on with it.”Dave Turnbull, regional officer at Unite,\u0026nbspsaid:\u0026nbsp“It’s scandalous that the government appears to have not even started drafting a response yet.“Every day that passes since its consultation on fair tips closed is another day that allows bad bosses to exploit low paid workers. It gives the likes of TGI Fridays the opportunity to interfere and manipulate the systems used to distribute tips internally to rip off workers and customers alike.“Government ministers will be sorely mistaken if they think this issue will go away and they can brush it under the carpet. Unite will not allow that to happen.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

In the new year, new groups may emerge.“I’m not sure who, or how they’ll be configured. But I predict it is going to happen and my instincts are that if they’re aligned with us on basic values, we can work with them.

Kosher meat requires all animals to be conscious at the point of slaughter.“We are checking whether the meat requirement can be linked to the place of residence,” he said, according to Austrian newspaper Wiener Zeitung.\u0026nbspWorld news in picturesIsraeli-annexed Golan Heights  shows a smoke plume rising across the border in Quneitra in southwestern Syria, as rebels destroy their arms stocks prior to their departure.

If it were 14-day-old puppies there’d be uproar but these are equally sentient, intelligent beingsA driver told the investigators that such breaches continued even after they were reported to the Irish authorities.Eyes on Animals, together with Compassion in World Farming\u0026nbspand French and German animal welfare groups, sent their formal complaint to the European Commission.\u0026nbspThey are also petitioning the ferry giants Stena Line and Irish Ferries Limited to stop accepting live transport cargos.The groups say this is the ninth time since 1999 that investigators have trailed live-animal trucks being exported from Ireland and reported breaches of EU laws to the authorities – but that nothing is done to enforce welfare regulations.Nicola Glen, of Eyes on Animals, told The Independent: “These calves are only 14 days old, they need to be fed every seven or eight hours, they’re suffering because they’re given no nutrition and they’re usually seen lying down because they’re tired and lethargic.“They are bellowing because they want their mothers’ milk – it’s a haunting sound.”Unweaned calves are particularly vulnerable during transport because their immune systems are undeveloped, welfare experts say.Ms Glen believes that because ferry journeys alone from Ireland to France last 18 to 20 hours – beyond the nine-hour limit – all live exports from the republic to Europe are illegal.Ireland’s agriculture minister Michael Creed told his country’s parliament, the Dail,\u0026nbspthat a thorough investigation was under way in conjunction with the French authorities.The Independent has contacted the Irish Agriculture Department to ask for a comment.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Only the ruling\u0026nbspUnited Russia fraction voted for, with all of the controlled “opposition” parties voting against.\u0026nbspSeveral deputies in the ruling party, hitherto known for demonstrative displays of loyalty, were mysteriously absent from the vote.\u0026nbspThe main provisions of the reform see the pension age increase from 60 for men and 55 for women, to 65 and 63 respectively. Its sponsors say the changes are necessary to bring the law into line with new life expectancy figures. Pension ages were last set in 1936, when pensioners accounted for no more than 2 per cent of the population. \u0026nbsp“Life has changed,”\u0026nbspthe employment\u0026nbspminister\u0026nbspMaxim\u0026nbspTopilin\u0026nbsptold parliamentarians. “We can’t remain in the 1930s.”\u0026nbspThe contentious issue of pension reform has been raised several times in the last two decades, but the government has repeatedly chosen to delay. It presented the bill in\u0026nbspless than auspicious economic times. Most Russians have faced real-terms wage falls since 2014, and the outlook is grim.\u0026nbspMr Putin’s trust ratings have\u0026nbspfallen to the lowest recorded ebb since 2011 – below 38 percent, according to state pollsters.Critics have also railed against the way the pensions plan was communicated, announced with no discussion a few hours before kick off during the opening match of the World Cup, between hosts Russia and Saudi Arabia. Fnance\u0026nbspminister Anton Siluanov has insisted that this was a coincidence, but the public outcry was real.\u0026nbsp“It is a bastardly way to introduce reform,” said the former Kremlin adviser Gleb Pavlovsky in an interview on the Echo of Moscow radio station. “The people have a deal with the Kremlin in return for not protesting – and the most important part of that deal is that they are given the chance to survive.”\u0026nbspIn some regions\u0026nbspthe\u0026nbspproposed pension ages fall below average life expectancy\u0026nbsp– in Chukotka,\u0026nbspin the country’s far east, the male life expectancy is 60.33, nearly five years below the proposed pension age.\u0026nbspFor many families\u0026nbspthe change will represent a fundamental shift to their way of life. Even according to state pollsters, eight out of\u0026nbsp10 Russians do not agree with the plans. There have already been\u0026nbspprotests against the reform.\u0026nbspOn the eve of the bill, 14 people were arrested at an unsanctioned rally in St Petersburg.\u0026nbspRegardless of whether significant protests follow, the relationship between the people and the state has changed forever,\u0026nbspsays the political analyst Ekaterina Schulmann\u0026nbsp“It is a tectonic shift. Even before the pension reform, people were viewing the state as less and less of a father figure. But the reform strengthens that perception.”In Ms Schulmann\u0027s view, these changes will affect the transfer of power between Vladimir Putin and his anointed successor, a process which may begin as early as 2021.\u0026nbspThe paw of Mr Putin has remained strangely hidden throughout the process. His press secretary,\u0026nbspDmitry Peskov, has distanced the president from the unpopular bill.\u0026nbspReports, on the other\u0026nbsphand, suggested the president approved the plan before its first reading. And all the while, state media have been kept under strict control. They have been told to avoid the word “reform”, to avoid associations with the “chaotic” 1990s, but nonetheless to keep close to a line emphasising the necessity of reform.\u0026nbspThere may not be protests, but the relationship between the people and the state has changed forever\u0026nbspBut the attempt to differentiate a\u0026nbspgood tsar from bad\u0026nbspboyars might not have been altogether successful.On the back of the controversy, trust\u0026nbspin Mr Putin has fallen to\u0026nbspthe lowest recorded\u0026nbspebb since 2011 – below 38 percent, according to state pollsters. And perhaps more significantly, the president’s ratings are falling steadily\u0026nbspin line with government popularity. This is the first time this has happened since the annexation of Crimea in 2014.\u0026nbspSome now wonder if the president is in danger of losing his Teflon coating.\u0026nbspIt may, of course, have been another coincidence, but on the eve and the day of the vote\u0026nbspthe Russian military released several videos purporting to show the testing of new cutting-edge “Avangard” and “Kinzhal” missiles. Russians are generally supportive of the president’s assertive foreign policy stance – as opposed to domestic policies with which they interact with every day.Propaganda directors may have decided to use the opportunity to play down\u0026nbspreaction to the proposal.\u0026nbspWelcome to the real Russia, on eve of electionRussia\u0027s imperial capital is the starting point of our journey Chudovo was one of the first stops of Radishchev\u0027s journeyThey say the fish rot from the head down429 On the way out of ChudovoWe choose our president, we choose our futurePeople have become fussy and want clear waterLife is just great Once the seat of a forward-looking republic — Russia\u0027s first experiment with democracy Once the seat of a forward-looking republic — Russia\u0027s first experiment with democracy Once the seat of a forward-looking republic — Russia\u0027s first experiment with democracy Navalny\u0027s activists continue campaign despite their leader being barred from the elections Thatcher was a bitch, but I liked her.

She saw her uncle’s legs blown off in the same airstrike that killed her father and destroyed most of their home in Beit Lahia, north Gaza.\u0026nbspLike many children in the tiny enclave, she suffered from post-traumatic stress.\u0026nbspThen Amjed Tantesh, 42, a swimming coach and one-time Olympic hopeful, encouraged her to learn to swim as a way of channelling her depression and anger.\u0026nbsp“A week after my dad passed away Amjed called my mum and offered me and my brother swimming lessons. My dad was killed by shrapnel from an airstrike which ricocheted off the wall and hit his heart. The same airstrike blew off my uncle’s leg. We were all downstairs screaming,” she said sitting by a small pool filled with murky green water in Gaza City.\u0026nbsp“It’s extremely important for me to achieve my dream, the dream of my family, of my coach, to be the first Gazan swimmer to take part in the Olympics,” she added.\u0026nbspFour years later, the fitness and football fanatic\u0026nbspspends her free time training in grubby and sometimes makeshift pools. Gaza is in the 11th year of an Israeli blockade, meaning Fatima cannot even get hold of proper swimming equipment. She is left to swim in a mismatched pair of pyjamas. If she qualifies it would be her first trip out of Gaza, which is just 25 miles long.She said swimming had helped her deal with trauma from the war and made her stronger.\u0026nbsp“I don’t want to be afraid any more. I want to be strong. I used to even be afraid of the pool, of water, and now I’m not. I’m determined to work on myself, to succeed,”\u0026nbspshe said.\u0026nbspIn June Save the Children\u0026nbspreported that a staggering 95 per cent of children in Gaza had depression, consistent with deep psychological distress. The charity said the constant threat of conflict, the fear of bombs, and the constant insecurity caused by the unstable political situation had created a psychological crisis in the country.\u0026nbspMany fear Gaza is now on the brink of another war with Israel as tensions have reached boiling point.\u0026nbspOn Friday the Israeli army said one of its soldiers had been killed by Palestinian gunmen near the border, the first Israeli military death near Gaza since the 2014 war. The army unleashed a tide of airstrikes that pummelled over 60 military targets in the enclave, in one of the most intense days of violence in four years.By the end of the day, the Gaza health ministry said that at least four Palestinians had been killed. As fires raged through the strip, a shaky truce brokered by Egypt was enforced. On Saturday, the United Nations urged both sides it was “imperative” to step back from the brink of a “devastating conflict”.At the heart of the latest eruption of hostilities is 16 weeks of Palestinian protests near the border fences that the Israeli army has met with force. More than 140 Palestinians been killed by Israeli fire since 30 March, when residents of Gaza first marched on the fences demanding right to return to ancestral lands they were forced from during the 1948 war which surrounded the creation of Israel.\u0026nbspSome of the protesters have taken to launching burning kites and balloons attached with explosives at Israel, sparking more than 750 wildfires and scorching 2,600 hectares of land.The Palestinians maintain the protests are peaceful and Israel is firing on them with live ammunition. Israel says their soldiers have been attacked and the wildfires are endangering Israeli citizens.\u0026nbspEarlier this week saw the most intense exchange of fire between Gaza and Israel since the 2014 conflict. Egypt reportedly intervened to stop war breaking out.Amid the escalating conflict, children, like Fatima, have suffered the most.\u0026nbspMr Tantesh said there were few resources or outlets for the youth to deal with trauma, though\u0026nbspswimming had\u0026nbspproven\u0026nbspa cheap alternative.\u0026nbspHe launched his swimming initiative in 1999 and said he has since taught more than\u0026nbsp5,400 children to swim. \u0026nbspBecause he initially\u0026nbsplacked access to pools and so, in the aftermath of the 2014 war, Tantesh built a makeshift sea pool\u0026nbspby using concrete blocks from bombed-out buildings to cordon off an area of the beach in north Gaza, where the water is less polluted.\u0026nbspIn 2015 alone, he taught some 465 children, with most of them receiving free swimming lessons.\u0026nbsp“All of them are war afflicted, they have lost a father, mother, relative or they have had a house destroyed,” he told The Independent.“But our new ambition is to prepare some of those children to qualify for the Olympics. Fatima is by far our best chance, she has developed the fastest and so we hope she will represent Gaza in Tokyo 2020. I have never seen such determination and persistence,” he added.Meet the girl who wants to be Gaza’s first Olympic SwimmerFatima Abu Shedeg, 13, dreams of leaping from the blocks at Tokyo 2020Fatima has survived three wars and until four years ago she was not only unable to swim but had never been in a poolIn 2014, Fatima lost her father during the last war with Israel, which raged for 51 days and left more than 2,200 Palestinians and 73 Israelis dead.

Bar one person, a young judoka from Jerusalem who qualified in London’s 2012 Games, they have all competed on a wild card scheme.The Palestinian Olympic Committee chooses its teams from Gaza, the West Bank and Palestinian communities across the world. So Fatima will face stiff competition while she makes do with scant resources.Gaza lacks an Olympic-size swimming pool and the few pools it does have struggle to stay open amid chronic energy shortages. It is also increasingly dangerous to swim in the sea.\u0026nbspGaza’s environment authority said last year that nearly two-thirds of its 25 mile coastline was seriously polluted.\u0026nbspSewage treatment plants cannot function due to the power\u0026nbspshortages. The United Nations said that more than 100 million litres of waste water are pumped into the sea off Gaza every day.With filthy beaches and not enough electricity\u0026nbspto keep pools clean, trying to train a swimming team is near impossible, according to the Olympic Committee in Gaza.\u0026nbspIn a battered office and sat in front of a battery-powered fan, Munther Masalmeh, the committee’s secretary-general, said it would be a “major achievement” for a swimmer in Gaza to reach the Olympics.“There is not a single pool in Gaza that hits international standards. With our infrastructure problems it makes it even harder. It would be a major achievement to have a female swimmer here because of the lack of resources,” he told The Independent.The Israeli blockade also restricts access to sports equipment. Mr Masalmeh claimed even iron goal posts were banned because the Israelis feared\u0026nbspthey could be used to make weapons.“Sports equipment gets stuck in the ports for year and does not reach the athletes. In addition, the Israelis have in the past banned players from leaving Gaza to participate in international tournaments,” he added.Nonetheless, Fatima hopes one day to get permission to leave Gaza and take her place at the Games.“I want to achieve my dream to be picked for the Olympics, so I can travel and compete in the 100m race,” she said, putting on her swimming pyjamas.“I don’t just want to participate, I want to get first place,\u0026nbspso those who picked me are proud.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Hun Sen has accused the United States of supporting the CNRP and plotting a colour revolution to overthrow his government.In June last year, Khoeun Virath was elected as a commune councillor in the capital of Cambodia, but months later his political party was banned and most of its leadership fled into exile - so now he works as a tuk-tuk driver to make ends meet.He said: \u0026ldquoPeople here are afraid, people don\u0027t want to speak out.Cambodia election 2018: Government supporters pictured following last year\u0027s vote (Image: )The government said calls for a poll boycott are illegal and has invited 50,000 observers, including some from China, Myanmar and Singapore, to monitor the election.Soeung Sen Karuna, 41, an investigator for rights group Adhoc, one of the oldest rights groups in Cambodia, said his organisation had been accused of plotting a revolution and was finding it increasingly difficult to work.He said: \u0026ldquoNGOs who work in other sectors are scared of cooperating with us.Five members of Adhoc were detained without trial for 14 months before being released on bail last year. They were charged with bribing a witness in a case against the now-jailed opposition leader, Kem Sokha. Supporters of Kem Sokha say the charges are politically motivated.Another person who knows the lengths to which authorities will go to silence critics is Ma Chetra, 28, who runs the Social Breaking News Facebook page, said he has also been targeted by the government over the page, which hosts news about land-rights protests, forced evictions, and other issues the government considers sensitive.Ma Chetra said he has fled Cambodia several times since 2017 after police sent a photograph of him with a group of activists at Phnom Penh\u0027s international airport. The activists were heading to Indonesia for a workshop on democracy, he said, but police circulated the image with the caption: A group of youths who went to train to conduct a colour revolution.The photograph, seen by Reuters, lists the names and some of the mobile phone numbers of those on the trip.Some of the group have since fled to the United States and France. Others are in Cambodia, but are keeping a low profile.Khoeun Virath said the best hope for opponents of Hun Sen is pressure from exiled leaders and the international community.He said: \u0026ldquoWith diplomatic pressure from abroad there can be a lot of momentum."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/unnamed-9.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960\" height=\"720\" width=\"960","title":"get all our great stories with the suns newsletters","story":"So if youre after the news that always drives the conversation of the nation, the showbiz scoops that will shock you, all the goings-on in football from the clubs to the players to the fans, look no further.Sign up to our newsletters today by clicking here now. Key Features:Sun 10 - Receive the 10 biggest and best stories of the day, as selected by our editors, sent straight to your inbox so you’re always in the know.Money - The best deals and advice for you and your family.Fabulous - All the hottest trends in fashion and beauty, celeb news and juicy real-life stories.Football - The best columnists, unmissable highlights from your favourite players and clubs and more.TV\u0026ampShowbiz - Get all the latest celebrity and TV news directly into your inbox.Even better, the newsletters learn what you like, so over time you’ll see more of what you want and less of what you don’t.

Sadly, a year or so later they also voted to keep the appalling Anna Soubry as their local MP. Let’s hope they never make that mistake again.For the last year this bilious, jabbering woman has done everything she possibly can to thwart the will of her electors.She is a staunch Remainer and is seemingly prepared to bring down the Government to get her way. Her actions suggest she couldn’t give a monkey’s about what the people in her constituency think.Two nights ago she was one of 12 Conservative rebels who voted against the Government. She wanted Britain to remain part of a customs union with the EU. That would mean — effectively — no real Brexit. And if they had won, it would have been catastrophe for the Government. And in my opinion, the country.The reason they didn’t lose is solely down to a bunch of courageous Labour MPs, including the excellent Frank Field, who voted with the Government. Soubry isn’t alone, of course. The people of Loughborough, Leics, also voted by a large margin to leave the EU.But they are represented in the House of Commons by Nicky Morgan, who appears not to give a toss what they think. She also voted for a customs union. Nicky is famous among many for being the second worst Education Secretary this country has ever had. She’s pipped to the post for that particular prize by Justine Greening.Being useless in their Cabinet posts isn’t the only thing that unites these two women. Greening is also opposed to Brexit and she has even called for a second referendum. Because she didn’t like the result of the first one.The people of Beaconsfield, Bucks, voted to leave the EU. But their MP, the grim Dominic Grieve, who resembles a funeral director from about 1923, appears not to care less. He has said he’s prepared to “collapse” the Government if he does not get his way.Sarah Wollaston is another one. Another embittered MP. Her constituency, Totnes in Devon, voted to leave by a sizeable margin.Because while it is true that the majority of Labour MPs are also opposed to Brexit, they have been nothing like as dangerous as the Tory rebels.We are in a mess. The Prime Minister staggers from crisis to crisis, striking meaningless deals whenever she can to stave off defeat for a few more days.She surely cannot last much longer. A Remainer herself, of course, I think she should be persuaded to call it a day. Go home, put her feet up. And let her party elect a leader who will take no more c**p from Brussels.And no more c**p from the likes of Soubry and Greening, either.THE top scientist Richard Dawkins – Britain’s most famous atheist – has got himself into trouble.He has said that he prefers to hear the sound of cathedral bells to the muezzin wail calling Muslims to prayer.  Saying something as inoffensive as that is enough to get you into hot water these days.Dawkins has been called a bigot as a consequence. I have to say I disagree with him. I love the sound of cathedral bells, sure.But I also enjoying hearing the Muslim call to prayer – when I’ve been on my travels in Morocco or Malaysia. But, over here, it’s cathedral bells for me every time.Here’s a tip, then.Take them to an expensive shoe shop and make them look at the display through the window.And remember the noise they make.KATIE PRICE is on holiday in Thailand and of course she’s got her baps out.  This might be a problem for Katie, pictured with boyfriend Kris Boyson.Topless sunbathing is against the law over there. This is because tourists enjoy looking at the scenic islands. Without having their view obliterated by a pair of breasts the size of Koh Samui.So watch yourself, Katie. And as a break from lying on the beach, how do you fancy a spot of caving?YOU’VE got to love the toffs, haven’t you?  Most of them are absolutely crazy after years of inbreeding.Take the brilliant Lizzie Purbrick who described herself as “a very well-bred toff”.  She went round to her married lover’s home after he’d cheated on her with a third woman.No messing with Lizzie. She took with her eight litres of pig’s blood which she sprayed across his flat. She daubed the words “slut” and “whore” and “big d**k lord” on his walls and sprayed a giant penis on the floor.  She said: “So many people have said I should write my life story, but I’m so bonkers I can’t remember it.”The judge said – in one of the great under-statements of the decade – that she had “real concerns about the defendant’s ability to make rational decisions”.No s**t, Sherlock.It started out a few years back with just a couple of stalls. Now the entire town centre is closed off and thousands turn up to pig themselves on cuisine from scores of nationalities.I got so stuffed last year I needed to be helped home. And not a chicken parmo – the supposed Teesside dish of choice – in sight.IT’S not often that the Labour peer Dame Margaret Hodge says something worth repeating. But in telling her party leader Jeremy Corbyn that he was a “f***ing anti-Semite and a racist” I think she kinda hit the nail on the head.Meanwhile, the decent, moderate Labour MP John Woodcock has resigned the party whip and become an independent.Long-time party members – like I was, until last year – know that Labour is currently led by a hard-left anti-Jewish rabble of thickoes.I hope the voters twig this sooner or later.AND now it’s time for Hypocrites of the Week. A special award for Pimlico Plumbers of London.They’ve put up a giant banner outside their premises about Brexit, saying: “Nobody voted to be poorer!”Pimlico Plumbers has just lost a landmark case brought by one of its employees. He, like almost all of their staff, was kept on a contract which allowed the firm to pay him less than the proper rate.They were done under a UK Supreme Court decision, using laws designed to stop unscrupulous firms exploiting cheap labour.I wonder what it is about the EU that Pimlico Plumbers likes so much?

He is not bright enough to realise how absurd and unstatesmanlike he looks.But he let something else very revealing slip too.Varadkar reportedly said that EU leaders have assured him no hard border or customs checks will ever be needed between Ireland and Northern Ireland.That’s under ANY scenario, including a No Deal.Since we will never build a hard border either, why is “avoiding” one still being discussed, let alone a huge sticking point?Answer: It is a ruse, confected by a Brussels desperate to keep us in its grip.Eurocrats yesterday tore apart Theresa May’s Chequers offer. Yes, the same offer already so over-generous it almost collapsed her Government.The Sun has never been more gloomy about the chance of a deal. There is nothing more Mrs May can compromise on.But Brussels is run by deluded bullies who apparently think they cannot lose.Martin Selmayr, the German who is effectively in charge, dislikes Britain and insists any deal must be punitive.The EU, while apparently negotiating with us, is also advising its members how to lure away our job-creating firms.Parliament, and its Remainers, must not be cowed. They must back Britain over Brussels. No Deal wasn’t our choice. But the EU is pushing us into it and telling its members to be prepared.Within eight months we must be fully ready too, economically and politically.THE huge surge in serious crime shames the supposed party of law and order.It is no coincidence murders, rapes, robberies and knife attacks are soaring with police numbers at a 36-year low.For years the Tories considered their necessary cuts to budgets safe enough. The evidence against is now irrefutable.But more cash is not the only answer.Many forces are appallingly led, obsessed with their image, with social media virtue-signalling and investigations driven by political correctness, all while ignoring the basics of keeping the public and their property safe.Home Secretary Sajid Javid must secure more money and reverse this horrific trend.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She would have let Charlotte run riot in her bedroom, trying on all her designer clothes and shoes and raiding her make-up bag.It’s so tragic that all of these happy times were not to be. When William saw all of his children come into the world, most especially baby Charlotte, he must have felt the loss of his mother even more keenly.Diana would have been there with her arms full of presents, and not just for the babies. There would have been thoughtful gifts for Kate and lots of hugs and happy tears.You can well picture her ­giving newlywed Harry a cheeky nudge and telling him to “get on with it” so she could have more grandchildren to spoil.I also think that if Diana had still been alive this sad situation between Meghan Markle and her dad would never have been allowed to turn so toxic.Diana would have seen this potential problem looming even before the engagement was announced and nipped it firmly in the bud.She would have insisted and ensured he was invited to the UK and would have dispensed shrewd and invaluable advice on how to deal with all of the hoopla surrounding the wedding. Diana learned the hard way how to deal with the media and palace officials. She was misquoted, manipulated and misunderstood during her time as a royal wife and knew all the pitfalls and how to avoid them.Skittish Meghan would have been soothed and calmed and all of the bad feeling among the Markle family would have surely evaporated.Diana would have advised Meghan’s dad on his wedding suit, helped him with his speech and rehearsed him walking down the aisle.She would have put this rather shy and ordinary man completely at ease.Rather than watching his daughter getting married on TV while cowering in a cheap bed and breakfast in the US, he would have been an integral part of the happiest day of her life.Instead, we have a constant stream of ill-advised interviews given by Thomas where he appears to have been ignored and abandoned and, whether it’s fair or not, Meghan seems increasingly cold-hearted.Photos yesterday of. him celebrating his 74th birthday alone with just a fast food takeaway for company don’t exactly help, whether they were staged again or not.A present, phone call or card from Meghan would have gone a long way to build bridges.It’s all turning a tawdry soap opera meaning commentators such as Sharon Osbourne will keep the pot boiling.Just this week she inferred Thomas has a drink problem and should get clean, ensuring more lurid headlines and bad feeling as he furiously has to deny all of the allegations.No one is coming out of this well and never has Princess Diana been more missed.Harry needs her wise counsel and William knows what an important part she could have played in the lives of his ­children.I know her sons will never really get over her death, but I do hope when William looks into his daughter’s beautiful eyes he is heartened to see a reflection of his mum rather than finding it ­unbearably sad.THE way BBC News treated Cliff Richard was utterly shameful and I’m not in the least surprised it lost its court case.The poor man went through years of hell and became a virtual recluse – and his physical and mental health was profoundly affected.At a time when he should have been enjoying the rewards of a lifetime’s graft, he was enduring sleepless nights and often crying in anguish on the kitchen floor.Many in the media have expressed fear and disquiet that any sort of Cliff’s Law will mean restrictions on newspapers, radio and TV, and this is indeed troubling.But the blame should be pointed firmly at those who thought it was a good idea to send a helicopter to film and report an OTT police raid on an innocent man.Seeing Cliff outside the courtroom this week looking extremely fragile and on the verge of tears was heartbreaking.Clearly the sunny, friendly, optimistic Peter Pan of Pop has gone for good and in his place is a haggard, careworn, wary victim.Before the court case, Cliff told me he doesn’t have photos taken with fans and their children any more.It was painful to see the hurt and mistrust in his eyes.He then revealed this week that his VIP status meant he was allowed to use the secret Wimbledon tunnel under Centre Court and Court No1 to bounce quickly between both venues and view as much tennis as possible.Cliff doesn’t do that any more, and never will, because the tunnel goes past the ball boys’ changing area and he doesn’t want to put himself in a situation where he could potentially be accused of something unspeakable.I really hope that when enough time has passed he can get some of that old “glass half full” spirit back, but he will never be the person he was.And no one else should have to go through such a hideous ordeal when they have done nothing wrong.IF you don’t want to watch a movie that will make you laugh, cry and come out singing Abba songs, we can’t be friends.I thoroughly enjoyed Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again – a rare example of a sequel that is better than the original.The starry cast includes Meryl Streep, Julie Walters, PIerce Brosnan, Andy Garcia and Colin Firth. But the cherry on the icing on the cheesecake is the legend that is Cher.I was lucky enough to host the world premiere this week in London and had the chance to talk to the cast, who were effusive in their praise of Her Cherness.It was surprising to hear she STILL gets nervous before going on set and she was genuinely bewildered by all the love in the air for her.I thought one elderly gay gentleman was going to explode with happiness when Cher blew him a kiss.It was so endearing – and there is nothing more deliciously camp than Cher stepping out of a helicopter in a blonde wig and sequins before going on to sing Super Trouper. She’s a class act and a throughly lovely woman.WATCHING politicians squabble like ferrets in a sack soon loses its novelty value – and our eyes are now glazing over whenever the dreaded subject of Brexit rears its ugly head.But we should never forget that when we woke up the day after the referendum – to discover a majority had voted to leave the EU – there was NO actual plan.Bupkis. Nada. Zilch. Diddly-squat.There wasn’t even a “to do” list.Instead, all the rats deserted the sinking ship, claiming the dog had eaten their homework or a big boy did it and ran away – leaving the (female) PM to tidy up their reeking mess. Funny that.No matter which way you voted, surely we can all agree on one thing.There was little or no thought put into how to actually implement such a seismic change. Not even a few notes on the back of a fag packet.Now, two years down the line, the whole big, fat mess is farcical and beyond parody.As a nation, we are a laughing stock.Shame on all those careerists and fence-sitters for their arrogance, stupidity and downright mendacity in not having even a half-arsed plan in place.A parcel of rogues, right enough.IF you fancy a right good laugh at some silly, bonkers, hilarious fun and games, tune in to BBC1 today at 5.05pm for another helping of Wedding Day Winners with myself and Rob Beckett.One couple will actually get married at the end of the show and it’s all very lighthearted and joyful.DID Burberry REALLY need to make a bonfire of its overpriced designer swag and burn an eye-watering £28million worth of clothing and cosmetics?In line with other designer labels, the fashion house claims the move was to stop counterfeiters getting their hands on garments and using them to produce fakes.But surely that just doesn’t add up.If criminals want to reproduce any designer clothes or handbags, they can go into any shop and purchase something – or, even simpler, just order it online.Could Burberry not instead have the mother of all sales in aid of Help for Heroes, or for the homeless charity Centrepoint, or any number of deserving causes here and in the Third World?That £28million would have gone a hell of a long way to help those in need.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Politics is a man’s world and, to many, women still feel like token visitors.Even when Tony Blair famously had 101 “babes” in his 1997 intake of MPs, only four of his Cabinet appointments were female.Here we are, 20 years later, and yes, we have a female Prime Minister but there is still a prevailing view that the Cabinet, in particular, belongs to men.Clearly there’s something profoundly wrong with that equation.Given that this country is made up, more or less equally, of men and women, things would undoubtedly be fairer, not to mention calmer, if more women were on board.So the big question is, why aren’t there?Things are better than they were. Since the 2017 election there are 208 women in the Commons, up from 191 in 2015.But there are still not enough and you don’t have to look far for reasons why that might be.Most women are put off by the environment and the culture and wonder why on earth they would want to put themselves within a country mile of either.Take Prime Minister’s Question Time, which appears to be a bunch of overgrown public school boys booing, jeering and jostling with each other in their bid to establish who is top dog.What woman in her right mind would choose to enter that fray?Then there are the practicalities. This week, Lib Dem MP Jo Swinson was “cheated” in a crunch Brexit vote by the breaking of her pairing pact.This is an arrangement where one MP agrees not to vote to cancel out the fact that another MP on the opposite side is unable to vote — in this case Swinson was at home with her three-week-old baby.The problem was, her pairing partner reneged on the deal and voted.Then there are the hours, which can be difficult if you have a family. Any woman would need a very understanding partner and family to do the job.Also, any MP is opening themselves up to the line of fire and a lot of personal criticism — which multiplies for female MPs.Some have to deal with endless comments and speculation about their appearance, as well as threats of rape and death on a regular basis. Just this week a man was arrested over abusive Facebook posts aimed at various female MPs.If it’s true voters are biased against women, any female has to be ten times as talented, determined and tenacious to get the job in the first place.It’s no wonder women are put off entering politics.But if we want true equality then more women need to go into Westminster and the culture needs to change.That is why I support the campaign group Women To Win and will be taking part in an event called The Voice Of Women In Politics.The idea is to try to encourage more women into Parliament, outlining some of the changes that need to take place to raise the number of female candidates.Getting more women into politics is a no brainer.Women tend to work collaboratively to solve problems whereas — in my experience — men are more likely to lock horns, point fingers and try to shout the loudest. All too often men are interested in progressing to be a leader, whereas women are more focused on getting the job done.And when women DO find their voice in politics, it can be very powerful, and they often hae the balls to say things that men just wouldn’t.Look at Tory minister Anna Soubry, who this week suggested the PM should take control of her hardliner MPs and stop pandering to the likes of Jacob Rees-Mogg.I know she’s got a lot on her plate at the moment, but if I was Theresa May I would be spending a good proportion of my time and energy on making real changes to politics in order, specifically, to attract many more women.It could be one of the greatest legacies she could hope for.Thomas Markle is a concerned dad who just wants to be reconnected with his daughter.Meanwhile this HALF-sister has turned a constant shade of green and wants to get involved in any way she can.Is it any wonder she wasn’t invited to the wedding?MY heroine of the week is 21-year-old Emilia Holden a waitress in Georgia, US, who was at the end of a shift when a customer casually grabbed her bottom as he walked past.Her response? She followed him, grabbed him and body slammed him to the ground, then called the police – after which he spent two nights in a police cell.What a fantastic response. Good for her.But also, who are these men that think that they can just grab a woman’s behind just because they want to?But hearing about elaborate plans by Pixie Lott which include a total of 18 bridesmaids all wearing the same dress, left me feeling a bit stressed out.Apart from anything else, it will take them all an hour to travel up the aisle.JAMES GODDARD-WATTS, the businessman whose family founded the hardware firm Screwfix, is still locked in a multi-million pound divorce battle with his ex-wife, Julia.They reached an agreement eight years ago ­– following the end of a 13-year marriage – that Mrs Goddard-Watts should get a £3.25million house and a £4million lump sum.But she complained that Mr Goddard-Watts had not revealed the full extent of his wealth at the time of the settlement and court fights began.Critics say Julia is a leech, greedy and after his money.But when you consider the worth and value of building a home, looking after children and a family while supporting a spouse, that should be worth at least half of whatever the partner who didn’t do all of that has earned in the meantime.So why shouldn’t she take him back to court?The law states that assets are divided equally.So people who hide theirs from their spouse only have themselves to blame if said spouse feels forced to take them to court to get what’s fair.ELLE Macpherson’s diet regime is enough to make me reach for the pizza delivery menu.The model is up at 5am. She has warm water, lemon and cayenne pepper.She has no booze, almost no carbs, no meat and no dairy. She is such a follower of the alkaline diet – based on the theory you can change the pH of your body through food – that she checks the acidity of her urine.I’m sure the diet is good for her – but who wants to add years to your life if those years are going to be so, well, dull?“The only chance I have of being on TV again is if I were very ugly,” he said.“I think only old, ugly women can get on TV. Like Mary Beard.”David added that he would only be hired now: “If I had tombstone teeth and rather funny hair and made a lot of noise about that fact.”Oh dear.Where even to start? When you resort to attacking someone’s appearance, you are in trouble.It’s not Mary Beard that has held back his career. It’s David himself.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Or a crap remake of Fight Club — except they DO talk about Fight Club. All the time.Theresa May has the leadership skills of a damp dishcloth, no authority and no political vision.A strong leader needs a clear mission. You may not agree with it, but you know what they stand for.“Live each day like it’s your last,” is our Prime Minister’s political strategy, except she’s not dancing in the rain.She is waiting for the sharks to circle. And soon they will come for her.Buffoon-in-chief Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg — a man so old-fashioned he could have been dug up by Time Team — wait to pounce. And Brexit is a mess. Things are so bad, even Elon Musk is out of ideas. No one will be happy with where we end up.And because there is no party political or Brexit majority in the Commons, politics is stuck, trapped in what feels like a never-ending Brexistential crisis.Normally, I’m with “Brenda From Bristol” when it comes to more elections and referendums.But maybe a People’s Vote on the final deal or another election is the only way to unblock Brexit.Think of it like a political plunger — unpleasant, nasty but necessary.You’d think the Opposition would be gleefully capitalising on all this chaos. Think again. Instead of going after the Tories, Labour has decided to traumatise the Jewish community. Again.Labour has had a horrible problem with anti-Semitism, yet instead of healing the wound, it has poured vinegar on it by choosing not to adopt the full International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance code of conduct.These guys sound pretty authoritative and the code is good enough for government departments and the Crown Prosecution Service.Many Jewish groups and leaders, including the Chief Rabbi, are distraught, confused and angry. And you can see why.This shameful decision led to an angry clash outside the Commons chamber where Jewish MP Margaret Hodge confronted Jeremy Corbyn, allegedly calling him an anti-Semite and a racist.Hodge lost family in the Holocaust and fought off the BNP in her Barking and Dagenham constituency.Instead of acknowledging her pain and offering to sit down with her, Team Corbyn are taking disciplinary action against her.I bet they deal with her far quicker than they did with Ken Livingstone, who couldn’t stop banging on about Hitler.What dark times for Labour, which once had a proud tradition of fighting racism. They must sort it out.Then we have the Lib Dems, who have proved useless. They have one policy — stop Brexit.Yet leader Vince Cable and ex-leader Tim Farron missed crucial votes on Monday. Talk about Dem and Dumber.To top it all off, the DUP’s Ian Paisley Jnr has been suspended for 30 days — which hasn’t happened since 1949 — for failing to declare lavish holidays to that well-known Northern Irish stakeholder, Sri Lanka.And to think Theresa May planned to give MPs an extra five days off as a reward for all their hard work.The country has had enough of these fools’ infighting, incompetence and filling their boots. Especially when we face so many big problems, from NHS funding to housing.Parliament’s end-of-term report is a big, fat fail. British politics should be taken into special measures.THE premiere of Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again was sun-kissed, frothy fun –  and no one mentioned the ­Customs Union. Bliss.The stars were out in full, including Cher. She is magnificent, but it is a little odd that at 72 she has fewer wrinkles than any other cast member, including 29-year-old Lily James. And the baby.She told Lorraine Kelly it was down to not drinking, smoking or doing drugs. Yeah, right.We women may be naive when it comes to the quest for eternal beauty, but we ain’t stupid.WHEN you hear of people getting up in the middle of the night and queuing, you think of the Boxing Day sales or the release of the latest Apple gadget.You don’t think of childcare.Yet more than 100 parents queued from 3am – armed with chairs, flasks and biscuits – trying to bag their child a coveted place in the breakfast club at a primary school in Cardiff.For many working parents, breakfast clubs are a lifeline.They can drop off the children in a safe environment where they can get a decent breakfast, then make it to work on time themselves.Though parents have the right to request flexible working hours, many fear the sack if they come in late.These spaces were limited and dished out on a first-come, first-served basis, which is why the parents took such drastic measures.This shows how desperate parents are for childcare that matches their working hours.The scrapping of Labour’s extended school programme and the first real-terms cuts to schools mean all these extras that were provided are no longer affordable.Childcare isn’t a luxury.It’s a necessity for millions of families and they are crying out for more breakfast and after-school clubs.JEFF BEZOS, the boss of Amazon, is a man clearly in his “Prime”.He’s now the richest man in modern history.Good for him.I’m all for celebrating entrepreneurs and hard work – but shouldn’t that apply to his poor workers toiling away in his warehouses?They would probably give Amazon working conditions zero stars.I wish our business leaders remembered some of their forefathers, who felt a moral and civic responsibility to look after their employees and took some pride in that.It makes business sense too. Happy workers are better workers.So after Bezos pops open the champagne, maybe he could spare a thought for his staff, who told an undercover reporter they pee in bottles because the loos are too far away and they are afraid of being accused of time-wasting.C’mon, Jeff – that’s really taking the p**s. ONE school in Liverpool had to apologise after kids as young as four were left in tears when they were denied an ice cream treat because they didn’t have a 97 per cent attendance record.How mean is that? What if they were ill? And surely it’s the parents’ fault.CARERS got another kick in the teeth this week when the Court of Appeal overturned a decision that those doing sleep-in shifts should earn at least the minimum wage.If the decision had gone through, it would have cost the UK care sector billions – so charities and local governments were relieved.But it shows what a raw deal carers get.Judges said only hours spent awake counted as work – but that is completely out of touch with the reality of what carers do.Many of the elderly and vulnerable people they look after need their help through the night, whether it’s a trip to the loo, to take medication or dealing with more serious situations such as seizures. Carers can’t exactly fall into a deep sleep. They have to be alert and listening in case they are needed.The rooms they sleep in may not be comfortable and they will be away from their own families.Many carers are paid so little that they live hand to mouth and barely get by.When I met a group in the West Midlands, they told me they couldn’t afford to put the heating on in winter and had to take their kids to the grandparents’ for tea once or twice a week just so they would be fed.Some were struggling so much they had to visit food banks.But they also loved their jobs and took great pride in looking after their clients as if they were family.They get paid a pittance, with some earning just £30 for a ten-hour shift.These low-paid workers – the majority of whom are women – are unsung heroes and deserve more.New Health Secretary Matt Hancock must make social care a priority and enforce minimum-wage law properly.It’s time we took better care of our carers.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We are pushing the envelope.”But when discussion turned to the loss of two Cabinet big guns, the usually gloomy Chancellor delivered a rare upbeat verdict.He declared: “The two main bogeymen have been taken off the board.”Last night his off-the-cuff remark was described as “arrogant” and “disdainful” by angry Brexiteers.They claimed it betrayed his staunch Remainer tendencies and determination to keep Britain shackled to the EU.A senior Brexiteer said last night: “With each day that passes, it is clear that this is more and more a Remain-run Brexit.“We have a Remain Prime Minister, a Remain Cabinet Office and most clearly of all a Remain Chancellor who is happy to undermine British interests and wave the white flag of surrender to Brussels as these comments prove once again.“It shows he is on the side of Brussels and not the 17.4million people who voted to leave the EU.”Former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith added: “There is no room in the Conservative party for arrogant and disdainful remarks about colleagues.“Who’s to say that, for some, it may well be the Chancellor who turns out to be the bogeyman.”Grant Shapps, who called for an “orderly” change after the 2017 election shambles, urged MPs to close ranks and get EU talks done.Tory MP Andrea Jenkyns, who quit as a ministerial aide over the Chequers blueprint, added: “I have nothing but the highest admiration for my colleagues David Davis and Boris Johnson.“They both made a brave and principled stand in putting the country before their party or their careers.“As for the Chancellor, if I were him, I’d be worred about the reaction of 17.4million people who voted for Brexit and already feel betrayed. They won’t be going away.“Philip Hammond has become nothing more than a mouthpiece for the PM’s EU-loving Europe adviser Olly Robbins.”Mr Hammond’s outburst has put Theresa May’s attempts to restore Cabinet unity at risk.The Chancellor, who is no stranger to Cabinet bust-ups, has clashed with several colleagues over Brexit and the squeeze on spending.He was accused of likening Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson to Private Pike from TV comedy classic Dad’s Army.After a clash over lack of military funding, an ally of Mr Hammond said: “Williamson doesn’t know one end of a rifle from the other.“When he is with all these grizzled old forces types, he just sites there looking like Private Pike from Dad’s Army.”An ally said: “I’ve never heard Philip use the word bogeyman against any colleague. He is a great admirer of David Davis and would never talk in a disparaging way about him.“Perhaps he was saying that the EU saw these two people as bogeymen. I’m sure Philip never has.”A senior Cabinet source said Mr Hammond was expressing the harsh reality – in his trademark clumsy way.He said: “I agreed with Philip’s sentiments but not the language used.“I suspect he was trying to say it is important to have a Cabinet united behind the same plan and removing two outspoken critics is a positive step.“However, to call hem bogeymen is over the top and will only inflame the precarious peace between the Leave and Remain camps.”If that’s the case then surely we won’t be conceding any more to Brussels.The evidence on Friday — when the EU slapped down Theresa May’s Chequers offers — suggests otherwise.Hammond’s disparaging remark shows that Remainers are at the heart of Theresa May’s Government, running the show at the expense of Leave voices.This Government sees Brexit as a damage-limitation exercise rather than a golden opportunity for Britain to reinvent itself as a global and buccaneering free nation.How can we ever achieve Brexit in full if the Government itself is so institutionally Euro-phile? We need more Brexiteers at the heart of the project.Meanwhile, it is clear that the PM’s Chequers plan has not only failed to win over Brussels, but also her party. The grassroots are livid.It was as generous an offer as Mrs May could politically have tabled.Every time we are reasonable in our approach, the EU slaps us down. They are determined to punish us.We can’t just keep giving while the EU arrogantly takes. Enough is enough.It is clear Mrs May needs to change her approach to Brexit - and fast.The PM has repeatedly said: “No deal is better than a bad deal”.She must be true to her words — and properly start planning for such a scenario.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And tell the truth? And the answer’s no.He added: I talked it over with my wife and her advice was: Leave. Mind you, she’s had to put up with the workload and the absence.Davis says Theresa May would look at deals struck with other countries - Canada, South Korea, South Africa, Switzerland, New Zealand - and create a best-of dossier as a bargaining chip.And he slammed the Treasury for fear mongering, saying: You’ve got a Whitehall establishment which putting it mildly, is not an enthusiast for the project.

Having your young lover saw and cut at you with a blade is both physically and mentally scarring.He physically abused and harmed me. Tore me down until I had nothing, so I’d have to go back to him.He made me believe his ideas were right. That everything was evil except him. That he was God.”Wyllie even imagined the aftermath, writing in his diary: “If this is found I have committed one of the worst atrocities in British history or I killed myself.”He and Bolland claimed they were seeking revenge for bullying.But twisted plot mastermind Wyllie hated authority figures and was obsessed with serial killers and blood-thirsty films.Bolland boasted of their plan in a text to a pupil saying: “You know we’re gonna do this school shooting . . . don’t take it as a joke.”The trial earlier heard the pair hero-worshipped Columbine shooters Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold who killed 13 people in 1999.The girl said: “He dressed like Eric all the time, he was proud, he admired him, he worshipped him.”The pair downloaded a bomb-making manual to make a device like the one that killed 22 people at the Ariana Grande concert in Manchester in May last year.They intended to torture and murder the parents of Wyllie’s girlfriend and steal her dad’s shotguns.After lying low at a hideout where they had stashed screws and flammable liquid to make a nail bomb, they would attack the school.Dressed in trench coats, the demented duo began opening fire on pupils outside the school before moving inside and spraying bullets at victims in the library.It later emerged Harris and Klebold placed two duffel bags each containing a 20-pound propane bomb set to explode in the cafeteria and waited outside.But when the bombs failed to go off, they started gunning down students - firing a total of 188 rounds of ammunition during the bloodbath.The pair murdered 12 students and one teacher and injured 21 others before they killed themselves after a shootout with police.But the massacre was tragically not a one off and children in America continue to be exposed to gun violence that is unparalleled anywhere in the Western world.More than 187,000 kids have been exposed to gun violence at school since Columbine.Wyllie and Bolland were found guilty of conspiracy to murder at Leeds crown court in May.Neither showed any emotion as judge Mrs Justice Cheema-Grubb said: “You were only 14 when you planned to murder teachers and pupils.”She locked up Wyllie for 12 years and Bolland for ten."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000422086425-e1532217086583.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"david beckhams broke nephew says hes been frozen out of the family while brooklyn and romeo live the high life","story":"Freddie Every, 17, grew up playing with his cousins Romeo and Brooklyn but now lives in temporary housing with his hard-up dad.The footie-mad teen feels he was cast adrift when his dad Colin, 50, and Becks’ eldest sister Lynne split up after 11 years of marriage in 2010.Freddie is now on a bricklaying course while living with his dad in a one-bedroom council flat in Dagenham, East London, reports the Sunday Mirror.He is desperately trying to reach out to the Beckhams and is dying to be reunited with his extended family.Freddie told the newspaper: “I just want to be able to go for a meal and talk and catch up.

United Utilities has come under fire for wasting water during the heatwave.According to the BBC, the water company loses 25% of its supplies through leaking pipes, which amounts to 439.2 million litres a day.That is the equivalent of more than one and a half bath tubs of water for every property, every day.To combat the problem, UU has turned to Snipe, a 21-month-old cocker Spaniel, which has undergone weeks of special training to detect tiny amounts of chlorine found in tap water.Snipe will be used to find leakages in rural areas where they are hardest to detect.UU is responsible for a network of 42,000 kilometres of pipes. With a team of 140 personnel, using drones and sound detection, it fixes around 27,000 leaks a year.But critics say more needs to be done to stop the leaks and potentially end the water shortage crisis."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000421357317.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"chief remoaner claims no deal would put britain in state of emergency but dominic raab says well thrive no matter what","story":"The pro-EU Tory insisted that no-deal would spark a huge crisis in the country and we would run out of food and medicine.Mr Grieve, who has been in charge of leading other Remainers to water down Theresa Mays Brexit Bill in the Commons on numerous occasions, denied his comments were another attempt at Remains Project Fear today and insisted it would be absolutely catastrophic if talks broke down with Brussels.He told Skys Sophie Ridge on Sunday this morning: Its right to take emergency measures, but we will be in a state of emergency.And he even claimed basic services like flights abroad wouldnt be able to take place, and there would be trouble getting food into the country.It is so serious - I find it difficult to see that no deal is better than a deal on offer, the Beaconsfield MP said.Ministers have drawn up secret plans to stockpile processed foods in case of a no-deal Brexit, and have started putting in place contingency plans.Last week Mrs May and the EU told businesses to start stepping up their preparations for not securing a Brexit deal with the EU.Advice will be given out across the summer for how to start getting ready.But Brexit Secretary Dominic Grieve insisted that we will thrive when we come out of the EU - no matter what happens.He insisted that far-fetched, fanciful predictions of what would happen when we leave would not come true, and he was confident of securing an arrangement.Mr Raab said the UK was hiring extra border staff and pumping in money to departments to prepare.Speaking to the Andrew Marr Show he said: People need to know we are getting ready and Britain can thrive no matter what happens.And he was confident that we would be able to get a deal by October, with his fresh injection of energy, ambition and pragmatism.80 per cent of the withdrawal agreement is already sorted, he confirmed today. And he insisted the Government would do everything it needed to smooth over any bumps we may face in the coming months.We will act responsibly and set out the details of that through technical notices over the coming months, he added.If we have no deal, we will make sure we are prepared - we will have all the planning in place and the infrastructure to deal with that.But he said that Mr Barnier asking questions about the UKs plans for Brexit was a good positive sign and ministers were pleased to see it.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I have never seen anything like it.The bolt was in his head and he was still alive and talking. I’m amazed he didn’t die.He must have a  angel or some other divine help because he is still alive.I’ve seen many things during my career but nothing as macabre as that. I can’t believe he was still able to talk to me.He was on the boat with his uncle, brother and two friends and they were shooting the harpoon at rocks.It appears the bolt was damaged and then when it was reloaded it didn’t lock properly and so when he stood up it went off and shot through his mask and into his head.The bolt was embedded in his head but appears to have missed his brain and other blood vessels.It went into a cavity behind his forehead.He is in hospital now and we are all hoping he pulls through.A file is being prepared for the local prosecutor as he was underage and shouldn’t have been handling the harpoon.As the uncle and brother are older and technically in charge it’s possible they could face action but that is for the prosecutor.A Foreign Office official said they were unaware of the incident.GOT a story?

It\u0027s been a busy year for the prince who has welcomed a new little brother, completed his first year at school and joined his great grandmother the Queen on Buckingham Palace\u0027s balcony to mark her official birthday.First born child of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, Prince George Alexander Louis was born on 22 July 2013 in the Lindo Wing of St Mary\u0027s Hospital in Paddington. He met the world\u0027s media one day later, leaving with his mother and father after being safely strapped into the baby car seat.He was christened on 23 October 2013, at The Chapel Royal, St James\u0027s Palace, by The Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Reverend Justin Welby. Prince George, who is third in line to the throne, was the Queen\u0027s third great-grandchild. She now has seven.The young prince has just completed his first year at Thomas\u0027s School in Battersea, south London.He arrived hand-in-hand with William on his first day, his mother Kate\u0027s morning sickness meaning she was unable to go along with him too.When Prince Louis was born in April, Prince George joined younger sister Princess Charlotte at the Lindo Wing to visit their new brother. With a love of planes, just like his father, Prince George enjoyed a fly-past in June to honour the Queen\u0027s official birthday on Buckingham Palace\u0027s balcony.The youngster - who aged just two made the best dressed list in GQ - was last seen at Prince Louis\u0027s christening in July wearing his custom summer staple, a pair of shorts.

Since Michel Barnier responded to Theresa May’s Brexit White Paper with a very polite “non” on Friday, it’s been all out war in the Tory ranks. Between the outcry over Vote Leave cheating in the campaign, the claims of Mad Max style armageddon if we don’t get a deal and Jacob Rees-Mogg being his most Jacob Rees-Mogg self, the rhetoric has seldom been so charged. So we thought it’d be helpful to have all this weekend’s most alarming Brexit pronouncements all in one place. Here’s a roundup. 1. Dominic Grieve: No-deal Brexit will leave us in a \u0027state of emergency\u0027  The Tory remainer told Sky News’ Sophy Ridge today: “I think no-deal would be absolutely catastrophic for this country. Clearly if the government thinks there’s a risk of no deal it’s right to take emergency measures, but we’ve got to be realistic about this, we will be in a state of emergency.” He added: “I don’t think it is scaremongering. Another way of looking at it is that it is so serious that one would hope that even if we weren’t able to reach any agreement with the EU on the economic framework we would still at the last minute put together some side-deals to address some of these issues. But you’ve got to understand that the language of some of my colleagues at Westminster is that they are actively seeking no-deal because they are so absolutely fixated on leaving the European Union without any ties or obligations at all. If that is what they want to pursue, then they themselves will be the people who precipitate this particular crisis.”  2. Dominic Raab: ‘Forgive me if I don’t keep a laser like focus on the substance’ The Tory Brexit Secretary told the BBC’s Andrew Marr this morning Brussels raising concerns about the legal position of UK citizens in the EU and EU citizens of the UK if we don\u0027t get a deal was irresponsible. He added: We ought to be trying to reassure citizens on the continent and also here. I think they’re trying to, in lots of ways…and of course neither the commission or the EU as a whole speaks with one voice. And there’s obviously an attempt to ramp up the pressure, and that’s fine. Forgive me if I don’t keep a laser like focus on the substance. He also refused to deny Britain planned to stockpile food, just in case.  Tory Remainer Anna Soubry told the : “Since the referendum, the forces of darkness have taken over and they have continued to take over and this week if there was every any doubt who was running this government it was quashed.” 4. Jacob Rees Mogg: It could take 50 years to know if Brexit has been a success  He told Channel 4: “We will know at some point, of course we will. But it’s a question of timescale. We won’t know the full economic consequences for a very long time, we really won’t.” He was challenged by Krishnan Guru Murthy, who said: “Of course not, but I mean we’ll have an indication. We’ll know if there’s been chaos, we’ll know if there have been job losses.” But Moggy insisted: “The overwhelming opportunity for Brexit is over the next 50 years.” He refused to say he’d resign if Brexit wasn’t a success, saying he puts his own future on the line at every election.  Asked if there should be a second referendum, Tory Brexiteer told the BBC’s Sunday Politics: “Absolutely not. Why do we need a second referendum? If nothing else we would need an act of Parliament to pass one. It would take at least another year or 18 months for that to happen. “But what is this, bullying? Do we say to the British people we don’t trust you in your last decision and your last vote, you’ve got to go again? Is it best of three?” 6. John Major: A second referendum would be ‘morally justified.’  Tory former prime minister Sir John Major told The Andrew Marr Show a second referendum is morally justified. He told the show: It has downsides. I mean, frankly, a second vote has democratic downsides. It has difficulties. But is it morally justified? I think it is. If you look back at the Leave campaign a great many of the promises they made were fantasy promises. We now know they are not going to be met. A referendum isn\u0027t an easy option, but it\u0027s not one at this stage that I would rule out.

President Moreno is in London to deliver a keynote speech at the Global Disability Summit, which is being hosted by Ms Mordaunt, the International Development Secretary. The Mirror understands the pair will meet on Tuesday, and are expected to discuss a range of bilateral issues, which could include Assange\u0027s asylum claim.  Assange has been holed up in London\u0027s Ecuadorian Embassy since 2012, when he asked the state for asylum. He was wanted in Sweden over sexual assault allegations, but claimed asylum fearing he would be extradited to the United States. He\u0027s currently wanted by British police for breaking bail conditions by failing to attend a court hearing in an attempt to resist extradition to Sweden. The Swedish sexual assault investigation was closed in 2017, but it\u0027s still possible the US Department of Justice could pursue him on espionage charges over the leaks of government documents relating to the Iraq and Afghanistan wars.

Meanwhile, senior Conservative MP Dominic Grieve said Britain would be left in a state of emergency if we do not secure a deal before Brexit day. He told Sky\u0027s Sophy Ridge: I think no-deal would be absolutely catastrophic for this country.  Clearly if the government thinks there’s a risk of no deal it’s right to take emergency measures, but we’ve got to be realistic about this, we will be in a state of emergency. He denied claims Britain would lose the right to fly over European countries and would be unable to import medicines and food were scaremongering.

If that is what they want to pursue, then they themselves will be the people who precipitate this particular crisis.  Asked if the reports of plans to stockpile food were true, he told the BBC\u0027s Andrew Marr it was unhelpful. He said: That kind of selective snippet that makes it into the media to the extent that the public pay attention to it is unhelpful. Asked again if it was true, he said: We’re making sure, both in the allocation of money, \u0026pound3bn allocated last budget, through operational things like hiring extra border staff, through the legal arrangements both domestic, but also the treaty arrangements, we\u0027re ready for any and every eventuality. And we will gradually and responsibly, which is the right thing for the government to do, set out more of that through techical notices. He added: I’m not going to get drawn into the selective snippets that are leaked out, and hair raising stories.  He was also asked whether it was true that another part of the Government\u0027s plan for a doomsday no-deal Brexit involved turning the M26 into a ten-mile-long lorry park. He again refused to deny it. He said: Well, no, but of course. If we have no deal, we want to make sure that we’re prepared at the border for the knock on effects that would have if on the EU side they take the worst case scenario approach, which is frankly irrational. And he said Brussels raising concerns about the legal position of UK citizens in the EU and EU citizens of the UK if we don\u0027t get a deal was irresponsible.

Mr Raab was a board member of Vote Leave, who the Electoral Commission ruled this week had broken the rules by overspending during the campaign.  But he suggested there was a problem with how the Tory Government, under David Cameron , had behaved during the campaign.  Mr Raab served as minister for Civil Liberties during the period in question. Asked if he believed the watchdog was politically biased, Mr Raab said: I\u0027m not getting into all of that - we\u0027ve got the rule of law and I respect it, and there\u0027s been a report out in the papers today about whether actually the Government\u0027s campaigning was correct.  Mr Raab was referring to the Independent Commission on Referendums\u0027 report on how such polls should be regulated in future. The report does raise concerns about the potential for potentially unlimited spending of public money in favour of one side of the debate before the final four weeks of the campaign. It suggests a the ban on government communications be extended for the whole referendum period, rather than just the final month.  However, the report also calls for a full white paper on how the government is to proceed to be published before any referendum is called.

Both he and former leader Tim Farron were absent from the vote last week despite changes to Theresa May\u0027s Brexit plan passing by a tiny majority in a day of House of Commons chaos. Farron apologised after he skipped the knife-edge vote to give a \u0026pound5 talk about \u0027intolerance\u0027 to Christians following a row over whether gay sex is a sin. Events changed rapidly through the day over the amendments to the Customs Bill, which Tory Leavers made in a bid to wreck Mrs May\u0027s plan for \u0027Soft Brexit\u0027. First the amendments were doomed to fail. Then Theresa May decided to back them to stop a Brexiteer revolt. Then, finally, Labour decided to vote against them - setting up the last-minute showdown.  In the end the key amendment - making it illegal for Britain to collect customs tariffs on behalf of the EU, unless the EU reciprocates - passed by 305 votes to 302. That meant if Mr Farron and Sir Vince had turned up, just one more Remainer would have needed to join them for it to be blocked. Sir Vince was reportedly attending a dinner to discuss the idea of setting up a new anti-Brexit party. An insider told the Sunday Times: “Sir Vince recognises that the centre ground has been all but abandoned by the two mainstream parties and was interested in exploring the idea of a new party. “He is not implacably opposed to the idea but wanted to be reassured it will actually get off the ground.

Mr Finnett dived into the water and dragged Toby back onto the boat before heading to the nearest port, but the boy was pronounced dead at a local hospital. A devastated Mr Finnett described his talented filmmaker son as his best friend and travel companion as he spoke about the horror of the day.  Paul, who is managing director for Aon, said: Toby lost his balance in the blink of an eye trying to get closer to his brothers, who were at the front of the boat.  He told the Mail on Sunday: We are numb – there is no pain like losing a child.  Nothing can prepare you for the shock and disbelief that this can ever happen to you. The horror incident happened last Saturday (July 14) after licensed sailor Paul hired a rigid inflatable speedboat for a day trip with Toby, his older son Benjamin, 17, and stepson Kai Stark, 14. The family were on a boy\u0027s trip when they decided to explore the nearby small island of Mogonisi, but they found themselves in turbulent waters about half a mile south of the island\u0027s port town of Gaios.  Mr Finnett paid tribute to his \u0027inspirational\u0027 son who he said lived life to the full in his short 15 years. Toby was a keen runner and was passionate about learning about the world, cultures and adventure and had big dreams for his future, Mr Finnett said.  On Thursday Mr Finnett changed his Facebook profile to one of Toby relaxing in the sunshine.  The family, from Littlehampton in West Sussex, are understood to live in Houston, Texas where Mr Finnett works as a managing director for the energy company. He\u0027s believed to have moved there in 1994 with his first wife, Justine Warburton, who is the mother of Toby and Benjamin.

Twisted Tom Wyllie carved his name into her back with a \u0026shypenknife. At the time he was plotting a \u0026shydevastating school massacre. The girl, who is 15 and cannot be named for legal reasons, said: “He wanted to hurt me. He did hurt me. “He physically abused and harmed me. Tore me down until I had nothing, so I’d have to go back to him.” Her ordeal, in a filthy shack behind a mini-mart store, came as Wyllie planned to murder classmates in a sick re-enactment of the 1999 US Columbine school shooting. The girl said: “He made me believe his ideas were right. That everything was evil except him. That he was God.”  She has taken drastic steps to try to get rid of the unsightly carving but is scarred for life. The distraught teenager heated up knives and tried to burn off the letters T O M from her skin. She has also had two operations. But the scarring remains. She feels \u0026shyunable to go swimming because she is embarrassed and cries constantly. She said: “Having your young lover saw and cut at you with a blade is both physically and mentally scarring. “The feeling of a steel pen knife against my skin is something I can’t forget. Being bent over and hidden away in an abandoned shack filled with bugs and garbage with my shirt lifted up to a boy I adored only for him to hurt me is forever going to be painful.” Wyllie, now 15, was jailed for 12 years on Monday for planning what he hoped would be one of the worst atrocities in British history. His accomplice Alex Bolland, also 15, got ten years over the plan to shoot classmates and teachers.  The pair hero-worshipped US killers Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris, who slaughtered 12 pupils and a teacher at their high school before taking their own lives. The two British boys, who were only 14 when they hatched their plot, drew up a hitlist of fellow students who had \u0026shysupposedly bullied them, and also members of staff, at their school in Northallerton, North Yorks. The girl’s horror was recounted to the authorities after her boyfriend and his partner-in-crime were captured. The teenagers downloaded \u0026shybomb-making manuals, researched weapons online and warned friends about what was to come. Wyllie, who has been described as the leader, \u0026shydiscussed his motivations for the planned massacre in his diary. The inside cover of the book, which was recovered from the teenager’s home last October, apologises for \u0026shycommitting “one of the worst atrocities in British history” and killing himself. The journal also featured a page of “stuff we need” for the plan, including napalm, firearms and pipe bombs.  In a secret hideout near Catterick Army Garrison, Wyllie kept a rucksack filled with screws, boards and \u0026shyflammable liquid. Bolland claimed he had also been a victim of bullying and revenge was his motivation. His Snapchat conversation discussing details of the plot came to light last September. Bolland confessed to a teacher and police. He claimed the people he aimed to kill were “infecting the gene pool” and that he and Wyllie were doing a “service to society”. But the pair were not \u0026shyarrested until October after Wyllie’s secret hideout was found by officers. Following a trial at Leeds crown court, both were convicted of \u0026shyconspiracy to murder. Wyllie was additionally convicted of the unlawful wounding of a teenage girl. The court heard how Wyllie also wanted to copy the film Natural Born Killers by murdering his girlfriend’s parents and going on the run. Giving evidence against him, the girl said her parents had banned her from seeing the “weird” schoolboy who had a deep-rooted hatred of them.  She told the court he climbed into her bedroom window last October armed with a large kitchen knife. He told her: “I would kill your \u0026shyparents if I had the chance, and not feel anything.” She said: “He goes on about a plan to kill my parents and we’d run off together and it would only last a month and then we would have to kill each other.” She said he wanted to run away with her: “He suggested we go full NBK (Natural Born Killers).” When she let Wyllie in through her bedroom window he was dressed like his sick hero Eric Harris, who wore a trench coat, backwards black baseball cap, black jeans and a white T-shirt for the Colombine massacre. The girl said: “He dressed like Eric all the time, he was proud, he admired him, he worshipped him.” Wyllie, who was also fascinated by the Nazis, had written on the white T-shirt in German the words for “kill the family” or “the family is dead”. The girl’s father owned seven shotguns, which Wyllie had asked about many times. To keep Wyllie happy and stop him nagging her She lied about getting hold of the keys to her father’s gun cabinet. She said: “I was scared he would hurt me or hurt someone else.”  But the girl’s mum heard her daughter’s wind \u0026shychimes and came into the \u0026shybedroom. Wyllie fled. He was said to have musical ability and liked Kurt Cobain and Nirvana but also had darker interests. He revelled in suicide videos and \u0026shyposted gory pictures of dead babies on social media. Wyllie confessed to his girlfriend: “I love that people are scared of me because it makes me feel powerful.” He kept a diary, just as Eric Harris had done, and wrote down names on a hitlist. On his bedroom wall he had scrawled the name Satan and the words Red Rum – murder backwards.

Wanting to get a closer look, he zoomed in and changed the angle at which he was looking at them. But it seems Google\u0027s Street View car captured a lot more than an innocent image of two holidaymakers. Bizarrely, the up-close image appears to show that one of the girls has a third leg. A third limb with toes can be seen sticking out from the sorts of the blonde girl on the right.  Users immediately dubbed the three-legged tourist mutant girl. But all may not be as it seems, with many pointing out the third leg is actually just a glitch on the Google system.

The newlyweds have already been for a viewing and fallen in love with the sprawling manor in Home Park after being offered it as a gift from the Queen, according to a source who told Mail Online. Nestled in the heart of the Crown Estate\u0027s private 655-acre royal park, Adelaide Cottage was built in 1831 as a retreat for William IV’s wife Queen Adelaide. The home boasts a master bedroom with gilded dolphins on the coved ceiling and rope ornament from a 19th century yacht, Royal George along with a Graeco-Egyptian fireplace.  The cottage, which underwent renovation in 2015 and is described as picturesque by the heritage organisation Historic England, is just a few minutes walk from Windsor Castle - where the couple married on May 19. The source added: There are seven gated entrances and exits to Windsor Castle so the newlyweds could come and go without worrying about being photographed.  It was formerly known as Adelaide Lodge, incorporating part of John Nash\u0027s original Royal Lodge. It has been home to Royal dignitaries and courtiers, most recently Simon Rhodes, son of Margaret Rhodes, who was first cousin of the Queen and a Lady in Waiting to Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother. The Queen helped Rhodes move his family to Britain from his home in Zimbabwe after he was driven out by the continuing violence in the country. But perhaps its most famous resident has been Group Capt Townsend - who was equerry to King George VI from 1944 to 1952 and who moved into the property in 1945 with his wife Rosie Marchioness Camden. Soon after the couple’s divorce in 1952, his doomed romance with Princess Margaret became public.

But when her then-husband got a job in Worcester, the couple had to move more than 200 miles to Middlesbrough and her life changed dramatically. Saying goodbye to her family and friends proved harder than she expected, and she turned to food for comfort. Before long Vanessa, who was working in a coffee shop, had put on six stone and hated the way she looked. She said: I\u0027d always been really fit and healthy right up until my early 20s. I\u0027d danced at the same dance school for over 17 years and had never worried about my weight or what I was eating.  After getting married, my ex-husband got a job in Worcester and we moved over 200 miles south from Middlesbrough. Looking back, it was a really unhappy time for me. I moved away from my friends and family, from the dance school I loved to a place where I knew no one and food became my comfort. I\u0027d eat broken breakfast pastries and cakes throughout the day at work then would come home and cook three course dinners every night. We\u0027d always have a starter followed by a huge pasta meal and favourites like toad in the hole and cottage pie. But it wasn\u0027t until her mum had a terrifying cancer scare that she decided it was time to change her life.  She said: It wasn\u0027t until my really health conscious mum was diagnosed with breast cancer that I looked at my own health and realised just how heavy and unhealthy I\u0027d become. I was unhappy with how I looked and felt, I wasn\u0027t enjoying my job and I felt trapped in my marriage. So, I decided to address one thing at a time. I started doing workouts at home – I was too embarrassed and ashamed to go to the gym – and saw results pretty quickly.  Vanessa then decided to make bigger changes, and started buying healthy food products from MuscleFood .   She said: I overhauled my diet and found MuscleFood. I love to cook and love food so didn\u0027t want to cut out all the things I enjoyed. Instead I made a few adjustments to make them healthier – swapping regular bread and pasta for the low carb versions I could buy from MuscleFood. I can still have my treats – the protein pizza is amazing – and I know I\u0027m eating healthy, wholesome meals, like the Easy Cook meal bags. She joined a proper join and was training four times a week, and before long she even managed to get a job there.  And Vanessa, who now weights 11 and a half stone, is no long content with just being in good shape, and has become a bodybuilder. She recently won her category in the UKBFF (UK Bodybuilding Fitness Federation) competition. She said: My husband and I separated, and I took a new job working for a gym chain.

Lindsay Taylor, 33, moved in with her ex after she and her husband suddenly became homeless. When Lindsay and new love, Mike Taylor, 50, suddenly became homeless, her open minded former husband Chris Kelley, 46, suggested they all move in together. Mum-of-four Lindsay describes it as “a very modern family” - and the two men now get on like a house on fire. She met Mike shortly after her daughter Joanna, now two, was born.  Knowing her marriage to Chris was over, Lindsay began divorce proceedings in 2016 but the couple remained on good terms. In July last year, Mike and Lindsay tied the knot in a beach ceremony, when she was pregnant with baby Harrison, now aged five months. Chris looked after their children, Joanna, and Lucas, five, who suffers from a rare immunodeficiency disorder, chronic granulomatous disease or CGD. Lucas’ stepsister Rachel, 17, who Lindsay gave birth to as a teenager, is finishing her final year of high school at home. Lindsay moved back in with her mum and began seeing Mike and soon they decided to move in together. But when they were evicted because the landlord was renting to them illegally, Chris suggested they all move into his five-bed house in Connecticut, USA.  Lindsay said: “We started to look for another place, but Chris made a suggestion that no-one was expecting. “He said: \u0027Why don\u0027t you both move in with me? We can pay one mortgage, one set of bills and keep all the kids together?\u0027. “Chris is very open minded, so for him, this wasn’t a big deal at all – it just made sense.” Moving in with Chris also gave them both the chance to see their children every day. Lindsay added: “We were willing to do anything to keep the flow of our family going. “Mike found it quite hard. He’s more classic and not as ‘go with the flow’. “It took him a while to be comfortable in our blended home.”  The men quickly struck up a friendship and helped each other out with painting and decorating. Mike joked to Chris: I took your wife, the least I could do was paint your kitchen. In October last year, Lucas underwent a bone marrow transplant which it is hoped will regenerate his immune system and cure him of CGD. He needs to live in a semi-sterile environment, and the five-bed home the family share is ideal. Lindsay said: “Lucas is a complex kid that needs a village around him and this is what we’re doing. “It might seem a bit strange that I live with both my ex-husband and my husband, but it’s what we need to do to get through this as a family. “Lucas’ immune system is so fragile right now that we need to limit his exposure to the outside world, and this means as a family we need to do this as well. “We can go to the store and little things like that but we avoid large gatherings and restaurants where we can easily pick up infections and pass them on to Lucas. “It’s a big sacrifice that everyone is making but hopefully it will all be for the best when Lucas gets better.” Cinema manager Chris has taken leave from work to care for Lucas, while Lindsay extended her maternity leave from her job. Mike also took leave from work to dedicate his time to his family, including Destiny Taylor, 20, and Danny Taylor, 19, who live with their grandparents a few doors down. Lindsay explained: “It was during the end of my pregnancy with Joanna that mine and Chris\u0027 marriage began to break down.

The adorable youngster was pictured beaming outside Clarence House in an official snap celebrating his big day. William and Kate have previously said they want George and his siblings, Charlotte, three, and two-month-old Louis, to have as “normal” an upbringing as possible, but they are still subject to certain Royal rules. Eagle-eyed royal fans will have noticed that George already complies with the tradition that boys within the monarchy are expected to wear shorts until the age of eight . It is believe to be a rite of passage dating back to the 16th century that they only graduate to long trousers at that age to signifying they are growing up.  The only time George has been seen publicly in long trousers was at Prince Harry’s wedding to Meghan Markle earlier this year. Another royal rule - that many five-year-olds would be heartbroken by - is that he may have to return a number of his gifts. According to official royal guidelines, “gifts offered by private individuals living in the UK not personally known to the member of the Royal Family should be refused where there are concerns about the propriety of motives of the donor or the gift itself”. This strict rule meant the Duke and Duchess of Sussex had to return millions of pounds worth of wedding gifts earlier this year, reports the Sunday Express .  Old tradition also dictates that no two direct heirs to the thrown are allowed to travel together at any one time . The rule dates date back to when air travel was a lot less safe and so far the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have so far ignored that rule - as did Charles with William and Harry when they were young. They are believed to have done so to be more cost efficient and to keep the family together. However, it is thought that George may be obliged to fly separately once he turns 12. Growing up in the smartphone age many of his peers will be taking selfies, but George will be reportedly discouraged from doing so.  As for why this has become part of royal protocol, US ambassador Matthew Barzun was able to shed some light on this in 2014, after having a meeting with Her Majesty who is reportedly not a fan. He told Tatler magazine: She was essentially saying, \u0027I miss eye contact\u0027. However, while whatever Her Maj says goes, the \u0027no selfie\u0027 rule hasn\u0027t exactly been strictly enforced. Signing autographs has long been banned for Royals amid fears the signature could be forged and used maliciously , however, in recent years, the same rules have been extended to selfies.  Kensington Palace shared George\u0027s official birthday snap last night , which was taken shortly after his brother Louis was christened, and by the same photographer who covered the event earlier this month. George will today enjoy private celebrations, with mum and dad Kate and Prince William keeping the plans under wraps this time. According to reports the party may take place in the Caribbean as William and Kate are rumoured to have taken their children on a summer break to the exclusive island of Mustique. The past 12 months have been an exciting period for George, from completing his first school year to once again joining his great grandmother the Queen on Buckingham Palace\u0027s balcony to mark her official birthday. Last year the young royal spent the run-up to his big day on an official tour of Poland and Germany with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and his younger sister Charlotte.  During the trip the prince, who loves flying, was spotted grinning from ear to ear as he got to sit at the controls of a helicopter. George has been on several royal engagements already. His first was a tour of Australia and New Zealand with his parents in 2014. Two years later he was joined by Charlotte, born in 2015, for the Cambridges’ tour of Canada – their first as a family of four. Prince George Alexander Louis of Cambridge was born at the private maternity wing of St Mary\u0027s Hospital, Paddington, the Lindo Wing, at 4.24pm on July 22, 2013, weighing 8lbs 6oz. He made his public debut in front of the world\u0027s media on the hospital steps one day later, wrapped in a white merino wool shawl, cradled in his proud parents\u0027 arms.

Most babies begin to talk at about 18 months , saying simple words.  From birth to three months old, crying is usually a baby\u0027s first way of communicating. They will also make quite cooing sounds, like ooh and ah, which mean they are happy. But Sara thinks she may have a genius on her hands.

Griffiths was a regular at The Plough Inn in Burton, Staffs, but Sandra Russell barred him on Christmas Eve 2015 after one of his pals ripped the head off a singing Santa. When Sandra confronted the group, “drunk and arrogant” Griffiths sneered at her before throwing cash in her face and over the floor. Sandra said: “He wouldn’t speak to a man that way. He doesn’t like a woman standing up to him, so he hated me. “Andrew’s friend yanked the Santa’s head off. I said ‘What the hell are you doing?\u0027  “They were drunk, it was approaching 1am. Then Andrew yelled, ‘You can’t talk to us like that’. “I told them to drink up, then Andrew went, ‘There was no need for you to carry on like that’. I said, ‘No, Andrew, that’s disrespectful. It cost me \u0026pound130’. He got \u0026pound100 out his wallet and threw it at me. “The money went in my face and over the floor. I was angry and upset. I went ‘Get out and don’t bother coming back. You’re barred’. “He has no respect. I left the money on the floor.”  Ironically, Griffiths did a shift at The Plough in 2011 to raise awareness of the pressures landlords face. He said at the time: “It was a real insight. A barman, I have found, is a cross between a social worker, an agony aunt and a stand-up comic.” But barmaid Terri Russell, 21, found Griffiths anything but funny as a customer.

My job is to be the grown-up or, in their words, the “queen of unfairness”. My house runs on my rules and I tell my kids Zac and Amara that the school holiday is no excuse for slacking. I know some people see that as a bit over the top. Why not let the kids have a nice long lie-in, they say? They work hard in term-time, so let them chill out in front of the telly or the computer and eat what they want, when they want. It’s a nice break from the punishing routine of the school day. And let’s face it, if children stay in bed till lunchtime and then head straight for the games console, it’s so much easier to get all the chores done, isn’t it?  But we pay for this attitude down the line when our kids grow into selfish, lazy, flabby teenagers without the tools they neeed to survive in the world of work. Which is why I’m a big fan of Shaun Fenton, the headmaster of Reigate Grammar School in Surrey, who has come up with a ‘super seven’ list of summer \u0026shyactivities. He reckons that all school-age children should be obliged to tick these off before they’re allowed anywhere near their tech. Start as you mean to go on, he says – first off they should get themselves up, washed and dressed without Mum shouting up the stairs every five minutes. Then they should make their own breakfast and clear it away – no Coco Pops on the floor or crumbs on the table. After that, they should take the dog for a walk (borrow a neighbour’s pet if you haven’t got one). This helps them learn to take responsibility for others. Every day’s routine should include a swim, a bike ride or a jog. Exercise is good for the body and the brain. Then they should play a board game – this teaches kids to follow rules and interact with actual people as opposed to virtual ones. Time should also be set aside for reading a book. It doesn’t have to be Dickens or Shakespeare. Just help them find something they enjoy.

The Buckles Lane site in South Ockendon has been allowed to expand onto greenbelt land and is now home to more than 1,000 people. The private camp, labelled a \u0027festering sore\u0027 by a local councillor, was granted permission in the 1980s for just 50 caravan pitches for travelling showmen to use during the winter months. But over the years the camp has ballooned in size, with an estimated 350 families living on 120 pitches. There are also a considerable number of mobile homes, which are being rented out by site residents to eastern European gypsies and the settled community.  Last Sunday a huge fire in the surrounding fields almost spread to the site. Nearby residents have now had enough and have demanded Thurrock council take action and enforce planning laws.  Tony Jones, 48, told the Sunday Express : ‘For years the council has let them get away with it.’   A woman in her 60s added: ‘I have lived here more than 30 years and the showmen have never caused a problem. But now they are advertising caravans to anyone in the local paper for \u0026pound100 a week.’ A 2014 assessment carried out by Thurrock Council said: “Buckles Lane is the largest travelling showpeople site in Europe. It is becoming overcrowded. “The demographic at the site is changing, with more east Europeans and fewer Irish and English people.” "},{"url":null,"title":"water chiefs urge uk customers","story":"NewsWater chiefs urge UK customers to have four minute showers - despite leaking 453million litres every dayUnited Utilities are facing an angry backlash after issuing households with four-minute timers shaped like pebbles to help customers take shorter showers\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsBydan warbutonDan Warburton21:47, 21 JUL 2018NewsFour-minute timers shaped like pebbles to help customers take shorter showers\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailWater chiefs who lose half a billion litres a day through leaks are urging customers to keep showers to just four minutes due to the dry spell. United Utilities has also brought in a hosepipe ban, threatening \u0026pound1,000 fines. Yet last year the firm lost 453 million litres from its own pipes every day – nine times the amount a ban may save. And they faced an angry backlash after issuing households with four-minute timers shaped like pebbles to help customers take shorter showers. One woman wrote on their site: “Four minutes? For a man maybe” – followed by a crying with laughter emoji. And customer Ron Bell urged: “Surely investment in stopping the leaks would be better use of customers’ money.” A third, Keith Browning, demanded: “How much water do UU lose through leaks in four minutes?”  Chief executive Steve Mogford has faced heavy criticism after bringing in England’s first hosepipe ban since 2012. Mr Mogford has seen his annual income and benefits soar to \u0026pound2.3million a year over the last five years, up by nearly half. That has made him \u0026pound12million since 2013 in salary, bonuses, pensions and other benefits, says the GMB union.

Mr Mogford is also said to have a luxury holiday villa on the Spanish isle. Meanwhile customers across North West England have expressed fears the company spends too much rewarding its shareholders and not enough on fixing its leaks. Critics have blasted the hosepipe ban, due to come into force next month and affecting around seven million households.

Louise Brown was born in July 1978 after her parents Lesley and John became the first to successfully undergo IVF.  The 39-year-old said one package arrived from California containing a broken test tube with a foetus with fake blood, the Bristol Post reports.  Her birth at Oldham General Hospital attracted huge controversy, with religious leaders voicing outrage and critics raising fears that science was creating Frankenbabies. But it also paved the way for around eight million IVF births across the world to date.  Mrs Brown, who lives in Bristol, said her parents received weird mail over the years, including the sinister package, but that she had never had any nasty approaches and definitely not recently. I think there\u0027s so many IVF children now that I think it\u0027s a lot more accepted now 40 years on than it was when I was born, she said. I think everybody\u0027s sort of moved mostly with the times.  She revealed the horrible fact as she spoke to reporters who had gathered to hear her pay tribute to the forgotten third pioneer who worked alongside the two researchers widely credited with the development of IVF treatment. Mrs Brown, now a mother-of-two living in Bristol with her husband, Wesley Mullinder, said that the contribution of embryologist Jean Purdy deserved greater recognition, alongside the better-known involvement of gynaecologist Patrick Steptoe and physiologist Robert Edwards.  Purdy, who was initially hired as a lab technician by Edwards, was the first person to witness the successful cell division of the embryo that would become Louise Brown. She co-authored 26 academic papers about IVF and helped found the Bourn Hall fertility clinic in Cambridgeshire, but is rarely mentioned in the story of IVF. Purdy died in 1985, aged 39. Mrs Brown, who works as a clerk at a freight company, said: Jean Purdy was, I was told by my mum, the one who saw all the cells dividing which is now me. Without her I don\u0027t think IVF would have taken off.  I know Bob and Patrick used to go home to their wives and families and I think it was Jean that used to stay and make sure everything was just as it should have been. She described them as three great people and said she hopes Purdy gets the recognition she deserves now. She was speaking at Bourn Hall to mark 40 years of IVF, and earlier laid flowers at Purdy\u0027s new memorial at the Church of St Andrew and St Mary in Grantchester where she is buried. There was previously a simple headstone which did not acknowledge Purdy\u0027s work. Steptoe died in 1988 aged 74, and Edwards died in 2013 aged 87.

Officials believed the blast, which left at least 11 dead, was carried out by a suicide bomber. Pictures showed the dead and wounded strewn across the road. Kabul police spokesman Hashmat Stanekzai said the blast went off near the main airport entrance, where supporters had been waiting to greet Dostum as his motorcade passed on its way to the city centre. The number of casualties may rise. The blast happened right after Dostum\u0027s convoy left the airport, he said.

Much of the area around the presidential palace was shut down for the arrival and there was a heavy security presence on the streets, emphasising the increasingly volatile political climate in Kabul. Dostum faced outrage from Western donor countries including the United States, after reports in 2016 that his guards had seized political rival Ahmad Eshchi and subjected him to beatings, torture and violent sexual abuse. He denied Eshchi\u0027s accusations but, amid international demands that he be held accountable, he left the country in May last year, ostensibly to seek medical treatment in Turkey. Dostum is one of Afghanistan\u0027s most infamous figures, loved and loathed in equal measure.

Olga Solomina, 46, grinned as she knelt down and touched the lion\u0027s mane for the photograph at a safari park in Ukraine. But moments after the picture was taken, things took a turn for the worse when the animal reportedly grabbed her arm and \u0027dragged\u0027 her around. I squatted down and put my hand on the lion as I was told, Olga recalled. Next moment it grasped my arm and dragged me like a rag doll.

She claimed: He asked me not to call the police or an ambulance, saying that my injuries were not dangerous. At his office, his secretary treated my lacerations with hydrogen peroxide. Then a veterinarian came.  He injected me with lidocaine and stitched the wounds. Instead of anaesthetising me they gave me a bottle of cognac. They did not give me any antibiotics. She said that she was then driven home where, drunk from the cognac she had tried to sleep. However, over the next 24 hours her health condition worsened and she was in incredible pain. When her temperature escalated, she finally called an ambulance. Doctors diagnosed her with a serious infection caused from the bite. Hospital spokesman Nikolai Vlasov said: The infection got into her body from the teeth of the animal. It is a very dangerous infection. She underwent surgery.

Even Darren O’Dea has been helping me with my defending and Graham Gartland has helped a lot and every day I’m trying to learn.“If my chance comes I’ll back myself to do the best I can.”Curran came off the bench in the 4-0 win over Stirling last weekend and is hoping to make it appearance No 2 nice and quickly against the Pars on Sunday.He added: “Dunfermline have always been a strong team in the Championship, always competing to get promotion to the Premiership so it will be a good test after they beat Peterhead 3-0 the other night.“There was a great turnout to the Stirling game so, hopefully, we’ll get another good one this weekend.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b51aaeebafbd-480x564.jpg ","title":"betfred cup ties remain vital as dundee united work to get going","story":"\t\t\t\t\tFor Dundee United, this season’s Betfred Cup looks all but over but don’t trying telling stand-in skipper Stewart Murdoch the final two group fixtures are meaningless.The 28-year-old knows today\u0026#8217s Tannadice clash with Alloa and next week’s trip to Elgin will be vital games as the Tangerines work to make sure they are a force in the coming Championship campaign.And while the ties so far against Arbroath and Ross County have ended in disappointment in terms of results, he believes they provided proof they’re heading in the right direction.“I think the thing is it’s really early doors and the manager will tell you we are still building, that’s maybe why we haven’t had the results we wanted,” he said.“We are still basically in a pre-season phase, so, for us, Tuesday was a really good competitive game up at County and gave us an opportunity to see exactly where we are right now.“It was another 90 minutes for the lads together and to help get to know each other. When you get the penalty at 0-0 and late on, if you score you probably go on and see out the game.“We didn’t and it was disappointing to lose but at the same time everybody could see the other night that already we can compete and we can take that forward. Now we move on to the next game.”And that need to be ready for next month’s league kick-off against Dunfermline means, for Murdoch and his team-mates, the next two outings are massive.“It will be difficult to qualify from our group now but we will take every game the same way we’ve always done and that’s as big ones.“We probably need to win both games now to have any chance and that’s what we’ll aim to do.“And they are another two big games leading into the start of the season in the Championship. We can get match sharpness and we will have another few boys who’ve had wee injuries back available.“It’s also another opportunity as well for the gaffer to maybe tinker with the team a bit and get boys some game time.”And, despite what the Betfred group table suggests, his belief this rebuilt United side is going to be a force to be reckoned with in the second tier, is growing.“I think everyone is confident we are building a good team and the manager will be wanting a few more players – I’m sure he’d said that.“I think the more good players we add the better we’ll play and the more we play together the better we’ll become.“It gave us confidence going to a place like County and competing the way we did. It was a good performance, it was just the result that was poor.“We are all excited about the season ahead and I think it’s going to be a positive one.”In the absence of newly-appointed club captain Fraser Fyvie, who’s likely to be out for another month or so as he completes his recovery from knee surgery at the turn of the year, the games so far have seen Murdoch wear the captain’s armband.Well aware of United’s history and some of the greats who’ve undertaken the role, he regards even having it on a temporary basis as a big feather in his cap.“I was captain a couple of times towards the end of last season and to be handed it again while Fraser is still out is nice,” he added.“This is a massive club, so to lead Dundee United out in any game is a huge honour for me.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"csaba laszlo urging dundee united to speed up","story":"\t\t\t\t\tCsaba Laszlo wants Dundee United to speed up when their Betfred Cup campaign continues at home to Alloa today.Despite a draw and a penalty shoot-out loss against Arbroath and a narrow defeat at Ross County in the two group ties so far, Csaba has been pleased with the signs coming from his rebuilt Tangerines.The next step forward he wants to see, though, is quicker use of the ball leading to more chances being created.“If I watch the team, Matej Rakovan, Adam Barton, Christoph Rabitsch, Callum Booth and others, they are really good football players,” he said.“They keep the ball well and have some good ideas, but we have to do more in the offence.“You can’t just control the game, you also have to go and finish, bring more danger in front of the opponent’s goal, be quicker.“I told them that for the second half at Ross County, ‘OK we are comfortable with the ball but we have to bring more danger’.”Fraser Aird will be in the squad after he sat out the County trip.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee boss neil mccann says craig wighton needed half time telling off","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee boss Neil McCann revealed Craig Wighton needed a proverbial kick up the backside at half-time in the weekend victory at Stirling – and he won’t be letting him “rest on” his talent in the future either.After going in at the break 1-0 to the good, Wighton’s second-half performance did show more urgency, with the 20-year-old delivering a telling cross for Sofien Moussa’s second and a classy finish himself.That strike was the Scotland U/21 international’s first since a 5-1 win over Motherwell way back in February 2017 after a serious knee injury curtailed much of the last campaign.And his manager is looking forward to seeing what Wighton can bring to the side in the season ahead.Neil said: “I’m delighted for him. It’s taken him a lot of time.“He went away with Scotland U/21s but he’s looked really fit in pre-season and you can see the quality he has.“I had a wee go at him at half-time because, for me, he was sitting on it, resting.“I don’t like people resting on ability like that and I think second half he was much more of a threat.”The Dens boss has also revealed he will continue to rotate the captaincy in the upcoming games after Genseric Kusunga wore the armband at Stirling.“I think it’s good they all get a wee bit of a shot and feel they can hold that responsibility.“The armband really isn’t that important to me so I’ll probably continue to do that throughout the League Cup.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/DN7D1449.JPG-846x564.jpg ","title":"dundee fans and tottenham teammates turn out to pay respects to football legend alan gilzean","story":"\t\t\t\t\tFans and former teammates paid tribute to Dundee icon Alan Gilzean on Friday as the legendary striker made his final journey past Dens Park.Supporters young and old braved the rain as the hearse carrying the title-winning forward drove up Sandeman Street just before midday.The ex-Dark Blues and Tottenham Hotspur star died earlier this month aged 79, just weeks after being diagnosed with a brain tumour.Among those to attend his funeral at Dundee Crematorium were several of his ex-Spurs teammates, including Pat Jennings and Alan Mullery.About 80 supporters gathered outside the stadium to pay their respects.Mark Kerr, 64, originally from Lochee, travelled down from Inverness to bid farewell to Mr Gilzean, who he said was one of his heroes.He said: “I was at Dens when Dundee won the league.“I was seven years old and I remember it distinctly.“I watched him playing in Europe and it confirmed I wanted to be a Dundee supporter for life.“I saw Alan at a hall of fame dinner at the Invercarse recently, so I was shocked to hear of his passing.“I’m the chairman of the Highland Dark Blues. I’ve come down from Inverness to pay my respect, and I’ll be raising a drink in his memory tonight.”Born in Coupar Angus, Gilzean is considered one of the finest players to grace Dens Park and netted an unrivalled 169 goals during the halcyon days of the 1950s and 60s.His eye for a goal was a crucial factor in Dundee’s title-winning season in 1961-62, before the club went on to reach the semi-final of the European Cup.Season ticket holder George McLaren, 73, said: “He has been such a big part of Dundee FC. My favourite memories of him are probably the goals against Dundee United.“I was shocked to hear of his passing and wanted to come here today to pay my respects. He will never be forgotten. He proved himself here at Dens and at Spurs.“An absolute legend for both clubs.”Fellow fan Daniel Smith, 33, from Maryfield, added: “There’s been a good turnout of people paying their respects here today at Dens.“He is a Dundee legend. I grew up on stories about Gilzean through the years and the things he accomplished at Dens. He still holds a number of records at Dens Park.”A tribute on the Dundee FC website stated: “Everyone at Dundee Football Club was devastated to learn of the death of Dundee legend Alan Gilzean aged 79 after a short illness.“A true Dundee legend in every sense of the word, we may never see his goal scoring like again and the thoughts of everyone at Dens Park are with Alan’s family and friends at this difficult and sad time.”He made the jump from Tayside to Tottenham in 1964 for a £72,500 fee, lifting two League Cups, the FA Cup and the UEFA Cup.As well as the dark blue of Dundee, Hall of Famer Gilzean earned 22 Scotland caps between 1963 and 1971, bagging 12 goals.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b51aab022de5-e1532091100625-751x564.jpg ","title":"dundee kiltwalk stet for biggest year as 2000 signed up","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee\u0026#8217s Kiltwalk is set for its biggest year yet — with all the signs pointing towards a record number of walkers for 2018.Paul Cooney, chief executive of the Kiltwalk, said the number of sign-ups was close to 2,000 with four weeks to go until the big day — almost the same number of people who took part last year.He met up with members of the Tay Road Bridge Joint Board and Dundee United midfielder Scott Allardice to launch the new start point of the five-mile Wee Wander.It’s one of three routes walkers can choose to complete, and follows the banks of the Tay from the refreshed urban art space underneath the road bridge to Monifieth.All three walks take place on Sunday August 19 — with the start points at the Tay Road Bridge, Tayport and St Andrews — and any registered charity can be supported.At the end of the Kiltwalk, all funds raised are given a massive 40% boost by the Hunter Foundation, run by philanthropist Sir Tom Hunter.The Kiltwalk takes no cut of the cash raised — instead funding the events through registration fees, which means every penny raised goes direct to good causes.Paul said: “Dundee has been brilliant with us. This year, we’re closing in on 2,000 people with four weeks to go, and last year we had 2,000 people taking part.“It’s a brilliant way of raising money for your chosen charity. We’re very lucky to have Sir Tom Hunter supporting us, boosting your fund by 40%.“It’s a great way of raising un-restricted funds for local charities.“People still ask what causes they can support and the answer is simply any registered charity — and they will all get the 40%.“There’s still time to sign up but if you’re thinking of doing the 25-mile walk, I’d start training now.”The Tele is continuing backing Dundee’s Kiltwalk as a great way of raising money for good causes across Tayside — a fact that has not gone unnoticed.Paul added: “I have to thank the Evening  and its readers for their support.“It’s made such a difference for us and I can’t overstate the importance of DC Thomson, and the Evening  especially, to what we do here in Dundee.”United star Scott added: “It’s all for a good cause and it’s not every day you can say you’ve been for a walk of up to 25 miles. I’m keeping my fingers crossed for everyone that we get good weather.”As part of its partnership with the Tay Road Bridge Joint Board, the Kiltwalk team devised a road bridge ‘takeover’.Bridge staff have hung flags and banners promoting the Kiltwalk along the length of the crossing.Bridge manager Alan Hutchison said: “With the new space available to all the people of Dundee and the wider community it made sense to lend it to the Kiltwalk.”West End Liberal Democrat councillor and joint board member Fraser Macpherson said: “We’re all very supportive of the Kiltwalk and all the funds it raises for charities across Scotland.“It’s great to see the bridge staff taking such a proactive approach to getting involved and it’s fantastic that there’s such great support for it here in Dundee.”There’s still time to sign up for Dundee’s Kiltwalk — go online to thekiltwalk to find out more.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b4f07435f2ed-912x564.jpg ","title":"dundee people alyx set for world stage","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA Monifieth street dancer is to represent Scotland on the world stage.Alyx Gray, 11, is through to the under-12 beginner/novice category at the UDO World Championships at the Hydro in Glasgow.She will also represent the country at the European Championships in the Netherlands next year.Alyx qualified after becoming Scottish champion.The former Seaview Primary pupil, who starts at Monifieth High this year, began dancing aged seven.She is coached by Laura Nisbet, who runs the Addicted 2 Dance studio in Dundee.Mum Jody said: “We are chuffed to bits.

We just captured events and places that we thought were significant,” he said.“There are photos of people, of events, the arts, dance activities, things such as the New Year’s Day Dook and a lot of buildings that we thought either were significant or would become significant.“I was given access to Dens Park, for example, because I imagine in 10 years or so it might no longer exist as we know it.“I’m quite surprised at what we’ve been able to achieve.”The Tele was given access to some of the archive and the differences in city life now and then are stark.The 1916 survey features street scenes in the city centre and atop the Hilltown – and couldn’t be any more different from the snaps from 1991.Many of the later images show the city at its post-industrial peak, complete with questionable fashion choices and a City Square yet to be pedestrianised.Red Sky’s modern day survey is packed with sights that are likely to be familiar now – the new railway station entrance under construction, rusted-in tram rails on the Murraygate and dance performances in front of Caird Hall.Rather topically, there are also photos of William Halley’s mill – now reduced to rubble.Alistair Wilson, of Dundee Libraries, said the relevance of these photographic surveys becomes very clear after just a few years, giving people a fresh perspective on a city that might have changed without them really noticing.“The 1991 survey was carried out by Dundee Photographic Society. It and the other surveys act like a social record of how the city was at that time,” he said.“Looking back at 1991, which doesn’t feel that long ago, you can see so many things have changed – the way people dress, the jobs they have, even the cars on the streets.“Once the exhibition finishes the plan is that it will move about so everyone can see it.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee united set

Sunday in the first home game since Gilzean passed away at the age of 79.The club legend’s funeral takes place tomorrow and Sunday’s clash promises to be one full of emotion for everyone associated with Dundee.A special matchday programme will be available while there will be a minute’s silence and black armbands worn by the players but Kerr expects a bumper home crowd to give Gilzean a roaring send-off.The 22-year-old said: “It’s a terrible thing to happen.“Sadly, I never got to see him play or have the privilege of meeting him but what a figure to have played at this football club.“To know you are at the same football club as some of the greatest footballers have played at is fantastic.“I’d like to send my regards and best wishes to his family at this time, obviously a tough time.“In terms of the game, I think it will be emotional and, hopefully, the crowd turn out for a very special player for this football club.“I’ve read a few of things in the papers about the player he was and I actually remember watching the thing on TV at White Hart Lane when they closed the old stadium.“I knew he was a good player but I didn’t know how big he was for Tottenham.“When they said ‘The Original King of White Hart Lane, Alan Gilzean’ it just shows the regard he was held in down there.“Naming a lounge after him doesn’t do him justice because he was, obviously, a great talent.”Being a fan himself, Kerr knows the kind of supporters Dundee have and the loyalty they show their team – something he experienced in a very noisy welcome and send-off at last week’s friendly against Farense in Portugal.“We could hear them when we got off the bus in Albufeira but you can’t see how many there were,” Kerr added.“At the end I got a few photos and things and they were singing away.“The best bit was when we were leaving and they were all banging on the bus – it was great!“You see European games and all the fans waiting on the buses so it felt like that, it felt great.“For the fans to go across there just shows the loyalty that they’ll go across to Portugal for a friendly. That’s fantastic to see.“I gave away a pair of my boots and I think someone had them on running about the streets about 10 minutes later!”Allan Johnston’s Pars side will be looking to spoil Dundee’s return to the newly-named Kilmac Stadium at Dens Park by putting themselves into pole position in Betfred Cup Group D.And Kerr knows the Dark Blues will have to be right on their game to see off a Dunfermline side that swept past Peterhead in midweek.He added: “The game is on the TV as well which is good and the pitch is coming on really well, too.

events coming up soon and would like the young person to be with me in time for these.“All travel and any other expenses will be provided.”Chelsea said she wasn’t sure what the response to her offer would be but she was hopeful young people would get in touch.“First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has already supported my offer, as have some other MSPs and other high profile personalities and charities,” she said.“If this is something you would love to do, please send a short piece about yourself and why you feel this would be a good opportunity for you to Chelsea-cameron@hotmail.”After her letter was made public, Chelsea was invited to London to appear on television and radio, beginning with the Victoria Derbyshire show.She was also interviewed on various news programmes and within a week her story had gone viral worldwide.Among those who were touched by the letter was Ms Sturgeon, who invited Chelsea to meet her for coffee and a chat.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"kharl madianga

Dunfermline.The Dark Blues host the Pars in Betfred Cup Group D on Sunday with Finnish international Kamara a big doubt after a training-ground clash left him with a protective boot on his foot.The club are hoping the damage is minimal and the use of the boot is purely a precaution.However, it’s unlikely he’ll be risked for the weekend game with Allan Johnston’s side.That means French midfielder Madianga is in line for a first competitive start since signing for the club over the summer.The former French U/17 international joined the club from Bulgarian side Lokomotiv GO – the same side Sofien Moussa was signed from.He made his competitive debut for the Dark Blues last weekend in the 4-0 victory at Stirling Albion, coming off the bench for fellow-new boy Elton Ngwatala.And manager Neil McCann said after that game Madianga was one Dundee fans should look forward to seeing in action.“Kharl came on and showed glimpses as well, he’s a fantastic player so in the midfield I think we have some real exciting talent in there,” the Dens gaffer said.Also missing at the moment for Dundee is winger Roarie Deacon.He’s continuing his recovery from ankle surgery and is expected to be out for a while yet.Club skipper Darren O’Dea missed the win at Stirling last week, and two friendlies in Portugal the previous week, with a groin problem.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b505b5b6573f.jpg ","title":"local girl trampled on by horse fundraises for air

for old iconic dundee pie shop site","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA famous Dundee pie shop bakery left to decay for more than 40 years is to be transformed into a quirky new home.The Auld Dundee Pie Shop at 18-20 Castle Street, which served up the famous Wallace peh, was a household name in the city from the turn of the 20th Century until it closed down in the late 1970s.Owned by David Wallace, it was once part of a string of pie shops run by the family, also featuring a restaurant named Wallace’s Tea Rooms.Dundee-based Castle Development has now been granted planning permission to convert the C-listed bakehouse at the back of the former shop and tearooms into a two-bedroom home.The development will add to the ongoing conversion of the adjacent St Paul’s Church, which is being transformed from a pub into residential accommodation.The business originally opened in 1892 in the Vault under the Caird Hall, an area now being converted into trendy restaurants such as the recently-opened Brassica.In the early 1920s Mr Wallace moved to the building on Castle Street, when the Vault was due for demolition, as the building was big enough to open the tearoom as well as the two-floor bakehouse.During the Second World War it is reported the queues for pies and bridies used to stretch down to the bottom of the street as they were able to supplement the meat ration. Now hidden from street view, the bakehouse has not been used since it closed 41 years ago, in 1977.A pend between two shops allows access from the street, which then opens up into a large courtyard and the entrance to the bakery.A design statement submitted by RDA Architects, on behalf of Castle Development, says the history of the building will be incorporated.It states: “The proposals seek to highlight the historic elements on the replacement elevation highlighting the area from which the dilapidation began, visibly documenting the history of the site and ensuring the preservation of the remaining structure.“The materials have been carefully considered against the context of the former bakery, its perceived history and gradual dilapidation and eventual demolition of its western elevation.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b4f0793923bf-771x564.jpg ","title":"stirling albion or celtic its all the same to dundee new boy jean mendy","story":"\t\t\t\t\tIn his very short time at Dundee, Senegalese striker Jean Mendy has already shown he can get fans off their seats at Dens Park this season.And he plans to continue doing that – as well as getting goals – whether he’s playing against Stirling Albion or Celtic, it’s all the same to him.He told the Tele: “I don’t know the teams at the moment!“For me, playing Stirling is like playing against Celtic, it’s the same for me – I just play my game, it doesn’t matter, and try to win every game.”The 28-year-old was delighted to start his career in dark blue with a goal after he knocked in a good strike from the edge of area as his new team began the season with a morale-boosting 4-0 victory at Stirling Albion.“It was good and we won of course – it’s very important to start winning,” Mendy added.“It was a little bit hot, I think, on the pitch on Saturday, we could feel it.“The performance was good, can be better you know, it was the first game but it was good to get the confidence with this game.“It was great for the team to score a lot of goals and we have shown we have people who can score.“I was pleased to get the goal, I got the chance and I put it in.“It was perfect for me to start with a goal and good for my confidence so I’m very happy to start like this.”Mendy joined the club from Belgian top-flight side Lokeren where he struggled to make an impact.That was after piling in the goals in the Norwegian lower leagues.Back in 2012, he banged in 27 goals in 25 league games for Elverum in the third tier before 27 in 52 in the next tier for Kristiansund. A move up to the top flight only brought a return of six in 23 for Sandefjord before returning to Kristiansund and then getting the big move to Belgium.Manager Neil McCann said he’d been keeping an eye on Mendy’s progress after missing out on him when he departed Norway.He’s finally got his man and the forward is delighted to be at Dundee, even if he’s not spent much time in the city with the club spending a week-long training camp in Portugal.He said: “I’ve enjoyed my time so far, it’s a good club with good players, too, and I think this year will be a good one.“Portugal was a lot of training. That sort of preparation is normal and it was good for us but you feel it when we played the games over there.“We didn’t get the wins in the friendlies, maybe one win against Sunderland but we lost the last two but they were only friendlies – more important is winning the games when the season begins, like Saturday.“It was very good to show we are ready.“There are a few new players, myself as well, and it’s very important for us to get together with the team and start to know each other in training, talk together and know how we all play.“It’s looking good. We’ll obviously continue to work more but I think the season will be good.”After starting off Group D with victory, Mendy and his new team-mates take on Dunfermline at home in front of the television cameras on Sunday.Even if he doesn’t know much about his opponents just yet, Mendy knows the Dundee fans will be expecting a good show from their side and he’s hoping to add to his goal tally.“I’m looking forward to my first home game this weekend.“That will be very important in front of our supporters.“Of course, we want to play a good game, put on a show for the fans and win the game, too.“We are going for a victory.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7486028.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film

School of Highland Dance and travelled to the ScotDance Canada Championships Series in Calgary, Alberta recently, where she took on fellow dancers from all over the world.Clearly not fazed by the competition she was ultimately named Open Canadian Champion for her age group.The competition was her fifth championship event and she won all three categories she entered \u0026ndash Highland competition, Premiership National Championship and Open Highland Championship.This latest victory followed on from a runner-up spot at the SDTA Central Scotland Championshps earlier this year, an impressive placing that was itself followed by her first Open Championship title secured at the UK Alliance Championships in Edinburgh, in which she saw off 33 other top competitors.Her younger sister

how many cycles we can accommodate.

Children love jumping from stone to stone and guddling about in water.\"It has all been looked at from the safety point of view, but let\u0027 face it, if you take children to the beach they jump from stone to stone. I think it is a good project and if necessary I will be the first to dip my toe in the water there.\"Inverness city manager David Haas said: \"This has had youth engagement all along and I think it is something that is going to sit well in the environment of a place that will become even more popular as people engage with the river.\"Masterminding the project is Bespoke Atelier, a Glasgow-based design studio.Its design statement, which will be discussed at a planning meeting later this summer, explains the lades and weirs already around the River Ness were used as inspiration. The stones would be patterned, partly to minimise slips and also to reflect foliage patterns from trees growing on the islands.A report from Inverness City Artworks Group states: \"While it was preferable to use natural stone, the cost might prove prohibitive and alternative materials might need to be considered.\"It was also minuted that if concerns were raised regarding the cost of this feature, the high cost of \"providing basic play equipment should be highlighted.\"The group was given assurances that the design would, when completed, look like part of the landscape, and members were told that Bespoke Atelier was confident that all aspects of the design could be met within the available budget.Path improvements in the vicinity are included in the application.Company director Yvonne Elliot-Kellighan said the stepping stone forms envisaged were inspired by the shape of the Ness Islands, and the stones themselves could be engraved with botanical patterns \"creating a ow and connection between stepping stones\".The children\u0027 feature is not far from MY Ness, a \u0026pound300,000 centrepiece which was unveiled as a concept in May and has still to receive planning permission.The River Ness Public Art Project is funded by Creative Scotland (\u0026pound305,000), Inverness Common Good Fund (\u0026pound250,000), HIE (\u0026pound66,000) and Highland Council (\u0026pound106,000).At a time of heightened concern about public spending, Highland Council has stressed that the vast majority of the money for the projects comes from third parties and cannot be used for other purposes, and the council\u0027 \u0026pound106k is from capital investment and not revenue spend.Sunday 22 Jul 2018 7:36 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116731.jpg","title":"New cinema proposed for the Black Isle","story":"\u0026nbspA THRIVING film society on the Black Isle looks set to take its next big step after plans were submitted for a permanent cinema to cater for growing demand.The brand new cinema, which would be located on the seafront in Cromarty, will cater to Cromarty and Resolis Film Society events and serve as a base for the town\u0027 increasingly popular annual film festival.Cromarty Estate, which owns the land, has lodged the application in partnership the film society, which would act as its tenant.The plans feature two key elements. The first is the cinema, which would be built on land close to the ferry slipway and next to an existing boat storage shed.The cinema would seat roughly 30 people and host weekly screenings throughout the year, rising to twice a week in the summer. It would also be used to help house Cromarty\u0027 growing film festival, which attracts fans and famous faces from across the country late every autumn.Cromarty Estate also plans to build an office hub alongside the cinema in a bid to cater for growing business demand in the town.In a supporting statement submitted by the estate alongside its application, its agents said: \"A dedicated cinema space will allow screening all year which currently is not possible using existing buildings with poor black out facilities.\"The cinema may also be available for other users to hire for screenings, presentations and lectures.\"They added that the cinema would also \"ideally\" feature an outdoor area \"for summer screenings and festival events\".Making the case for new office space in the town, the estate said: \"Cromarty has a thriving entrepreneurial community but this is not matched by suitable office accommodation with the result that many find themselves having to move their business bases from Cromarty to Dingwall, Tore or Inverness when they outgrow their own homes, with the resulting loss of employment opportunities in the town.\"Addressing this need... will make Cromarty a more balanced and sustainable community.\"In a statement supporting the application, the film society said that a survey of Cromarty residents found that 82 per cent backed a cinema in the town and the same number would go to more screenings if the venue was better than what is currently on offer.Justifying the decision to proceed with an all-new site for the cinema, the estate\u0027 agents said the site\u0027 position close to adequate parking and its location away from homes were both positives, as was the existing vehicle access from the harbour.The buildings would feature dark metal cladding to the walls of the cinema, with timber cladding on the office hub.If the plans are approved construction could start as early as spring next year.Sunday 22 Jul 2018 7:36

Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route directing traffic to the new complex on the A96 – which last week announced it would be renamed the Event Complex Aberdeen (TECA).That means all of the signs saying “AECC” will need to be altered or even replaced.It is understood the cost of making the changes will fall to the centre’s owner SMG Europe.However, it has not yet been decided if that will involve altering or removing the incorrect signs.Any changes can be requested by the developer – in this case SMG – and Transport Scotland, along with the local authority, will make the alterations.A Transport Scotland spokesman said: “The strategic signing policy was agreed with the local authority and any changes to the signage has to be agreed with them.”An Aberdeen City Council spokeswoman said changes “would have to be agreed with Transport Scotland” and referred inquiries to TECA’s operator SMG Europe.A spokeswoman for SMG Europe, which operates the venue, would only say: “Discussions are under way into this matter.”SNP group leader councillor Stephen Flynn said it would be “beyond embarrassing” if the signage was wrong.He said: “I agree with those folk who have said that TECA is a fairly uninspiring name change and would prefer not to see it on any sign.“However, if they are to press ahead with the new title then it would be beyond embarrassing not to have signage to match.“Ultimately, it’s really poor that there doesn’t appear to have been much, if any, communication between partners on such a simple issue and any changes shouldn’t be borne by the public purse.”Liberal Democrat councillor Ian Yuill added: “It is important that the signage is clear.“Given that SMG Europe decided on a different name for the AECC and that TECA will be its name going forward, it makes sense that the signs should use that name.“I do believe that SMG Europe should be fronting any costs to make those changes.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"charity playscheme helps

We have two flags, and they were used for religious ceremonies in the Bell Rock Lighthouse.”As servicemen were unable to get to church on a Sunday, Robert Stevenson decided that they shouldn’t miss out.The bible would have been placed on one of the flags, which was created by Jane.Michael said: “There’s so many Janes in the family, but we think it was his daughter. Both flags have now been taken down.“One is rolled up, but the other is folded up as it is too big.“We have been in contact with the conservator.”The flags will be checked over by experts, and will be placed in an exhibition on the ground-floor level, to give visitors to the museum a better view.Visitors to the Museum of Scotish Lighthouses can also buy a copy of the story of the Bell Rock Lighthouse, which was written by Michael, in the museum shopAn illustrated book, it sets out the history of the Arbroath lighthouse, starting with its construction, and Robert Stevenson’s role in it, to the present day.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"royal seal of approval for football clubs community trust with highest honour","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAn Aberdeen FC charity group has been given the royal seal approval after receiving an award for its work.Aberdeen Football Club Community Trust (AFCCT) received the highest honour available to volunteer groups during a ceremony at Pittodrie.Presented by Lord Provost of Aberdeen Barney Crockett, the team were given the prestigious Queen’s Award for Voluntary Services in recognition of their work with north-east communities.The award, created by the monarch to mark the Golden Jubilee in 2002, recognises outstanding contributions made to communities by groups of volunteers.Mr Crockett said: “Congratulations to everyone at AFCCT on receiving the Queen’s Award for Voluntary Service.“It is testament to the dedication, enthusiasm and sheer hard work of all involved which has led to such prestigious recognition.“We are very fortunate in Aberdeen to have so many individuals who give up so much of their own time for the benefit of others.“They should be proud of themselves and the work they do as part of AFCCT in helping enrich the lives of others in communities across the city and beyond.”Youth ambassador Caitlyn Irvine, of Tillydrone, joined Mr Crockett at the ceremony.She said: “I was so proud when I found out we had won this award and very proud of all the volunteers for the hard work they’ve put in to make this award possible.“The trust has not only given me confidence but I’ve made friends for life.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"temporary closure of road to carry out urgent works","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDrivers will be prohibited from parking on sections of a busy Aberdeen road while urgent drainage works are carried out.The restriction will be enforced on the west side of Victoria Street, Dyce, between number 37 to number 57, from 9.30am tomorrow until 6pm on Friday July 27.There will also be a ban on parking on the opposite side of the street, from number 38 to number 56, during the same time period.Illegally parked vehicles will be removed at the owner’s expense.Tesco vehicles will be exempt while loading or unloading.Aberdeen City Council, which is carrying out the drainage works, said it regrets any inconvenience that may be caused by the temporary measure.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/07/GOLF-Open-183986.jpg.jpg ","title":"stonehavens locke receives silver medal at open championship","story":"\t\t\t\t\tStonehaven\u0026#8217s Sam Locke has received the Silver Medal for the leading amateur at the 147th Open Championship.Locke, 19, only reached Carnoustie through final qualifying, but the Scottish Amateur champion was the only Scot or amateur to make the cut at his maiden Major.He ended the championship nine over par after a final day round of seven over, but joined household names like Rory McIlroy and Tiger Woods as winners of the medal.Locke said: \u0026#8220Obviously, it\u0026#8217s a great feeling to have won the silver medal and make the cut in my first major as well.\u0026#8220Obviously, the back nine today wasn\u0026#8217t what I wanted, but overall, I\u0026#8217m really pleased to be here.

Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

We simply don\u0026#8217t have enough children playing shinty in each school to make up separate clubs.Surely, in 2018, this shouldn\u0026#8217t be allowed to happen?It is only three clubs that are being affected by this, and they\u0026#8217re all in the south of Scotland,  half way through a season, leaving all our kids devastated at the though of losing their chosen sport.My son has been playing shinty since Primary One. He is now heading into Primary Four and is even more passionate about the sport. He enjoys quality team time, striving to be the best he can and just loving playing the game.It\u0026#8217s very difficult to explain something like this to an eight-year-old child, never mind the Primary One children we have in our club.One quote from a child was: \u0026#8216Everyone is going to be so sad if we don\u0026#8217t have shinty. Why would shinty people do this to us?\u0026#8217It\u0026#8217s a very sad day indeed for the children of Argyll and Bute who are simply being punished for what school they go to and where they live. We have to stand together and fight for our club and our children.The Camanachd Association needs to step up and find a solution to allow all children to compete nationally and stand as one united shinty community.Ailsa and Alastair Crawford, LochgilpheadSir,The Camanachd Association has put politics before the needs of the children and the development of the sport in Argyll.The kids are disappointed and the coaches who have worked tirelessly to set the club up are deflated. Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards. So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 25","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 23/06/18, 5:52 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,Labour and the Lib Dems must recognise and respect the recent vote in the Scottish Parliament and the views of their Scottish colleagues who refused to give consent to the damaging Brexit legislation proposed at Westminster.Labour amendments to former clause 11 of the bill require consent of the Scottish Parliament unless a UK Minister ‘has reasonable grounds for believing that regulations are required for the purpose of giving effect to any international obligations’.It would be catastrophic for Scotland if Labour left the door open for the Tory Government to breach the devolution settlement.Leaving Holyrood exposed to powers taken without consent in any area connected to an international trade agreement would be disastrous. This could threaten future trade deals, environmental standards and food safety.The Tories think they can do whatever they want to Scotland and get away with it.The SNP tabled amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill to safeguard the Scottish Parliament from the threat of constraints on existing powers.This is something which Holyrood refused consent for last month by an overwhelming majority including all parties, except the Scottish Conservatives.It would simply be a democratic outrage and it would fly in the face of the fundamental principles of devolution. This Conservative government seems determined to destroy the founding principles of devolution and Labour and the Lib Dems must join us in defending it.Brendan O’Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,It seems that almost every day I\u0026#8217m contacted by farmers in my constituency with concerns about their future.This is hardly surprising as farmers are borrowing more and having to pay staff less, according to figures released by the Scottish Government.According to ‘Agricultural Facts and Figures’ published recently, agricultural borrowing has doubled in the last 10 years, capital investment has stayed the same and agricultural workers are earning £1,560 less on average compared to last year.The figures show farm borrowing has almost doubled from £1.38 billion to £2.28 billion between 2007 to 2017, while capital investment has stayed the same at £210 million.This demonstrates that farmers are investing much less in their machinery and equipment while still having to borrow ever-increasing sums to remain viable.This is on top of the fact farmers are still struggling with debts they incurred as a result the CAP payment fiasco caused by the SNP Government several years ago.Time and time again the separatists have shown complete disregard to the plight that our hard pressed farmers are facing. It seems our agricultural industry is just one more sector that is ignored by the separatists in their relentless push for a second independence referendum.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Claims by Theresa May that a so-called ‘Brexit dividend’ will help pay for a boost to NHS spending in England worth £20 billion a year within five years are highly disingenuous.The UK will continue to pay into the EU through the transition until the end of 2020 and will pay £20 billion of the \u0026#8216divorce bill\u0026#8217 through to 2028. In addition, the UK Government has committed to keep EU funding for agricultural subsidies, research and development and other key areas at the same level in the short-term.These are set figures so it will be at least 10 years before any so-called ‘Brexit dividend’, if it were ever to materialise, is to be realised. Add to that, if the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts are accurate, public finances are set to be £15 billion a year worse off by 2021, equivalent to £300 million a week.Interestingly, if taxes are set to rise, which they will clearly have to, it is staggering hypocrisy for the Tories to have attacked the Scottish Government’s boosting of the NHS in Scotland through progressive tax changes and then look to hike taxes themselves.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,Local government spending cuts have left councils in Scotland unable to meet the needs of local communities and, in some cases, are putting the public at risk.A survey of more than 2,000 local government employees working across all services reveals almost eight in 10 council workers have no confidence in the future of local services and half are thinking of leaving their jobs for less stressful work elsewhere.While local authorities have protected spending on statutory service areas such as adult and children’s social care, the amount they spend on other areas including parks and libraries has fallen sharply.Local authorities have had to cut so many vital services that they have now reached a point where vulnerable children and the elderly struggle to get the help that they need, entire communities are suffering and the public is being put at risk.There have been cuts to road and bridge maintenance, potholes in roads are left unfilled and bridges are at risk of crumbling. Crematoriums are not maintained, streetlights stay broken and parks are in disrepair as councils don’t have the equipment or the staff to adequately maintain them.There are now more than one million people with an unmet need for social care because councils do not have the resources to support them. Now is the time to reverse these cuts and invest in local government once more or the fabric of our society will come unstuck.Mark Ferguson, chairman, UNISON Scotland local government committee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 24/06/18, 3:39 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There is no denying Lochgilphead could benefit from a wash and brush up.

The pair were steady, neat and quick all day and broke the timing beam on stage eight, Bishop\u0026#8217s Glen, to complete the rally in 23rd overall and third in class four.Everything finally came together and the car and crew got the result they deserve. The collective sigh of relief could be heard in body shops and garages all across the land, with annual leave in  most of them on hold until Douglas\u0026#8217s result came in.Duncan MacLean and Ian Parker were out in the mighty Peugeot 106 once more and were having a decent day, with a few hairy moments when the intercom wasn\u0026#8217t working (or so Duncan tells it) and unfortunately breaking a gearbox mount which, though fixed between stages, saw them over their time limit and out of the rally.Mull ace Ally Currie and his Oban co-driver Grant MacNiven continued to chase the bigger more powerful machinery in his 150bhp Fiesta and was sitting third in the 2WD section when a problem that they had been experiencing for most of the day became worse \u0026#8211 and the passenger side front wheel decided to part company on the approach to the start line of stage seven.The family duo of Cara and Donald MacNeill made a welcome return to the stages, in new machinery this time, debuting their Subaru Impreza and bringing it home in one piece in 31st overall and second in class nine.Mull\u0026#8217s James Campbell and Claire Tilley also got their Mitsubishi Evo to the finish and will be happy with the result.The event was won by Kilmarnock\u0026#8217s Andrew Gallagher with Jane Nicol on the notes in the CobbleShop Ford Focus WRC.The next rally action for Argyll is the Mach 1 Stages on the weekend of July 14/15 at Machrihanish.\u0026nbspPICS:Photographs by West Coast PhotosAlly Currie and Grant MacNiven blasted it while their Fiesta was still on four wheels. no_a27ArgyllRally01no_a27ArgyllRally02Overall Winners Andrew Gallagher and Jane Nicol in their Ford Focus. no_a27ArgyllRally03Donald MacNeill from Furnace and Cara MacNeill, Glasgow, make light work of the hairpin in their Subaru.  no_a27ArgyllRally04James Campbell and Claire Tilley from Mull in their Mitsubishi. no_a27ArgyllRally05Kicking up dust in their Peogeot 106 are Lochgilphead team Duncan MacLean and Ian Parker. no_a27ArgyllRally06\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"tv company seeks argyll adventurers","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/07/18, 11:20 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowCould you travel to The Far East without stepping on a plane?If so, a television production company is looking for you.Studio Lambert, the company behind Gogglebox, is seeking folk from Argyll to take part in a trans-global race for a cash prize.Flightless is described as an \u0026#8216ambitious real-world adventure series\u0026#8217.

I am still receiving many justifiable complaints about the terrible condition of Mansefield Road in Port Ellen and the hospital road in Bowmore. With long overdue road works going on across Islay and the rest of the Kintyre and Islands ward, it\u0026#8217s only fair these roads are not ignored.The poor condition of the Bruichladdich toilets continues to be raised by local residents.Since contacting the appropriate department I have been informed repairs and maintenance are planned for them.While checking on the progress of pothole repairs I had previously requested, I noticed some of the recent street light repairs leave a lot to be desired. While a quick fix is better than nothing, many of these short-term fixes need to be looked at again.I have been speaking to the BT Openreach staff across Islay who are expanding our island\u0026#8217s internet capabilities. I have contacted BT to make sure recent issues with phone lines in some local households are not a result of the broadband upgrades.There has been progress with local housing associations after pointing out many of their tenants are having trouble with mould in their housing. Measures are now being implemented to to rectify the problem. I was happy to hear Argyll Community Housing Association has fixed gate latches on four of its houses at Cnoc Na Faire in Port Ellen after I raised this with them a few weeks ago.I met with environment, development and infrastructure committee member councillor Gary Mulvaney about Kintyre and Islands\u0026#8217 crumbling infrastructure, alongside our growing industrial output with the success of distilleries on Islay and Jura.Later that day I spoke directly to my constituents in Tarbert after a number of locals \u0026#8211 some business owners \u0026#8211 contacted me about the recent flood of sewage on Harbour Street as a result of blocked drains. Scottish Water were coming under fire from locals because of its slow progress on the matter.I made my anger about the poor conditions in Tarbert very clear when I contacted Scottish Water. A long-term solution to needs to be put in place.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Scottish Water is asking customers to use water wisely in their daily activities to help maintain supplies during the current hot summer weather.Following a sustained dry period without any significant rainfall, customer use has increased significantly.In some areas, there has been a 30 per cent increase in demand for water and an additional 140 million litres are currently being produced and pushed through the system every day.The situation is being monitored closely to manage supplies across the country.This includes deploying additional resources to move water between distribution areas and tankering water to supplement local networks.Average reservoir levels are generally normal for this time of year but the current level of use and continuing dry weather means stocks of stored water available for use are reducing.Try to reduce use wherever possible.Businesses are also being asked to consider their use and how they can use water more efficiently.Simple, practical steps include: taking shorter showers, using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket rather than a hose to wash vehicles only washing windscreens/lights instead of the whole vehicle, turning off taps whenever possible and use washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.More advice on using water wisely is online at www.scottishwater/savewaterscotland or call 0800 0778778.Peter Farrer, Chief Operating Officer, Scottish Water.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"riverside fun day sparkles in the sun","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/07/18, 9:44 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe sun shone on the Riverside in Lochgilphead for a day of fun.Mid Argyll Community Pool and Riverside Rascals nursery hosted the family day on Sunday July 1, featuring a variety of colourful craft and charity stalls.The unmistakeable aroma of barbecue wafted across the car park from Riverside Rascals nursery, which opened its doors to the public for the occasion, complete with children\u0026#8217s activities.MACPool lifeguards were on hand to keep an eye on the youngsters in the pedal boats while the sunshine glistened across the splashing fun.PICS:Four-year-old Kaiden Abel from Lochgilphead has fun splashing in the inflatable outdoor pool. 06_a27RiversideFun01Kyra Robertson, aged 11, from Cairnbaan, tries to hook a duck on the MS centre stand \u0026#8211 and it\u0026#8217s not as easy as it looks. 06_a27RiversideFun04On the MS Centre Mid Argyll stall were Maggie Dodd and centre manager Karen McCurry. 06_a27RiversideFun07Mary Stewart of the Loch Awe Pottery helps sisters Abby and Chloe McCallum, from Glasgow, to decorate their pottery. 06_a27RiversideFun08Cathleen MacDonald was there with her Woolly Bobbins textile-base crafts. 06_a27RiversideFun09Alongside Cathleen was her mum Margaret Davidson, who creates soft toys under the name Twisted Yarn.

His problems did not end there, though, as injury also ruled out Gordon Whyte, Thomas Whyte and Dunky Kerr although the latter was stripped as Kyles only substitute, while Robbie MacLeod was unavailable.Caberfeidh manager Jodi Gorski had Ally MacLennan back but he was also short of players, with Jamie Matheson and Colin MacLennan among his absentees and they lined-up with the Cabers with the second team.Kyles settled into the game with a goal on four minutes. There was a scramble in the goal area where Colin MacDonald fought for possession with Caberfeidh keeper Ewen Pilcher and defender Blair Morrison, and it was actually Luke Thornton who got the final touch to put the hosts ahead.Luke Thornton got Kyles and his second on eight minutes. Sandy MacKenzie played the ball across from the left wing forward position to Luke Thornton who smashed a shoulder-high volley past the Cabers keeper from 15 yards.Kevin Bartlett made it 2-1 on 13 minutes when he latched onto a loose ball in defence and carried the ball forward before thumping it past John Whyte from a central position.However Kyles restored their two-goal cushion on 42 minutes to make it 3-1 at the break. Former Skye Camanachd player Neil MacVicar, playing in attack, switched play from right wing forward to Sandy MacKenzie at left wing forward and he rifled the ball past keeper Pilcher from 18 yards.Grant Irvine got in on the act on 55 minutes. A ball forward from midfield was brought out of the air by Colin MacDonald, who slipped it out to the right wing forward position to the onrushing Grant Irvine, who swept the ball across the keeper into the right-hand side of the net.Sandy MacKenzie put gloss on the win with a rather fortuitous effort on 62 minutes. MacKenzie turned full back Blair Morrison and as keeper Pilcher came out to clear the ball, it rebounded off MacKenzie into the net.Donald Irvine was superb for Kyles, while Grant Irvine was an instrumental figure at full centre.Caberfeidh did not perform at the levels seen when they took shinty’s top flight by surprise in the earlier part of this season.\u0026nbspMarine Harvest South Division 1Title hopefuls the Kyles Athletic second team march on, beating Ballachulish 1-0 at the Jubilee Park.Balla’s Cain MacPhee was free of a one-match ban, while Kyles were without Luke Thornton who was on first team duty.The only goal of the game came on 19 minutes and it was a superb strike from Martin MacFadyen whose 25 yard piledriver from the middle of the park gave the keeper no chance.Balla’ had the chance to level on 35 minutes when referee Callum Duff awarded them a penalty, penalising a \u0026#8216kick\u0026#8217 inside the D.Lorne Brown took the penalty and he struck the ball well enough but his effort was superbly saved by Kyles keeper Douglas Nicolson. It was one of a number of great stops by the Kyles custodian.Kyles have a five point lead on second place Bute although they have played a game more.Bute 4 Bute scored three times in the final third of the game to defeat Aberdour 4-1 in their 12.30pm throw up at The Meadows.Bute’s Craig MacKay was unavailable as he served the second game of a two-match suspension.Aberdour travelled without Cameron McCue and David McDougal.James Craig gave Bute the lead after just five minutes and that proved to be the only goal of a tight first 45 minutes during which Bute goalie Kevin Queen saved well from David MacKenzie, tipping his effort over the bar.Referee Robert Baxter pointed to the penalty spot when Ruairidh Reid was wiped out inside the D, taking a stick across the knees, when he looked set to equalise. Angus Thorburn struck the penalty well but Kevin Queen made a brilliant save to keep his side in front.The visitors were awarded a second penalty shortly after when Roddy MacColl was felled inside the box. Angus Thorburn stepped up again but this time he did not catch the ball as he would have liked and his effort went past the post.The penalty misses were a blow for Aberdour and Bute took advantage and, with some good running and quick passing, they went on to score three more times.Robert Walker made it 2-0 on 65 minutes and Iain McDonald added a third with 15 minutes remaining.Chris Lawrence made it 4-0 on 80 minutes, although there was some consolation for Aberdour when Ruairidh Reid finished well a couple of minutes later. Angus Thorburn battled to get the ball to Reid and his powerful strike from just outside the D gave the keeper no chance.Bute were sharper on the day and they deserved the win but the final scoreline was a little harsh on Aberdour in what was only their second league defeat of the season.Bute now leap-frog Aberdour into second place in the league on goal difference and the Islanders have a game in hand.Kilmory 1 MacRae Park was in perfect condition to host the local derby between Kilmory and the Inveraray second team.A large crowd gathered to watch two teams filled with youth and experience.Kilmory started with top scorer Alister MacArthur in defence and they had young Andrew Innes up-front, supported by the more experienced Hal Jones.Inveraray went with a mature forward line which included Euan McMurdo, John MacKenzie and Neil Campbell but their back five were all aged under 18.But it was across the centre line where all the action happened in the first half.Referee Alex MacVicar had a busy afternoon and David Macpherson was first into the book for a cynical challenge on Sandy Leiper.It wasn’t long before Leiper joined him, yellow carded for a late swing on his fellow winger, young Ruaraidh Graham.Duncan MacBrayne was next to fall foul of the official for persistent fouling.In-between all the yellow cards, Alister MacArthur was dictating the play from the Kilmory defence, with young Hamish MacLennan doing the same for Inveraray and the first half ended scoreless.Inveraray came out the traps the quickest in the second half. A long range effort from David Macpherson was easily saved by the Kilmory keeper, but Neil Campbell was quickest to react and slot the rebound home to open the scoring on 48 minutes.Inveraray added a quick second following a well-worked set-piece routine on 56 minutes. Euan McMurdo’s free-hit found Campbell Watt, whose movement caused the Kilmory defence problems all afternoon, and he made 2-0 with fine finish.The goal sparked life into Kilmory who pulled one back on 65 minutes when Hal Jones blasted home an unstoppable shot from the edge of the penalty area to make it 2-1 and it was game on.After getting themselves back in the game, Kilmory’s discipline let them down soon after, with both Duncan MacBrayne and Sandy Leiper receiving their marching orders from referee MacVicar within minutes of one another.Inveraray capitalised on their two-man advantage and former Kilmory player David MacAllister scored his first goal for his new club on 69 minutes to make it 3-1.Euan McMurdo finished the day’s scoring off with a well-constructed goal to make it 4-1 with 15 minutes remaining.Inveraray will be happy with their league first win of the season, while Kilmory will be disappointed with the result and the fact that they will be missing two influential players over the weeks to come.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"a look at the advertiser of yesteryear","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 20/07/18, 11:54 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowWith the success of the Islay Mòd still fresh in our minds, it is clear that taking part in regional and the national Mòd is a long-standing tradition for Mid Argyll youngsters.For more than 20 years Mid Argyll students have done us proud at the Gaelic singing competitions, as seen here in our edition from 1998, when singers from all over Argyll made their way to the Royal National Mòd on the Isle of Skye.The Lochgilphead Primary Gaelic Choir came fourth in their competition, with the Lochfyneside Junior Gaelic Choir gaining top music mark in their unison singing competition.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"cinema paradiso as screen machine parks up in lochgilphead","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 20/07/18, 1:31 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowA familiar large blue lorry rolled into Lochgilphead recently, offering the latest movies to the public for two nights.The cinema on wheels parked itself outside Kilmory resource centre for movie buffs to enjoy on Tuesday July 10 and Wednesday July 11, with screenings of Gnomeo and Juliet sequel, Sherlock Gnomes superhero epic Avengers: Infinity War Part I and LGBT rom-com, Love, Simon.The Screen Machine has a busy few weeks ahead.

There will be a feed station at approximately the half way mark.The route continues through Kilberry, heading east, with some short sharp climbs and sweeping descents, before following the coast of West Loch Tarbert north, passed the Tarbert Golf Club, before a left turn at the junction with the A83 and back to Tarbert and the finish.The loop is suitable for road bikes  the road surface is variable but generally reasonable, and there are a few steep descents, so some caution is required.The club spokesperson continued: \u0026#8216We are hopeful we\u0026#8217ll get more than 50 entrants on the start line, so please sign up.

It is also the story of a family trying to reunite cousins on both sides of the Atlantic.Except this is not fiction. This is the mysterious story of James Campbell Hay Robertson, known as Jim, who was born and raised in Lochgilphead, and who was so determined to make a fresh start in America that he never saw or spoke to his Scottish family again.Why Jim would cut himself off from his family is something his granddaughter Morgan has been trying to find out and she has asked the Argyllshire Advertiser to help solve this mystery.James Campbell Hay Robertson was born in Lochgilphead and lived in Calman Villa in Ardrishaig. He was the son of the schoolmaster, a noted talent on the Lochgilphead football team and an aspiring doctor. Born in 1896, he had just turned 18 when the Great War began. He enlisted and, when the call for new officer candidates came, he signed up, becoming a \u0026#8216temporary gentleman\u0026#8217 rising to the rank of acting captain in charge of a battery of 4.5-inch Howitzers at the Ypres front. When the war ended, he spent six months in the army occupying Germany near Bonn.Jim was a smart boy, who loved his parents, and he was especially fond of his older sister Alexandria – a very talented pianist. She is often mentioned in the Advertiser as leading musical events in Lochgilphead, and was known as \u0026#8216Miss Lala Robertson\u0026#8217. According to Jim, she went off to study piano around 1910 in London or Edinburgh, but returned to Lochgilphead by the time the Great War broke out.After the war, Jim left for America and banished all of them from his life. It is here the mystery begins: what caused Jim to turn his back on his family and keep their existence hidden, from leaving Scotland in 1921 until his death in 1995 at the age of 99?Jim had a long and happy marriage and he and his wife Ruth had four boys who have grown up without extended family and under the impression that no relations existed in Scotland, which is not true. On a visit to Lochgilphead, Morgan found cousins in Furnace.Jim did share some clues about his family, but they were not all they seemed. He said his older brother William was in the Navy during the Great War, but had become an alcoholic, fallen overboard and drowned. This was not true. William\u0026#8217s signature was on their mother\u0026#8217s death certificate, signed in Aberdeen in 1943. William clearly lived a long life after Jim left Scotland and perhaps had his own family, themselves unaware of their American relatives.Jim\u0026#8217s telling of Alexandra\u0026#8217s story is even more tragic, saying she volunteered as a nurse in the war, fell in love with a South African soldier and left for Cape Town, only to die of food poisoning six months after arriving. This too was false, as the Advertiser\u0026#8217s obituary for their father in 1926 stated he \u0026#8216is survived by three children\u0026#8217, including Alexandra. Part of the story was true, however, as the Advertiser noted in 1920 that she married Henry Beck of Cape Town, in Dorset.Why Jim wanted to make a clean break with his family to such a degree he pretended his brother and sister had died will never be known. But it is possible his brother and sister lived long lives and had large families. Jim\u0026#8217s family in the United States now amounts to three surviving children, six grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren.Jim\u0026#8217s father, William Robertson, came from a family of printers and dyers in Bonhill, Vale of Leven, and served as a schoolmaster from 1883 to 1920. He died in 1926, possibly in Kilmun, and, according to family records, was \u0026#8216buried in Dunoon\u0026#8217, but this may be another red herring from Jim.His mother, Wilhelmina, came from a farming family in Aberdeenshire. She moved to Lochgilphead in 1874 when she was 14, to live with her uncle, Alexander Cameron Robertson, the new minister of Lochgilphead Parish Church, a position he held for more than 50 years, from 1876-1933.There is one picture which could help crack part of the mystery. It shows Jim\u0026#8217s mother with two girls and appears to have been sent to him after his move to America. Part of the handwriting on the back is obscured but reads: \u0026#8216Hannan\u0026#8217s daughter, mom and myself taken last summer.\u0026#8217\u0026#8216Mom\u0026#8217 would refer to Jim\u0026#8217s mum, \u0026#8216myself\u0026#8217 the teenage girl whose age meant she could not be the daughter of Wilhelmina or the sister of Jim. Who was she and was she part of the story which caused Jim to cut himself off from his Scottish roots?If you have any information which could help solve this mystery please email the Argyllshire Advertiser editorial team at editor@argyllshireadvertiser\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12951950.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_emp_ayp_300618station_10JPG.jpg","title":"ayrs station hotel faces 3","story":"NewsAyr\u0027s Station Hotel faces £3 million demolition bill as South Ayrshire Council fear dangerous building is beyond repairCouncil bosses fear a multi-million pound job is on to bring down the crumbling Station Hotel.\u0026nbspShareByStuart Wilson11:50, 20 JUL 2018NewsAyr\u0027s Station Hotel (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailDemolition of the crumbling Station Hotel will cost \u0026pound3million, we can reveal. Council bosses have sized up the task, fearing the iconic structure has reached the end of the line. Large parts of Ayr railway station are closed to the public as safety teams comb the site. But the Post has learned that even a short-term salvage mission will cost more than \u0026pound300,000. Senior councillors have been briefed to expect a hefty hit to the wallet. South Ayrshire bosses will bid to retrieve whatever they spend from the hotel’s absentee Malaysian owner. But a senior adminsitration source said: “We have to face the reality of the situation. “The cost of refurbishing the hotel would be well in excess of \u0026pound10m, so that’s a non-starter. “I think that knocking it down is quickly becoming our only option.” That prospect is likely to face a strong challenge from groups such as Historic Scotland. And political tensions could further complicate the picture.  It comes as the hotel’s safety cordon was extended to take in part of the road over the railway. Teams are inspecting the condition of the building’s gable end amid concerns it could collapse on to people and cars below. Trains continue to run as normal, but access for commuters has now become fraught with difficulty. And worried rail chiefs are now said to be hatching contingency plans, should Ayr become become a no-go zone. But council bosses this week refused to confirm whether an official briefing on demolition had taken place. In a statement, they said: “Work to fully assess the condition of the former Station Hotel is continuing on site. “However, a decision on any future action will be dependent on the findings of the ongoing works and surveys.” But the council’s opposition group claim they are being kept in the dark over developments. Tory boss, Martin Dowey, said the public need to be kept informed. “I’m surprised this figure appears to be being quoted by members of the administration,” he added. “The SNP’s claim of inclusion and transparency is just one more empty promise. “The public need to be kept informed about the hotel and the council’s plans for its future, if that does indeed involve demolition.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnHistoric ScotlandScottish National PartySouth Ayrshire CouncilTransportAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12945474.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_IBP_AYP_110718WINDOW_01JPG.jpg","title":"ayr window cleaner keith mckissock","story":"NewsAyr window cleaner Keith McKissock says South Ayrshire Council parking wardens are \"stopping\" him from workingFurious Keith McKissock claims he is being \"stopped\" from going about his business in Ayr town centre.\u0026nbspShareByStuart Wilson10:49, 19 JUL 2018NewsKeith has won support from customers and some councillors (Image: AYRSHIRE POST)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA popular window cleaner claims council bosses are blocking his bid to work. Keith McKissock washes up to 50 properties – many of them businesses – in Ayr town centre. But the dad-of-two faces a stand-off with parking wardens on his tail. Keith, who runs Craigie Cleaning Services, wants a special permit allowing his van into town. But despite offers to pay an annual fee, red tape and fines have dogged his progress. The 53-year-old said: “I’m just trying to go about my work – what I do actually improves the town. “If I wasn’t cleaning these windows, would the council? “I can’t carry 22 litres of water on my back with all my ladders. “Maybe they expect me to balance everything on my bike.”  Keith, once a top Scottish cyclist, was backed all the way by customers this week. Kenny McLachlan, of Ayr, said: “Keith’s been washing our windows for five years and you couldn’t meet a harder working guy. “The High Street needs all the support it can get – we shouldn’t be harassing people doing it a turn.”  Now Tory councillors are  hoping to ride to the cleaner’s rescue by proposing a new parking charter.  Group chief Martin Dowey said: “Examples exist in other councils where they charge an annual window cleaner permit. “Keith is someone who legitimately services our High Street and there needs to be a common sense solution.” Ayrshire’s roads boss Stewart Turner said: “Vehicles can’t remain in the same location for longer than 10 minutes without activity. “In addition, it is not possible to move a vehicle from one bay to another in attempt to buy time. “In Mr McKissock’s case, he can use the bays to undertake cleaning operations but can’t use them to park or collect money from customers. “He was recently asked to move his vehicle from a bay by a parking attendant as he was not carrying out any window cleaning activities. “The Alliance wrote to Mr McKissock, once again, regarding his behaviour towards our parking attendants. “Our employees deserve to be treated with respect and we have a responsibility to protect them.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"former wwe star hurricane tops","story":"NewsFormer WWE star The Hurricane tops bill as Pro Wrestling Elite stages anniversary show at Ayr CitadelPWE will stage their latest extravaganza - and are promising fans one of their biggest and best shows yet.\u0026nbspShareByLochlin Highet16:03, 19 JUL 2018NewsPWE will stage their big event this weekend (Image: Copyright Unknown)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailGrappling fans are in for a treat this weekend as a host of wrestling stars will descend on Ayr.

The Honest Men were relegated at the first time of asking in the second tier in the 2016/17 season when they finished bottom with 33 points. But former Ayr hitman and manager, Roberts, reckons being part-time was what held them back. Marko, who played second tier football with Ayr under Brian Reid, said: “I think Ayr will be fine, I really do. “Being full-time in that league is a massive thing. “The last few times Ayr have been in that league it has been very difficult to compete with the full-time teams. “But the fact they have got that now will make a big difference and I don’t think they will have any issues staying in the league. “When I was there under Brian Reid, being part-time was what held us back. “You didn’t have enough time to go and work on things on a daily basis but Ayr will have that now.  “You can beat any team in a one-off game but over the course of a season of 36 games it’s difficult to compete. “But the fans should be excited this time as there should be no problem – Ayr can even start looking up rather than looking down.” Roberts, who hit the net 43 times for Ayr, was more than impressed with Ayr’s impressive goal-scoring form last season as they topped League One, pipping Raith on the final game of the season. He said: “I thought they were really good to watch. “You always thought they were going to score every game they played. “And I don’t mean just scoring one, you always thought they’d grab three or four. “Sometimes they were left open all over the park – but they had too much quality up front and that’s the reason they went up. “Fair play to them as they had three really good strikers in Shankland, Moore and Moffat.” Roberts added: “The way the league was won was certainly a bit of a way to win it.  “I’ve been in teams that have won titles and been promoted with five or six games to go, which gives you a great feeling of accomplishment, but there’s nothing more exciting than winning the title in the last 10 minutes of the season. “Both teams had the chance to run away with it but kept faltering.” Roberts managed Ayr for three years before getting sacked, He then had a player/coach role at Clyde for a season. He has now gone back to playing at Junior Cup finalists Hurlford United. But he insists that his managing days aren’t over.  He said: “I won’t give up on it, I just wanted to play again for now. The best days of your life are when you’re kicking a ball and I am still fit enough.  “Any manager who tells you they prefer coaching is talking rubbish. When you’re out there playing it’s  just great.  “I do want to get back to managing eventually though, but it’s all about finding the right club and what suits my life at the minute.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12935909.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_emp_ayp_080618maragret_12JPG.jpg","title":"meet this weeks class act","story":"NewsMeet this week\u0027s Class ActAyr United striker Michael Moffat popped along to Queen Margaret Academy to visit the youngsters who were holding a Soccer Aid event.\u0026nbspShareByAbi Smillie15:12, 17 JUL 2018NewsMichael Moffat of Ayr United pictured with the senior sports leaders (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailFooty fans and soccer stars joined together for a special charity event last month.

Catherine also works in the entertainment industry as a photobooth attendant for Foxy Photo booths. The couple are from Irvine and have two kids together, David, 9, and Darcy, 2. The pair met on a night out in November 2013 in Irvine town. Catherine said: “We exchanged numbers and the rest was history. “We dated for several months before Jamie settled into family life with my little boy David and since then the two of them have been inseparable.” The couple tied the knot on Friday, June 8 at the Gailes Hotel.  “We had a Rugby Glam theme with lots of sparkle,” said Catherine. “We had centre pieces with feathers, rugby balls going down the aisle and silver sparkly table covers. “My son David wrote and shared a reading at the ceremony, which no one knew about, for Jamie about how he has made his mum so happy and how he is proud that this man is his step dad. The bride wore a strapless princess ballgown with cathedral train and sparkly cathedral veil. The 32 layered dress was MoriLee from J’Taime Bridal in Stevenston. The groom and groomsmen wore full kilt attire from Kilts4U in Kilmarnock. The wedding party consisted of Maid of honour, auntie of the bride Anna Marie Darroch Bridesmaid, best friend Emma Sneddon Flowergirl, daughter Darcy Doolan Bride’s parents Luigi and Julie Coppola Best man, best friend Aaron Robertson Ushers, Craig Wilson and David Darroch, Page boy, son David and Groom’s parents Jim Doolan and Una Doolan.

Catherine said: “We were lucky enough that both sets of grandparents looked after the kids and we got a full seven nights in the Luxury Moon Palace Resort in Cancun, Mexico. “We were treated like royalty from the moment we walked off the plane - butler service, 24hr room service, chauffeur driven everywhere. “But, it rained 22 hours a day for almost six days out of seven so we were stuck inside felling like we were at Irvine beach not the Caribbean Coast! Hugh McFedries Photography and Magic Memories Videography captured the couple’s big day, leaving them with fond memories to look back on. Flowers were arranged by Myra Craigen @ Balloons and Blooms and their cake created by Not Just Cake, Bellshill. Catherine said: “It was six tiers of white and sparkle- exactly what I had envision on my day. “It was made with different flavours but the Irn Bru and Toffee layers were our favourite.  Hair and Make-up was styled and created by Forever Diamonds, Prestwick Catherine added: “Hair and make up and all things beauty were done by my cousin Sean Diamond’s salon.

And United proved that underdogs can upset the odds by finishing sixth and leaving Aberdeen, Dundee United, Dundee and St Johnstone in their wake. It was a stunning effort but McSherry, who was signed by Ally MacLeod on a free from Kilmarnock, reckons Ayr can once again confound the pundits and enjoy a great season. United kick off the league at home to Partick Thistle on August 4 and midfielder turned publican McSherry expects them to be up for the challenge. He said: “Consolidation should be the aim but there is no reason why Ayr can’t rise again and enjoy the good times that we enjoyed in the 70s.” An old team picture that surfaced in McSherry’s Wee Windaes got punters rewinding the years and reliving past glories. It was taken at the start of season 1975-76 and showed Ayr in their change kit of Barcelona strips. Proudly standing tall are, back row – Davie Wells, Alex McAnespie, Ally MacLean, Hugh Sproat, Rikki Fleming, John Murphy. Middle row – Alex Ingram, Gerry Phillips, Johnny Graham, Johnny Doyle, Hugh Cameron, Jim McSherry. Front row – John Dickson, Danny MacDonald, Davie McCulloch.   Jim recalled: “No one could work out why the team weren’t in their usual black and white if it was an official  team picture.  “We were also puzzled why there were 15 players in it, including two goalkeepers. “Then one of my regulars, Stephen Robb, came up with the answer – it was taken before a pre-season friendly.  “We wore it in a 7-2 defeat at home to Celtic and it was never seen  again. I think it was binned as a bad omen.  “These were good times at Ayr and the team was loaded with some great players. “We were the only part-time team in the Top Ten and were quoted at 66/1, which seemed about right given the teams we were up against. “I remember Ally signing me on the wall at Central Station and then telling me to look out my passport. “He told me ‘You’re going on tour to Canada next week’. It was quite a start to my Ayr career.” Only three months into that season, Ally was lured to Aberdeen and replaced at the helm by Alex Stuart who quickly appointed McSherry as captain. Ayr sealed safety with a last-day 2-1 win over Motherwell, who were bossed by Willie McLean and Craig Brown. Gerry Phillips got a dramatic late winner to spark euphoric scenes at a packed Somerset. The second season of top-flight football saw Ayr again more than hold their own.  They finished eighth in the table on 30 points, three ahead of Hearts and a distant 13 more than rock-bottom  rivals Kilmarnock.  Season 1977-78 marked Ayr’s third campaign in the top flight, a remarkable achievement considering they stayed part-time. Robert Connor, Ian McAllister, Derek McCutcheon and Iain Sim were called up from Ayr United Boys’ Club. But Ayr were always up against it and their life in the Premier League ended when they finished second-bottom on 24 points and were relegated along with Clydebank. Now as a new league season beckons with renewed optimism and a totally full-time structure, it’s time to dream again.

Prestwick Airport were delighted that the UK Space Agency (UKSA) continued to support their plans to be one of the UK’s three horizontal space launch sites. This follows the Space Agency’s announcement that Sutherland will be the UK’s first vertical spaceport, a significant step for the UK space industry. Prestwick bosses believe they are by far the most suitable spot for horizontal space launch in the UK in terms of location, capability and the thriving satellite manufacturing industry that exists on their doorstep. An independent assessment said most of the anticipated infrastructure required for space launch capability is already in place at the site, meaning that they could move speedily to achieve a licence once the legislation is defined. Airport bosses say the development of a spaceport at Prestwick is a real opportunity for the Scottish and Ayrshire economies. The spaceport project is an integral part of the Ayrshire Growth Deal and supporters say it would attract new investment to the aerospace cluster located around the airport, safeguarding existing jobs and creating many new ones. Stewart Adams, chief executive of Glasgow Prestwick Airport, said: “We are extremely grateful for the support we have from South Ayrshire Council and look forward to our continued collaboration with them and our other partners as we look to successfully deliver on our joint vision, a vision that places Glasgow Prestwick Spaceport as a centre of excellence for the space and aerospace industries. “We will be having further discussions with all our stakeholders to review our strategy and how to take our plans forward in light of the additional funding available. “We will also be talking to potential customers and launch partners willing to support operations at Prestwick.” South Ayrshire Council leader Douglas Campbell said: “Prestwick is still the most advanced site currently in the running for the UK’s first horizontal space launch and we’ll seek to use the development fund to cement our position. “Our focus will continue to be on supporting our partners to ensure Prestwick can deliver the significant levels of jobs and investment that we know can be realised.” Ayr MSP, John Scott, said: “The case for Prestwick hosting this facility is a strong one, including the availability of a 2,987m runway and many aerospace businesses already on site with and land to accommodate more.” And MP Bill Grant added: “I am delighted that Sutherland in North East Scotland has been selected for the UKs first vertical take-off Spaceport facility and equally important is the fact that Glasgow Prestwick is still in the running for a Spaceport licence for horizontal take off facilities.” The commercial space sector is worth an estimated \u0026pound3.8billion to the UK economy over the next 10 years.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnPrestwick AirportSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12953553.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Craig-Ferguson-Promotes-American-On-Purpose.jpg","title":"talk show host holds giant","story":"NewsTalk show host holds giant showbiz party at his South Ayrshire mansionAnd the telly alter egos of two of the guests were certainly more at home in a council tower block.\u0026nbspShareByStephen Houston15:23, 20 JUL 2018NewsStill Game stars Isa, Jane McCarry, and Tam, Mark Cox (Image: AYRSHIRE POST)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailFamed American talk show host Craig Ferguson has staged a giant showbiz party at his South Ayrshire mansion. And the telly alter egos of two of the guests were certainly more at home in a council tower block. For Tam and Isa actors in Still Game - Mark Cox and Jane McCarry - were among those clinking champagne glasses. It was staged at his country mansion near Dailly which has become the Scottish seat of Ferguson. The party follows shooting of his new movie has been filmed in Argyll. Along with 140 cast and crew he was staying near Arochar while filming for ‘Love You To Death’ at locations around Argyll and Bute.  Stars include male lead Craig, Craiglang favourite Ford Kiernan and Liz Hurley Producer Matthew Weiner - the creator of the hit TV series Mad Men, said: “Our experience of filming in Argyll and Scotland as a whole has been phenomenal, we have never felt so welcomed and supported as Americans.” Sources say the party was a grand affair, with “lots of great people.” One guest said: “Craig really put on a show and his house is incredible. “As well as actors some of the Ayrshire gentry were there. They had a ball . . . and it was so funny to see ‘Tam and Isa’ there. “Craig is a huge fan of Still Game and appeared in it alongside Jane and Mark. “While Jane and Mark had no problem fitting in to the glamour surroundings, Tam and Isa would have been completely overawed.”  Craig bought his Ayrshire property for \u0026pound2million cash six years ago, bidding over the \u0026pound1.85m asking price. The 56-year-old was once the highest earning talk show host in the US, taking home \u0026pound8m a year. He fell in love with the mansion in the Girvan Valley and was keen to have a Scots base for his three sons. The house is 336 years old and has 14 receptions and 15 bedrooms over four floors. But it also boasts facilities fit for a Hollywood superstar with cinema, games room, billiard room, gym and tennis court. Craig has kept a low profile since, but four years ago popped up to watch the panto at the Ayr Gaiety with the family and wife Megan. Amazingly he actually trod the Gaiety boards 20 years ago in a touring show, starring with the late Gerard Kelly in ‘The Odd Couple.’ "},{"url":null,"title":"drivers-facing-10-weeks-of-disruption-during-galafoot-bridge-works","story":"DRIVERS using the Galafoot Bridge will face 10 weeks of disruption from next month.\nEssential maintenance work is being carried out on the A6091, beginning at 8pm on Sunday, August 5.\nThe work will include the replacement of the road and footpath surfacing the waterproofing of the bridge deck deck repairs and a repair of the expansion joints \u0026ndash subject to investigations.\nThe scheme will require a full closure of the eastbound carriageway of the bridge \u0026ndash travelling from Galashiels to Tweedbank \u0026ndash with a signed diversion route in operation.

Galashiels has been especially hard hit, with its proportion of vacant retail units now standing at 15% representing a total of 37 empty stores.\nHawick and Selkirk lag not far behind, with 14% apiece of their shops lying empty, and 13% of Jedburgh\u0026rsquos shops are also going spare.\nPeebles, Kelso, Duns, Melrose and Eyemouth have all kept their proportion of empty shops in their town centres at 8% or below, though.\nThe purpose of the town centre core activity area pilot study is to suggest updating the council\u0026rsquos planning policy in a bid to save the region\u0026rsquos high streets.\nIn it, lead planning officer Charles Johnston says: \u0026ldquoRetailing patterns continue to fluctuate, and the role of town centres is changing\u0026nbsp for example, the increase of online shopping and competition from larger national retailers.\n\u0026ldquoThe impacts of the current challenging economic climate are being felt across the country, and these trends are not unique to the Scottish Borders.\n\u0026ldquoPlanning policy must adapt to these changing circumstances.\n\u0026ldquoIn recent years, the council has amended its town centre policy in its local development plan to adapt to such changes, and whilst these changes have helped, it is acknowledged that a further review of relevant planning policy could be tested via this pilot study.\n\u0026ldquoThere are specific immediate concerns regarding Hawick and Galashiels, where reduced footfall and vacancy rates have had a detrimental impact on how these town centres have performed.\n\u0026ldquoThis is of particular concern as Hawick and Galashiels are the two largest towns within the Borders and have a strategic economic and social significance for the region.\nThe report recommends the council tries out pilot schemes in Hawick and Galashiels, either scrapping or altering their core activity area status marking out the boundaries of their commercial centres to allow a greater range of activity to take place within them.\nPlanning permission is usually only granted in such town centres if proposals are for business use in keeping with the surroundings of the sites in question, but\u0026nbspabolishing core activity area status would allow non-commercial enterprises to occupy empty high street properties.\nIn Hawick, the report says, a radical approach is needed, so it recommends councillors to vote to abolish the core activity centre there altogether.\n\u0026ldquoReducing the core area completely would, in essence, allow a greater number of other uses within the town centre, it says.\n\u0026ldquoWhilst there is the threat that complete removal of the core activity area may cause longer-term footfall issues, it is considered that some significant action is required in Hawick.\n\u0026ldquoTo implement this as a test case via a pilot scheme would seem an appropriate course of action in the circumstances.\nIn Galashiels, it is recommended that core activity area is retained but that the scope of activity allowed be expanded to include professional service businesses, non-profitable institutions and leisure activities.\nThe outcomes of those proposed pilot schemes in Hawick and Galashiels would then be used to draw up similar proposals for other towns.\nFootfall figures % change from 2007 to 2017:\nHawick

More of the same please.It was a good day for the Argyll favourites. A positive start which should continue at Kintyre Park against Pollock under 19s tomorrow with a 2pm kick off.

Boasting one of the oldest golf courses in the world \u0026ndash Musselburgh Links, The Old Course \u0026ndash the town was once home to the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers, who now play at Muirfield, near Gullane.  The Honourable Company brought other Edinburgh clubs to the town such as Royal Burgess, Bruntsfield and the Warrender.  The exhibition celebrates the days from 1836 to the early 20th century when Musselburgh was at the forefront of the game\u0026rsquos development.  It not only celebrates the golf clubs which played in the town over the years but also the many golf club and ball makers, and professional players, who made their living in the town between 1836 and 1900 \u0026ndash a period of dramatic growth in the game.  The display has been organised by Musselburgh Museum and Heritage Group in partnership with Mungo Park, whose great-grandfather Willie Park Senior, from Wallyford, won the first Open Championship at Prestwick in 1860 and went on to be a four-time Open champion.  Willie\u0026rsquos brother Mungo and son Willie Junior were also Open champions at Musselburgh Links.  Two other local men \u0026ndash Bob Ferguson, who won a hat-trick of Open Championships, and David Brown \u0026ndash complete the town\u0026rsquos five Open champions, with 11 wins between them.  Support for the exhibition has also been received from East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos economic development and strategic investment department and Musselburgh Common Good Fund.  The exhibition, which runs from July 6 to September 1, is to be officially opened by Lord Wemyss, whose family has been involved with golf since the early 18th century.  On display are a large number of golf items and memorabilia donated by golf clubs that were formerly located at Musselburgh Links. Artefacts from the British Golf Museum and private collections can also be viewed.  The exhibition includes significant artefacts that have not been seen publicly in Scotland for decades, among them Charles Lees\u0026rsquo famous painting A Summer Evening on the Musselburgh Links: Golfers, which recently sold at Bonhams.  Organisers say the display shows Musselburgh\u0026rsquos leadership in developing golf and exporting it.  The museum is open on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays from 10.30am to 4pm each day."},{"url":null,"title":"the-rahs-make-waves-across-the-world","story":"  The band, from Prestonpans, released their latest single Survival through their independent platform EH32 Records last week and have been thrilled by the response it has received.

Mattie Edmond, club steward, handed over a cheque for \u0026pound1,410 to Fiona Brown and Alison Clancy from the charity after they hosted Pancreatic Cancer Scotland following two events on Easter Sunday and a show with the Jersey Beats organised by Pete Barrie with support from the Prestonpans Hearts Supporters Club.

They also found five secondary tumours at the top of his spine.  By the age of 13, the brave teenager had completed a high dose of radiotherapy to his brain and spinal cord following a biopsy.  Despite his health challenges, Paul, who is now 30, received a Bachelor of Engineering with Honours in Computer Systems and Networks degree at a graduation ceremony at the Usher Hall last week.  His family, including mum Angela, 52, and sisters Laura, 34, and Aleigh, 21, were filled with pride to see him receive his degree.  He was also awarded the Rob Kemmer Prize, receiving \u0026pound100 in recognition of his \u0026ldquooutstanding achievements on his individual programme of study.  Paul, of Burns Wynd, is now planning to return to Napier after the summer to complete his Master\u0026rsquos Degree.  Angela, who has been Paul\u0026rsquos full-time carer, said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom incredibly proud of Paul.  \u0026ldquoDespite his challenges he just gets on with things and has achieved his degree.  \u0026ldquoHe has had a tough life but he does not give up and is an incredibly caring young man.  \u0026ldquoNothing is going to stop Paul.  Angela revealed that Paul was a pupil at Musselburgh Grammar School when his condition was first diagnosed.  She said: \u0026ldquoPaul was having trouble with his eyesight and the school contacted me to say they thought it was getting worse.  \u0026ldquoIt was when he was referred to the Eye Pavilion in Edinburgh they discovered the tumours were the cause of it.  \u0026ldquoHe had multifocal germinoma tumours and secondary cancer caused the spinal lesions.  Although the radiotherapy cured his tumour, it had other detrimental effects.  Paul is registered blind as a result of the radiotherapy to his visual nerves and also has a curvature of the spine.  The pituitary gland in his brain has failed completely, so he needs to take hormone replacements and he also finds it difficult to open his jaw, which is thought to be due to scar tissue following radiotherapy.  It was when he was working as a volunteer at Musselburgh Citizens Advice Bureau that Paul first became interested in developing his computer skills, attending both Edinburgh College and Napier for four years.  Angela said: \u0026ldquoPaul doesn\u0026rsquot have an assistant at Napier and he travels there independently.  \u0026ldquoHe has some vision out of the side of one eye and the centre of the other.  \u0026ldquoThe university helped with extra large screens for him and giving him more time his teachers are all delighted for him.  Paul hopes that his achievement will inspire others with illness and disabilities to follow their dreams and aspirations.  He said: \u0026ldquoTo graduate with a degree is massive. It took a while to get here from secondary school.  \u0026ldquoI am looking forward to returning to Napier for a year to do my Master\u0026rsquos Degree. They have given huge support.

The company, which provides a link to many of the Scottish islands from the mainland, dates back to 1851 and has become famous for the red and black funnel, complete with the Lion Rampant, on its ships.  Kit said: \u0026ldquoWe self-published it the first time and having, finally, persuaded him to write down all the stories I found a way of getting it published.  \u0026ldquoWe printed about 400 copies and the punchline is, despite him giving a few away, we got enough money back to cover the publication cost.  \u0026ldquoAs far as I know it is sold out \u0026ndash I have got a copy and so do both my sons but I think that is about it.  \u0026ldquoThe reason we published it in the first place was, certainly to us, the highly entertaining stories about MacBrayne.  \u0026ldquoThere was a lot in it about his army service and, after coming back to it after all those years, the reason for publishing it again was just to make sure those reflections on a way of life long gone did not die with him.  Kit \u0026ndash who last year released The Triumph and Tragedy of the Bantams, which focused on a band of \u0026ldquobrave but largely forgotten soldiers \u0026ndash has added his own stories of being a \u0026lsquoMacBrayne Child\u0026rsquo.

The dad-of-three said: \u0026ldquoThe TV course has been a brilliant journey.  \u0026ldquoColleagues often ask where I find my energy, and sometimes I have to ask myself the same thing, especially at 4am when I have forgotten to go to bed. Perhaps my endurance and resilience comes from my 12 years as a commando.  \u0026ldquoThere have been sacrifices, the biggest of them being to have had no social life throughout this time, but I am passionate about television and I am now talking to production companies and hoping to make my mark in the documentary genre.

Matt, who served with the Royal Marines in Northern Ireland, has already completed a music production with National Museums Scotland for a new exhibition on Scottish pop from the 1950s to present day.

Svetlana Kondakova and Maja Quille, graduates of Edinburgh College of Art, worked on \u0026lsquoMusselburgh Archer\u0026rsquo, a life-size bronze cast of an archer and 12 steel arrows which will create a trail around the town.  In a joint statement, they said: \u0026ldquoWe hope that the artwork will link the heritage of Musselburgh to the modern day, as well as providing an interactive element of activity for both locals and visitors with the trail.  The lifesize figure represents layers of local history including the Roman invasion in AD 80, the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh in 1547 and the Musselburgh Silver Arrow, which dates back to 1603 and is claimed to be the oldest sporting trophy in the world still competed for annually.  The artwork will be completed with a series of stainless steel arrows installed at different locations around Musselburgh. They are expected to be installed later this summer and will form a trail around the town to areas of cultural, historical, natural and community significance, supported by a Global Treasure App organised by Musselburgh Area Partnership.  Councillor Jim Goodfellow, cabinet spokesperson for community wellbeing, said: \u0026ldquoThis is a striking piece of art that represents so many aspects of local history.

Dunbar and East Linton ward member Councillor Norman Hampshire encouraged members of the public to go along and have their say.  He said: \u0026ldquoThere is a high demand for the parks that we have in Dunbar.  \u0026ldquoAs the town grows in size, we have got to make sure we make best use of every bit of green space that we have.  A proposed theme for the park would be to celebrate the varied geology of the county.  Information cairns and distance markers could be created around a circular path.  The creation of paths, additional trim trail equipment and the retention of the putting green are among the ideas highlighted, as well as a new football area with permanent goals.  However, potentially the most ambitious aspect of the scheme is the creation of a new pavilion with access to public toilets.  The potential of a pavilion comes after Winterfield Pagoda, which dated back to the 1920s, was torn down in March last year.  Capital investment could also be made in a tree shelter belt, rural parkour \u0026ndash or free-running \u0026ndash elements in timber and additional benches and seating.  Another major project could be the creation of \u0026ldquoa low-key but iconic \u0026lsquogateway\u0026rsquo feature which would welcome walkers off the John Muir Way and into the park.

East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership confirmed it had suspended admission to the home following the report, which has now been fully revealed, after it emerged last month the home had been ordered to make urgent improvements after inspectors raised \u0026ldquoserious concerns.  HC-One, which operates the home, says it has introduced a new home manager and it pointed to some of the more \u0026ldquopositive comments in the report which acknowledged staff were praised for their approach to residents.  A spokesperson for HC-One said: \u0026ldquoThe health and wellbeing of our residents is our highest priority and we take all feedback from the Care Inspectorate extremely seriously. We are pleased their full report included some positive comments about the home, particularly noting our staff team are \u0026lsquokind and caring\u0026rsquo in their approach to residents.  \u0026ldquoWe also recognise we need to do better in some other areas. To do this, we have a new home manager in place who is being supported by the wider management team, and we continue to work closely with the Care Inspectorate and relevant authorities as we implement our improvement plan.  \u0026ldquoWe are pleased significant positive progress has already been made, and are confident the home is in a better place than at the time of the original inspection.  \u0026ldquoWe will continue working hard each and every day so that we are consistently providing the standard of care that Residents deserve.  \u0026ldquoThe Care Inspectorate have recently returned to the home to commence a new inspection, and we look forward to demonstrating the positive changes to them.  Drummohr is the second nursing home in East Lothian operated by HC-One to have admissions suspended in two years.  In 2016, Tranent Care Home was temporarily stopped from admitting new residents by the partnership, which oversees adult care services, after reports of residents being ignored as they asked for help to eat, with others eating with their fingers because of a lack of cutlery or being unable to cut their food themselves, while others were seen wearing clothes soiled or left unchanged after spilling food on themselves.  The report into Drummohr said: \u0026ldquoThere was a lack of oversight and management of food and fluid intake in the home. Nineteen residents were recorded as having lost weight in March 2018. Five had significant weight loss.  \u0026ldquoWe observed instances where residents did not take their meal and nothing else was offered, teas were often left cold and untouched and one resident walked around taking others\u0026rsquo meals and drinks.  \u0026ldquoWe also noted that there was specific guidance in a care file from the dietician in respect of food and fluids that one resident could have. The instructions were not followed. These issues, together with the lack of guidance to staff in respect of monitoring, recording and evaluating intake, is concerning.  The report added that \u0026ldquosome of this lack of care could be attributed to a lack of staff.  Drummohr scored a 2 out of 5 on all four areas inspected, a score regarded as \u0026lsquoweak\u0026rsquo. The four areas were quality of care and support environment staffing and management and leadership.  An East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe wellbeing of residents is always our paramount concern and in this case we will continue working closely with Care Inspectorate to ensure that HC-One delivers the required improvements as soon as possible.  \u0026ldquoAs an interim measure, we have decided to suspend new admissions to Drummohr to enable staff there to focus on what needs to be done. They will be supported in this by a multi-disciplinary team from the partnership."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8061096.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"bus-mounts-pavement-in-tranent","story":"  The 62-year-old, who was driving an empty Prentice coach at the time of the incident, is understood to have taken ill at the wheel as it pulled out from a bus stop.

WHAT do we remember of our childhood in our later days? Think for a moment of the key happy memories which have framed your childhood. They are often simple ones involving play outside. Sadly, research is showing that children are increasingly less able to explore and play in the outdoors.  There are various reasons for this and there is a horrible irony at the centre of it. We have become far more obsessed with material things, it\u0026rsquos all around us. We are literally buying into the idea that happiness is about purchase and we are passing this on to our children.  It\u0026rsquos in our brains that the economy needs us to spend our money on things we don\u0026rsquot need. We are fed an ideology that spending money on stuff is not just a pleasure but a civic duty. It keeps the economy going and makes us all prosperous. That\u0026rsquos what we are made to believe.  But the result is that more than ever, for our children and ourselves, we are enslaved to the interests of corporate profit at the expense of what really matters: simple time to be and enjoy free pleasures.  These were my thoughts as I set off for the second of this summer\u0026rsquos journeys of discovery. I didn\u0026rsquot share them at the time, and of course I stopped thinking about them as the magic of the wood engulfed us.  We began our journey amongst yew trees which surrounded the ancient kirk of Garvald. It was a scorching day and the shade of trees was such a relief. The plan was to spend the day exploring the wood and discover Stoneypath Castle.  Garvald Kirk has a simple beauty. While parts of its wall are 800 years old, it has been subject to renovation and alteration over the last 200 years. There is a welcoming atmosphere inside and I reflected that when not being used for services it would make a perfect storytelling venue.  By the door there is a reminder of how religion can change its spots. A set of jougs hangs on the wall: an iron collar and chain once used to humiliate and degrade \u0026lsquosinners\u0026rsquo by chaining them up. The victims of this would have been mainly young women who became pregnant out of wedlock.  It\u0026rsquos right that it remains there, I think, as a reminder that religion can be used as a justification for intolerance, hate and cruelty as well as a source for love and compassion. The choice of which version to adhere to is a human one.  We followed the rabbits which scattered from the kirkyard into the wood. I was surprised that the Papana Water, which flows through the wood, was so full given there had been no real rain for weeks  It\u0026rsquos impossible to be bored in a wood. Hours were soaked up under the cooling shade of the tree canopy. It was quite simply a day of utter magic. We had our picnic under the shade of two giant Scots pine trees with the sound of running water in the background. It was the only real quiet moment in what would be hours of constant play. The kids just sat for a while, listening to the running water, and looking up at the trees. It was a communion of simple joy.  The walk isn\u0026rsquot so long in distance but it took us around five hours to complete. It could be done in 20 minutes or less if you just walk. But we didn\u0026rsquot just walk, we explored. There are three bridges which cross the Papana. Each one had a different attraction. Shoes were soon off and clothes got wet but the heat meant none of this mattered. A new game was devised when our youngest, Lewis, tried to use a piece of half-eaten banana as a substitute for a stick while playing \u0026lsquoPoohsticks\u0026rsquo . The girls rushed into the river to reclaim it, but then came up with a new game \u0026lsquohunt the banana\u0026rsquo.  After spending time at various points by the river, getting wet and discovering lots of things, we finally reached the walk\u0026rsquos end: Stoneypath Tower. It suddenly appears above the trees as if out of a fairy tale, its newly restored red walls and parapets a contrast to the green we were surrounded by.  There is much history in the castle, but then again there is history in the woods and hills.  As we headed back to Garvald the kids were quieter, tired by adventure, but in a joyful way. The image of my kids standing in the water, playing and searching for fish seemed to symbolise something immemorial: a powerful and simple truth that what we really need is an immersion in nature, not stuff that hijacks our wellbeing in the name of profit.  We surely stepped on the footprints of Robert Neillans on our return. He was a well-known cooper who lived in Garvald over 200 years ago. Perhaps he came foraging here, I thought. As the water sparkled in the sunshine I reflected that the making of \u0026lsquoillicit whisky\u0026rsquo was once common hereabouts and that Robert was, according to local historian Irene Anderson, one of those involved.  We walked past the house he built on the banks of the Papana when we returned to Garvald. What tales this village could tell!  We\u0026rsquod been \u0026lsquoaway\u0026rsquo for a total of nearly six hours in a magic place. But we\u0026rsquod met only one person walking her dog. In one sense that was a joy, and the absence of litter was another.  But it was tinged with a sense of sadness that the magic is something being lost to so many of us, and indeed that so many of the magic places are themselves being lost.  But my melancholy did not last long. It was a day of joy and we thanked the wood as we left."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8067093.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"day-two-of-the-aberdeen-standard-investments-scottish-open-at-gullane-golf-club","story":"  Rock is 13-under-par, two shots better off ellow countryman Tyrell Hatton.

A former Musselburgh Grammar School pupil and member of Edinburgh Road Club (RC) Cycling Club, he won the British youth circuit race championship in 2013 at Blackpool.  Ben, who passed away on July 1, was studying geography at the University of Edinburgh.  Christopher Noble, Ben\u0026rsquos \u0026ldquoheartbroken flat-mate, paid tribute to his friend on Facebook.

A tribute on the Edinburgh RC website stated: \u0026ldquoEdinburgh RC would like to mark the life of former club member Ben Forsyth which sadly ended on July 1.  \u0026ldquoHe was a stalwart member of the youth section until he joined the Spokes race team in 2014.  \u0026ldquoThe pinnacle of his cycling achievements was winning the British youth circuit race championship in 2013 on the promenade at Blackpool in an ERC jersey. That performance did not come out of the blue \u0026ndash it was the culmination of many years of learning from others and pure hard work.  \u0026ldquoThe week after his victory in Blackpool, he returned to where he started at Inch Park, resplendent in his national champion\u0026rsquos jersey, to meet and inspire our younger riders.  \u0026ldquoHe became a hero figure for many of our Go-Ride members, and some of the coaches too.

He will be greatly missed by the cycling community in Scotland.  \u0026ldquoWe pay tribute to his many achievements in his short life and extend our condolences to his parents, Keith and Margaret, sister Emma and girlfriend Hannah.

Taylor Wimpey East Scotland has teamed up with Mactaggart and Mickel Homes \u0026ndash both of which are already building on the adjacent Letham Mains site, where more than 800 homes are being built \u0026ndash for the plans on Haddington\u0026rsquos south-western edge.  The early proposals, which will be unveiled to the public later this year, show about 300 homes, with a quarter of those being affordable.  Included in the plans are provision for roads and drainage infrastructure, off-site road improvements, as well as land being set aside for play areas and open space.  The Proposal of Application Notice (PAN) is the first step in the planning process, with the idea of housing on the site, off the A6093.  The land outlined for the development is identified for housing in the new Local Development Plan and, according to the developers, will be designed to integrate with the Letham Mains development.  The public exhibition will give both housebuilders the opportunity to share their proposals for the development with members of the public and other interested parties, and for feedback to be passed to the developer.  A detailed planning application is expected later this year.  Joanne Casey, director of Mactaggart \u0026amp Mickel Homes, speaking on behalf of both developers, said the PAN allowed the developers to \u0026ldquobegin the important process of community engagement.  She said: \u0026ldquoWe are fully committed to a detailed programme of engagement with local communities throughout the lifetime of our developments.  \u0026ldquoFor large-scale development projects like this one at Letham Holdings, we are especially keen to fully engage as early as possible in the overall process to allow us to understand and consider the views from as many stakeholders as we can.  \u0026ldquoWe will hold a joint public consultation event during the next few months and we would like to take this opportunity to encourage all interested individuals to become involved.  \u0026ldquoThis event will allow the local community to share their views so that we may consider these as we develop our emerging development proposal in order to make a detailed planning application around October this year."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8064331.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"east-lothians-chief-nurse-takes-on-health-director-role","story":"  Alison Macdonald has been appointed to replace David Small, who left the post last month to take up a new role as director of primary care transition with NHS Lothian.

The 63-year-old passed away on March 2, having been minister at St Mary\u0026rsquos Parish Church for more than a decade.  Now her sister Susan Gibson, along with daughters Laura Burgess and Elaine Macrae, will be joined by nieces Clare Furze and Kara Wallace and granddaughters Ciara Burgess and Isla Burgess in the running-themed fundraisers.  Susan said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom the runner in the family and I have always done a fundraising event every year.  \u0026ldquoJennifer was a great supporter, she was not a runner herself but she would tease me about the time I had done at the event.  \u0026ldquoShe was a huge supporter and always contributed generously to what I was running for.  \u0026ldquoAfter she had the terminal diagnosis, one thing we talked about was that I would organise some kind of running thing for the family.  \u0026ldquoIt was her choice to go with Edinburgh Maggie\u0026rsquos Centre because she had such amazing support there.  The charity, which has been based in Edinburgh since 1996, offers support to people with cancer and their family and friends.  The centres offer not only practical advice about benefits and eating well but qualified experts provide emotional support and the centres offer a chance to meet people or simply sit quietly with a cup of tea.  Team Jenny, which includes seven-year-old Isla, will in varying combinations be clocking up nearly 200 kilometres of timed runs throughout the summer.  Originally, the plan was for the seven family members to take part together in the same event.  However, with the family spread out in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Coleraine, it proved impossible.  Instead they are taking on half a dozen different events before combining both the distance and fundraising totals together.  Elaine, 32, has already completed the Baker Hughes 10k in Aberdeen, while Kara, 28, and her husband, Duncan, will be joined by Clare, 32, Elaine and Susan at the Run the Blades event at Whitelee Wind Farm, near Eaglesham, this month.  Meanwhile in Portrush, Northern Ireland, Susan will join Laura, 36, together with her daughters Ciara, 13, and Isla, at the Portrush Park Run.  Clare, Elaine, Kara and Susan will all take part in the Great Aberdeen Run 10k next month before Susan\u0026rsquos attention turns to the Scottish 10k, which starts and finishes at Musselburgh Racecourse in September.  Finally, Elaine and Susan will take on the Great Scottish Run Half Marathon in Glasgow, with Laura\u0026rsquos husband Barry competing in the Belfast City Half Marathon in September.  The family set an initial fundraising target of \u0026pound1,000 before increasing that to \u0026pound3,000 but both have already been smashed, with nearly \u0026pound5,000 already raised.  Susan said: \u0026ldquoIt is amazing.  \u0026ldquoPeople are just so incredibly generous and I think that is a measure of Jennifer and Maggie\u0026rsquos and the affection and respect people have for Maggie\u0026rsquos.  \u0026ldquoWe are very fortunate it is a very close family.  \u0026ldquoJennifer was very caring, had a great sense of humour and she was honest.  \u0026ldquoYou could always depend on her \u0026ndash it might not be what you wanted to hear but what you needed to hear.  \u0026ldquoShe had that ability to be completely honest without ever being harsh or unkind.  \u0026ldquoShe was incredibly supportive of the family and everybody in it.

Mrs Reid, known as Kit, told how she exchanged early memories of her nursing career and the transition into the NHS with the royal guest.  She said: \u0026ldquoMy first pay was two pound notes and a 10 shilling note. The week before national health it was seven (shillings) and six (pence).  Mrs Reid, of Haddington worked as a nurse from 1946 until 1952 and spent some of her career at Edinburgh\u0026rsquos Royal Hospital for Sick Children. The grandmother of five, with triplets in Seattle and a grandson in Saskatchewan, Canada, and a further grandson at the University of Edinburgh, said: \u0026ldquoThe Duke was absolutely normal.  \u0026ldquoHe spoke to me and asked various things about the work I had done.  \u0026ldquoObviously he had been briefed because he asked me about the pay and for what felt like a long time he spoke to me.  \u0026ldquoHe was just so charming \u0026ndash it was the thrill of a lifetime, the whole thing.  \u0026ldquoI met so many wonderfully interesting people \u0026ndash people from Orkney and Shetland, from all over Scotland, with their own stories to tell.  \u0026ldquoIt was just absolutely wonderful \u0026ndash I even got to walk on a red carpet.  Mrs Reid said that the NHS had made a massive difference to the way of life across Scotland and said she was \u0026ldquoall for the NHS.  The 90-year-old, who also met Scotland\u0026rsquos new Health Secretary Jeane Freeman MSP, added: \u0026ldquoMy first memory of work was the knowledge that the hospital was getting much busier and there were more children coming in and going out cured. Before that, the parents couldn\u0026rsquot afford medical help and were leaving it too late for their children to come in and many of them didn\u0026rsquot make it.  \u0026ldquoAlso I remember saying to the sister I was working with at the time: \u0026lsquoThe parents coming in now have lost their terribly haunted look because they know now they can bring their children in.\u0026rsquo  She told how the nurses had to live on-site in those days and would therefore tend to give up work when they became married.

Eileen, 31, will return to the country where she was born as part of a team including Mercury-nominated artist, producer and collaborator Jon Hopkins and neuroscientist Mendel Kaelen, as well as photographers, architects and filmmakers.  Eileen said: \u0026ldquoAfter a 10-year solo adventure into the depths of the Legend of Tayos and my father\u0026rsquos work, it is a real honour to be joined in this quest to protect the caves by such an inspiring group of fellow explorers with a collective knowledge and talent beyond anything I could have imagined was possible.  \u0026ldquoI am excited to be part of the efforts to continue what my father and Neil Armstrong started back in the 1970s and have renewed hope in the efforts of protecting these precious, beautiful and fragile environments from devastating destruction.  The trip, which costs about $50,000, is an eight-day creative expedition and will result in experiences, observations and documentation transformed into an exhibition in 2020. It is hoped the exhibition will shine a light on a drive to make Cueva de los Tayos\u0026rsquo unique and endangered ecosystem a UNESCO World Heritage site.

The Einsatzgruppen were responsible for more than a million shooting massacres of civilians.  The effort comes 73 years after the war ended and as the youngest perpetrators of the Holocaust turn 90, underscoring the limited time left to find the remaining Nazi war criminals.  Though there are no precise counts, Nazi hunters estimate dozens who served in the Einsatzgruppen are still alive, along with as many as several thousand Nazis who committed war atrocities against civilians.  \"In a way, when the Nazis said that they would create a thousand-year empire, they weren\u0027t wrong. What they did will be felt for the next thousand years,\" said Rabbi Daniel Fabian of the Kahal Adass Jisroel synagogue in Berlin.  His grandmother survived in the Auschwitz concentration camp during the Holocaust, in which Nazis systematically murdered six million Jews and countless others.  \"For the 95-year-old men who are being tried, perhaps this is a distant memory,\" Fabian said. \"But for people like myself and my parents, it\u0027s still something that\u0027s very palpable.\"  Horrific scenes from Auschwitz and other death camps are prominent in history books and films, but little is taught about the brutal Einsatzgruppen shooting squads.  In the war\u0026rsquos early years, Nazi death squads tore through villages of the Soviet Union behind German troops, killing mass numbers of Jews and others before Adolf Hitler established concentration camps such as Birkenau and Auschwitz.  One of the most notorious incidents by the Einsatzgruppen was the two-day massacre in 1941 of more than 33,000 people, mostly Jews, at Babi Yar, a ravine near Kiev, Ukraine.  \"The camps liberated by the Western Allies, they\u0027re the iconic images of the Holocaust,\" Efraim Zuroff, the chief Nazi hunter at the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Jerusalem, said. \"But the truth of the matter is that the greatest horrors of the Holocaust are really the murders by shooting.\"  Allied forces tried and convicted a few dozen members of the Einsatzgruppen during the Nuremberg trials after the war, but only a handful of death squad members have been tried since then, Zuroff said. None has been brought to justice in the past 40 years.  German prosecutors initially targeted the death squad leaders instead of rank-and-file members because of the sheer number of those involved in the genocide. The strategy was logical, given the desire to bring prominent Nazis to justice, but the implications of ignoring those killers were troubling, Zuroff said.  \"People who were out there shooting and murdering innocent people ... day in, day out, were basically ignored,\" he said.  It\u0026rsquos difficult to prove whether suspected Einsatzgruppen members actually pulled the trigger because the killing squads were constantly on the move, said Jens Rommel, who heads the German federal prosecutors\u0027 office that investigates Nazi war crimes.  Rommel said that changed after groundbreaking cases in 2011 and 2015.  First was the conviction in 2011 of John Demjanjuk, a guard at the Sobibor extermination camp in Poland (who became an American citizen in the 1950s) for being an accessory to the murder of more than 28,000 Jews. Then in 2015, Oskar Gr\u0026oumlning, a junior squad leader at Auschwitz, was convicted as an accessory to 300,000 murders.  Those convictions gave prosecutors a legal precedent to go after suspected Einsatzgruppen members, because they could indict low-level abettors of atrocities just by proving the men were active Nazis at the time.  That\u0027s when Zuroff got to work. Combing through archives, he compiled a list of 79 members of the killing squads likely to still be alive.  Zuroff\u0027s work led German authorities to look into three suspects in the cities of Braunschweig, Celle and Kassel, though no formal charges have yet been filed, according to Rommel.  The three men, ages 94 to 96, have been widely identified in the German news media, but prosecutors declined to identify the suspects, citing privacy laws.  \"Finding these people has been one of the most satisfying results of my work over the years,\" said Zuroff, who has hunted Nazis since the 1970s. \"When they\u0027re brought to justice, there will be no person happier than me.\"  Despite the difficulties of bringing such individuals to justice, the final-hour effort is welcomed by victims of the Nazis, as well as Germany\u0027s Jewish community. \"Even if these perpetrators are already very old today, it\u0027s a gesture of latent justice,\" said Josef Schuster, president of the Central Council of Jews in Germany.  With that gesture, Rabbi Fabian said, the arduous process of forcing the German nation \u0026ndash and the world \u0026ndash to atone for the Holocaust has found new energy.  \"It brings uncomfortable memories back to the surface,\" he said. \"But in order to come to terms with the horrors of the past, it\u0027s both necessary and important.\""},{"url":null,"title":"standards-breach-complaint-to-prime-minister-after-top-civil-servant-sent-to-tory-mps-political-meeting","story":"  UK Government civil servants are not permitted to participate in political meetings, but SNP MP Deidre Brock claims an event set up by Luke Graham to debate how millions of pounds of public money should be dished out falls into this category \u0026ndash and that it was also in opposition to the official body.  Graham set up the Clackmannanshire Investment Forum (CIF) to discuss how to spend \u0026pound8 million of the \u0026pound90m of UK and Scottish Government money provided as part of the Stirling and Clackmannanshire City Region Deal.  However, the Clackmannanshire Commission \u0026ndash overseen by the local authority \u0026ndash has responsibility for identifying and developing projects which will receive funding in Graham\u0026rsquos constituency of Ochil and South Perthshire.  Graham MP boasted that \u0026ldquoUK Government civil servants from the Scotland Office will attend his CIF meetings, and it is understood one of the most senior civil servant from David Mundell\u0026rsquos Government department was at the first CIF meeting held in Alloa Town Hall last week.  Brock, the MP for Edinburgh North and Leith, has written to Prime Minister Theresa May to complain. She said: \u0026ldquoIt is clear that the organisation set up by the Member for Ochil and South Perthshire \u0026ndash a Conservative backbencher \u0026ndash is a party political organisation set up in opposition to the usual official consultation carried out by the council.  \u0026ldquoIt is also clear that the Secretary of State has asked his officials to take part in these meetings which are clearly party political rather than an exercise in governance. Mundell told a recent meeting of the Scottish Affairs Select Committee that he is \u0026ldquovery open to allowing civil servants to \u0026ldquoengage with MPs directly.  When Brock asked if that extended to \u0026ldquopotentially party political promotions, Mundell said: \u0026ldquoI don\u0026rsquot think that is in any way an accurate characterisation.  The leader of Clackmannanshire Council, Ellen Forson, has also complained to Mundell that Graham\u0026rsquos CIF meeting is \u0026ldquoextremely confusing to locals who, she claims, may have been \u0026ldquomisled. She added: \u0026ldquoIt was my understanding, as with every other City Deal, that it was for the local authority to determine governance structures for the area and this seems to fly in the face of that.  Mundell accepted that \u0026ldquoit will ultimately be for the council to submit proposals to Government but he added that \u0026ldquoI hope that Luke\u0026rsquos Forum will help to generate some ideas and that you will give these some consideration through the work of the Clackmannanshire Commission.  A spokeswoman for Graham confirmed that Mundell\u0026rsquos deputy, Lord Ian Duncan, was at the MP\u0026rsquos meeting along with civil servant Neil MacLennan, the head of City Deals and Local Government at the Scotland Office.  Graham was not available for interview. A spokeswoman supplied a prepared statement in Graham\u0026rsquos name which accused the SNP of \u0026ldquotrying to make this overtly political. It added: \u0026ldquoI have fought for the additional investment from the UK Government directly with the Treasury and will continue to stand up for my constituency by looking for long-term opportunities. To this end, I will work with all parties to ensure its success but will not be bullied by the SNP.  A UK Government spokeswoman said: \u0026ldquo The UK Government is investing \u0026pound45m in the Stirling and Clackmannanshire Deal, and it is right that UK Government ministers and officials work closely with local partners to turn proposals into reality."},{"url":null,"title":"10-of-the-most-unusual-shows-to-see-at-the-edinburgh-fringe-festival","story":"  But as the race for ticket sales gets under way, how do you choose what to see?  Never fear ... Sunday Herald writer Kirsty Fraser has been trawling through the schedules to find 10 gems hidden among the thousands of shows on offer. From rapping care workers to synchronised swimming on dry land, these shows are her guide to the strange and surprising treats on offer at the Fringe.  \u0026ldquoWho cares?  by Jane Westhead  Where: Natural Food Kafe, Clerk Street  When: August 4-12, 14-20, 22-25 @ 13:10  Duration: 1 hour  Age: 8+  Price: Free  To kick this list off, we have the ultimate one-woman show. Meet Tracy, the hard-working mobile care worker, and meet her completely random alter-ego \u0026ndash Rapper Tray-Z. In the basement of an Edinburgh Caf\u0026eacute, Tray-Z raps and rhymes her way through this one-woman show about life as a care worker. It\u0026rsquos fair to say that the soft tones you expect from a care worker are not to be heard in this performance.  You will also meet Jack, Maureen, Lily and Daisy who already seem to have had their hips popped and locked from their younger years. But ultimately, who cares? Does Tracy care, does Tray-Z care? Well, I only care because this is a one-woman rap show that is completely FREE!  \u0026ldquoJapan Marvelous Drummers  by NPO Japan Marvelous.  Where: Assembly George Square  When: August 4-7, 9-16, 18-27 @ 13:15  Duration 1 hour  Age: 3+  Price: \u0026pound13/14  Hear that big booming? No? Me neither, but you certainly will at the Fringe because the Japan Marvelous Drummers are in town. With not a bagpipe in site, this performance allows you to escape from the busy streets of Edinburgh and immerse yourself in Japanese musical culture.  I\u0026rsquod normally say sit back and relax, but the banging of the drums will probably keep the audience on their toes throughout this spectacle. Bamboo flutes and Koto Harps fly around as dancers move gracefully across the stage. Ditch the tartan and enter an entirely new culture. Really, it\u0026rsquos hard to miss a beat with these talented drummers.  \u0026ldquoAh Dinnae Ken  by STAG  Where: TheSpace on Niddry Street, Upper Theatre  When: August 3-4, 6-11, 13-18 @ 16:15  Duration: 50 minutes  Age: 12+  Price: \u0026pound7/8  Romeo and Juliet meets future Scottish Independence Referendum in Ah Dinnae Ken. Basically, you fancy the guy next door but your parents become too involved. We\u0026rsquove all been there, but perhaps not because your parents wanted to kill the neighbours for voting no\u0026hellip  This show has the audiences seated on all four sides of the stage, but don\u0026rsquot worry, you won\u0026rsquot be divided by whether you vote Yes or No. It really doesn\u0026rsquot matter, just be ready to watch an absurd amount of costume changes with this double-casted farcical show. Shamelessly Scottish, Ah Dinnae Ken is an unusual political gem.  \u0026ldquoMonski Mouse\u0026rsquos Baby Disco Dance Hall  by Monski Mouse Media  Where: George Garden Square  When: August 3-5, 10-12, 17-19, 24-26 @ 11:00  Duration: 1 hour  Age: 0+  Price: \u0026pound7.50  This dance experience is on the list because it unintentionally, yet whole-heartedly, encourages the ultimate dance style out there \u0026ndash dad-dancing! Monski Mouse\u0026rsquos Baby Disco Dance Hall is the opportunity to show the young ones how partying is done. Parents bring their kids who are yet too young to be embarrassed, and dance away to pop tunes and funky nursery rhymes.  Admittedly there is no booze to get you through, but partying with your whole family and with the bonus of escaping a hangover is right up my street! Full of fun and silliness, this dance session will leave you dancing down the Royal Mile.  \u0026ldquoSynchronised Swimming \u0026ndash The Dry Version  by Ursus and Nadeschkin in association with Aurora Nova.  Where: Assembly Rooms \u0026ndash The Blue Room  When: August 2-12, 14-19, 21-25 @18:00.  Duration: 1 hour  Age: 12+  Price: \u0026pound10/12  Leave your flippers and nose clip behind and experience synchronised swimming ... on dry land. Yes, you heard right \u0026ndash there is strictly no water to be found in this synchronised swimming performance. Graceful movements and precise choreography doesn\u0026rsquot quite come to mind when presented with comical Swiss duo Ursus and Nadeschkin. Images of crashing and splashing seem far more likely, as this duo show audiences how this absurd not-dry-land-but-on-dry-land-sport is achieved. If this sounds on your wavelength, then you can dive right into this crazy show throughout the entirety of the Fringe \u0026ndash goggles are not required.  \u0026ldquoAccordion Fight Show  by Strangely  Where: Sweet Grassmarket  When: August 22-26 @ 23:00  Duration: 1 hour  Ages: 18+  Prize: \u0026pound5.  When I think of an accordion player, I imagine traditional Scottish music being played in the corner of a charming wee pub by one of the locals. I don\u0026rsquot think of an insanely daring fight show with a folk-punk accordion player who is completely naked. Yet, that is what musician Strangely presents in his late-night show Accordion Fight Show. He invites adults only to witness this outrageous hour of him and his accordion. There are sing-alongs, questionable stories and the chance to partake in a battle with Strangely to win some, probably very budget, prizes. Nonetheless, a naked accordion player is exactly what was missing from this unusual list of shows.  Alice Hawkins \u0026ndash Suffragette  by Peter Barratt  Where: The Helen Duncan Room  When: August 13 \u0026ndash 17 @16:00  Duration: 55 minutes  Age: 8+  Price: \u0026pound7/8  For a change of scenery from the gags and frills of the Fringe, I recommend Alice Hawkins \u0026ndash Suffragette. A century on from The Representation of the People Act 1918, this show retells the story of suffragette Alice Hawkins in a passionate spoken-word performance by her great-grandson Peter Barratt.  He gives a moving and poignant account of Alice\u0027s campaign with readings from her own notes from during her time as a political prisoner. Despite being a historical piece, this is current and relevant to an important conversation happening in the world today, and it is made that more significant in this 100th year of women having the vote.  \u0026ldquoRay Bradshaw: Deaf Comedy Fam  by Ray Bradshaw  Where: Gilded Balloon Teviot \u0026ndash Sportsman  When: August 16-22 @ 16:15  Duration: 1 hour  Age: 12+  Price: \u0026pound10/11  With so many comedians at the Fringe it is impossible to know where to start, but Ray Bradshaw provides a show which is, truly, one of a kind. It is the first ever stand up show where the comedian speaks and signs simultaneously. Now, we all have numerous stories we could tell about growing up and the painful embarrassment that our parents inflicted on us, but how different are these stories from Bradshaw\u0026rsquos, who grew up with two profoundly deaf parents? To start with, the stories are far more hilarious than you might expect. This hysterical multilingual show \u0026ndash sign language is actually Ray\u0027s first language \u0026ndash is an unusual but humorous find at this year\u0026rsquos Fringe.  \u0026ldquoComfort Food Cabaret  by Michelle Pearson Music in association with Made in Adelaide.

Do you ever get peckish throughout a show, or have to experience that awkwardly loud unwrapping of a tiny wee sweet and feel the angry eyes from people around you? Comfort Food Cabaret is a show that rids you of that shame, because it requires you to eat throughout the performance \u0026ndash perfect!  This show mixes cabaret and cooking as Australian Singer Michelle Pearson cooks the audience a three-course meal during her award-winning show. Pearson leaves you fully satisfied with performances of jazz, pop and rock as you discover the meanings behind your three delicious courses. This is undoubtedly a brilliant two-for-one at the festival this year, and is exactly what I want from a show.  \u0026ldquoUniverSoul Circus: Hip Hop Under the Big Top  by UniverSoul Circus  Where: Underbelly\u0026rsquos Circus Hub on the Meadows  When: August 4-25 @17:00  Duration: 1 hour  Age: 5+  Price: \u0026pound19.50/\u0026pound21.50  Finally, we have an incredible circus spectacle. Making their UK debut, American hit circus show Hip Hop Under the Big Top have come to Edinburgh to showcase their circus of international talent and skill. At the very least you can expect to see Caribbean limbo fire-dancing, high-wire walking and mindboggling contortionists, not forgetting the hilarious slapstick comedians and stunning soundtrack.  I agree, that already seems like a lot to take in, but this show presents some of this most unusual and crazy sights at this year\u0026rsquos Fringe, all under the one roof, or rather, circus tent.  FIVE FRINGE HOT PROPERTIES  Hot Brown Honey  By Gilded Balloon and Briefs Factory  Where: Gilded Balloon Teviot  When: Aug 3-7, 9-14, 16-22, 24-27 @19:30  Duration: 1 hour 10 mins  Age: 16+  Price: \u0026pound15.50/ \u0026pound16.50  The world-renowned Hot Brown Honey are returning this year with their outrageous cabaret show. Prepare for the heat to rise in Edinburgh with this sass-filled sensation. A carnival style party, this show has audiences laughing, gasping and dancing the whole night away.  Gary Delaney: Gagster\u0026rsquos Paradise  By CKP, Impatient and InterTalent Group  Where: Pleasance Courtyard  When: Aug 2-11 @21:20  Duration: 1 hour  Age: 16+  Price: \u0026pound13/14  Mock the Week star Gary Delaney hits the fringe with his one-liner gags to present his greatest stand-up show yet. His risky humour will have audiences roaring in disbelief, but his charming cheeky manner gets him away with every punchline.  DICK vs DOM  By Brett Vincent for Get Comedy  Where: Underbelly, Bistro Square  When: Aug 1-12 @13:00  Duration: 1 hour  Age 5+  Price: \u0026pound12.50/\u0026pound14.50  Children TV legends Dick and Dom are making their way to Edinburgh for their Fringe debut. The multi BAFTA-winners bring their newly toured show which is sure to feature mess, songs, and the infamous game of \u0026ldquoBogies. An interactive show that the whole family can enjoy.  Trainspotting  By Kings Head and In Your Face present by James Seabright  Where: The Tunnel, Venue 150 at EICC  When: Aug 2-7, 9-14, 16-21, 23-27 @18:00/19:45  Duration: 1 hour 15 minutes  Age: 16+  Price: \u0026pound17.50/19  Trainspotting is the must-see production for any Fringe goer. In a tunnel beneath Edinburgh\u0026rsquos streets, audiences will experience an intense immersive adaption of Irvine Welsh\u0026rsquos classic. Having sold-out for the past three years, this is definitely one to book in advance. Expect a grimy whirlwind of a show, with a visit to the unforgettable \"worst toilet in Scotland\".  Prom Kween  By Aine Flanagan Productions in association with Harlow Playhouse  Where: Assembly George Square Gardens \u0026ndash Piccolo  When: Aug 2-12, 14-26 @21:05  Duration: 1 hour  Age: 12+  Price: \u0026pound13/14  Strutting straight back into the Fringe with an absurd amount of glitter is the musical comedy Prom Kween.

This week Citizens Advice Scotland published research highlighting a number of areas where improvements are needed to ensure that businesses can maximise their full potential.  We found that postal services are indispensable to Scottish SMEs, with 72% describing the Post Office as very or fairly important to their business. This is particularly true for those in rural areas, who often depend on the Post Office for banking and financial services as well as deliveries.  With the on-going closure of bank branches across Scotland this will become even more important in the future, making it vital that the Post Office network is maintained across Scotland.  We have written in this column before about the high cost of parcel delivery charges for Scottish consumers, and our new research highlights the issue is huge for business as well. One in four SMEs reported being asked to pay an additional delivery surcharge due to their location and almost half of those who have experienced this problem said it happens regularly. One in five also reported delivery delays due to their location.  Businesses need reliable and affordable delivery systems to operate competitively, so we will continue to work with ministers and delivery companies to find solutions to this problem. Location should not be a detriment to successful business activity.  But postal services were not the only challenge that our research identified. There is also digital connectivity. One third of SMEs told us that broadband in their area is variable or poor, and this rises to 45% for those based in remote rural areas.  We know that geography and population distribution in Scotland have been used in the past as explanations for poor broadband service, but in 2018 these excuses seem increasingly outdated. It is past time that good quality broadband was available for everyone in Scotland, regardless of location.  There is no doubt that Scottish businesses are disadvantaged by limited access to reliable broadband, location-based delivery surcharges and delayed deliveries. This is a real consumer detriment that affects the ability of our economy to operate effectively, particularly in rural areas.  We would look to both the UK and Scottish governments to use the powers and influence they have to address this important issue. We will continue to engage with both to solve these problems for businesses and consumers.  Kristin Hartman is policy officer at Citizens Advice Scotland.

It\u0027s all Remoaner fantasies and Brussels scaremongering to try to get Britain to submit to the heel of the European Court of Justice and cough up the \u0026pound40 billion divorce bill. Except that this scaremongering isn\u0027t coming from Brussels, but from the British civil service whose job it is make contingencies. And they are right to do so. A no-deal Brexit is looking more and more likely, following the effective demise of Theresa May\u0026rsquos compromise White Paper last week.  Her attempt to remain in the EU regulatory environment by adopting a \u0026ldquocommon rule book \u0026ndash in other words, agreeing to replicate all the terms of our current membership while not actually being a member of the EU \u0026ndash pleased no one. It was condemned as \u0026ldquovassalage by Boris Johnson in his resignation speech, and a \u0026ldquonational humiliation even by pro-Europeans like the former Labour EU Commissioner, Lord Mandelson. The trade bills scraped through parliament last week on the back of a handful of rebel Labour MPs and the indolence of the current and former Liberal Democrat leaders who failed to show for a crucial vote on Monday. But amendments from hard Brexiteers have made May\u0026rsquos White Paper unworkable.  The Scottish Government hasn\u0027t commented on the no deal preparations, but it, too, will have to think the unthinkable. This week the Supreme Court will rule on whether the Scottish parliament had the right to pass a Continuity Bill, seeking to retain control over devolved powers like food, fishing and environment repatriated from Brussels. But this has been comprehensively overtaken by events. The Scottish Parliament was reduced to the status of a parish council last week by legislation that ran roughshod over Holyrood\u0027s legal right to withhold consent if it disagrees with aspects of the new trade agreements. No Sewel convention is going to prevent Scotland disappearing down the Brexit sink hole.  Now, when people talk of a no-deal Brexit they usually mean something like Britain \u0026ldquoreverting to World Trade Organisation terms, or a Canada-style free trade agreement. Wrong. No deal means no deal \u0026ndash it means no trade agreement, no two-year transition period in which things remain largely as they do today. No rights to travel in Europe for work or leisure without a visa, no common standards for medicines, nuclear material or air safety. Everyone will do their best to prevent relations with Europe breaking down completely, and people being hurt \u0026ndash but accidents can happen.  A no deal would be Britain\u0026rsquos biggest economic dislocation since the Second World War. Even a bog standard, free trade deal has to be negotiated and the one struck last week between the EU and Japan took eight years. And even when we have one, it will not be anything like Britain\u0027s current \u0026ldquofriction-free access to the customs union and the single market. There will be tariffs of 10 per cent on cars (so goodbye Nissan and Honda) and 15 per cent on average on food. But much worse will be all the non-tariff barriers to trade: like sanitary and \u0026ldquophytosanitary\" regulations [protective measures against contaminants] which could make much produce unsellable. Service industries, which make up 80 per cent of the British economy will find that they are not automatically authorised to trade in the EU. Banks and financial services will lose their \u0026ldquopassporting rights \u0026ndash though many have already jumped ship.  There will be a hard border in Ireland, or the Irish Sea, because there has to be one, despite what Theresa May said in Ireland last week. No dealers, like the Tory MP John Redwood, insist this is not necessary. \u0026ldquoWe don\u0027t want to set up any borders he says.  This is a new dimension in post-truth politics verging on the theatre of the absurd. The whole point about Brexit was to set up borders \u0026ndash that is what leaving the European Union means. And the UK\u0027s only land border with Europe runs right through the Emerald Isle. It\u0026rsquos 500 km long and has 300-odd crossing points. Moreover the Good Friday Agreement requires regulatory harmonisation north and south. Brexiteers seem to believe that everything will just continue as it does now, and that all those multilateral agreements Britain has entered into over the last 40 years will somehow still apply even as we leave the EU.  Right wing economists like Professor Patrick Minford insist that Britain will be so efficient, freed from Brussels red tape, and so low cost, that we we\u0026rsquoll still be able to flood their markets with our cheap goods and services. But that kind of Vietnamisation of the UK economy is not something that British people are quite prepared for. Brexiteers expect the \u0026ldquoanglosphere \u0026ndash the Commonwealth plus America \u0026ndash to give preferential terms to the UK. But countries like Canada and India are all much more interested in trade deals with the EU, not their former imperial master.  Remain-voting Scotland has been watching the slide to a no deal Brexit with mounting alarm. There was chaos in Westminster last week, as pairing arrangements were abandoned, Tory anti-Brexit rebels were threatened, and a clutch of die-hard pro-Brexit Labour MPs saved the day for Theresa May. It felt like being chained to a lunatic. Every constituency in Scotland voted to remain and the consequences of a no-deal Brexit for Scotland will be dire.  But not nearly as dire as it will be for the future of the United Kingdom.  Descent into no-deal chaos, or even the imminent threat of such, will surely lead to the collapse of the UK Government. Theresa May has been a \u0026ldquodead woman walking, to use the former Chancellor\u0026rsquos phrase, for over a year, and now she isn\u0026rsquot even doing that. With parliament deadlocked, and both the major UK parties opposed to a repeat referendum on Brexit, her departure should mean a General Election, as the Tory party spirals into a state of civil war.  In any General Election against the background of a no deal Brexit we can expect the SNP to return another super-landslide even greater than in 2015. Labour will be condemned for failing to defend the Scottish Parliament\u0027s powers, and for Jeremy Corbyn\u0027s refusal even to contemplate a soft Brexit solution involving continued membership of the customs union and single market. The Scottish Tory revival is already stone dead, and the Liberal Democrats are irrelevant. Scots will vote with fury for the party that has consistently opposed Brexit: the SNP. That could mean curtains for the Union, as Scots realise that they made a mistake in 2014. The Tory right better believe it: no deal means no more UK."},{"url":null,"title":"north-korea-the-history-the-fact-and-the-fiction","story":"  The US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un ratcheted up the tension over nuclear weapons in volleys of words and Tweets, with Trump calling his adversary \"rocket man\" and vowing that if there were any more threats against the United States they would \"be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen\", while Kim responded by calling the President a \"mentally deranged US dotard\". Before it ended in mutual love fest at the Singapore summit last month.  But what it also did was to partially lift the curtain \u0026ndash an iron curtain, in Churchill\u0027s famous description \u0026ndash which had closed North Korea to the west for more than half a century. There are now limited tours, arranged by politically-approved travel agencies, although in the words of one source, \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom not suggesting that it\u0026rsquos risk free \u0026ndash it\u0026rsquos not Cornwall. But people who go to North Korea already know that.  The country has a history of being a pawn in someone else\u0027s savage, political game. North and south had been ruled by Japan, and fought over, until the ending of the Second World War in 1945 when the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki forced the Japanese to surrender. The Soviet Red Army quickly occupied the northern part of the country, halting at the 38th parallel and waiting for three weeks so that US forces in the south could reach them. Thus was Korea divided by the allies.  The US General John R Hodge became the military governor in the south and, like Mountbatten did in Vietnam, attempted to restore Japanese colonial administrators, then quickly reversed the decision in the face of waves of protest. The Republic of South Korea was formed in 1948, with the Soviet Union setting up a communist government under Kim Il-sung in the north.  Kim had been leader of the Workers\u0026rsquo Party of Korea but became Supreme Leader of North Korea, a position he held for more than 48 years until his death in July 1994. Kim supported the communists over the border in China in their civil war with the nationalists, sending thousands of fighters and supplies. With Mao Zedong\u0026rsquos victory up to 70,000 Korean veterans were sent back to their own country with gratitude and their weapons, and it was they who formed the spearhead of the attack by the north on the south in April 1950.  The Soviet president Josef Stalin had given the nod to it, although Red Army forces would not openly take part in the combat, on condition that Mao would send reinforcements if needed. At dawn on Sunday June 25 1950 the Korean People\u0026rsquos Army crossed the 38th parallel, shielded by artillery fire. South Korean forces were routed in hours, and the north\u0026rsquos armies marched on the capital Seoul.  Syngman Rhee, the South Korean president fled, but not before he had order the blowing up of the Hangang Bridge across the Han River in an attempt to stop the advance \u0026ndash killing hundreds of fleeing refugees \u0026ndash and then the massacre of his political opponents.  Within five days South Korean forces had been decimated, from 95,000 men down to less than 22,000, which is when US forces, under the United Nations banner, arrived to bolster them.  In October 1950, after the UN forces, including British soldiers, had beaten back the onslaught and even crossed into the north, Mao ordered 200,000 Chinese troops to be secretly deployed in Korea. In one of the greatest military manoeuvres in history they marched \u0026ldquodark to dark, only travelling in daytime and under aerial camouflage, remaining motionless if an aircraft sound was heard, amazingly escaping detection. In 19 days a three-division army marched almost 300 miles undetected, while another division marched at night along a circuitous mountain route averaging 18 miles a day.  The proxy war between communism and capitalism began in the Cold War and raged and abated for almost three years. The armistice which finally ended hostilities was signed on July 27, 1953 by which time, according to recent analysis, more 1.2 million had died on both sides. The US has admitted to 33,686 of its men killed in the hostilities.  Recovery in the north was quick, aided by support from China and the USSR and, later, with Japan as relations improved. By 1957 industrial production had reached 1949 levels and the economy was outstripping the south, and through the 1960s economic growth was higher than in the the south. But by the 1980s it had stagnated and then started its long decline in 1987, almost totally collapsing with the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 and the complete cessation of Russian aid. The other ally, China, was unable to provide enough food aid to meet demand  Differences had by then emerged between North Korea and its mentor the Soviet Union, central to these was Kim\u0026rsquos philosophy of Juche, which focused on nationalism and self-reliance, technically not communism but a homegrown version of it, which included collectivisation and the banning of private enterprise.  The demise of the Soviet Union and loss of economic aid had a dramatic and drastic effect on the north\u0026rsquos economy, exacerbated by floods and droughts, all of which led to widespread famine between 1994 and 1998. Estimates of the number of people who died vary widely, but as many as 3.5 million of a population of 22m may have perished.  The closed, collective economy imposed by Kim meant that foreign trade was not an option and as the famine took hold there was a huge rise in the number of illegal private markets springing up. Smuggling across the border boomed and up to 250,000 North Koreans may have moved to China. The famine also led to widespread government corruption, also undermining controls and regulation from Pyongyang. North Koreans developed their own black markets and becoming less reliant on the state and began to distrust Kim and the ruling family more. This has been described as \u0026ldquothe natural death of North Korean Stalinism.  Kim Il-sung, the \u0026ldquoGreat Leader \u0026ndash later to be dubbed the \u0026ldquoEternal Leader \u0026ndash died of a heart attack in 1994 but had been ill for some time before, with his eldest son Kim Jong-il holding, then taking, the reins of power. The second Kim was known as \u0026ldquoDear Leader and the \u0026ldquoGreat General.  North Korea\u0026rsquos governance and succession is akin to a royal family \u0026ndash or alternatively, so far the first and only communist dynasty \u0026ndashand is based on strong and absolute leadership, known as Suryong.  According to a 2004 Human Rights Watch report, the North Korean regime under Kim was \"among the world\u0027s most repressive governments\", having up to 200,000 political prisoners according to US and South Korean officials claims with no freedom of the press or religion, political opposition or equality of education.  Kim had a fear of flying (or perhaps being blown up in the air) and travelled by a private armoured train on visits to Russia and China. It was reported that on the journey he had live lobsters delivered to him each day which he ate with silver chopsticks. He was also a huge fan of movies made in the West, from Rambo to James Bond and all the explosions in between. It may be fanciful, or a judgment based on his bouffant hairstyle, but he was also said to be a huge Elvis Presley fan  Kim had four partners and at least five children with three of them. His third son, Kim Jong-un, was nominated to succeed him. The senior Kim died in December 2011, either of a heart attack on a train outside Pyongyang, or, in another account, in a fit of rage at construction faults at a crucial power plant.  Since the 1950s the country had been trying to develop a nuclear capability. In 1963 the USSR supplied a nuclear reactor, with North Korea going on to develop its own reactors. In 1958 it had asked both Russia and China to help develop a nuclear weapons programme, which both countries refused, although Russia did provide the initial reactor and also undertook to train nuclear scientists.  This developed into the clandestine weapons programme, leading to tests in 2006 and 2009. It\u0026rsquos believed that by 2009 North Korea had up to 10 functional nuclear warheads. A third nuclear test took place in February 2013, with the warhead estimation increasing to 30.  Kim lll has also developed and pioneered the country\u0026rsquos own short and long-range ballistic missiles. In November last year the country launched an inter-continental ballistic missile which it was claimed could reach the USA.  In June, after a summit in Singapore between Kim and President Donald Trump, there was an apparent agreement that North Korea would get rid of its nuclear weapons within a year. Then just last Wednesday Trump tweeted, \"Russia has agreed to help with North Korea, where relationships with us are very good and the process is moving along. There is no rush, the sanctions remain! Big benefits and exciting future for North Korea at end of process!\"  Ten things you didn\u0026rsquot know about North Korea.  1. It\u0026rsquos year 106, not 2018 in North Korea. The calendar is based n Kim Il-sung\u0026rsquos date of birth, April 15 1912.  2. The Rungnado May Day stadium in Pyongyang is the biggest in the world, with more than 150,000 seats.  3. In the 1990s all teachers were required to learn to play the accordion. The rumbling sound is Jimmy Shand applauding from the hearafter.  4. Kim Jong-Il\u0026rsquos body is preserved in a glass tomb in Pyongyang and is the country\u0026rsquos top tourist attraction.  5. North Korea only has three TV channels, two of which are only on at the weekends. The other broadcasts in the evenings only, hence the flood of imported South Korean soap operas  6. Students has to pay for everything except the teachers, and including chairs and desks  7. In the past the country used human faeces for fertiliser, due to lack of resources  8. Marijuana is not illegal and can be bought in markets  9. It has the largest military in the world with almost eight million active, reserved and paramilitary. The country\u0026rsquos population is 24m.  10. North Korean women have 28 sanctioned haircut designs, men just 10."},{"url":null,"title":"the-dirty-diary-pay-attention-you-stupid-boy","story":"  The BBC and the UK Government conspired last week in an epic sting on the SNP Government, appropriately orchestrated by the tarantula-keeping defence minister Gavin Williamson. It was announced in a blaze of publicity \u0026ndash and breathlessly by BBC Scotland\u0026rsquos fresh-faced Private Pike, Nick Eardley \u0026ndash that squaddies in Scotland, who were having to pay more tax because they were based here, would get the money back. And that this would cost the public purse around \u0026pound4 million a year. If it wasn\u0026rsquot such a discredited clich\u0026eacute I\u0026rsquod call it fake news.  This was all kicked off by football referee and Tory MP Douglas Ross who argued that changes to the income tax threshold where soldiers in Scotland begin to pay more than their English compatriots was \u0026pound24,000 a year. It isn\u0026rsquot. While the tax rate does go up from from 20 per cent to 21 per cent the actual amount payable does not, through a combination of an increase in personal allowance and a drop in the lower tax rate to 19 per cent. It\u0026rsquos at around \u0026pound32,000 that the increase comes in. Those earning below \u0026pound24k (and granted there aren\u0026rsquot many) pay less tax here.  There are 9,970 military personnel in Scotland and, according to Williamson, 70 per cent will be affected which, if you accept his gross figure, means the average refund will be just over \u0026pound570 year. If so there must be a huge number of the top brass earning bucketloads because you\u0026rsquod have to earn well over \u0026pound50,000 to be hit by that amount of tax.  Then there are all of the other benefits that they receive, like cheaper council tax, subsidised meals as well as free prescriptions, education, childcare provision and other welfare benefits they don\u0027t get in England. Eardley and Williamson, you\u0027re dismissed.  THE GREAT COMMONS COVER-UP  In yet another vote for opacity the House of Commons agreed during the week not to publish the names of MPs who are being investigated by parliament\u0026rsquos sleaze watchdog. Within minutes the cover-up began and the two names on the outstanding list were removed from the website of the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards. Seventy-nine MPs, most of them Tory, voted for anonymity, a majority of 57 \u0026ndash which is also a damning judgment on the lack of interest, or attendance, by our elected members. This was passed despite the chair of the Committee on Standards, Sir Kevin Barron, opposing it, together with all of the seven lay members who concluded, \u0026ldquoAny proposals to limit this approach [transparency] would be a detrimental step in continuing to build the credibility of the reputation of the House. Quite.  For the record the two MPs under investigation are the oleaginous Keith Vaz, Labour MP for Leicester East, and Tory Robert Courts, who inherited the ultra-safe seat of Witney, which David Cameron sloughed off last year. Vaz has been under investigation for two years for allegedly bringing the House into contempt. This relates to his involvement with male prostitutes and his filmed discussion about buying cocaine with a rent boy. Vaz subsequently issued a public apology. The parliamentary investigation was on hold until March this year due to some unknown medical condition Vaz was suffering from, which didn\u0026rsquot stop him from visiting Saudi Arabia and India. Courts alleged misdemeanour is considerably less serious. He\u0026rsquos accused of using his office stationary for political purposes, which he denies.  IT\u0027S CHRISTMAS IN JULY  The world\u0026rsquos oldest amusement park is a fitting venue for the annual World Santa Claus Congress, which opens tomorrow at Brakken outside of Copenhagen. It\u0026rsquos billed as \u0026ldquoChristmas in July and more than a 100 authorised Santas from across the globe will be meeting to discuss issues relating to their work, ho, ho, ho!. Which opens a veritable sack of questions. Just who authorises them? Is there a greater Santa power? Do they discuss what to do about Rudolph and that flaming proboscis? Do they bring presents for each other? Do they have a slimming plan for accessing those ever-narrowing chimneys? Or is it rather more serious, like the criminal charged to avoid when sitting a child on your lap? Whatever the urgent questions for Santadom it will take three days to answer them. All attendees must wear uniform including stick-on beards if they don\u0027t have natural ones, not drink or smoke while in uniform and they can\u0026rsquot carry any advertising on their gowns even for toy shops or Sanatogen. There\u0026rsquos a different dress code for elves apparently. Santas will also get a free parking codes, for the sleighs I assume, elves will have to lump it.  WOLFMAN DAVE  I hadn\u0026rsquot heard of the Glasgow-born photographer David Yarrow until last week when two of his prints of grizzled Montana mountain men, barmaids and the obligatory wolf sold for \u0026pound140,000, the proceeds to Sir Tom Hunter\u0026rsquos charity. Yarrow has raised more than $1m for good causes through the sale of his works. He specialises in wildlife photography, following Robert Capa\u0026rsquos mantra that if your pictures aren\u0026rsquot good enough then you aren\u0026rsquot close enough. One of his techniques, with a remote-controlled camera, is to smear the body \u0026ndash the camera that is \u0026ndash in scent to attract the animals. Here at Herald Towers we stick to the tried and tested method of 70-proof spirit. Yarrow is the son of Eric, who used to run the family business, building large ships on the Clyde. The boy also dated Elizabeth Hurley. That\u0026rsquos quite enough about him.  YOU\u0027LL HAVE HAD YOUR HUMOUR  I don\u0026rsquot know who the New Town Flaneur is on Twitter but he\u0026rsquos hilarious. His shtick is about Edinburgh New Town residents, often in red trews, who are fighting to preserve their exclusivity and sense of entitlement against the incursions of the dastardly and d\u0026eacuteclass\u0026eacute Fifers. Who\u0026rsquod have thought someone from Edinburgh had a sense of humour?  WIKIPEDIA HEALTH WARNING  I have pointed out before on how easy it is to alter profiles or create fake ones on Wikipedia. Take the case of Tinotenda Chibharo who allegedly plays for FC Sloboda Uzice in the Serbian First Division. I say allegedly because not much about this Zimbabwean-born player is true, if he even exists. He is said to be the youngest of a family of 11 and was brought to England by Manchester City where he captained the Under-21 side. Except he didn\u0026rsquot. Nor is it true that because he couldn\u0026rsquot make the first team there he came to Scotland to play for Ranjurs \u0026ndash presumably Rangers \u0026ndash and then to Kilmarnock, where not only was he a regular but also holds the club\u0026rsquos scoring record with 154 goals. He didn\u0026rsquot and he doesn\u0026rsquot. It\u0027s all made up. This is all quite amusing but it also underlines the health warning about Wiki and how easy it is to manipulate."},{"url":null,"title":"the-editors-decision-is-temporary","story":"  Or when the keys to The Beano\u0026rsquos magic kingdom are given to comedian David Walliams. His guest editorship of the UK\u0026rsquos longest-running children\u0026rsquos comic was announced last Friday and he\u0026rsquoll edit a special 44-page 80th birthday edition, to go on sale on Wednesday.  As well as appearing on the front cover, Walliams will feature in a Bash Street Kids strip and has created a new character for a strip titled Moe\u0026rsquos Monkey Feet. He has also commissioned a story in which Dennis the Menace and his canine side-kick Gnasher team up with Minnie the Minx and Bananaman.  \u0026ldquoI was thrilled to be invited to guest-edit the Beano, Walliams said. \u0026ldquoI felt rather giddy sitting in the editor\u0026rsquos chair helping to create storylines and introduce my new character to the comic\u0026rsquos fanbase.  Giddy or not, he joins a long list of actors, politicians, rock stars and royals who have been similarly honoured \u0026ndash and not always with agreeable results. Here are some of the more notable examples. Plus Abi Titmuss.  Bono  \u0026ldquoMay I say, without guile, I am as sick of messianic rock stars as the next man, woman and child, ran an editorial in The Independent in 2006, back when the newspaper still existed in the non-virtual world. The writer was a man for whom some say the label \u0026ldquomessianic rock star could have been invented \u0026ndash Bono, frontman with U2. He had been asked to guest edit the edition of May 16 that year to promote the work of RED, an AIDs charity he had set up with Bobby Shriver, a nephew of John F Kennedy. The 16-page motoring section stayed but among Bono\u0026rsquos editorial interventions was an interview with Eddie Izzard (conducted by him) and one with Giorgio Armani, done by Stella McCartney. According to then-editor Simon Kelner, Bono took the job so seriously he even ate his lunch at his desk.  Kate Moss  Moss was asked to guest edit the December 2005/January 2006 edition of French Vogue and, despite early reports that she was threatening to include a cover-mounted CD of her singing a duet with then-boyfriend Pete Doherty, the eventual edition was considered a success \u0026ndash thanks in large part to having four different covers (always bumps up sales), each one inspired by Jean Cocteau\u0026rsquos cult 1946 film La Belle Et La Bete, which is pretty decent source material. Moss\u0026rsquos editorial was accompanied by a picture taken in the Grand Canyon just after she had emerged from a rehab clinic in Arizona. She looks very happy to be out and very ready to party.  Coleen Rooney  Nothing as exalted as French Vogue for Wayne Rooney\u0026rsquos wife. Instead she was asked to guest edit an edition of celebrity magazine Closer in August 2006. Either cementing her reputation as the uber-WAG of the Noughties or damaging it irreparably \u0026ndash it\u0026rsquos hard to say a decade on, and nobody really cares now anyway \u0026ndash she chose to appear on the cover wearing a \u0026pound14 dress from ASDA. But as editor Jane Johnson recalled, she made it \u0026ldquolook worth a million dollars. Which is about a month\u0026rsquos earnings for her husband, now signed to American team DC United.  Hillary Clinton  In November 2017, being at a bit of a loose end having failed to become the first female president of the United States, Hillary Clinton forgot about running the world\u0026rsquos most powerful country and guest edited Teen Vogue instead. \u0026ldquoI love seeing articles about the search for the perfect makeup remover next to essays about running for office, she wrote in an introductory column in which she also said she was adding her book What Happened to the Teen Vogue book club reading list. As the title suggests, it\u0026rsquos a sort of reflective post-mortem about how she failed to become the first female president of the United States and ended up guest editing Teen Vogue instead.  Kate Middleton  Middleton, aka The Duchess of Cambridge, took over the reins at politics, news and opinion website Huffington Post UK in February 2016. Her grand subject was mental health, particularly among children, and her editorship also saw the start of a campaign with the hashtag #YoungMindsMatter. Michelle Obama, then First Lady of the United States, penned an essay in support but all anybody really wanted to know was what the Duchess wore to work. So, just for the record, she turned up wearing a high-neck white blouse by Reiss, a black, herringbone-patterned boucl\u0026eacute wool skirt by Dolce \u0026amp Gabbana and black tights. With suede pumps.  PJ Harvey  It doesn\u0026rsquot take much to get the Daily Mail into a self-righteous lather so it was always likely that the diminutive indie rock star\u0026rsquos 2013 stint guest editing BBC Radio 4\u0026rsquos Today programme would manage it. But even PJ Harvey can\u0026rsquot have realised how much the paper would hate such \u0026ldquoinnovations as replacing the weather forecast with a Tom Waits song, letting Julian Assange do Thought For The Day, getting Ralph Fiennes on to read verse by Shaker Aamer, the last Briton to be released from Guantanamo Bay, and giving John Pilger free rein to take potshots at David Cameron. The Daily Mail called it \u0026ldquounpatriotic while the head of the Christian Conservative Fellowship called it \u0026ldquoincomprehensible liberal drivel. Labour MP Dianne Abbott, bless her, seemed to love it, however. \u0026ldquoShe should do it every day, she tweeted.  The Dalai Lama  Calling this one a guest editorship is a little rich, but the Tibetan spiritual reader did have some input into the 1992 edition of French Vogue he \u0026ldquoedited, even if it was to just nod sagely and smile politely as a series of layouts and fashion spreads were placed in front of him by then-editor Colombe Pringle. Eight months pregnant at the time, she had flown to his home in northern India with her husband, her art director, a photographer and a journalist. \u0026ldquoHe was so normal and so open, so modest, so charming, she later recalled. \u0026ldquoHe put his hand on my tummy and said \u0026lsquoIs it a boy or a girl?\u0026rsquo. I am not a Buddhist but after a few days the whole team started getting calmer and more reflective. Wow.  Abi Titmuss  For 10 years, between 2004 and its closure in 2014, Nuts was one of the pre-eminent \u0026ldquolads\" magazines, a publishing sub-genre that looks increasing (and justifiably) old-fashioned and unpalatable in this era of #MeToo and #TimesUp. And for 10 years, controversial glamour model and sometime TV presenter Abi Titmuss, was a regular in its pages. Shortly after its launch, Nuts handed the editorship to her. She gaffer-taped editor Phil Hilton to his seat and gagged him before effecting her takeover. Reflecting on the experience after the tape had been removed Hilton said that Titmuss appeared \u0026ldquodelighted to be spending her day tying me up and being paid for it. He added: \u0026ldquoIn case you ever wanted to know, gaffer tape can be very painful to remove, especially from the mouth."},{"url":null,"title":"the-helsinki-blowback","story":"  \u0026ldquoWhy should my son go to Montenegro to defend it from attack? Fox News host Tucker Carlson asked the US President in a conversation about Nato\u0026rsquos common defence policy.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove asked the same question, Trump replied, \u0026ldquoMontenegro is a tiny country with very strong people. They\u0026rsquore very aggressive people. They may get aggressive, and congratulations you\u0026rsquore in World War III, the US president asserted.  Doubtless at some point over the subsequent next few hours Russian President Vladimir Putin would have seen last Tuesday\u0026rsquos interview, and almost certainly have been well pleased with Trump\u0026rsquos response.  \u0026ldquoThe criticism seemed to parrot Putin\u0026rsquos thinking on Nato and Montenegro\u0026hellipthe exchange left observers justifiably wondering if this was part of the agenda in the private Trump-Putin talks, observed New Yorker journalist Susan B Glasser, who writes a weekly column on life in Trump\u0026rsquos Washington.  In effect the US president had just succeeded in undermining Montenegro\u0026rsquos membership of Nato, something the Russians have been trying to do ever since the small Balkan nation expressed a desire to join the alliance some years ago. So incensed was Moscow at the time in the run up to Montenegro\u0026rsquos full Nato membership last year, that the Kremlin brought the full might of its dirty tricks repertoire to bear. Propaganda, espionage, and subversion were all tried by Russian military intelligence the GRU, the same service that has been indicted by the US Justice Department for its meddling in America\u0026rsquos 2016 election.  The Kremlin even went as far as to support a coup in 2016 against the Montenegro Government of then prime minister, Milo Dukanovic.  Although the putsch ultimately failed it had been hoped that with Dukanovic\u0026rsquos assassination a pro-Russian party would be brought to power, so determined was Moscow to ensure that the west was not able to encroach on areas it has long viewed as falling within its sphere of influence.  In the end the GRU\u0026rsquos plans were rumbled, but the Kremlin\u0026rsquos obsession with the tiny Balkan country remains.  With a population of only 600,000 and a standing military force of scarcely 2000 troops, Montenegro poses no threat to the United States, yet last Tuesday with his on-air remarks Trump made this miniscule country sound like a threat to world peace.  \u0026ldquoThis is insane. I can tell you these days we are thinking about our holidays, heading to resorts along the Adriatic, not waging world war three, Vesko Garcevic, Montenegro\u0026rsquos former ambassador to Nato, said in response to Trump\u0026rsquos remarks.  Jokes aside, given that Trump\u0026rsquos Montenegro comments came so quickly on the heels of his hugely controversial meeting with Putin in Helsinki, they only served to ring more alarm bells concerning his cosiness with the Russian president.  \u0026ldquoWorrying to hear Trump use Russian talking points with Tucker Carlson, about Montenegro, tweeted Wesley Clark, retired US army general and former Nato Supreme Allied Commander  \u0026ldquoMontenegro has been under continuous pressure by Russia for more than a decade. Trump\u0026rsquos comments weaken Nato, give Russia a license to cause trouble and thereby actually increase the risks of renewed conflict in the Balkans, warned Clark.  This weekend the fallout and blowback from Trump\u0026rsquos Helsinki meeting is far from abating and indeed shows signs of intensifying.  News on Friday that the US President has now offered his Russian counterpart a further meeting in Washington in the autumn has only added to the prevailing \u0026ldquoincredulity and ire within the US security and foreign policy establishment.  The furore was further fuelled by the almost 24-hour delay before the White House publicly rejected Putin\u0026rsquos request to interrogate Americans in exchange for assistance in the FBI\u0027s Russia probe led by US special counsel Robert Mueller.  Trump has already effectively dismissed FBI indictments of 12 Russian military officers for conducting cyber-warfare against the US during the 2016 Presidential elections.  Putin had suggested that Mueller\u0027s investigators could come to Russia to question the Russians that have been charged with interfering in the election. But in return, Putin said he would expect the US to allow Russian investigators to question people he called fugitives on American soil.  The Americans wanted for questioning by Moscow include Michael McFaul, the former US ambassador to Russia, and American-born financier Bill Browder, who successfully lobbied the US government to impose new sanctions on Moscow.  Almost across the board senior US officials have pushed Trump to roundly dismiss Putin\u0026rsquos offer.  \u0026ldquoThat\u0026rsquos not going to happen, said Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in an interview with the conservative Christian Broadcasting Network on Thursday when asked about Putin\u0026rsquos offer. Other prominent figures were also uncompromising in their response.  \u0026ldquoThe administration needs to make it unequivocally clear that in a million years this wouldn\u0026rsquot be under consideration, period. Full stop, insisted John Kerry who served as Secretary of State under president Barack Obama, adding that the proposal is \u0026ldquonot something that should require a half second of consultation. Dangerous.  But even the White House announcement rejecting Putin\u0026rsquos offer has done little to allay fears of Trump\u0026rsquos relationship and apparent willingness to appease Putin. His remarks in Helsinki, which were far more deferential to Russia than anyone could have anticipated, are continuing to send shockwaves through Washington and other Western capitals and have clearly made their mark on ordinary Americans too.  According to a recent Reuters Ipsos Mori poll, 56 per cent of Americans think Putin did interfere on behalf of Trump in the 2016 elections, even if only 32 per cent of Republicans think the same.  Many Americans are clearly rattled at the sight of their president showing greater faith in Putin\u0026rsquos word than the analysis of the US intelligence services. With mid-term elections scheduled in November, minds are now focused in certain quarters to ensure there is not a rerun of Moscow meddling  Already the US Senate is actively debating a bill introduced back in January by Senators Mark Rubio, a Republican, and Chris Van Hollen, a Democrat, that would impose harsh economic sanctions if Russia interferes in the November poll.  As for the Helsinki summit itself there remains a near total blackout on what was discussed between the two leaders.  Such is the concern over what was talked about and possibly agreed that some US Democratic politicians moved to subpoena Trump\u0026rsquos interpreter Marina Gross, the only other American in the room during the meeting with Putin.  The Democrats efforts were only thwarted by Republicans during a vote in the US House Intelligence Committee on Thursday, but as many observers have pointed out subpoenaing a president\u0026rsquos interpreter is unprecedented in modern times.  For their part the Russians have at least alluded to some of what was talked about and made clear Moscow\u0026rsquos satisfaction over how things went.  \u0026ldquoAwesome, better than super, was how Sergei Lavrov, the Russian Foreign Minister summed up his assessment of the summit.  The Russian Government appeared to be taking advantage of the secretive meeting, suggesting that Trump and Putin had reached agreements on key issues despite denials from US officials.  For his part president Putin announced that the summit \u0026ldquowas overall successful and led to productive agreements. Russian state-controlled TV channels agreed, praising the summit outcome and Putin\u0026rsquos performance for five consecutive days.  On Thursday Trump said he looked forward to a second meeting with Putin \u0026ldquoso that we can start implementing some of the many things discussed.  He listed Ukraine, Israel\u0026rsquos security, nuclear proliferation, trade, North Korea, and Middle East peace, much to the consternation of US officials who are still in the dark over what was discussed and are keen to reassure European and Nato allies.  Bloomberg reported that Putin made a proposal during the meeting to hold a referendum to end the conflict in eastern Ukraine, a plan that the news outlet said Russians diplomats believe Trump is considering.  Inevitably the scarcely believable events of the last week have also provoked rising debate in Washington over whether Russia does indeed have some incriminating intelligence it is holding over Trump\u0026rsquos head that is influencing his behaviour toward Putin. While so far there has been no publicly available evidence to back up any such claim, some are beginning to seriously consider the likelihood.  \u0026ldquoBefore the Helsinki summit, I was not prepared to go to the darkest corner in the room and say there is kompromat \u0026ndash there is compromising information \u0026ndash on Donald Trump, said Steve Hall, a former CIA station chief in Moscow, on CNN\u0027s \u0026ldquoAnderson Cooper 360 on Thursday.  \u0026ldquoAfter I saw Donald Trump treat Putin in a fashion that is just inexplicable, the only conclusion that I can come to is ... I think there is information and data out there that implies there is indeed compromising information that Vladimir Putin has on Donald Trump. Why else would he treat him that way? asked Hall, expressing the fears of many.  Should such an assessment prove to be true it would have profound political consequences. Even without this doomsday scenario, many observers of America\u0026rsquos corridors of power feel that massive damage has already been inflicted on the US body politic.  Some like political writer Susan Glasser of the New Yorker suggest what we are witnessing is nothing less than the breakdown of American foreign policy.  \u0026ldquoEven if we don\u0026rsquot know the full extent of what was said and done behind closed doors in Helsinki, here\u0026rsquos what we already do know as a result of the summit: America\u0026rsquos government is divided from its President on Russia its process for orderly decision-making, or even basic communication, has disintegrated and its ability to lead an alliance in Europe whose main mission in recent years has been to counter and contain renewed Russian aggression has been seriously called into question, she wrote last week.  What, more than anything, now baffles the US political and media community however, is why, given the near universal condemnation Trump received over meeting Putin in Helsinki, is prepared to do the same thing all over again in the autumn?  This, after all, is a President who has been known to make or reverse decisions based on what he sees on TV, a man that feeds off media coverage.  As the Washington Post noted on Friday, only a month ago Trump abruptly decided to end his administration\u0027s policy of separating families apprehended at the Mexican border after criticism of it reached near fever pitch in the US and beyond.  In November last year too, he also ended the import of elephant trophies from Africa just a week after his own administration reopened it, after conservative TV hosts voiced their aversion to big-game trophies.  Why then now, given the tsunami of criticism over his Putin meeting would Trump now invite the Russian leader to a rerun in Washington, not least without conferring with his own country\u0026rsquos top intelligence officials?  For the moment there remain more questions than answers as to what really happened in Helsinki. If one thing is certain, though, it\u0026rsquos that the Trump-Putin summit is cutting its way into the US political establishment in a way rarely ever seen before.

Now the event is marking its coming-of-age with half a dozen events in Scotland, plus bog celebrations in the rest of the UK, Ireland and across North America.  The idea of an event to get the message across that bogs are an important natural habitat \u0026ndash and a valuable resource in fighting climate change \u0026ndash was the brainchild of the Scottish Wildlife Trust charity. Threats to bogs globally include being drained for agriculture, peat digging for gardens, and encroaching trees.  The trust\u0026rsquos Rory Syme said: \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Wildlife Trust set up National Bog Day in 1991 as a way for the public to find out more about the peatlands and bogs around them.\"  He added: \u0026ldquoIn 1996, the trust hosted a major international conference on peatlands here in Edinburgh. Experts and scientists came from all over the world to discuss the way forwards for peatlands.  \u0026ldquoPeople at that conference heard that we were holding National Bog Day and took that back to their own areas like Ireland and the States, and started to run their own events on the same day, the fourth Sunday in July \u0026ndash and so from 1997 it became International Bog Day\"  Unique plants found in Scotland\u0026rsquos bogs include species of the carnivorous sundew, which trap insects on sticky pads and then absorb them. They have evolved for the bog environment because the peat they grow on is so nutrient-poor they need vital foods from elsewhere.  Dr Tim Duffy is an ecologist who chairs the committee that runs the Red Moss of Balerno bogland nature reserve, and will be in charge of Bog Day events there today.  He encourages \u0026ldquobog lying, getting up close and dirty with the peat, moss and the other plants.  He says: \u0026ldquoBogs can seem like bleak places but there is a lot of beautiful stuff going on in them, and amazing colours. Red Moss of Balerno may have got its name from the red sphagnum moss that grows here.  \u0026ldquoPeople these days realise bogs are worth millions of pounds to the world as carbon sinks. The Scottish Government has put some useful amounts of money into bog restoration in Scotland, which is great. They are working on making some of our degraded bogs wetter to become proper carbon sinks again.  Celebrations of International Bog Day today in Scotland include the event at Balerno and guided walks and bog activities at Portmoak Community Woodland in Kinross.  https://bogday.org/events-scotland/"},{"url":null,"title":"its-time-for-a-hand-brake-turn-on-brexit","story":"  Unless there is some unforeseeable u-turn we will be propelled over the edge next March. And the carnage will be colossal. In the coming weeks we will be bombarded with increasingly ominous \"technical notices\" from the UK Government advising us how to prepare, like stockpiling non-perishable food and cancelling these summer holiday plans because well need visas, air travel will be out and, anyway, even if we manage to cross the Channel, through the lorries parked up for miles, forget mobile phone roaming and discount the value of your pound.  So far the Scottish Government has been not so much sidelined as run over by Westminster. The Supreme Court will rule this week on whether the Scottish parliament has the right to pass a Continuity Bill retaining control over devolved powers repatriated from Brussels, but we already know the Sewel convention is illusory and that Holyrood has no legal right to withhold consent if it disagrees with new trade agreements \u0026ndash agreements we don\u0027t have anyway.  There will also be a hard border in Ireland, or the Irish Sea, although the DUP seems as intransigent as the Brexiteers on that.  There is only one brake that can be put on this journey to disaster and that is a second referendum on the final deal with Brussels, although with another arch-Leaver, Dominic Raab leading the negotiations and determined to live down to the standards of his predecessor, don\u0027t expect much.

Originally called 80s Rewind Festival, it showcases bands and solo artists and has seen dedicated crowds return and swell year after year since its inception in 2009.  Rubics Cube fancy dress, bouncy castles and old school carnival rides all add to the flashback atmosphere as eighties fanatics are given the chance to relive their youth.  Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark played hits dating back as far as 1980 on Saturday, with favourites such as anti-war classic Enola Gay and If You Leave.  Joining OMD on the stage yesterday were Latin act Gipsy Kings, who for the Rewind Festival featured Nicolas Reyes and Tonnino Baliardo in their ranks. The group first rose to prominence a quarter of a century ago with their self-titled debut album which would go on to achieve a gold certification and become a global phenomenon for its blend of western and Latin styles.  Closer to home, Fife-born rockers The Skids rode \"into the valley\" to kickstart the event playing some of their own hits. Formed just up the road in Dunfermline back in 1977, the band reformed in 2007 and have spent the past 11 years touring the material that made them favourites of the late John Peel.  Today\u0027s line-up has an even more heavyweight feel to it, with huge bands from across the world travelling to provide a look back into the past for the retro fans in attendance.  Status Quo arrive in Perthshire to play a snippet of their own back catalogue, while the iconic Bonnie Tyler will also take to the Forever Stage. With a career spanning four decades, and a voice instantly identifiable the world over, the Welsh singer is the international first lady of rock, a title she has held for four decades.  The eighties brought even more success for the songstress, with hits Total Eclipse of the Heart and Holding out for a Hero of Footloose fame among her best-known tracks.  Elsewhere, Grammy and Ivor Novello winning artist Midge Ure will play hits from his own illustrious back catalogue for festivalgoers at the former Royal seat in Scone.  An original Band Aid member and well-known charity worker, Ure\u0027s prominence stretches beyond his musical work and the songwriter will no doubt provide a story on stage today.  The Boomtown Rats, with the other half of the founding Band Aid partnership at the helm, will also appear today, while UB40, Heaven 17, A Flock of Seagulls and Hue \u0026amp Cry also part of today\u0027s line-up.

While I appreciate that Inverness is the larger and most busy airport, there is a real public perception that, at present, Inverness gets a lot of public money spent on it in terms of development and jobs, to the detriment of other regional airports.The Caithness, Sutherland and Ross MSP added: \u0026ldquoI have consistently made the case that Wick John O\u0026rsquoGroats Airport should be considered as a real possibility for the future of the air traffic control service in the Highlands, not least because of the real benefit and impact it would have on the socio-economic climate of the county.\u0026ldquoWe need sustainable, quality jobs and I am worried that this decision will limit many who have seen themselves as having a career in the aviation industry in the Highlands to only being based in Inverness.Mrs Ross added: \u0026ldquoIn May, the rural economy and connectivity committee, of which I am vice-chair, took evidence on this issue and were assured by the then minister, Humza Yousaf, that a full consultation and scoping exercise would take place and that there would be no decisions made until this work was carried out.\u0026ldquoI was very disappointed to learn of the decision to base the new service in Inverness, which seems like a real kick in the teeth to smaller airports that have been working hard to train, support and develop the expertise in their ATC staff.Trudy Morris, chief executive of the Caithness Chamber of Commerce, was also unhappy with the decision.She said: \u0026ldquoWe were extremely disappointed by the Hial board\u0026rsquos decision to select Inverness in principle as the location for a planned centralised air traffic management facility. Wick John O\u0026rsquoGroats Airport would have made an excellent base for this facility, and would have offered an opportunity for Hial to reverse the trend of centralisation of public services in Inverness.\u0026ldquoIt is our understanding that Inverness offered significant benefits to Hial with regard to retention of existing and recruitment of new staff, and we can appreciate why this proved to be a significant factor in the decision-making process. Unfortunately the end result will be a loss of skilled jobs from the rural communities which most need them.Ms Morris added: \u0026ldquoAt a time when the future for the north Highlands is looking bright, with significant investments in oil and gas, renewables, tourism and indeed the airport itself, we feel this is a missed opportunity to maximise these. We will be working closely with Hial, public agencies and local businesses over the coming years to understand and address the impact that this decision will have on the north Highlands.Inverness was picked as the preferred location for a new state-of-the art air traffic control centre following a study by consultants.Sunday 22 Jul 2018 7:39 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"New record set for Lands End to John OGroats cycle run","story":"THE record for cycling from Land\u0026rsquos End to John O\u0026rsquoGroats has been broken by Michael Broadwith.The 40-year-old from Hertfordshire did the marathon bike run in 43 hours, 25 minutes and 13 seconds \u0026ndash more than 30 minutes faster than the previous record held by Gethin Butler.His record of 44 hours, four minutes and 19 seconds had stood for 17 years.Veteran local cyclist Alasdair Washington was a record-keeper for the Road Records Association (RRA) at the north end of the trip.Mr Broadwith, a maths teacher, joins a select number of people to break the record since George Mills, riding a penny-farthing, made the first successful end-to-end attempt in 1886.Broadwith also broke the RRA 24-hour record with 507.511 miles covered at an average speed of 21.1 miles per hour.Bill Mowat, vice-chairman of the Dunnet and Canisbay Community Council, congratulated Mr Broadwith on his remarkable achievement.The women\u0026rsquos record holder is Lynne Taylor who lives in the West Midlands. \u0026ldquoShe is the only one with a Canisbay parish relative to do so, said Mr Mowat, who pointed out that the RRA only recognised female racers in the late 1930s.

Its expertise is thought to have formed part of the case for siting the facility at the Moine, which is about 40 miles west of Dounreay.Cavendish Dounreay Partnership (CDP) and its subsidiary Dounreay Site Restoration Ltd (DSRL) have invested resources in the spaceport proposal as part of its bid to identify and develop new jobs after the closure of the plant.Mr Craig said: \u0026ldquoEvery single one of us here at Dounreay recognises the importance of seizing opportunities like these to create new job opportunities, not just for this generation but the one that follows when Dounreay is gone.He added: \u0026ldquoOur skill sets in engineering, environmental science, programme management and a range of technical disciplines are easily transferable to industries such as the space sector and I am committed to working closely with the developer and operator to make the most of this amazing opportunity for our people.CDP chairman Simon Bowen said: \u0026ldquoDecommissioning a complex nuclear site like Dounreay is about more than getting it into a state that is safe for future generations \u0026ndash it is also about securing the social and economic prosperity of future generations.\u0026ldquoThe UK vertical launch facility is a key priority, with the potential to deliver high-value employment and supply chain opportunities.Sutherland was one of three potential spaceport locations to submit outline business cases to Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE) earlier this year. The others were Scolpaig on North Uist and Unst in Shetland.All three were assessed by independent consultants with specialist knowledge of the space sector.Each one met key criteria, including the ability to stage north facing launches over the sea into both polar and sun-synchronous orbit.However, the business case for Sutherland was judged stronger overall, including being successfully awarded UK Space Agency funding for its proposals in collaboration with potential launch operators.HIE chief executive Charlotte Wright said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore very clear that we want to work with others to ensure the benefits of a spaceport in the Highlands and Islands are not confined to Sutherland, but extend well beyond.\u0026ldquoA central part of our approach as we develop this project will be to explore opportunities throughout our region.Sunday 22 Jul 2018 7:39 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Vet finds Major mess on record paddle run","story":"A VET caused a bit of a splash when she swapped her stethoscope for a paddleboard to complete a memorable Land\u0026rsquos End to John O\u0026rsquoGroats journey.Cal Major was paddling along the seas, rivers and canals of Britain in order to raise awareness of plastic pollution in our waters and to also raise money for mental health charities the Samaritans and Vetlife.The 30-year-old completed her momentous journey inside 59 days \u0026ndash as she\u0026rsquos the first to do this by paddleboard, she is now the official world-record holder.Cal, who hails from North Devon, is keen to highlight not only the untidiness of plastic litter left on our beaches and in our seas but also the damage it can do to both the sea wildlife and the environment.She found many examples of plastic pollution along the way to John O\u0026rsquoGroats and hopes people will give more though to their use and disposal of plastic products.\u0026ldquoThere was plastic wherever I went.

This means 42 per cent of all eligible LFASS 2017 claims have now been paid, with more payments to follow in the coming weeks.Rural Economy Secretary Fergus Ewing said: “Given the pressures that farmers and crofters continue to face, due in part to the extreme weather conditions during the winter and summer periods, I’m glad to see these important payments starting two months earlier than last year.“Earlier in the year we provided a loan option for farmers in advance of these payments, to help provide cashflow and financial certainty. Farmers are the backbone of Scotland’s rural economy and the Scottish Government is committed to supporting them wherever possible.\u0026#8221On behalf of the Scottish Farmers Union, NFU Scotland, LFA Committee Chairman, Robert Macdonald, welcomed the news saying: “The news that LFASS payments will be reaching farmers and crofters is welcome, particularly for those who did not apply for or receive an LFASS loan of 90 per cent through the LFASS loan scheme. The current prolonged period of extraordinary weather, and the economic impact that it brings, once again underlines the importance of these payments to business stability.“As we look ahead its vital that support for the less favoured areas, for hill farms and crofts, continues. NFU Scotland continues to press the Scottish Government for a timetable for payments, delivered in a timely manner to allow farmers and crofters to efficiently plan their cashflow.“Whilst these payments will bring relief for some, NFUS continues to highlight to farmers and crofters the importance of planning ahead for straw and feed supplies with three key messages — Plan ahead, Be flexible and collaborate.”\u0026nbsp\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

We created the FitHomes concept to help Highland residents take charge of their own wellbeing and health needs through innovative technology and design.\"Thanks to the support we\u0026rsquove had from Centrica, both financially and advisory, we will be able to deliver digital health and assisted living technologies in a way that has not been possible before.\"The investment has been made by Centrica\u0026rsquos Ignite social impact investment fund. Established in 2017, Centrica Innovations aims to invest \u0026pound100 million by 2022 in new technologies that will transform the way people live, work and move.Sam Salisbury, Centrica Innovations labs director, said: \"As a market leader in connected home products, we are always on the lookout for opportunities to solve real world problems with new technology and innovation. The lack of affordable, energy efficient, desirable homes is one that is affecting families across the country so we\u0026rsquore delighted to be able to support an initiative that shows such potential in transforming how people, young and old, live in their homes.\"The origins of the FitHome go back to 2008 when a tenant was found dead in his home, having lain unnoticed for over a year. Vowing to put new preventative systems in place, Albyn commissioned research exploring potential solutions. As a result, the society decided to develop its own system that could be adopted across its growing portfolio of homes.Matt Stevenson of Carbon Dynamic said of FitHomes: \"I truly believe that this housing method can change the way that we view construction of new housing developments as well as feeding into the wider healthcare and societal issues.\"Sunday 22 Jul 2018 7:40 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

It has been credited with helping some people to turn their lives around.Confirmation that Mr Harper, who has also sold on the streets of Inverness, had found a successful new niche for himself came when he was handed a Scotland\u0026rsquos Top Seller accolade.Mr Harper, who has overcome major health challenges, averages around 160 copies a week. He has been selling the magazine on and off since it was launched back in 1991.The secret to his success is fairly straightfoward, he believes: \"I speak to everybody who walks past me. You don\u0026rsquot know the last time they talk to someone. That\u0026rsquos the nitty gritty of it.\"Smile and say hello, and help them if they need it. I gave an old lady a hand with her shopping trolley earlier, and when she came back out she bought a magazine off me.\"I love selling the magazine, it\u0026rsquos my job. I don\u0026rsquot get benefits, this is my only source of income, and I travel up on the bus here from Inverness every day to do it. I\u0026rsquom always on my pitch. I love it, I\u0026rsquoll moan and groan when it\u0026rsquos snowing but apart from that it\u0026rsquos great.\"My customers are amazing, I\u0026rsquom well looked after and I have good banter with them. I feel like a part of the community here. People bring me stuff all the time \u0026ndash recently I was given a bag of clothes \u0026ndash not all of them fitted me, so I took the rest to a charity shop so they could use them. And recently one of my customers bought me lunch.\"The staff at Tesco always ask how I\u0026rsquom doing \u0026ndash I get on really well with Steve, the manager, he tells me I\u0026rsquom good with the punters.

As a result, Newton Road will be closed from July 19 at 7am to July 22 at 11am. And Dingwall No.1 in Craig Road will be shut from 7am on August 2 to 11am on August 5.Final installation and testing of the new barriers will also require fortnight-long road closures at both sites \u0026ndash Dingwall Middle from October 15 to 29 and Dingwall No.1 from October 29 to November 12.David Dickson, infrastructure director for Network Rail Scotland, said: \"These level crossing upgrades represent a significant improvement for rail and road safety.\"Our consultation work with the local community earlier this year indicated support for these improvements and we look forward to seeing them delivered.\"Our aim is to deliver this work with as little disruption as possible, however, we will require two short closures this summer plus two week road closures for each crossing to install and test the new equipment this autumn.\"Train services are not expected to be affected by any of the works.Sunday 22 Jul 2018 7:40 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Visitors will then be able to access behind the scenes areas of the museum, experiencing objects up close.Curator Dr Karen Buchanan explained: \"We want to make as much of the material in our collections accessible as possible. This includes not only our objects in storage, but also the wealth of archive and library material we hold, which document the history of Gairloch parish. This funding will maximise our storage space, protect our collection for the future and enrich our visitors\u0026rsquo experiences.\"Museums Galleries Scotland is the National Development Body for museums and galleries in Scotland and offers strategic development support to the sector. This round of funding saw over \u0026pound550,000 awarded to 15 different projects in 14 museums across Scotland. Gairloch Heritage Museum museum plans to move its collection early in the new year and to start opening its stores to the public next summer.Its new premises have been fashioned from a former anti-aircraft operations room, a piece of local history in itself.Sunday 22 Jul 2018 7:40 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

A spokesperson for the judges said:\"He is someone who thoroughly deserves to be recognised for the great contribution he has made to both the industry and the community. A wonderful role model and ambassador.\"Stories shared by his colleagues when nominating him, included times when he dug out roads during a storm to deliver bottled gas and a generator to a terminally-ill customer delivering flowers to a customer who had recently lost her husband, and caring for a customer who had suffered a severe stroke.\"For me, it isn\u0026rsquot about going above and beyond, it\u0026rsquos about doing what I feel is the right thing to do and making sure our customers are cared for and supported when they need us most,\" said a modest Mr Sutherland, who said the award was as much recognition for the Highland team as for himself. \"I\u0026rsquom delighted to take this award home to my wife and girls, who have supported me along the way as I disappeared for days during storms, sometimes missing important events and occasions at home. It\u0026rsquos all worth it as I\u0026rsquom glad to say I still love my job as much as I did when I joined 44 years ago as an apprentice.\"Colin Pirie, SSEN\u0026rsquos head of Region for the Highlands and Islands, added: \"Mike is without doubt the most dedicated, conscientious person I have ever met in my 28 years with SSEN.\"He genuinely cares for everyone he meets. His selfless attitude and his devotion to customers, colleagues (especially young people and trainees) and his family is well known.

Depute fiscal Alison McKenzie told Sheriff Margaret Neilson the 15-year-old was being trained in lifeguard skills and it was when they were alone at the pool Russell repeatedly fondled him over his trunks: \"It happened so frequently he could not recall the number of occasions he was molested,\" said the fiscal.The boy didn\u0026rsquot report the assaults and told no-one until many years later as a father of two he received a letter from Russell offering to act as a football scout for his children.The fiscal said: \"The complainer was furious, recalled the abuse he suffered at the hands of the accused, and made a statement of complaint to police.\"Russell admitted assaulting the boy on various dates between 1977 and 1979 at Dingwall Sports Centre Swimming Pool and between May and June 1981 at the Mackay Hostel sexually assaulting a 16-year-old.He further admitted assaulting an 18-year-old by handling his buttocks over his kilt in 1983 at a street in Dingwall and exposing himself to him.He also pleaded guilty to indecently assaulting an 18- year-old at the hostel in 1984 by sitting on his bed uninvited, placing his hand under the bed covers and repeatedly attempting to touch his genitals.Sentence was deferred after his last appearance for reports.Russell is due to appear in court again on August 2.Sunday 22 Jul 2018 7:41 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The first is the cinema, which would be built on land close to the ferry slipway and next to an existing boat storage shed.It would seat roughly 30 people and host weekly screenings throughout the year, rising to twice a week in the summer. It would also be used to help house Cromarty\u0026rsquos growing film festival, which attracts fans and famous faces from across the country every autumn.Cromarty Estate also plans to build an office hub alongside the cinema in a bid to cater for growing business demand in the town.A statement submitted by Cromarty Estate said: \"Cromarty has a thriving entrepreneurial community but this is not matched by suitable office accommodation, with the result that many find themselves having to move their business bases from Cromarty to Dingwall, Tore or Inverness when they outgrow their own homes, with the resulting loss of employment opportunities in the town.\"Addressing this need... will make Cromarty a more balanced and sustainable community.\"Film society trustee Tanya Karlebach said the group was \"really excited\" to reach this milestone and the move would help increase the frequency of screenings in Cromarty.She added that there is still some fundraising to do before the \u0026pound240,000 cost of the venue is covered, but that by lodging the application now, they are hopeful permission will be in place to begin as soon as the target is met.They hope to hear about their remaining grant applications and other fundraising by late autumn.She added the society had opted for a new-build because none of the existing sites in Cromarty were suitable for conversion. They would also have cost more to take on than building a cinema from scratch.\"We hope the community is supportive,\" she said. \"We\u0026rsquove had positive feedback so far and it\u0026rsquos in a great location down by the ferry.\"A survey of Cromarty residents found that 82 per cent backed a cinema in the town and the same number would go to more screenings if the venue was better than what is currently on offer.The plans for the cinema and office hub have won support from a leading Highland business figure.David Richardson, the Federation of Small Businesses\u0026rsquo Highlands and Islands development manager, said the organisation \"wholeheartedly supports locally-managed collaborative ventures that make our small rural communities even better places to live, especially for the young people and families that we desperately need to retain and attract.\"Cinemas appeal to all ages and to locals and visitors alike, and they can also be great social hubs.\"Equally, the presence of purpose-designed office space can do much to encourage would-be entrepreneurs to take the plunge and start new businesses existing small business to expand and to attract businesses from outside to relocate.\"It approved the buildings would feature dark metal cladding to the walls of the cinema, with timber cladding on the office hub.Construction could start as early as spring next year.To donate to the cinema project go to www.justgiving/crowdfunding/cromartycommunitycinemaSunday 22 Jul 2018 7:42 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The Oil \u0026amp Gas Technology Centre (OGTC) is leading the industry-backed “Facility of the Future” initiative that could halve the cost of developing and operating an oil and gas facility and help to access the equivalent of more than 3.5 billion barrels of reserves in so-called marginal discoveries.            A discovery is classed as marginal when the risks or technology involved make it too challenging to develop economically, for instance because of its geographical location or the specialist equipment needed.            The project wants to design a new approach that will make this process more efficient than traditional methods, such as fixed platforms.It aims to develop lower-cost, reusable facilities that can be remotely operated from onshore control centres, thereby increasing reducing the requirement for staff to work in the hazardous offshore environment and creating skilled onshore jobs. Chris Pearson, the OGTC’s small pools solution centre manager, said: “Oil and gas is playing catch-up with many industries when it comes to automation and remote operations. We’re exploring how the combination of existing and new technology can be best used in the offshore environment to improve safety, reduce life cycle cost and increase efficiency.“New, smarter and more automated ways of developing oil and gas fields are required if we’re to fully unlock marginal discoveries and maximise economic recovery from the UKCS. “The Facility of the Future initiative will help to significantly reduce life-cycle costs and strengthen the investment case for both marginal discoveries and more traditional reservoirs.”            The initiative will kick off with a study led by Crondall Energy and Buoyant Production Technologies to develop a floating facility adapted from the type of installations currently used for shallow water gas fields, known as NUIs, to make them suitable for oil discoveries. It hopes to design an NUI concept that will function at any water depth and uses a minimal manning approach by involving remote control and automation technologies.Niki Chambers, project manager at the marginal development solutions centre, said: “This study is looking at unlocking the capabilities of these floating facilities to work across any kind of discovery. It is opening up the whole of the UKCS.” The OGTC is supported by the Scottish and UK governments, Aberdeen City and Aberdeenshire councils and Opportunity North East. It also generates funding from industry and university partners, and is currently in the process of securing further funds for subsequent studies as part of this initiative."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4772278.1532255228!/image/image.jpg","title":"bid for free bus travel for over 60s to be enshrined in law","story":"        Scottish Labour is calling for free bus travel to be protected by law for people aged over 60.

What you’ll need:              • 500g Canadian strong white bread flour (or a flour with a high gluten content, i.e. at least 14 per cent) • 30g lard or vegetable shortening • 10g sugar • 10g salt • 5g fast action yeast             • 400ml cold water For the Coating • 50g plain flour • 50g rice cones/flourView our STEP BY STEP GALLERY HERE            Method: 1 Rub the fat into the flour in a large mixing bowl. Stir in the sugar, salt and yeast. 2 Now pour in the water and mix until it is all incorporated. This is a wet dough but when you are using bread flour with such a high gluten content it can easily take that much water without becoming sloppy. 3 Remove the dough from the bowl and knead it for 1 minute until the dough has just become smooth with all the ingredients thoroughly combined. 4 With such a long ferment you don’t need to knead it too much. Put the dough back into the bowl and cover loosely with cling film. Put the bowl in the refrigerator to leave it to ferment for 12 – 16 hours.             5 The next morning combine the rice cones and plain flour for the coating. Take a large baking sheet and dust it liberally with the coating mixture (make sure to leave enough to coat the rolls). 6 Empty the dough on to a work surface which has been liberally dusted with the rice/flour coating mixture. This is where a large silicone spatula or scraper is useful. 7 Now using a dough scraper divide the dough into 8 pieces. Don’t worry if it is sticky or messy as these rolls aren’t supposed to look perfect. 8 Dust your fingers with the coating mixture and take each piece of dough, one at a time, and dip it into the coating mixture and place it on the baking sheet. They don’t need to be in the shape of a roll but try to keep in the air that is inside the dough. 9 Do this with each piece, placing them near to each other so that when they rise they will bake together. Despite the stickiness of this dough the coating mixture works wonders for stopping the dough from sticking to everything. Leave them to rise for 1 – 2 hours or until doubled in size. 10 Bake in a 250˚C preheated oven on a high shelf for 15 – 20 minutes or until the tops are dark. The rolls should be well fired for the right flavour.• Recipe submitted by Fraser Wright Read more: The history of morning rolls, including a recipe for making your ownRead more: A history of the square sausage, including a recipe for making your own"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4772349.1532277551!/image/image.jpg","title":"in pictures one summer s day competition your best photos of the scottish summer","story":"        We asked you to send us your favourite pictures illustrating sums up the perfect summer\u0026#8217s day is for our readers, and boy you didn\u0026#8217t disappoint!

Take former foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, for example. Having backed the Leave campaign in 2016 because he calculated that would maximise the chances of him one day becoming prime minister, Johnson now sits on the back benches, from where he may pontificate about how to solve a crisis for which he is in great part responsible. Last week, days after his resignation from Theresa May’s cabinet, Johnson could be heard to complain that “a needless fog of self-doubt” had descended on the process of departure from the EU.            To those already duped by Johnson, this was stirring, statesmanlike stuff.            It was nothing of the sort. Rather, Johnson’s resignation statement to the House of Commons was stuffed with meaningless platitudes which refused to acknowledge that the EU has every right to negotiate as it sees fit. It boiled down \u2028to a rather Trumpish “make Britain \u2028great again”, with neither detail nor \u2028logic playing any kind of part in achieving this.Throughout the referendum campaign and in the two years since, the Brexiteers’ response to legitimate questions about how exactly departure from the EU might be painlessly achieved has been to fall back on platitudes about confidence, as if somehow “self-belief” will protect sterling and prevent job losses.In Johnson’s cynically constructed fantasy world, if we walk meekly into a lion’s den, we should expect to be mauled to death. But if we hold our heads up and instruct the lion that we’re here to take back control of the den then the beast will roll over in defeat. Oh, and if that doesn’t work and the lion does eat you, well that’s the fault of all those people who told you not to go into its den in the first place. Having failed in the two years since he and Nigel Farage and sundry snake-oil salesmen won the referendum to come up with anything approaching a workable version of Brexit, Johnson took the coward’s way out. He did not resign because of principle (a concept entirely alien to the man), he resigned because he had no idea how to make that victory look like anything other than a spectacular act of national self-harm.May is not, even her fiercest critics would surely concede, a politician in the mould of Johnson. Charged with leading the UK out of the EU, she has to come up with ideas more substantial than “just be confident”. She has to engage with the real world – a real world in which the UK has no cards to play during Brexit negotiations with the EU.            Yet May has begun to show worryingly Johnson-esque tendencies.A call from the Prime Minister for the EU to “evolve” its position on Brexit, for example, is pure Johnson.Support for May’s white paper on Brexit – the document that provided rats such as Johnson and Brexit secretary David Davis with the excuse they required to flee the ship they helped sink – would require huge compromise (or evolution) from the EU which would have to be willing to allow the UK to retain the benefits of a trade deal while absolving us of any responsibility to honour the free movement of people or to recognise the jurisdiction of the European Court.Little wonder, then, that the EU Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, has signalled his… let us diplomatically describe them as “concerns” over the document.            According to Barnier, the Prime Minister’s plan for a future trade relationship could weaken the single market and create burdens for business. The white paper, he said, opened the way to a “constructive discussion” but it had to be “workable”.Those labouring under the misapprehension that the EU is in the business of ensuring the UK gets precisely what it wants (whatever that is) will seize on that word “constructive”. They would do better to pay attention to his warning about the things being “workable”.In the febrile atmosphere created by cabinet infighting over Brexit, the fact that the white paper represents nothing more than a series of aspirations is frequently ignored. The arrogant assumption that the EU is obliged to take seriously proposals that would undermine the integrity of the institution might comfort true believers in the Eurosceptic mission but, meanwhile, back on Planet Earth, the reality of a no-deal Brexit looms ever closer.Johnson once said that when it came to Brexit, he was pro cake and pro eating it. A pithy little soundbite, to be sure, but one that assumed the UK could force the EU to make compromises in our favour.It is time, surely, for us to get real about what exactly we can expect from the EU by way of a Brexit deal. And what we can expect is nothing.            Yes, the EU might be willing to give a little here or there but it will only do so when such concessions are in its interests.The European Union will, inevitably, be weakened by the United Kingdom’s departure. This will be welcomed by Russian President Vladimir Putin along with various nasty little blood and soil nationalists around the word. And that, among other reasons, means the EU will want to do all it can to discourage other member states from leaving.It simply makes no sense for the EU to send a message that says a nation may walk away from the shared responsibilities of membership and then pick and choose what parts of the relationship it wishes to maintain.Countless analogies about divorce or golf club membership have been made in pursuit of driving home this point in recent months yet the ludicrous idea that the UK has cards to play persists.Barnier had said nothing to encourage the belief that the UK can strike a deal on Brexit. Rather, his remarks should remind us that our European partners have more important things to worry about than playing along with the fantasies of right-wing ideologues who insist cake may be both had and eaten."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4772171.1532176550!/image/image.jpg","title":"sir tom devine revisiting the nation s historic bestseller","story":"        John Prebble\u0026#8217s The Highland Clearances, published for the first time in 1963, is the best-selling Scottish history book ever written, having achieved worldwide sales of more than a quarter of a million copies. It still sells well and is the most widely read text in the United States on any aspect of Scottish history.                 The book is part of his Highland trilogy, Fire And Sword, which also includes Culloden (1961) and Glencoe (1966). In the foreword to Glencoe, Prebble revealed his objective: “I have written this book because its story is, in a sense, a beginning to what I have already written about Culloden and the clearances – the destruction of the Highland people and their way of life.”            John Prebble (1915–2001) was born in England but emigrated, aged six, to Canada with his parents, later returning to the UK as a young boy of 12. It is suggested that early friendships among members of the Scottish emigrant communities in Canada first stimulated his interest in Highland history. He joined the Communist Party of Great Britain as an adult but left after the end of the Second World War. However, Prebble never lost his hostility to the human impact of market capitalism or sympathy for its victims.            Many scholars have rubbished The Highland Clearances as a work of faction, or a fusion of fact and fiction, rather than a serious history. Predictably the book rarely features in the prescribed reading lists of Scottish universities, except perhaps as an exemplar of partisan historical interpretation. I recall a colleague once setting students the essay question: “Prebble’s The Highland Clearances is not good history but it is a good novel. Discuss.”But most readers seem not to care about the ferocious criticisms which the volume has sometimes attracted from members of the academy it continues to sell well long after his death. For the general public, Prebble tells a compelling story in very readable prose presented as a dramatic saga of betrayal, loss, tragedy and forced exile of the Highland clans from their native glens which in his interpretation remain empty to this day as silent memorials of man’s inhumanity to man.The author makes his own position perfectly clear from the outset: “This is the story of how the Highlanders were deserted and then betrayed. It concerns itself with people, how sheep were preferred to them, and how bayonet, truncheon and fire were used to drive them from their homes.” The book is an accessible and fluent read, in part because the author does not even try to come to grips with any of the many challenging complexities of Highland history. Those in the dock are always the former chieftains of the clans, by the later 18th century transformed into commercial landlords, whose greed, Prebble insists, led them to sacrifice their erstwhile clansmen for filthy lucre. At root, indeed, the volume is concerned with a classic struggle between the forces of good (the defenceless people of the Highlands) and evil (the brutal landlords and their callous lackeys, the notorious factors – estate managers – of ill fame). Prebble’s perspective on clearances had been fashioned by almost a century of earlier polemic, political and fictional writing which stretched back into the Victorian era. Most of the documentation in the book relies on these earlier works with little evidence of original research by the author. Almost all of this passionate oeuvre was produced at the height of Victorian controversies about clearances between the 1840s and the 1880s. It was deeply sympathetic to the people who had been displaced, strongly supportive of the vital need for land reform and bitterly hostile to what was seen as oppressive and brutal landlordism.            It was significant too that The Highland Clearances achieved bestseller status in Scotland during the late 1960s and 1970s, when the country first began to experience the early stages of deindustrialisation and rising levels of unemployment as the postwar boom petered out and the old imperial connections which had sustained the great heavy industries faded into the past. As the country started to move politically to the left, the history of the evictions became a symbol for the emerging tragedy of an economy in decline, the social impact of deindustrialisation sometimes being described as a modern clearance.This was also the time when Scottish nationalism finally achieved some electoral purchase with Winnie Ewing’s famous victory in the Hamilton by-election of 1967. Nationalism, clearances and victimhood soon became intimately linked by some polemicists, a tendency which has continued to the present day through the proliferation of social media. The contentions were that the historic tragedy of the Gaels had taken place during the Union and sometimes also, against all the evidence, that English landowners and sheep farmers were mainly responsible for the draconian acts of eviction.Prebble himself never claimed to be a historian and always referred to himself as a historical writer. He seems to have been taken aback by the storm of criticism generated in some circles by his book, especially by the intervention of the late Professor Gordon Donaldson, a former Historiographer Royal,who bitterly denounced Prebble’s work on the Highlands as “complete rubbish”.Some thought the furore simply reflected jealousy on the part of an academic establishment whose works might be scholarly and rigorous but could never hope to achieve a fraction of Prebble’s sales. It is also fair to say that he had tackled an important and controversial subject which most historians up until that time had studiously ignored or consciously avoided. But scholars were also right to be concerned that a book which some of them believed to be riven by bias and distortion, as well as being under-researched and devoid of much critical perspective, was widely accepted by the public as the authentic chronicle of clearance.             There is indeed still much to be said about this controversial and emotive subject. In my new book The Scottish Clearances, which will be published later this year, I return to the saga of the dispossession of peasant communities, not just in the Highlands but throughout Scotland between 1600 to 1900. Based on four decades of research, writing, teaching and reflection I see it as my most ambitious and challenging project to date.Sir Tom Devine is Sir William Fraser Professor Emeritus of Scottish History and Palaeography in the University of EdinburghThe Scottish Clearances: A History Of The Dispossessed 1600-1900 will be published by Allen Lane: The Penguin Press on 4 October at £25.00"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.\n\nThe project, costing around £6 million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in 2006. Construction began in 2016 and is expected to be completed on schedule in late summer.\nLocated at Seafield the new centre is just a short distance from the long-standing Eric Gray Centre. Once opened the centre will provide specialist assistance for adults with complex care needs and learning disabilities.\nThe building has been designed by Richard Gibson Architects and construction is being led by DITT. The drone footage was shot by Nick McCaffrey.\nThe centre does indeed look good and is on schedule well done DITT , the clients and staff are all looking forward to being in the building. It has taken many years to reach this point  and is much needed.\nI wonder what, if any, proof you have that clients and staff are looking forward to being in the building? If you do have some proof to justify your claim, are they looking forward to being in before or after completion?\nGeorge Dickson\nI have along with other parents of clients that currently use the Eric Gray Centre worked hard, and against many obstacles to finally see the realisation  of a much needed new building where all clients who are at this moment in different buildings due to there being not enough space in the old building and facilities that have run there course in time. It has been a long journey for some and a hard fight to gain the ground and then keep it  for the new building. The building will provide not only better facilities and space but will also give staff the help in coordination and equipment to do there job under one roof with less strain and expense to all.\nI also claim nothing but most people that have lived in Shetland for the last 10 years will be aware of the problems associated with the Eric Gray building, whether directly involved or not although the thinking and planning of a new building goes farther back than that.\nSome parents and staff have had a look through the new building at different stages of build, and everyone to my knowledge was impressed. I like many other parents and carers look forward to the day its complete and our daughters and sons can enjoy the help and encouragement from staff to live their lives to the best of their ability.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"more seabirds entangled but fishing industry not always to blame says tour guide ","story":"\nDarron Smith cuts free a gannet.

It’s manufacture uses up valuable natural resources but this is a result of human exploitation. This begs the question, why are humans capable of natural behaviour and unnatural behaviour in what seems to be equal measure?  Is it normal and natural to drive cars, fly in ‘planes, build tower blocks, dig for coal, aim to fly to distant planet ? The list is endless. According to the experts, global warming and ice ages have occurred many times and certainly before life as we know it existed.  We are worried about what are threats to our welfare only because it is a seemingly an alien threat . Surely, if we are able to stand outside ourselves, we are now caught up in a “ normal” event. And in our short sighted stupidity we are adding to the dangers.

One of the most remarkable performances in the latter game came from Kari Arnason, recently deemed not good enough by Aberdeen but still able to do a pretty fair job on shackling Lionel Messi.\nThe introduction the Video Assistant Referee system, or VAR as it is commonly known, has caused a few talking points. There was the decision to allow Diego Costa’s first goal for Spain against Portugal, and also to award penalties to France and Sweden against Australia and South Korea respectively.\nThese “assistants” are apparently not even at the game. They are sitting in a office somewhere in Moscow, but bizarrely kitted out in full referees’ uniform!\nWhy on earth they didn’t disallow Switzerland’s equaliser against Brazil is beyond me, however. Everyone seemed to notice Steven Zuber’s push on his marker before making room for himself to head the ball home.\nEveryone that is except the boys in black in Moscow. The ITV panellists were unanimous in their opinion that the goal should have been ruled out. Even Roy Keane, who used to think decapitation was just about permissable, appeared to agree with the others.\nOkay, so we will mention the commentary and punditry.

And surely it is high time Gary Lineker was pensioned off.

The cricketer with roots connected to these parts was none other than the man of the match himself – batsman Callum MacLeod whose magnificent 140 not out was largely responsible for Scotland’s thrilling win.\nMacLeod’s father Donald attended the Anderson High School in the late 1960s and early 70s. He was a goalkeeper himself, playing for the Ness United team in the Shetland under-18 competitions.\nHe went on to make somewhat of a name for himself as a photographer, working for The Press and Journal and The Scotsman at times before establishing his own business.\nMacLeod (junior) has obviously usurped any success attained by his old man, however. Even before his recent moment of glory he has been an established international batsman, making several centuries at one-day level.\nHe has been good enough to play grade cricket in Sydney, which is no mean feat, has had stints at English counties Warwickshire and Durham and has just signed a contract with Derbyshire.\nIt is going on half a century since I last saw Donald MacLeod, but I know a certain former Whitedale goalkeeper who keeps in touch. If he happens to read this he’ll maybe pass on congratulations from me, and I’m sure a few others, to the family.\n: : : : : : : :\nTwo weeks ago I suggested that having clubs competing in a local league structure could be of great benefit to preparation for junior inter-county sports such as hockey and netball.\nWhile there is no regular junior league set-up in the isles for hockey, it has been pointed out that in netball this exists for primary school-aged players upwards.\nThe sport appears to be thriving at the various age levels, with under-13 and under-17 squads regularly competing on the mainland with success.\nThe Anderson High School team has also regularly sent a team to compete in the Scottish Schools Open competition, where they have performed with distinction over the past few years.\nThe AHS team also plays in division one of the senior netball leagues, while a feeder team called “Hotfooters” was created to provide easier access for youngsters to join the league.\nAccording to the organisers there have been over 1,000 competitive matches in Shetland and 32 competitive matches away from the isles for juniors this season in various leagues and tournaments.\nCoach Sanna Aitken says: “Of course it is disappointing that we lost the junior inter-county this year \u0026#8230 the girls were really gutted.\n“As a coach, I am delighted that the netball continues to be really competitive [with] an incredibly high standard of match demonstrating the hard work and success of the sport and junior set-up in both isles.\n“I am confident when saying the loss was nothing to do with any weaknesses in the local league structure. It just didn’t go our way on the day. Only two years ago it went Shetland’s way where we won on Orkney’s home turf.

Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildlife centre based in Lerwick.

It\u0026#8217s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.  Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.  It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion.

Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatiful structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautiful building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indifferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"rubber duck wins first bergen lerwick leg of shetland race ","story":"Espen Børresen (left) and Morten Offendal celebrate their victory.

There is no doubt the English are cute enough to take full advantage of the introduction of VAR system with three penalty kicks so far despatched by captain Harry Kane.\nPenalising defenders for holding at corners and other set pieces is, I have to say, a major step forward. This has been going on for far too long in most levels of football, and thankfully the days of pundits uttering the words “part and parcel of the game” will now be over.\nGrabbing someone in a bear hug is not football – never has been and never will be. I recall a European match some years ago when Glasgow Celtic should have had about six penalties but the referee gave none.\nWhat this needs now is for officials to be in accordance with one another. But sadly, and I can envisage a few whistlers spluttering over their cornflakes at this, the words “consistent” and “referees” are an oxymoron as far as I\u0026#8217m concerned.\nOn the subject of the English progression in the tournament, it has once again thrown up the perennial question of whether Scottish people should support their oldest rivals.\nThere are no doubt many north of the border who would find the prospect of England winning the World Cup a terrifying one. They could even be in the majority. A recent poll suggested that only 15 per cent of Scots would support the English while 28 per cent would back anyone playing against them.\nThe same survey found that only two per cent of Scottish National Party voters would get behind England, although I actually find that figure quite high.\nIt does appear to be the case that Scottish football followers have nothing against English players, many of whom they actually admire, but it is those in the press and the media who they reserve their anger for.\nI sincerely hope that England do go all the way. I have always supported them when Scotland are not involved, and in recent years that has become the norm.\nA few issues do bother me, such as the constant gormless look on Kane’s face and the insistence of manager Gareth Southgate on dressing as if he was taking part in the World Snooker Championships. Someone should tell him that waistcoats are the most pointless item of clothing known to man.\nBut hey, most of it is good. I particularly enjoy the ITV panel and even Ian Wright is growing on me!\n: : : : : : : :\nIt is just over a month since the tragic death of former Aberdeen footballer Neale Cooper and I would like to add my own tribute to the many which have been paid to such a popular man.\nThe late Neale Cooper made a memorable trip to Shetland.\nAt just 19 he was the youngest member of the 1983 European Cup Winners Cup side which defeated Real Madrid in the final at Gothenburg in Sweden.\nAlong with that memorable triumph he was in the team which won two Scottish league titles, four Scottish Cups, a league cup and the European Super Cup, all achieved before he was 24.\nHe later played for Aston Villa, Rangers, Reading, Dunfermline and Ross County, where he later became manager.\nIt was in the summer of 1999, when Ross County were invited to Shetland as guests for Scalloway’s centenary celebrations, that I had the privilege of meeting Cooper.\nThere was a gala dinner in the village hall after the friendly match where County defeated Scalloway 8-2, and he agreed to give me time for a short interview. But not until after his speech, he said, which he was dreading as he hated speaking at formal events.\nSadly the evening dragged on somewhat, with various Scalloway luminaries spending rather more time on stage than was really necessary, and it was approaching 1am when Cooper eventually got his turn.\nI decided to give up on the interview that night, and maybe catch him the following day after a game against a Shetland XI in Lerwick.\nAs I was wandering along the embankment at Gilbertson Park prior to the match I heard someone calling my name, and was surprised to see Cooper running towards me.\nHe was full of apologies about the previous evening, although he had no justification, and he said he would speak to me immediately after the game.\nThe match ended 2-2 and Cooper was generous in his praise for the opposition. Shetland were “as good as any top Highland League side”, he said.\nThe two-day visit had been excellent both from a football point of view and a social one, he added. “It’s been fantastic. We had a great welcome from Scalloway and it was an honour to be invited to their centenary celebrations. I’ve never been to Shetland before and I only found out last week that my mother had been here 40 years ago.”\nFollowing Cooper’s untimely death, and the loss of the first of the Gothenburg greats, there have been many kind words. Colleagues, writers and others have pointed out what a humble, friendly and likeable character he was.\nThey are absolutely correct.

Just because he’s the best cyclist in the world does not mean he’s benefiting from a performance-enhancing drug.\n: : : : : : : :\nWith all the buzz of the World Cup an annual competition in southwest London has almost been forgotten about.\nYes, Wimbledon is in full flow once again and the British competitors are as usual struggling to make it into the second week.\nAndy Murray was probably sensible to withdraw, citing that he was not quite ready for five-set matches after his hip operation. There were signs at Queens and Eastbourne, however, that he may be able to scale the heights once more.\nThere is of course a capable replacement in Kyle Edmund, who is seeded having reached the Australian Open semi-finals earlier this year.\nEdmund’s half of the draw looks fairly open, and he could well still be involved come Monday. But of course anything can happen, and by the time you read this he could be gone.

Any avoidable delay in receiving essential treatment is unacceptable.\n\u0026#8220Many of these passengers have been waiting for their appointments for months if not years, and have no way to access the treatment and specialists they need at home.\n\u0026#8220Travelling out with the isles for medical treatment is already stressful for vulnerable isles residents without the added anxiety caused by cancellations. Rescheduling appointments is not easy for those living in remote communities and patients may have a lengthy wait for another opportunity to travel.\n\u0026#8220The right to strike is an important one and I understand that strikes have to cause disruption in order to be effective.\n\u0026#8220But, I urge your members to carefully consider this compromise: Loganair flights from the North Isles use smaller aircraft which require a lower level of fire service cover.\n\u0026#8220Therefore, Unite members could guarantee a minimum level of fire and security coverage on the proposed strike dates, allowing life-line Orkney and Shetland flights to continue for essential medical travel.\n\u0026#8220I hope further discussions will resolve the dispute before any strike action goes ahead and that the needs of North Isles passengers are at the forefront of your decision making.\u0026#8221\nMeanwhile, Loganair is giving passengers in Shetland the chance to change their flights.\nAbout 170 members, including key airport staff, security workers and firefighters have voted in favour of striking – with more talks expected next week involving conciliation service Acas.\nTwenty-four-hour strikes are planned for Friday 20th July as well as on Thursday 2nd August and Thursday16th August.\nLoganair managing director Jonathan Hinkles said passengers could change their flights free of charge.\nHe said: “Although there is still time for the strike to be averted and we hope it will be, we are offering customers booked to fly to or from Aberdeen on the strike dates the opportunity to change their travel date or route if they wish.\n\u0026#8220This is free of charge and designed to offer certainty of alternatives for those booked to travel.\n\u0026#8220We also have contingency plans to operate Aberdeen flights to alternate airports on strike days if this does go ahead, and will announce details of those if this action cannot be averted. Our website is up to date with the latest information.”\nUnite regional officer Wullie Wallace expected talks with Acas next week. The dispute is over pay for airport workers. A total of 88 per cent of workers rejected the latest pay offer.\nThe union said members had rejected two below-inflation wage offers on the back of below inflation increases over the last two years.\nMr Wallace said: \u0026#8220Aberdeen International Airport’s latest derisory pay offer has been emphatically rejected by Unite members. The workforce for several years now has received below inflation increases and the company’s idea of rewarding its hard working employees is by offering more real terms pay cuts.\n\u0026#8220Aberdeen Airport has been investing heavily into improving the airport facilities and amenities. It’s high time for the company to invest in its employees. Unite remains open to further discussions with a view to resolving the dispute.\u0026#8221\nAn unattributed quote from an Aberdeen spokesman stated: \u0026#8220We have been informed by Unite of their intention to take industrial action on Friday 20th July.\n\u0026#8220This follows the rejection of our proposed pay offer. We believe we have made an offer that is entirely fair and reasonable and we are committed to continuing discussions to reach a resolution acceptable to all parties.\n\u0026#8220We have made contact with Acas which has agreed to mediate between both parties. We are seeking a suitable date to continue our discussions in an attempt to reach a mutually agreeable position.\n\u0026#8220We will, as a matter of course, ensure contingency plans are in place in the event of any planned industrial action.”\nI am amazed that the Scottish Government will allow a union to hold hostage urgent healthcare for 45,000 citizens in Shetland and Orkney. It is reasonable to suspect that the SNP is in the unions’ pockets.\nI can only suggest that if Christopher wants to find out who is in the ‘unions pockets’ he should investigate the connection between the Labour Party and Unite,  and while he’s at it perhaps he should refresh his memory as to what powers are reserved at Westminster and which are devolved to Holyrood.\nThere are so many reds under beds these days \u0026#8230\n My primary concern is that Shetland and Orkney folk will be at risk for a number of August days while this irresponsible union strikes.

On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great individual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois (Belgium) Benjamin Pavard (France), Raphaël Varane (France), Diego Godín (Uruguay), Ivan Strinic (Croatia) Ivan Perisic (Croatia), Luka Modric (Croatia), Jordan Henderson (England), Eden Hazard (Belgium) Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal), Edinson Cavani (Uruguay).\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the diving Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe if Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"vacancy kitchen assistant and dispatch assistant with sandwick baking co ","story":" We currently have a vacancy in our kitchen department assisting in making our range of filled products and also selected confectionery lines.\n We also have a vacancy in our dispatch department wrapping, labelling products and making up customers orders.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"blue green algae found in tingwall ","story":"Another loch has been found to contain blue green algae, this time the Loch of Griesta in Tingwall.\nNotices will be posted next to the loch warning against contact with the algal scum.\nThe SIC\u0026#8217s environmental health department received notification of the discovery from the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency.

the eye of storm in Tornado Alley","story":"Nicole Webber\n\u0026nbsp\nA storm chaser from Newtonmore had to run for cover from some of the world\u0027s most extreme weather in Tornado Alley.\nScott Duncan (24), a former Kingussie High School pupil, has just returned from his dream adventure to the United States with a team of fellow meteorologists.\nHe got up close and personal with several tornadoes and massive electric storms during the trip of a lifetime which started on May 19, with the quartet returning on Saturday.\nThe daredevil and talented photographer captured breathtaking snaps of the huge storms as they crossed Nebraska, Kansas, Colorado and Texas.\nScott told the Strathy: \"The four of us flew out to Tornado Valley in the hope to witness some of the planet\u0027s most extreme weather.\n\"We decided to put our meteorological skills together and chase the storms ourselves.\"\nThe group of Reading University graduates rented a car and travelled 7000 miles over the course of the three weeks.\n\"We do it for the buzz as we all have a passion for extreme weather and it is also a great way to hit the open road and explore new states,\" he added.\nHe agreed that it can be a dangerous hobby but not for the reasons you would think.\n\"People often think tornadoes are the main concern but lightning, giant hail stones and flash flooding are often the hazards that prove most deadly,\" he said.\n\"Careful planning before and during a storm chase is absolutely essential.\"\n\u0026nbsp\nScott now works for MetDesk, a UK-wide weather service, and he took those skills across the Pond with him.\nThe friends used the latest weather model data, satellite and radar observations and invested in a portable internet device to ensure they had the best chance of remaining connected to signal while on the move.\nScott said it is incredibly important that the driver can access accurate directions quickly when faced with dangerous and often changing conditions.\nAlthough they had a few close calls, they managed to avoid getting themselves into \"major trouble\" by knowing when to back off and take shelter.\nThe Newtonmore man explained: \"We avoided driving through storms with tennis ball sized hail stones and 70mph straight line winds.\n\"But at one point we did have to take shelter in a gas station freezer room \u0026ndash the strongest room in the building \u0026ndash due to a tornado with confirmed flying debris just upwind of us.\"\nScott admitted that storm chasing is not for the faint-hearted but that \"it is an experience\" and in the US it is becoming an increasingly popular attraction.\nBecause the adventurers did not know where they would end up at the end of the day, accommodation had to often be found late and in an obscure towns in the middle of nowhere\nScott, who is now safely back in Hertfordshire where the weather is rather less dramatic, added: \"That alone makes the trip more exciting as it holds an incredible depth of freedom.\"\nTornado Alley is the name of the area in the United States where tornadoes are most frequent.\nThe term was coined in 1952 as the title of a research project to study severe weather in areas of Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, South Dakota, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Nebraska, Colorado, North Dakota, and Minnesota.\nSunday 22 Jul 2018 7:45

Even with the introduction of new flights our air connections remain some of the most fragile across these isles.\n\u0026ldquoThe Smith Commission was very clear when it stated that: \u0026lsquothe power to charge tax on air passengers leaving Scottish airports will be devolved to the Scottish Parliament. The Scottish Government will be free to make its own arrangements regarding the design and collection of any replacement tax\u0026rsquo, yet, as we have seen time and time again with this Government, the arrangements on offer, limits the ability of the Scottish Government to make changes to benefit the Scottish economy.\u0026nbsp\nIn his response to the Highland MP, Mr Jenrick confirmed that his department was willing to work closer with the Scottish Government to find a solution to the problem, recognising the commitment outlined in the Smith Commission.\nResponding after the debate, Mr Hendry said: \u0026ldquoI am glad that the UK Government recognises it has failed to hand over APD in a workable way, and that Airport Departure Tax cannot be implemented by the Scottish Government without a solution to this problem.\n\u0026ldquoI hope that the assurances from Mr Jenrick today, are followed up by meaningful action from the UK Government, to enable the Scottish Government to introduce its reduced Airport Departure Tax, while protecting the Highlands and Islands exemption.\"\nSunday 22 Jul 2018 7:45 PM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/IMG_0946-e1530785665580.jpg","title":"harold davis 1933 2018 from the korean front line to footballing glory and a spot of fishing in wester","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n\n\nHis surname should in fact better reflect the Wester Ross area he’s called home for almost 40 years.\n“I like that to be known up here in MacKenzie country,” he notes from his home near Badachro, on the shores of Gairloch. “My mother was Catherine MacQueen Kirk, and my father was Angus Davis, though originally he was born Angus MacKenzie. The change came when my grandmother remarried, and so then the family name became Davis.”\nFor 37 years “MacKenzie country” has been his base, and these days it’s fishing rather than football which is his passion. Yet before making the move north with wife Vi to build the Craigmore Hotel in Gairloch, Harry Davis had enjoyed a remarkable sporting life — recovering from multiple bullet wounds in the Korean War to carve out a glittering football career with Rangers.\nTalk about “dual contracts” may have loomed large over Scottish football in recent months, but here was one ex-professional who really knew what it was like to serve two paymasters.\nA native Fifer, but brought up in Perth, Harry was an emerging talent with East Fife when he signed up as part of his national service to join the Black Watch. He soon found himself in the thick of the bloody, but often forgotten, Korean War where in the midst of conflict he suffered injuries from which it would take him over two years to recover.\nRemarkably, not only did he return to full health, he resumed his football career with gusto — signing for Rangers in 1956. He would enjoy a memorable eight-year spell with the Ibrox club, winning three league titles, two league cups and a Scottish Cup, as well as playing in the first Scottish side to reach a European final.\nA fearsome defender known as the “Iron Man”, he was never one to shirk a tackle on the pitch, and he’s not afraid to offer an opinion off it either — as he documents in a compelling autobiography which recently hit the bookshelves.\nHis is a tale far removed from the anodyne offerings served up by today’s breed of pampered millionaires. Having witnessed and experienced what he did on the battlefield, it’s hardly surprising that Davis had little time for those less appreciative of their sporting talents.\nTake, for example, the Rangers and Scotland great Jim Baxter.\n“I don’t dispute Baxter’s talent — he was a class player, but he wasted it,” he says ruefully. “He got privileges no one else got and it upset a lot of players in the team. He only turned it on once every three games and for the rest of the time, when your backs were to the wall, Baxter was nowhere to be seen.”\nHe describes Willie Waddell, the man who led Rangers to their only European trophy, as a “lucky manager” who had used his position as a sportswriter to undermine predecessor David White — a man Harry Davis had returned to Ibrox to assist.\n\nIT SEEMS CLEAR that wartime experience — and the discipline and work ethic it instilled — would leave a lasting imprint on everything Harry Davis did thereafter. But, ironically, his prowess on the football field might actually have spared him from active service altogether.\nHis military call came just after he had broken into East Fife’s excellent post-war team under Scott Symon — the man who would later bring him to Ibrox. And he adds: “I had a couple of opportunities, one to be a PTI in the army, and the other to take an airborne course.\n“It was all a scam to get you to play in the army team and I turned them all down. I was quite happy to go and thought it was all a bit of an adventure.”\nThat sense of wide-eyed wonder would soon give way to the full-blooded horrors of war, as he found himself fighting off Chinese forces intent on advancing further south on the Korean peninsula.\nHe remembers that many caught in the thick of the fighting were simple conscripts — scarcely prepared for the brutality they would encounter. Indelibly marked in his memory is the image of one desperate soldier running deliberately into enemy fire and to his death.\n“He was away with the birds,” he added. “I tried to stop him, but just at that moment a shell landed on top of our trench — all the hairs on the back of my hand were singed, but we were sheltered and escaped the full impact. But by the time I got up he was off again, and disappeared.\n“I couldn’t do anything about it, but that stayed with me. You can’t blame the guy — he was just a conscript as well.\n“There was always a little bit of ill feeling in that these conscripts were shipped out to the battlefield, yet regular, more experienced soldiers from the Black Watch were left behind in Germany.”\nHarry’s contribution to the war effort ended in the spring of 1953, though to this day he has no idea where the bullets which left him wounded actually came from. Years later, a former colleague contacted him to say he believed he had been responsible.\n“I said to him it might have been him, it might not have been. Who knows? But everyone was in a state of panic, and again we go back to conscripts. I certainly wouldn’t place any blame on him.”\nThe stray bullets had caught him on the back of the foot — fracturing his heel, but mercifully just missing the Achilles tendon. Having also suffered abdominal damage, Harry Davis would spend months recuperating in a Japanese hospital before returning to the UK to continue a slow road to recovery.\nIn the far east a nursing sister from Stornoway would become something of an inspiration, but it is Harry’s biggest regret that on leaving Japan he would never see the woman again.\n“She was marvellous and encouraged me so much through all the operations, the bad nights and bad days,” he added. “I made a point that I would go and see her, and when I built the hotel up here I thought I’d be able to find her. I only knew her as Sister MacKenzie, but she was from Stornoway and I believe she had something to do with the Post Office over there.\n“But then I did hear from one source that she had died — I never got to make contact with her. It’s one of the great disappointments of my lifetime.”\nON HARRY’S RETURN HOME doctors gave him little hope of ever playing top-level football again — sometimes in fairly graphic terms.\n“One doctor at the military hospital in London told me that my only hope was that my bowels were in such a state, defenders were likely to slip on what would come out! It didn’t look very encouraging.”\nYet after being helped back to fitness by David Kinnear — a physiotherapist and former Ibrox player — Harry Davis would eventually get his career back on track.\nHe resumed action for East Fife, and in 1956 got the call from Symon to follow him to Ibrox.\nIn Glasgow, he initially learned the ropes in the reserve side — one of his memorable early encounters bringing him into direct contact with the Celtic legend Charlie Tully, who by this time was at the opposite stage of his career.\nBefore too long Davis would join a first-team pool that included vintage names likes George Young, George Niven, Sammy Baird and Alex Scott, and Rangers lifted the league at the end of his first full season in 1957.\nIn something of a golden era for the Scottish game, Davis regularly played in front of crowds topping the 100,000 mark, and he remembers a vibrant and competitive league where in his first few years the main challenge came from a Hearts team which claimed two league titles.\n“If we had fewer than 40,000 at a game it was a disaster,” he said. “But regularly the crowds were 60-70,000 and for big games the 100,000-mark wasn’t unusual.”\nA degree of European success followed, as Rangers reached the European Cup Winners Cup Final in 1961. There they would be outclassed by a fine Fiorentina side, and tellingly Harry feels the Scots simply refused to heed their continental lesson. Half a century on, and the same basic mistakes continue to be made.\n“They were ahead of us,” he said. “Scott Symon was a great manager, no question, but he didn’t keep up with modern techniques. He still said get the ball to the winger, get the winger up the field and cross it and get the centre forward to head it into the net. That worked in the old days, but it didn’t work when you played these continental teams.”\nAfter winding down his playing career with a season at Partick Thistle, Harry took the manager’s job at the grand old institution of Queens Park. It was a time he enjoyed immensely, though the lure of Ibrox once again tempted him back across the city — this time to hook up with White.\nThat spell in the dugout was to prove less successful than his playing days, with Rangers then in the shadow of Jock Stein’s great Celtic side. Yet some redemption would arrive at Dundee where White and Davis led the Dens Park club to a memorable league cup final triumph over Celtic in 1973. A few months later the pair gained revenge over their old nemesis Waddell, dumping Rangers out of the Scottish Cup at Ibrox.\nDundee would prove to be Harry’s last staging post in football — and thereafter he set his sights on the quiet life in the north west Highlands.\nTHESE DAYS his football involvement is limited to appearing alongside former team-mates at charity fundraisers for the Erskine Trust, for which he is also to donate most of the proceeds from his book. However, he still keeps one eye on developments at Ibrox, even if he struggles to comprehend the team’s recent high-profile fall from grace.\n“The honest answer is that I just don’t know what to make of it all,” he said. “One conclusion is reached one week, and a week later it’s turned around again. But I do believe a number of teams were quite happy to get rid of them because they were strong competition. I don’t think that was right.”\nAsked for his personal highlights in the game, his answer is a simple one.  He just reels off a list of the players he played with, and it reads like a who’s who of greats for fans of the Ibrox club.\n“I joined Rangers and played with George Young, George Niven, Baird, Billy Simpson, Bobby Shearer, Alex Scott, Jim McColl — a great team. And then by the end I had also played with John Greig, Ronnie MacKinnon, Ian MacMillan, Millar, Brand, Baxter and Wilson. How many people can say that?”\nA Scotland cap may have proved elusive — “in those days they only picked 11” — with a place on the reserve list as close as he got to pulling on the dark blue.\nNevertheless, Harry Davis had long since proved his mettle on the international stage — and he still has the scars to prove it.\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/7s.jpg","title":"comhairle must replace barra housing","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\nComhairle nan Eilean Siar must replace land they gave away for housing in Castlebay, Barra, because it was meant to be kept in perpetuity for recreational use.\nLast month, Housing Minister Kevin Stewart cut the turf on the Corran Ciosmul development at Horve. However, the six houses are to be built on what was a King George V Playing Field, which was set aside and protected in 1962.\nFor anyone to build on this land they must notify and obtain the consent of Fields in Trust, a charity that acts to protect all KGV land. Even though the comhairle took over the management of the land in 1984 they must still obtain the trust’s consent.\nThe Barra Sports Forum have been pressing the comhairle for years to transfer a piece of derelict land near the Co-op, which is adjacent to the KGV area, for use as an all-weather pitch.\nA spokesman said: “The sports forum urge the comhairle to fulfil their legal and moral obligations to the people of Barra and Vatersay to protect the sports and recreation land in Horve by righting this wrong: firstly, by filing for a change of land use to Fields in Trust from ‘sports and recreation’ to ‘housing’ and secondly, by transferring an equivalent area of land to the KGV playing field in compensation for land lost to housing. Only by doing this will the comhairle avoid the danger of stalling the desperately needed new housing that helps secure the future of our islands.”\nRichard McKeever of Fields in Trust the charity recognised that that “sometimes it may be necessary” to change the use of recreational land.\nHe added: “As part of our protection, we have a responsibility to ensure the local owners and managers of these spaces seek our consent to undertake any changes regarding land ownership, land transactions, erection of buildings and structures \u0026#8211 and that proposed changes fit with the purpose of the protected space and benefit its recreational use. We are currently in constructive dialogue with the council and await their proposals for replacement recreational land of an equal or better standard which will be protected for the local community to enjoy in perpetuity.”\nThe housing development at Corran Ciosmul is being undertaken by the Hebridean Housing Partnership, which has owned the land since 2006.\nKatrina Rowlands, HHP development manager, said: “Due to the nature of how the titles were transferred to HHP, the burden in relation to the Fields in Trust was not recorded therefore the responsibility to meet the Fields in Trust conditions remains with the comhairle. We are aware that the comhairle’s legal team are in discussions with Fields In Trust to resolve the matter.”\nA spokesman for the comhairle said discussion with Fields in Trust were continuing.\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/homeinthehighlands17-2-360x100.jpg","title":"top four prepare to lock horns in ross cup","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\nThe top four teams in the Skye and Lochalsh League will meet this weekend with two places in the Ross Cup Final up for grabs.\nLast season\u0026#8217s league champions Kyleakin will travel to Broadford to play Sleat and Strath, while Mallaig host Portree Juniors in the early kick-off.\n\n In what is their debut season in the Skye and Lochalsh Football Association, Mallaig have made a marked impression in the league \u0026#8211  where they currently sit fourth \u0026#8211 and in the associated cup competitions \u0026#8211 in which they are seeking to reach their second final today.\nWith six wins from their eight league fixtures so far, the Lochaber side are keeping pace with the top teams in the league.

The blues, however, will be keen to avoid a repeat of their performance in the final which saw Kyleakin run out 4-1 winners in a disappointing and underwhelming showing by Mallaig.\n\n \u0026#8220Another tough game for us, but it’s the type of games we wanted to be involved in at the start of the season. We now have a great opportunity to make a second cup final this season.\n\u0026#8220The season, in general, has been a learning experience but a very enjoyable one. The lads have picked up a lot quite quickly and we have had some good wins this season especially on our travels. It’s good to be back playing at home especially in such a big game, especially after being away for so long\n\u0026nbsp\nWith four wins from their last five matches in all competitions, and 37 goals scored in the process, Juniors have really hit their stride and will approach their third meeting with Mallaig with great confidence.\nNow just four points point off leaders Sleat and Strath with one game in hand, Phil McCaherty will hope his team can transmit their impressive league form into today\u0026#8217s cup match against the only side who have beaten them domestically this season.\nWhile Juniors\u0026#8217 recent free-scoring display will have given Mallaig some food for thought in their preparations for the match, the Portree side must avoid the lapses in concentration which cost them in their heavy defeats at home against Mallaig in the league and Loch Ness in the Highland Amateur Cup.\n\nIt\u0026#8217s a tough task for us away to Mallaig who have beaten us twice already 5-2 and 6-0. We are going with the same squad (minus Angie MacPherson and Paul MacKinnon) that played GA United in last round, with Nick Flanagan added for goalkeeping duties to free up backup goalie Will Brown to his normal defensive duties. I am hoping that David Potter doesn\u0026#8217t get lost this week!\u0026#8221\n\nIt\u0026#8217s been a fantastic season so far for the Broadford-based side who are the current league leaders, joint top scorers, and have the meanest defence to boot.\nWith an average of 5.2 goals a game in the league, Sleat and Strath have developed a ruthlessness in front of goal and appeared to have a strong belief when they take to the pitch that they can beat any team whether it be at home or away. Their most recent win in which they turned a 3-0 lead at half-time into an emphatic 12-0 victory in last week\u0026#8217s quarter-final tie against much-improved Glenelg is evidence they have the weapons to transform a tight match into a comfortable victory.\nHaving put in impressive defensive displays against both Kyleakin and Portree Juniors in the league, DL MacKinnon\u0026#8217s team have proven they can stand firm when required against tough opponents. That said, he will still be mindful of his side\u0026#8217s loss in their last semi-final encounter against Mallaig \u0026#8211 in what has been their only defeat so far this season \u0026#8211  and will be keen to avoid missing out on a second final.\n\n \u0026#8220It\u0026#8217s going to be a battle at our tight pitch. Key to the result will be our ability to defend set plays, which is not our strong point as we are a very small team. If we can keep Gordy (Mccarroll) and Innis (Thompson) quiet we will hopefully cause them problems with our pace.\u0026#8221\n\u0026nbsp\nWith Sleat and Strath having burst out of the blocks in the league and new boys Mallaig also making their mark, it is perhaps easy to overlook the fact that Kyleakin is not only very much in contention for the league title but have already won a piece of silverware this season with a convincing victory over Mallaig in the GF MacRae Cup.\nWith 22 goals in their last three matches, which included their 10-2 quarter-final win over Kyle, the reigning league champions know how to win games, and ultimately trophies. As well as being well-deserved, their 4-1 victory in the GF MacRae Cup Final against Mallaig was a superb example of game-management against difficult opponents on a big occasion.\nAlthough Kyleakin have put themselves in a good position to challenge on all fronts, they will have to address their inconsistency this season which has seen them held to draws recently by Glenelg and GA United.\nWith back-to-back matches coming up against Sleat and Strath in the cup, then the league, the reigning champions will look to draw on their past successes in the big games.\nBy Adam Gordon\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Campbell-Stewart-MacLennan-Co.jpg","title":"recruitment highlighted as a priority at first emergency services","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n\nRepresentatives of all the emergency services on Skye held their first ever partnership meeting in Broadford last week to discuss how they can support each other.\nPictured (left to right) are Dave Philips from the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, Nick Mort from the British Red Cross, Station Manager Mike Colliar from the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, Sgt Andrew Shaw from Police Scotland, Neil Urquhart from Skye Mountain Rescue, Inspector Lynda Allan from Police Scotland, Area Service Manager Alan Knox of Scottish Ambulance Service.

We are so very proud of her for being so strong and powering through this whole thing so far.\n  \n“This is by no means the end of Zoe\u0027s journey as she still has a lot of issues to deal with from the tumour, but it is the end of this part of her treatment which will hopefully do its job and stop anymore regrowth.\n  \n“At the end of treatment in Jacksonville every patient gets the chance to ring the bell (or chime) and it is so lovely to watch.”\n  \nIn her graduation speech Zoe said: “I would like to thank my amazing family, I am so grateful that they have supported me through my journey.”\n  \nShe also thanked the staff of the centre and everyone at home for all their support.\n  \nOver the last few months the local community has been rallying together to raise funds for Zoe and her family. \n  \n Michelle commented: “We can\u0027t thank everyone enough from family, friends, complete strangers, schools and local businesses for all their amazing love and support.\n  \n“Zoe still has a long way to go but with everyone behind her we know our girl will be ok. She has been a tower of strength since her diagnosis and during her time in America and we are so very proud of her.”\n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_866187.jpg--.jpg?1531813044000\n","title":"kittens get new home after being found by passer by","story":"  \nFOUR kittens have been rehomed after they were dumped at the side of the road in Portglenone.\n  \nThe black and white kittens were found in a box behind a hedge by good samaritan, Darren McFetridge.\n  \nDarren had been out on Thursday evening (July 5) walking his dogs around 7pm in Portglenone Forest.\n  \nHe went into the forest with his two dogs and around half an hour later when he was returning to his car he saw two of the kittens wandering around the road.\n  \nSpeaking to the , Darren said he immediately started looking for more kittens.\n  \nOn closer inspection he found two more kittens in a box behind the hedge.\n  \nThe cardboard box they were in seemed fresh as if it hadn\u0027t been there that long, Darren explained.\n  \n\n  \nDumped\n  \n\n  \nI think whoever dumped the kittens has possibly done it in the time that I was in the forest because I would have noticed them on my way in.\n  \nI think it is really sad that people will do this to poor, defenceless animals. \n  \nIt would have taken the person five minutes to bring them to a vets and they would have been rehomed without a shadow of a doubt.\n  \nDespite the kittens being left at the spot on the Gortgole Road they appeared to have been unharmed and \u0027perfectly healthy\u0027.\n  \nDarren waited on a friend to come and meet him where he found the kittens so they could transport them to Parklands Vets.\n  \n\n  \nRehomed\n  \n\n  \nThe vets confirmed to the Ballymena  that all four kittens were rehomed by the following morning.\n  \nA staff member at the vets said: All the kittens were perfectly healthy and they have now gone to a good home.\n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_866293.jpg--.jpg?1531813307000\n","title":"ballymena nursery gets a gold star report","story":"  \n BALLYMENA Nursery School has received a glowing report by the Education and Training Inspectorate (Eti).\n  \nThe report gave the nursery school the highest award for overall effectiveness with “a high level of capacity for sustained improvement”.\n  \nIt follows an inspection of the nurserys at Trostan Avenue, Ballymena which was carried out on April 26.\n  \nIn the report the inspectors commented that the nursery school leadership “understand fully the changing needs of the children and wider community”.\n  \nJust last year the nursery school celebrated its 50th anniversary with a community party.\n  \nAs it sits on the site where Ballymena Castle once stood, the celebrations involved a “castle theme” with knights, princesses, court jesters, balloon modelling and face painting.\n  \nThe inspectors also commented that parent\u0027s written comments “praised the staff\u0027s dedicated professionalism and care in meeting the children\u0027s individual needs” and highlighted the nursery\u0027s positive reputation within and contribution to the community.\n  \nThe staff comments “endorsed the supportive and productive working relationships at all levels and the caring and positive strategic leadership of the principal”.\n  \nThe inspectors reported that both indoors and outdoors, the staff provide a “stimulating, richly resourced and well organised learning environment the wide range of authentic and natural resources and displays are easily accessed by the children to progress their self-reliance and to promote their active interest”.\n  \nThe inspectors also commented: “The children\u0027s personal, social and emotional development is a key strength.
