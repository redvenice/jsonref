Taliban leader Mullah Mohammad Omar lived as a virtual hermit, refusing visits from his family and filling notebooks with jottings in an imaginary language according to the book\u0027s authorAt one point, a US patrol approached as Omar and Omari were in the courtyard. Alarmed, the two men ducked behind a wood pile, but the soldiers passed without entering.A second time, US troops even searched the house but did not uncover the concealed entrance to his secret room.Omar decided to move when the US started building Forward Operating Base Lagman in 2004, just a few hundred metres from his hideout.He later moved to a second building but soon afterwards the Pentagon constructed Forward Operating Base Wolverine - home to 1,000 US troops, and where American and British special forces were sometimes based - close by.          Omar decided to move when the US started building Forward Operating Base Lagman in 2004          Omar later moved to a second building but soon afterwards the Pentagon constructed Forward Operating Base Wolverine (pictured)He dared not move again, Dam says, rarely even going outside and often hiding in tunnels when US planes flew over.Though he listened to the BBC\u0027s evening Pashto-language news broadcasts, even when he learned about the death of al-Qaeda supremo Osama Bin Laden Omar rarely commented on the outside world, the book says.The book goes on to claim that Omar became ill in 2013, did not see a doctor and refused to travel to Pakistan for treatment, later dying in Zabul.The allegations sparked mixed reactions, with the Afghan government quick to deny the claims.\u0027We strongly reject this delusional claim and we see it as an effort to create and build an identify for the Taliban and their foreign backers,\u0027 tweeted Haroon Chakhansuri -- a spokesman for the Afghan presidency.

The militants kept his death secret for two years.The latest account of Omar\u0027s life comes as the Taliban and US are holding ongoing peace talks aimed at bringing an end to the nearly 18-year conflict.The US and Taliban have remained tight-lipped about the most recent round of talks in Doha, which have been ongoing for two weeks, sparking expectations that they may be inching closer to a deal."},{"url":null,"title":"Hindu man claims ate beef wrongly labelled lamb asks Countdown pay flights","story":"    Jaswinder Paul (pictured) claims he bought meat wrongly labelled as lamb from Countdown Blenheim on New Zealand\u0027s South Island in September when it was allegedly beef insteadBy eating beef, Mr Paul said he broke his religious vow and needed to be flown back to India to be \u0027purified\u0027 by priests, stuff.co.nz reported. \u0027According to my religion, I have to go back to my country and do sacred things for four to six weeks, and be purified by priests, so I can continue on my religious path.

Mr Clifford said he wanted the very best for his pub The Flitch of Bacon in Little Dunmow, EssexNearly £23,000 worth of seating and £12,000 worth of tables were not fit for purpose or so bulky that they did not fit properly into the space intended, he said.Some chairs broke when people sat on them, he claimed, while tables became unsightly quickly.\u0027It now appears from Jo Frances Ltd\u0027s disclosure that she purchased cheap residential furniture from a \u0027homeware\u0027 supplier,\u0027 he claimed.He continued: \u0027The layout design for the restaurant as designed by Jo Frances Ltd, and installed using the large non-fitting furniture provided by the company, did not fit into the space available and only provided room for 52 covers.\u0027The entire design had to be re-done by a replacement designer - with furniture that fitted and a workable table plan - to achieve the required number of covers.\u0027A wooden pergola supplied for the garden did not fit the space it was intended for, while the bar floor tiles cracked and had to be replaced, he added.In the bedrooms, Mr Clifford expected bespoke fittings to a luxury standard, which would allow premium rates to be charged, the barrister continued.However, the furnishings were \u0027incomplete and of a poor quality,\u0027 so that additional furniture and furnishings had to be purchased.          Through his restaurant Midsummer House, Mr Clifford has held two Michelin stars since 2005He said the floorspace was reduced due to planning requirements and because of the owner\u0027s decision to re-arrange the plan in order to emphasise the pub element of the business.\u0027The consequences of that was that the number of covers that could be accommodated without modification of the design fell from 62 to 52,\u0027 he said.There was nothing wrong with the tables and chairs which were provided, he said, and \u0027no evidence that the chairs broke as a result of some inherent weakness\u0027.          Mr Clifford was in 2015-16 named Chefs\u0027 Chef of the Year at the AA awardsThe pergola did not fit because speakers had been fitted in the courtyard which were not on the architectural drawings, while floor tiles failed because the underfloor was not properly prepared by other contractors.He continued: \u0027No intelligible explanation has ever been given as to the way in which the bedrooms were \u0027of mediocre appearance\u0027 or not to a \u0027luxury standard\u0027.\u0027There is no evidence at all that the rooms could not be let out at any particular rate owing to the standard of their decoration.\u0027The bar-restaurant was redesigned by Teresa Azevedo Coutinho in 2016, but the work went far beyond rectifying alleged defects in Jo Frances\u0027 work, he said.\u0027It is submitted that it is plain from considering the evidence in the round that the defendant is simply raising a cloud of meritless objections to avoid paying Jo Frances\u0027 legitimate invoices,\u0027 he added.Through his Cambridge restaurant, Midsummer House, Mr Clifford has held two Michelin stars since 2005, and was in 2015-16 named Chefs\u0027 Chef of the Year at the AA awards.Last November, Mr Clifford said drug dealers were operating outside Midsummer House because of a lack of police. He posted footage online of an alleged drug deal to highlight the problem after police failed to respond to his complaints.Mr Clifford has twice been one of the winners of the BBC\u0027s annual Great British Menu competition, which sees top chefs compete against each other to serve dishes at prestigious banquets.

May is due to meet EU...Demonstrators protest outside the Royal Courts of Justice...Share this articleAnd there are a host of top Tories ready to step into her shoes whenever she finally decides that she can take the country - and the Conservative Party - no further.Here we look at the runners and riders, with their odds with Ladbrokes and how they voted in the 2016 referendum:Boris Johnson: The long-running thorn in May\u0027s side  who has recently had a \u0027prime ministerial\u0027 makeover          Boris Johnson has undergone a prime ministerial makeover  as Theresa May\u0027s days appeared increasingly numbered Former foreign secretary and mayor of LondonVoted leave and has become an increasingly hardline Brexiteer As likely to make headlines over his private lifeHas recently lost a lot of weight and smartened up his appearanceLeadership odds 41 The former foreign secretary who quit last July and has been tacitly campaigning for the leadership ever since returning to the backbenches with a regular stream of attacks on Mrs may and her Brexit strategy.Never far from the limelight it is his private life that has seen him most in the news recently after splitting from his wife Marina and embarking on a relationship with a former Conservative communications staffer 20 years his junior.But as an increasingly hawkish Brexiteer who says we should not be afraid of leaving without a deal he is hugely popular with the party faithful.In recently weeks he has further boosted his frontrunner credentials with what might be deemed a ‘prime ministerial’ makeover.He has lost weight and taming his unruly mop of blonde hair into something approaching the haircut of a serious senior statesman.Michael Gove: The boomerang cabinet minister who has a machiavellian reputation          Michael Gove, pictured in Downing Street today, has made a remarkable political comeback after being sacked by Theresa May in 2016Leading Vote Leave figure in 2016 who now backs PM\u0027s Brexit dealFormer journalist, 51,  who stood for leadership in 2016Was sacked as education minister by Theresa MayLater returned as Environment MinisterLeadship  odds 51A Brexiteer with a machiavellian reputation after the 2016 leadership campaign in which he first supported Boris Johnson for the leadership and then stood against him, to their mutual disadvantage.The former education secretary -  sacked by Mrs May -  was rehabilitated to become a right-on environment secretary - complete with reusable coffee cups and a strong line on food standards after Brexit.Despite being a former lead figure in the Vote Leave campaign alongside Mr Johnson the former journalist and MP for Surrey Heath has swung behind Mrs May\u0027s Brexit deal.But while he noisily supports the deal - he views the alternatives as worse he is quieter when it comes to supporting the Prime Minister and practically mute when it comes to her future.Seen as one of the Cabinet\u0027s strongest political thinkers and having stood once it is unthinkable that he would not stand again.Dominic Raab: Brexiteer who quit rather than back Mrs May\u0027s deal          Dominic Raab has become a cheerleader for a hard Brexit since stepping down as Brexit secretary in NovemberShortlived Brexit secretary last year, replacing David Davis in the hot seat But walked in November over terms agreed by PMVoted for Brexit in 2016Leadership odds 81 Mr Raab, 45, is another Vote Leave member who became Brexit secretary after David Davis quit alongside Mr Johnson last July over the Chequers plan.But he lasted just a matter of months before he too jumped ship, saying he could not accept the terms of the deal done by the Prime Minister.Like Mr Johnson and Mr Davis he has become an increasingly hardline Brexiteer, sharing a platform with the DUP\u0027s Arlene Foster and suggesting we should not be afraid of a no-deal Brexit.The Esher and Walton MP\u0027s decision to quit in November, boosted his popularity with party members but he lacks the wider popular appeal of Mr Johnson.And like Mr Johnson he might benefit from having quit the Cabinet at an earlier stage and dissociating himself with the dying days of the May administration. On Sunday he was asked on Sky News\u0027s Sophy Ridge on Sunday programme if Mrs May would still be Prime Minister by Christmas, saying: \u0027I don\u0027t know. She has said she is going to step down. I would like to be able to see her do that in a way which is in terms of her own choosing.\u0027 And asked today if he’d like to be prime minister, he said: ‘Never say never.’ Sajid Javid: Remainer star who has run into trouble over knife crime and refugees          Sajid Javid has seen his stock take a hit in recent weeks over the knife crime crisis and migrants crossing the English Channel in small boatsThe most senior cabinet contenderVoted Remain but wants to see Brexit deliveredFaced criticism as Home Secretary But has taken a hard line on Shamima Begum case Leadership odds 81The Home Secretary, a Remainer who wants to see Brexit delivered, was the leading candidate from inside the Cabinet to replace Mrs May.After replacing Amber Rudd last year he consciously put clear ground between himself and the Prime Minister on issues like caps on skilled migrants after Brexit.But his credentials have taken a hit in recent weeks. He finds himself facing ongoing criticism of his handling of the knife crime crisis affecting UK cities, which sparked a cabinet row over funding for police.He also lost face over his handling of the influx of migrants crossing the English Channel in January, being seen to move slowly in realising the scale of the problem.But more recently the 49-year-old Bromsgove MP has made a serious of hardline decision designed to go down well with Tory voters.Most notably they have included moving to deprive London teenager turned Jihadi bride Shamima Begum, 19, of her British citizenship, after she was discovered among former Islamic State members in a Syrian refugee camp.Jeremy Hunt: Remainer turned Brexiteer unity candidate who wants to heal the party          Jeremy Hunt, a born-again Brexiteer after supporting Remain, is said to have been promoting himself as a unity candidate for a ided partyThe Foreign Secretary voted Remain But has become an increasingly vocal BrexiteerBacks May\u0027s dealHas approached ministers about running as a unity candidateLeadership odds 101 The Foreign Secretary who has undergone a Damascene conversion to the Brexit cause in with a series of hardline warnings to the EU.The 52-year-old South West Surrey MP is the most senior Cabinet minister in contention.He has reportedly been selling himself to colleagues as a unity candidate who can bring together the fractious Tory factions into something approaching a cohesive party.On Sunday he issued a stark warning to Tory MPs that they risk losing Brexit altogether if they fail to back Theresa May\u0027s deal in the crunch Commons vote on Tuesday.Mr Hunt said there was now \u0027wind in the sails\u0027 of the opponents of Brexit and that it would be \u0027devastating\u0027 for the Conservatives if they failed to deliver on their commitment to take Britain out of the EU.A long-serving health secretary, he replaced Mr Johnson as the UK\u0027s top diplomat and has won some plaudits over issues like the imprisonment of British mother Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe in Iran.But critics point to tub-thumpingly comparing the EU to the USSR at the party conference last year - which was very badly received in Brussels - and a gaffe in which he referred to his Chinese wife  as \u0027Japanese\u0027 as a reception in China.Nevertheless he is seen as a safe if uninspiring pair of hands.Andrea Leadsom: May\u0027s former leadership rival who has not let collective responsibility stop her speaking out          Ms Leadsom is a Brexiteer who frequently clashes with Speaker John BercowThe Commons\u0027 Leader challenged May in 2016Voted for Brexit Hosted Brexiteer \u0027pizza party\u0027 plot last year Increasingly outspoken BrexiteerLeadership odds 161 The Commons’ Leader stood against Mrs May for the party leadership in 2016 before conceding defeat before it was put to a vote of MPs.As collective responsibility has largely broken down among ministers she had been an increasingly vocal and clear Brexiteer voice in the Cabinet along line similar lines to Mr Johnson and Mr Raab.She was reportedly the host of a Brexiteer ‘pizza party’ in Parliament as the vying wings of the Cabinet plotted last year to shape the Brexit deal they wanted.In her role as Commons’ Leader she frequently clashes with Speaker John Bercow, something that will do her no harm among the Tory backbenches where he is widely loathed.Jacob Rees-Mogg: the old-fashioned Tory who led attempts to topple Mrs May but failed to remove her            Mr Rees-Mogg is a hardline Brexiteer but has suggested he could back a deal depending on what concessions Mrs May winsChairman of the European Research GroupWell-known for his old-fashioned mannerisms Led attempots to topple the PM last year but failedHas since suggested he could support a deal on the Irish backstop But only if the PM wins concessions from BrusselsLeadership odds 161 The leader of the European Research Group of Tory Brexiteers has an almost cult following.Known for his old-fashioned manners and clothing he played a lead role in attempts to topple Mrs May in December last year.Once the hardest of opponents to the Irish border backstop he has slightly thawed in his opposition in recent weeks.In the face of concern that Brexit could be delayed or stopped altogether he has hinted that he (and much of the ERG) could support a deal if Mrs May achieve certain concessions - which she has let to achieve.The Somerset MP has brushed off the chances of him running for the leadership but he remains a popular figure in the party, although some feel that he may be too eccentric.Amber Rudd: The former home secretary brought back to sort out benefits mess who became a Remainer rebel leader          Ms Rudd has emerged as the senior voice of Remainers in the Cabinet after her return to the top table of politicsHas publicly called for Brexit to be delayed in order to achieve a deal with BrusselsThe Hastings MP, 55, has refused to rule out resigning if the Government backs a no-deal BrexitMs Rudd was brought back into Government to sort out the benefits systemShe had quit as Home Secretary over the Windrush scandal Leadership odds 201 Ms Rudd was forced to quit as Home Secretary last year over the Windrush scandal which saw British citizens, many of them old-aged pensioners, wrongly sent ‘back’ to foreign countries they had left as small children.She was brought back as Work and Pensions Secretary after Esther McVey quit, with the dubious honour of having to sort out the widely criticised Universal Credit system.Since then the Hastings MP has found herself at the heart of a Remainer cell in the heart of the Cabinet.Last month she linked up with Justice Secretary David Gauke and Business Secretary Greg Clark to call for a delay to Brexit if a deal cannot be hammered out by March 29.She has also consistently refused to rule out resigning if the Government decided to go for a no-deal Brexit.It’s unlikely she could get much support among the Brexiteer wing of the party.David Davis: The confident Brexit bulldog with an eye on the top prize          The former Brexit secretary does not lack confidence but may struggle to get the backing of large numbers of MPs or the Tory membershipFormer Brexit secretary turned opponent of Theresa MayWas the first top level minister to quit last JulyBrexiteer who has made no secret of his desire to lead the party, aged 70 Leadership odds 201 As Brexit secretary David Davis was lampooned by opponents as the ‘Brexit bulldog’ who oozed confidence if not ability.Mr Davis was the first minister to make a Brexit-themed jump from Mrs May’s ship Government last July, followed by his deputy Steve Baker and then by Mr Johnson.Since then he has followed them into a position of extreme Brexiteer opposition to her strategic direction, talking down the risks of no-deal and arguing the Uk needs to take a firmer line with the EU in order to get concessions.Not short of self-believe, when asked last month by Tatler if he had the right credentials to be leader he replied: ‘Yes. And if this were an application for a job as a chief executive, I would probably win it.‘But it isn’t. And that isn’t the way the decision is done.’ Penny Mordaunt: The highly regarded Brexiteer trying to carve out a niche in international development          Ms Mordaunt is an outsider for the leadership but is highly thought of in Brexiteer groupsThe MP for Portsmouth North is a Royal Navy reservistHighly regarded in Brexiteer circles She has been consistently tipped to quit over Brexit but remains in the Cabinet Has come up with ideas to change the way foreign aid is spent Leadership odds 331 The International Development Secretary is an outside bet but is highly regarded in Brexiteer circles. The Royal Navy reservist, 46, has attempted to carve out a niche at International Development with some eye-catching suggests about changing how the UK spends disperses aid cash.Last month the Portsmouth North MP demanded a major overhaul so less of the UK\u0027s £14.1billion aid budget was handed out through staff at international agencies.She wants to use the cash to fund specific projects chosen by Britain with more oversight to make sure money is not wasted.Over the last few months she has been at the heart of persistent rumours that she will be the next Brexit-supporting minister out the door over Brexit.She has so far remained in the Cabinet but there is little time remaining for any ministers considering their position to make the change, so expect the rumours to continue as Brexit approaches.‘Next negotiation will be for Bake Off’: Tory MPs suggest PM’s days are numbered | Politics | The GuardianMinister claims \u0027only two\u0027 Cabinet members support Theresa May as she faces growing pressure to quit over BrexitDavid Davis, the Conservative Party’s self-styled secret weapon | Tatler"},{"url":null,"title":"Cameron insists backs Mays plan partnership EU","story":"    David Cameron (pictured today in London) warned MPs not to let Britain crash out of the EU today as Theresa May faces catastrophe over BrexitMr Cameron said: \u0027I support the Prime Minister and I think she is doing the right thing seeking a partnership deal with the EU, that\u0027s the right approach.The reason I don\u0027t give lots of interviews and answer lots of questions about this is because her job is hard enough already without her immediate predecessor giving a running a commentary.\u0027So I wish her well.\u0027Asked about no deal as he walked off, Mr Cameron said: \u0027I don\u0027t think no deal is a good idea at all.\u0027 May CALLS OFF last-minute dash to Brussels after late-night...David Davis says failing to deliver on the referendum will...Share this articleMrs May was today urged to delay her Brexit doomsday vote in the Commons tomorrow after she again failed to make any breakthrough in negotiations with the EU and called off an 11th-hour trip to Brussels.The Prime Minister had her plane on standby but after a phone call with President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker last night she cancelled plans to fly out to Europe as the deadlock continues.

It has been made clear to Downing Street that it would be eminently sensible to avoid that by proposing a motion that the party can support.

Pictured: The court building Sentencing, the magistrates told Shaw: \u0027The factors that make it more serious are that children were with you on both occasions and you used their bags to evade detection. \u0027They said, however, he had used the money to pay bills and not for a drugs habit, for example, and he had been under pressure as the main breadwinner.The justices added: \u0027We can\u0027t condone what you have done.\u0027The defendant, of Bacup, Rossendale, admitted theft to the value of £192 on February 6 and a second theft charge.He was given a 12-month community order, with a 25- day rehabilitation activity requirement and three months\u0027 alcohol treatment.

The good news is the financial hangover caused by Christmas has, we hope, lifted and the penal cost of your summer holidays has yet to be truly felt. That is why now is the ideal time for a clear-headed, stress-free financial spring clean. While we can’t guarantee it, we reckon there is a pretty good chance you will have saved yourself hundreds of euro by the time you get to the end of this article, as long as you follow the steps we outline, that is. Fingers crossed.1. The first thing you need to do is to work out exactly where your money is going each month so you can work out what you can do to cut back. There was a time when carrying out even the most cursory of financial audits required sifting through endless sheaves of bank statements, collecting all your receipts and looking over incomprehensible utility bills.But times have changed and technology is now your friend. So, the first step on your road to financial redemption will see you log on to your online bank account so you can go through the last six months of your transactions. Keep an eye out for all payments or direct debits that look unfamiliar it doesn’t matter if the payment is substantial or just €2.99 for some online service you have long since forgotten you signed up for. Cancel all the subscriptions to services that you reckon are of no value to you any more.2. And while you are focusing on your bank account, you might want to pay some attention to your actual bank too. Repeated studies over recent years have shown that Irish consumers who switch their current account from a bad value one – and there are loads of bad value ones out there – to a good value one could save themselves about €150 a year. Despite that free money, the level of switching in the banking sector remains chronically low – less than 1 per cent by the latest count.Banks profit from this consumer lethargy. We’re not going to lie to you, changing your bank account is a bit of hassle, although not as hard as you might think. But if you can save yourself more than 100 quid while putting manners on your bank, it is certainly worth considering doing as part of your financial spring clean.3. There are even bigger savings to be made by switching your mortgage from one provider to another, although such a move comes with an important tracker-mortgage shaped caveat or, to put it another way, if you have a tracker, hang on to it.By switching mortgage provider, many homeowners who have been gouged by their banks could save hundreds of euro a month. Let’s say you are on a 4.3 per cent standard variable rate and have a €250,000 mortgage. If you have at least 20 per cent equity and switch to the cheapest rate on the market and sign up for 20 years mortgage you will save about €250 a month. That is about 60 grand over the life of the loan.While switching mortgage from one bank to another can deliver big savings – as long as you are not on a precious tracker (we can’t say that enough) – it can also be difficult, which explains why so few people bother with it. If you can find yourself a good mortgage broker and one you can trust, they will do all the hard work for you.4. The next thing to do is pay more attention to your credit cards. Audit them and work out how much they are costing you every month. Chances are you have not done that for a long time. Last week the Irish League of Credit Unions published a survey which suggested that just under 60 per cent of people do not know the rate of interest their credit card provider charges while even more have no idea how and when interest is applied to their cards. It also revealed that most of us routinely use them for spontaneous purchases.So don’t be part of the majority. Work out how much your credit cards are costing you and look at how you use them and if there are spending pitfalls you could avoid. If necessary, leave them at home. You can use them for random purchases in Penneys or Arnotts if you are carrying them if they are inaccessible or hard to get at, you won’t spend as much money on them.And if you owe a lot on your cards, you really have to focus on clearing that debt. If your credit card balance is €5,000 and you’re paying interest on the debt of 23 per cent, then it would be mad to put money into your savings or buy things you don’t need at the expense of clearing more of that debt.5. If you have not changed your energy supplier in the past two years, you are wasting money. And there is a very, very good chance you have never made the switch. As many as 60 per cent of Irish consumers have never bothered to change their electricity or gas provider. And even more depressing, 85 per cent of us are paying the standard tariffs for both electricity and gas. That means we are paying hundreds of euro more than we need to. By spending just a few minutes moving from a dear provider to a cheaper one, you can save more than €350 a year.And, unlike changing bank account or mortgage provider, changing your utility provider is really easy and – unlike switching breakfast cereals – the end product is identical. To make the switch you just need copies of your most recent gas or electricity bill, or both if you’re a dual fuel customer. You also need your Gas Point Reference Number (GPRN) or Meter Point Reference Number (MPRN), so energy suppliers can identify your property. These numbers are on your bills. And, finally, you need a current gas andor electricity meter reading, so your old supplier can provide you with a final bill and your new supplier can start from that point.If you are struggling to work out which provider you should switch to, the price comparison sites bonkers.ie and switcher.ie can help you out.6. We have said this before and we will say it again, if you have not changed your health insurance provider in the past three years, you are almost certainly paying more than you need to. You can make the switch only once a year when your renewal time comes round. When it does come around, call your existing provider and ask for all the equivalent plans it has on its books to the one you have now. Insist that all its company’s plans are explored. If it comes back with a plan that costs €100 cheaper than the one you have, ask if it is the best-value plan. Calls are being recorded, so they have to say yes or no and they are under pressure to tell the truth. Then go onto the HIA website – www.hia.ie – and compare the plans you have with those from other providers. Remember, companies can’t pry into your health conditions and as long as you are getting the same level of cover as you already have, there are no waiting periods to deal with.7. If you have not got travel insurance and are planning to leave the country at any point in the months ahead, now is the time to take it out. Many claims made by Irish people are down to changing family circumstances or a bereavement and you have no idea when such things will happen. Do not go for the cheapest policy and do read the terms and conditions – or at least some of them – to make sure you are getting the cover you need.8. And staying with insurance, this month is as good as any to look at all the other insurance products you have and to make some calls. If you can knock just 10 per cent off the cost of your car, home and life insurance by either changing provider or asking your existing one for a better deal, you could be better off by couple of hundred quid after just three or four calls.9. Mobile phone packages can be hideously confusing and in all the confusion the big loser tends to be the consumer. So have a look at your phone package and make sure you are on the right plan for your usage. There is not much point in paying €20 a month for data if you don’t use that much data or you download everything using wifi. Be wary of your mobile provider offering you an upgrade as your contract term nears its end. Getting a new handset almost certainly will see you locked into a new contract for as long as two years. And if you can buy a handset outright and go for a 30-day contract or a pre-pay sim, you will save money.10. Television watching is not cheap but much of the money we spend can be saved. The cost of a package that includes broadband, a landline and a television service offering more than 100 channels runs to about €100 each month. Typically companies don’t let you get rid of the landline element of the deal even if the last time you used a landline was when Jesus was a boy but you can get rid of the 100 channels and, depending on your circumstances, you might not miss them all that much.Other services can be accessed with Android boxes. These typically cost about €100 although be warned that many such services are in a legally grey area while some others are downright illegal. It is also worth bearing in mind that streams can be flaky and disappear in the blink of an eye. And of course there is Saorview, the national digital terrestrial television service. To get the service, you just connect a suitable aerial to your Saorview-approved TV and tune in to all the free-to-air Irish channels, and, depending on the box, free access to all the UK free-to-air channels too.11. Your financial spring clean can turn into a physical spring clean too which may generate some cash. Take a day to wander through your house boxing up all the stuff you no longer use or no longer like. Sell the stuff that is worth selling on donedeal.ie and donate the stuff that you’ll struggle to sell to a charity shop.12. Set some new spending habits for the months ahead. The best way to get a handle on your outgoings is to keep a spending diary for a week or so to get a sense of where your money is going. Simply note, on your phone, every time you spend money over the course of two weeks and you will get a sense of where your money is going. Once that is done give yourself a spending budget to cover everything and stick to it. If you spend less than your allowance, don’t go mad with the leftovers in Penneys put it into the following week’s pot.If you have yet to sign up for it, then spring time is the time to do it. It is very simple. Your employer buys you your new bike and any bike equipment you may need up to a total value of €1,000 and when tax deductions kick in you end up paying only half that. There are more details available from bikescheme.ie.Not only will you get yourself a bike on the cheap – and spread the cost out over the year – you will also save yourself a packet on commuting costs. Anyone who lives within 10km of their place of work will spend at least €20 a week on commuting if they drive or take public transport. A cyclist spends nothing. If you live in Galway, Cork or Dublin, sign up to the bikes scheme. They are a lot cheaper than cabs. And remember that people who cycle every day live years longer than those who don’t."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"If you wish to alter your career path, a conversion course might be the right optionGraham Doyle (31) to be sentenced on March 29th after pleading guilty to sex assault, rapeJudge reduces award for Aisling Smith from on grounds of contributory negligenceThe measure is part of a new plan aiming to tackle waiting lists in the health sectorThomas Bates and Nigel Gartland also accused of possessing ammunition in Co TipperaryJudge seeks urgent assessment of woman (18) allegedly subjected to \u0026lsquodevastating\u0026rsquo abuseUnions, community groups and housing bodies to gather for event at City Hall at 5pmHSE\u0026rsquos immunisation chief says \u0026lsquoeliminating cervical cancer is now an achievable goal\u0026rsquoComdt Conor King says Department of Defence policies were \u0026lsquofailing the State\u0026rsquoMichael McKevitt, Colm l Murphy and Liam Campbell order to pay damages to victims\u0026rsquo familiesNorwegian Air has no current plans to withdraw 737 MaxFunding to organise events around War of Independence and Civil WarBrian Dobson, Heather Humphreys, Jan O\u0026rsquoSullivan and others on growing up in a Catholic dominated StateRemoving citizenship for woman who left for Syria would not be \u0026lsquocompassionate\u0026rsquo moveAny Brexit extension would have to be an \u0026lsquoextension with a purpose\u0026rsquoClare man lived on Popes Quay in Cork city centre with his wife and two childrenBody of woman found after incident in east side of cityContract a key element of proposals that led to suspension of the recent nurses\u0026rsquo strike"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3821583.1552313253!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"met %C3%A9ireann issue orange weather alert as storm gareth approaches ireland","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTuesday will be an extremely windy day across the country.

Photograph: Alan BetsonThe The Government faces legal and logistical complications in managing a crash-out Brexit and is relying on emergency orders to bypass normal planning procedures to prepare, internal Government documents reveal.Work on a wide variety of transport issues in the event of a hard Brexit – ranging from assessing the legality of the State leasing ships to safeguard supplies, to reviewing whether Rosslare Port can take private investment – are disclosed in briefing papers prepared for Minister for Transport Shane Ross and released under the Freedom of Information (FoI) Act.The Government has ruled out leasing ships, taking ownership of, or running, ferries in the event that the British “landbridge” route to mainland Europe is affected by Brexit because it “could give rise to claims of interference in the market” and complaints under State aid rules from shipping companies, the papers say.The Department of Transport warns in the records of risks to existing food supply chains from disruption on key landbridge transit routes. It notes Irish hauliers transport “very time-sensitive” food products that “may not be suitable for ersion to direct sea routes” from the State to mainland Europe.New post-Brexit controls will mean that “at any one time” up to 120 lorries – the equivalent of up to 2km of traffic – arriving on dawn ferries would face additional controls before leaving Dublin Port and are likely to depart the port “during peak morning traffic”.Planning powersTo build new port facilities for a surge in checks required on UK imports after a potential no-deal Brexit, the Government will rely on “emergency orders”, exempting construction from normal planning procedures.The Office of Public Works said the Government has already used these emergency powers under the Planning Acts for works at Dublin Port and a further order is likely for facilities planned for Rosslare.The records say that for permanent facilities, regulations will be brought forward to “tailor” requirements and timeframes for environmental impact assessments, and checks under EU rules, to protect birds and habitats. The OPW said it was “fully satisfied there are no environmental issues”.However, Birdwatch Ireland expressed alarm at the use of emergency measures to override environmental law for works at Dublin Port, where there is a colony of terns near a warehouse being refurbished for plant and animal-based food imports from the UK after Brexit, and in a special protection area such as Dublin Bay.“We are particularly concerned that conservation organisations like Birdwatch Ireland might not be consulted on proposed planning applications under emergency provisions,” said Oonagh Duggan, BirdWatch Ireland’s assistant head of policy and advocacy.This would go against recent rulings by the European Court of Justice and in Ireland EU law must be fully implemented. We call on the Government to engage with us on this and to clarify its proposal.\u0026nbspOther measures being considered in a no-deal scenario include moving lorry freight traffic to the Port of Cork in Ringaskiddy from Dublin Port should it experience traffic congestion after Brexit, though the port would need investment.This week marks the start of a crunch period in the Brexit process as MPs could cast a series of votes to decide the manner and timing of the UK’s exit.British prime minister Theresa May was preparing last night to make a last-minute trip to Brussels in an effort to save her Brexit deal ahead of a crucial vote in the House of Commons on Tuesday.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Peter MorrisonAPTaoiseach Leo Varadkar has said it is “far too late” in the Brexit process for the United Kingdom to tell the European Union what it wants as part of an exit deal.Speaking in Dublin, Mr Varadkar was also dismissive of suggestions that British prime minister Theresa May may further postpone a vote on the Brexit withdrawal agreement that is due to take place in the House of Commons this week.Mrs May is battling to save her Brexit strategy as negotiations with the European Union remain “deadlocked”, amid warnings that the prime minister is heading for another crushing defeat in Tuesday’s crunch Commons vote.Tory Brexiteers said rejection of the withdrawal agreement is “inevitable” unless Mrs May is able to secure significant changes to the Northern Ireland backstop. “Technical” talks between officials took place in Brussels over the weekend and the PM spoke to European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker on Sunday night. But a Downing Street source said the negotiations remained “deadlocked”.Speculation in London has suggested Mrs May could replace the so-called meaningful vote with another vote which would allow MPs show what type of Brexit they would find acceptable.The Taoiseach said such a prospect “really misses the point”.“I do hear some suggestion that the votes may be called off in favour of a new vote as a result of which the House of Commons would tell the European Union what they want. That really misses the point,” Mr Varadkar told reporters. “We’re two and half years if not three years since the referendum. It is far too late for the United Kingdom to tell us what they want. The withdrawal agreement requires a compromise and this withdrawal agreement is already a compromise.”“Obviously the first step on Tuesday is the next vote on the withdrawal agreement in the House of Commons. That may pass or it may not pass, I can’t predict the outcome of that vote but if it doesn’t pass I understand there will be a vote on Wednesday to take no-deal off the table and potentially a vote on Thursday then around an extension.”The remaining 27 European Union members will have to agree to grant an extension of the negotiating period beyond Brexit day on March 29th, if one is requested by London. The Taoiseach said it has to be an “extension with a purpose”.“I think if there is going to be an extension. It has to be an extension with a purpose. Nobody across the European Union wants to see a rolling cliff edge where tough decisions just get put off until the end of April and then to the end of May and then maybe until the end of July.“The uncertainty around Brexit is already worrying citizens. It is damaging business confidence, it is effecting our agriculture in particular. It will affect other industries as well as the week goes on. I really think if there is going to be an extension it has to be with a purpose, that extension.”The threat of a no-deal Brexit is not one “that the European Union or Ireland is making”, he added.“The 29th March is a self imposed deadline and the United Kingdom parliament can take the threat of no deal — for Ireland, for Northern Ireland, for Britain, for Europe — off the table at any time.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph:  Tolga AKMENAFPGetty ImagesWe are only weeks away from\u0026nbspMarch 29th, the date on which, at 11pm our time, the UK is due to leave the EU.If you decided to tune out for the last few months, the good news is that you haven’t missed much, at least in terms of decisions. There has been lots of noise, but little clarity on what is going to happen.It is still not clear whether the UK will leave the EU with or without a deal, or whether March 29th will, in fact, be Brexit day, or whether there will be some extension.This was not the plan. The terms of which the UK were to withdraw were to all have been agreed by now.The failure – so far – to conclude the withdrawal throws everything up into the air.The UK House of Commons has so far not approved the deal negotiated between the EU and UK, with British prime minister Theresa May’s government looking for concessions to try to get it through. Another vote on this is due on Tuesday, but so far there is no sign of agreement on changes which would get support in the House of Commons and the mood between the two sides seems to deteriorate further over the weekend. It is not even clear in what form May will put the votes to the Commons this weekHere are the key questions to be answered.1 Will the UK leave the EU on March 29th?This is very debatable. If there is some breakthrough in the talks and the House of Commons does approve the withdrawal agreement – at some stage in the next few weeks – then more time will almost certainly be needed for the UK government to pass the necessary legislation. This could delay the exit by a couple of months – a so-called technical extension. But right now no route to Commons approval is evident and Theresa May is believed to be considering in what form Tuesday’s vote will be put to the Commons.If there is no breakthrough, then the UK may ask for an extension of the article-50 process – the rules for a country leaving the EU. The suggestion is that it could ask for an additional two or three months. This would have to be agreed unanimously by the EU side, which may look for some indication of how the UK hopes to break the deadlock. In other words, they will not want to give an extension just for the sake of it. There have even been suggestions that some EU states favour a longer extension. There has as yet been no formal EU discussion on this as no request has been made by the UK.If no extension is granted, and no withdrawal agreement is finalised, then the UK will leave on March 29th with no deal. It is also possible that an extension in the UK’s leaving date is agreed, say until the end of June, and failure to reach a deal in the interim leads to a no-deal exit at that stage.In short, pretty much anything can still happen.2 What is the difference between an exit with a deal and one without?If a withdrawal agreement is finalised then once the UK leaves it would enter what is called “a transition period”, lasting until at least December 2020, with a possible extension of up to two years.It would have left the EU, but existing arrangements would remain in place, meaning not much would change. This would be to give time to work out what would happen next in terms of trade and other relationships between the EU and UK. So an exit with a deal would still leave a lot to be worked out, but would mean little practical change in the short term – except that the UK would no longer participate in EU institutions.For Ireland it would remove the immediate economic threat and also the huge political problems which a no-deal would cause, particularly in relation to the Border.A no-deal exit, on the other hand, would sever the UK’s links with the EU overnight. This would create immediate upheaval in areas such as trade, with potential delays in ports in France, the UK and Ireland in particular, as new customs and regulatory checks are introduced overnight.These delays would ease as new procedures are worked out. But other impacts would be long-lasting and serious. Irish exporters would face new bureaucracy and, in some cases, tariffs, making it harder to sell into the UK market. Parts of our food industry, particularly the beef sector, could be priced out of the UK market overnight, or face new competition from low-cost producers in South America.Tariffs on goods coming in here from the UK would push up prices, particularly in areas such as consumer foods. The Central Bank has said that a no-deal Brexit could cost out economy 4 per cent of GDP in the first year.A no-deal exit would also lead to immediate pressure on the Irish Government to check goods passing through the Irish Border and thus into the EU single market. The Government has said that, in the case of a no-deal Brexit, urgent talks would be needed with the EU and UK to avoid this. Ireland might be given some leeway, but it is not clear how border checks could be avoided under EU rules. The UK is unlikely to agree to the alternative – checking goods as they cross the Irish Sea – as this has been a key point in dispute in the talks.The potential chaos and uncertainties of a no-deal Brexit have led everyone to assume a way will be found to avoid it. So far this has not happened.3. What happens next?The House of Commons is due to vote on the withdrawal agreement again on Tuesday. The UK government had promised the vote will go ahead, though it remains to be seen what tactics it uses on the day and there are reports that the prime minister is considering changes, perhaps asking the Commons to indicate what kind of deal it would support, in a bid to put pressure on the EU. If the existing withdrawal agreement is passed, at some stage, then the UK leaves with a deal and enters the transition.If the Commons does not approve the withdrawal agreement, then two further votes have been promised. Again it remains to be seen how this plays out, if prime minister changes her approach on the first vote.The first, due on Wednesday, would be on whether MPs support a no-deal exit. The second would be on whether they support an extension to the article 50 process. A majority against a no deal would be expected. MPs might be expected to support an extension, though it remains to be seen whether agreement can be found on how long they want it to last.The EU side has to agree to an extension of article 50 – unanimously. And so just because the Commons supports it does not mean it will happen, certainly without some conditions attached, or with EU input into how long it lasts. This could all come to a head at the EU Summit on March 20th-21st, just over a week before the date Brexit is due.Talk about cutting it fine.4. And what are the key issues in the talks?It has come down to one thing: the backstop.This is the measure designed to guarantee that whatever the outcome of future trade talks between the EU and UK, a hard border will never return on the island of Ireland.Opposition has grown to the backstop plan among Conservative MPs and the DUP, despite changes to the original proposal during negotiators. Crucially, the UK attorney general Geoffrey Cox has ruled that the UK might not be able to escape from this arrangement and political opposition has focused on the risk of being “ trapped” in the backstop. MPs oppose this because it would leave the entire UK in a customs union with the EU and the North even more closely aligned with the EU, with no guarantee on when this might end. Under an alternative plan, just the North would remain aligned, but this, too, is opposed.So the talks in Brussels have focused on trying to provide some reassurances to the UK that the EU does not intend the backstop to be permanent, and ideally hopes it will never have to be used. However, while the EU side is willing to provide statements of intent,and legal guarantees on how an arbitration process would work, the UK is still seeking something which would effectively allow it to decide itself to leave the backstop or put some time limit on it.The EU side argue that the whole point of the backstop is that it stays in place unless and until some other way is found to avoid a hard Irish border.And so the conversation has gone around in circles. As the countdown continues, there is – as yet – no clear way forward. Today, Downing Street is saying that the talks are “deadlocked.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches. See more here.

Photograph: ITV Removing Irish citizenship from an Irish woman suspected of association with Islamic State in Syria is not the right or compassionate thing to do, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has said.Lisa Smith (37) from Dundalk left for Syria about five years ago, after stepping down from the Air Corps where she served as a flight attendant on the Government jet at the rank of corporal.It is understood she and her two-year-old child are currently in the Al-Hawl refugee camp along with about 500 other wives and children of Islamic State (Isis) fighters.Speaking this morning, Mr Varadkar said more information is needed on her case.“We still don’t have full information about this case,” he told reporters in Dublin. “Each of these cases is going to have to be treated differently.“Going to Syria or going to live in what was called Islamic State is not in itself an offence or a crime. So we will need to carry out an investigation.“I know the authorities there will want to interrogate her to see if she has been involved in any crimes there. But it’s very possible that wasn’t a combatant.“We really need to get to the bottom of the facts here. Carry out a security assessment to see if the Syrian authorities want to carry out a prosecution or not.“But ultimately this is an Irish citizen and we don’t believe that removing an Irish citizen’s citizenship from her or her family, rendering them stateless, would be either the right or compassionate thing to do.“As an Irish citizen, she will have the right to return to Ireland as will her child. But as an Irish citizen, it’s not just as simple as coming here and proceeding as if nothing had happened. There will need to be an interrogation by the authorities there. There may need to be a prosecution there. And we’ll make sure that if she returns to Ireland, she isn’t a threat to anybody here either.”Minster for Children Katherine Zappone said the “best interests of the child will also be attended to”.“ I think that’s always the way the Government has operated in general – but particularly we’re aware of that in this case as well.”"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/02/10/TELEMMGLPICT000051671687_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqO65TkrT7BriBrd3fK6VEg2oOnP5Tf-6BsL77M1adEXU.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"sir philip green staff told wear revealing clothes visited","story":"Sir Philip Green in 2014 with models, left to right, Suki Waterhouse, Kate Moss, Cara Delevingne, Sienna Miller and Naomi Campbell.

However, the review makes no proposal as how long this should take.It also says that all patients with suspected cancer should receive a definitive diagnosis within 28 days of urgent referral.Officials suggested the current four-hour A\u0026ampE target distorts priorities, putting pressure on doctors to admit patients before the “cliff edge” target is missed, rather than doing what is best for them.Why is the NHS under so much pressure?One fifth of emergency admissions from A\u0026ampE happen in the last 10 minutes before the deadline, they said.The proposals - which will now be tested in pilot schemes - will also see the axing of a 2 week target for urgent referrals with suspected cancer.Instead all patients with an urgent referral should receive a definitive diagnosis within 28 days of urgent referral, the plans state.If the pilots are deemed to be a success, both the A\u0026ampE four-hour target and the 18 week target for those needing planned hospital treatment, could be scrapped.The current 18-week target for people to start treatment could also be axed.The review suggests it could be replaced with either a new maximum waiting time - as yet undefined - or by one measuring the average time to start treatment.The new system could begin being introduced nationally as soon as this autumn, the review states.Professor Stephen Powis, the NHS in England’s national medical director and leader of the review, said: “The NHS is aiming to improve care for patients and save hundreds of thousands more lives over the coming years, with greater access to mental health support, better treatment for the major killer conditions and services which are more joined-up, personalised and closer to home.“So, as we build an NHS that is fit for the future, now is the right time to look again at the old targets which have such a big influence on how care is delivered, to make sure that they take account of the latest treatments and techniques, and support, not hinder, staff to deliver the kind of responsive, high-quality services that people want to see.”Brexit latest news: Theresa May visiting Strasbourg tonight for talks, Dublin\u0026#39s deputy PM claimsBrussels resigned to Brexit extension after London rejects EU backstop offer Democratic National Committee selects Milwaukee to host 2020 national conventionEthiopian airlines crash: The British and Irish victimsStorm Gareth: Met Office names third storm of 2019 as Britain braces for 80mph windsBirmingham City supporter is jailed after admitting assault on Aston Villa\u0026#39s Jack Grealish during derby clashNew Assad statue triggers rare anti-government protests in SyriaTaliban back report Mullah Omar hid until death in Afghanistan near US baseThe world is not prepared for a global flu pandemic, experts warnJacket belonging to missing backpacker Catherine Shaw found in GuatemalaEurostar announces delays and cancellations in Paris as French customs officials strike over Brexit Murder of Putin enemy made to look like \u0026#39trashy suicide\u0026#39, his daughter saysWreck of Italian warship sunk by a British submarine discovered on seabed after 77 yearsComment: I have long admired Tony Blair, but his latest interference goes too farJohan Claassen, biblical scholar who served the Springboks rugby team as player, captain, coach, selector and manager – obituary  Headteacher bans sugary treats so parents aren\u0026#39t \u0026#39shamed\u0026#39 into buying unhealthy snacksShamima Begum\u0026#39s family urge Home Office to reconsider citizenship decision as \u0026#39act of mercy\u0026#39Ex-soldier died from wasp sting while working as pest controller after suffering allergic attackBBC chef sues interior designer after chairs she fitted broke when customers sat on them, court hearsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 11 march 2019","story":"The annual East Lancashire Railway Spring Steam Gala, UK, attracted bumper crowds of rail enthusiasts from all over the country.

They were 18 months and nine months.The baby’s death on Thursday prompted further criticism of Sajid Javid’s decision to strip Miss Begum of her British citizenship after she pleaded to be allowed to return home.Diane Abbott, the shadow foreign secretary, said it was a stain on the conscience of this government and branded it “callous and inhumane”.Mr Javid revoked her citizenship on the grounds that she had Bangladeshi citizenship, through her parents and so was not rendered stateless.The letter sent to the Home Office, seen by Sky News, says: We write specifically on behalf of Mrs Begum, Shamima Begum\u0027s mother to ask you to reconsider your previous decision dated 19 February 2019 to deprive her daughter Begum of her British citizenship.Mrs Begum requests this reconsideration, as an act of mercy, on the basis of the following new information, namely the death of her newborn son.It says the family has been unable to contact Miss Begum directly and highlights that a request for help from the government was ‘refused in writing’”.The letter sent to the Home OfficeA request for help in bringing the baby home was refused on the basis that there was no written confirmation that neither the family, nor their solicitor, was acting on the instructions of the teenager.The family’s letter added: As far as we are aware, the British government did not ask for the views of, nor consult with the government of Bangladesh on whether Shamima held dual nationality before the decision depriving citizenship.You will appreciate there are immediate fears for Shamima\u0027s health and safety, and the matter is urgent.The letter asks for a response within 24 hours.Following the death of Jarrah, a government spokesman said: The death of any child is tragic and deeply distressing for the family.The Foreign and Commonwealth Office has consistently advised against travel to Syria since April 2011.The government will continue to do whatever we can to prevent people from being drawn into terrorism and travelling to dangerous conflict zones.Brexit latest news: Theresa May visiting Strasbourg tonight for talks, Dublin\u0026#39s deputy PM claimsBrussels resigned to Brexit extension

gareth met office names third storm 2019 britain braces","story":"A person pushes a car out of snow on Mortimer Road in the Peak DistrictThe Met Office has named its third storm of the year which will bring winds of up to 80mph to parts of Britain over the coming days. Various yellow weather warnings for wind and rain for Storm Gareth are in place from Tuesday through to Friday. From 3pm on Tuesday, Northern Ireland will be subject to the first warning for wind, stretching all the way through to midday on Wednesday.All of England and Wales south of York will bear the brunt of the storm from 9pm on Tuesday through to 3pm on Wednesday. After a weekend of strong winds which was enough to fell trees and partly-demolish buildings, there will be no let up as more strong winds will batter the country for almost two days. On Tuesday, Thursday and Friday, there is a separate yellow weather warning for rain in the north west of England, which threatens to flood homes and businesses in the area. Up to 40mm is expected to fall in less than a day in parts of Lancashire. The average monthly rainfall for the UK in March is 95mm. What to expect: There is a small chance that injuries and danger to life could occur from large waves and beach material being thrown onto sea fronts, coastal roads and properties and there is a small chance of injuries and danger to life from flying debris. There is also a slight chance of some damage to buildings, such as tiles blown from roofsThere is a small chance of longer journey times or cancellations as road, rail, air and ferry services are affect. There is a small chance that some roads and bridges could closeThere is a slight chance that power cuts may occur, some of which have already hit parts of the south east, with the potential to affect other services, such as mobile phone coverageFlooding of a few homes and businesses is likelyIn September, the Met Office and Met Éireann revealed the list of storm names for the coming season.First introduced in 2015, this is the fourth year the Met Office and Met Éireann (the meteorological service in the Republic of Ireland) have jointly run the ‘Name our Storms’ scheme, aimed at raising awareness of severe weather before it hits.This first storm, which was male and named Ali, hit on September 19 last year. The second was female and named Bronagh and hit Britain a day later, lasting until September 21. The system follows the alternating malefemale pattern established by the US National Hurricane Center in the 1970s.Storm Callum and Storm Deirdre have both come and gone before the new year, Storm Erik was 2019\u0027s first on February 8 and 9 followed by Storm Freya was the year\u0027s second on March 3 and 4. Here are the rest of the storm names for this season, after Storm Gareth was named as March\u0027s second and 2019\u0027s third:Storm names for 201819Announcing the storm names back in September, Evelyn Cusack, head of forecasting at Met Éireann, said: The last 12 months have seen some extreme weather around the Globe as well as here at home.While it is too early to say whether the coming winter will be a stormy one or a quiet one we are prepared with a whole new set of 21 names for whatever nature may throw at us.As before, Met Éireann forecasters will work in close co-operation with our colleagues from the  Met Office in the UK to keep all the peoples of these islands warned of impending severe weather.This season’s names have once again been compiled from a list of suggestions submitted by the public, choosing some of the most popular names but also selecting names that reflect the nations, culture and ersity of Britain and Ireland. As in previous years, Q, U, X, Y and Z will not be used, to comply with the international storm naming conventions.A storm will be named on the basis of \u0027medium\u0027 or \u0027high\u0027 potential impacts from wind but also include the potential impacts of rain and snow.So storms will be named for weather systems which is expected to result in the Met Office issuing an amber or red warning. These two warnings carry a potential risk to life. There\u0027s nothing British people enjoy more than talking about the weather and in 2015, they were given the chance to develop an even closer connection by giving names to major weather systems affecting the UK and Ireland.In September 2016, the Met Office invited members of the public to submit names for storms for autumnwinter 201516 by social media.The idea behind the pilot project was to help raise awareness of severe weather before it strikes and to ensure greater safety of the public.Attaching a name to a weather event has been found to help people track its progress, to allow people to prepare for and avoid danger and to make it easier to reference on social media.Didn\u0027t we already give names to storms?Before the new system was introduced, naming was random, with the same storm sometimes being referred to by several different names.The St Jude\u0027s Storm of October 2013, which led to the deaths of four people, was so-called because it was due to arrive on St Jude\u0027s Day.In Britain, we also hear about a number of ex-hurricanes that arrive at our shores from across the Atlantic.Since 1953, Atlantic tropical storms have been named from lists originated by the National Hurricane Center. These lists are maintained and updated every year by the international committee of the World Meteorological Organization. There are six lists that are used in rotation.As with the US system, the new naming system in Britain runs through the alphabet with alternate male and female names.There are no storms that begin with the less common letters Q, U, X, Y or Z.The only time that there is a change in the list is if a storm is particularly deadly or costly, such as Hurricane Katrina, which claimed nearly 2,000 lives in the United States and caused more than £65 billion in damage.If a storm is the remnants of a tropical storm or hurricane that has moved across the Atlantic, the already established method of referring to it as, for example Ex-hurricane X, will continue.On March 9, 2016 there was heavy rainfall across south Wales and southwest England and widespread northwesterly gales.There were gusts of wind up to 70mph and rainfall totals were around 20-30mm.Many were confused as to why the winds were not given the name Storm Katie, the next name on the Met Office list after Storm Jake.Storms are named by the Met Office when medium or high impacts are forecast as a result of high winds.As the weather system on March 9 was expected to have a low impact, it did not meet the criteria for naming a storm and was therefore not named.Brexit latest news: Theresa May visiting Strasbourg tonight for talks, Dublin\u0026#39s deputy PM claimsBrussels resigned to Brexit extension after London rejects EU backstop offer Democratic National Committee selects Milwaukee to host 2020 national conventionEthiopian airlines crash: The British and Irish victimsBirmingham City supporter is jailed after admitting assault on Aston Villa\u0026#39s Jack Grealish during derby clashNew Assad statue triggers rare anti-government protests in SyriaTaliban back report Mullah Omar hid until death in Afghanistan near US baseThe world is not prepared for a global flu pandemic, experts warnJacket belonging to missing backpacker Catherine Shaw found in GuatemalaEurostar announces delays and cancellations in Paris as French customs officials strike over Brexit Murder of Putin enemy made to look like \u0026#39trashy suicide\u0026#39, his daughter saysWreck of Italian warship sunk by a British submarine discovered on seabed after 77 yearsComment: I have long admired Tony Blair, but his latest interference goes too farJohan Claassen, biblical scholar who served the Springboks rugby team as player, captain, coach, selector and manager – obituary  Headteacher bans sugary treats so parents aren\u0026#39t \u0026#39shamed\u0026#39 into buying unhealthy snacksShamima Begum\u0026#39s family urge Home Office to reconsider citizenship decision as \u0026#39act of mercy\u0026#39A\u0026ampE four-hour target to be scrapped except for most serious cases Ex-soldier died from wasp sting while working as pest controller after suffering allergic attackBBC chef sues interior designer after chairs she fitted broke when customers sat on them, court hearsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/03/07/12/nadhim-zahawi.jpg","title":"nadhim zahawi ceo childrens minister education yougov brexit","story":"IM Subscribe \u0026nbsp registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

Not long after he became children’s minister in January 2018, Mr\u0026nbspZahawi announced the appointment of a private company called Spectra First to\u0026nbspget more than 50 businesses to provide work-based opportunities to young people leaving the care system, including every government department.The competition to say the stupidest thing about Brexit has been wonDiary: Slick work brings in the cash for Tory MP Nadhim ZahawiNeigh way! MP Nadhim Zahawi apologises for stables expense claims“My diary secretary here is brilliant, I would hire her in a heartbeat,” Mr Zahawi says of one of his own hires. He has, since this interview took place, made her a permanent member of staff.\u0026nbsp“All they need is an opportunity in life. You just have to think about these kids in the round. You have to think about their life and their experiences slightly different to, dare I say it, our kids.”Mr Zahawi could not have had a more different start. He arrived in the UK at the age of nine,\u0026nbspthe child of Kurdish parents fleeing the war in Iraq. His first school was Holland Park, a comprehensive in west London. He later moved to Ibstock Place, a private school, and King’s College School, at the time an\u0026nbspindependent school for boys in Wimbledon.\u0026nbspHe won a place at University College London to study chemical engineering, but quickly showed an interest in businesses and started a property company after graduating. In business, he is best known for YouGov, the polling company he co-founded in a garden shed in 2000. He remained its chief executive until 2010, when he was elected to parliament.He gave up several additional business interests when he was\u0026nbspmade education minister in a cabinet reshuffle\u0026nbspin January 2018, including a £350,000-a-year, part-time job at Gulf Keystone, an oil company, and a 50 per cent stake in Zahawi and Zahawi, a firm he founded with his wife Lana in 2010.\u0026nbspBut Mr Zahawi\u0026nbspstill remembers how difficult it was to arrive in the country as a young boy, with no way to communicate.\u0026nbsp“You’re wrenched away from your friends and you come to a new country, you have to start all over again,” he says. “I sat at the back of the class, I didn’t want to get laughed at, trying to string the words together to make a sentence.”Language, he quickly understood, would be the key to moving ahead. “I worked out very quickly that if you communicate well, doors open for you,” he says.\u0026nbspI ask him whether he feels young people from Syria and Afghanistan trying to get to this country in search of a better life should be given the same opportunity. He explains that his family went through the weren’t asylum seekers, but\u0026nbspapplied for settled status through the immigration system to\u0026nbspset up a business in the UK. He believed that people who work hard should be allowed to come to the UK.\u0026nbsp“We’ve got a rigorous immigration system to do that,” he says. “We’ll be able to decide our own immigration policy post-Brexit. For genuine asylum seekers we should be welcoming.”Mr\u0026nbspZahawi backed leaving the European Union. “Brexit appeals to me for no other reason than I thought we could reform within the EU, but when that became undeliverable for David Cameron I reluctantly backed Brexit because I thought the direction of travel for the EU is not right for us.”He says he doesn’t believe the German people have bought into the so-called transfer union, in which wealth within the EU ends up supporting weaker southern economies. He also believes Britons\u0026nbspwould never back the idea of a European army, an idea loathed by Brexiteers, but also seen as highly unlikely: “We’re better off exiting and wishing them luck in their endeavours but securing a trade deal so that we have access to the single market.”He never set out to be a politician. But a chance encounter at university piqued his interest.\u0026nbsp“At the University College of London union, on the first week at university, there was a bloke handing out the Socialist Worker\u0026nbspoutside. It was thin and small and I politely declined his offer at which point he was so aggressive, I thought I would go and find out about what the other side thinks,” he remembers.He was elected Conservative councillor in Putney in 1994, where he remained until 2006. In the interim, he helped run Jeffrey Archer’s unsuccessful campaign for Mayor of London in 1998. He was selected by the local Conservative association for the safe Tory seat of Stratford-on-Avon in 2010 and was re-elected in 2015\u0026nbspand 2017.\u0026nbspAs a member of parliament, Mr Zahawi has voted for reducing the rate of corporation tax and against an amendment in parliament on homes under a certain rent limit being “fit for human habitation”, notable because he is reported to have spent £25m\u0026nbspbuying property around London for buy-to-let and commercial use.\u0026nbspHis success in property has come later in life. After university, Mr Zahawi started an estate agency, but the business suffered when the property market entered a downturn in the Eighties. Mr Zahawi and his business partners were forced to liquidate.“The lesson there was that you don’t know how hard it is to make money unless you lose money,” he says. “It’s well worth all of us remembering in politics that every morning, millions of people get up and start a business or work in a small business and we have to make sure we deliver for them. It really does matter\u0026nbspthat what we do here does not hurt them and their prospects.”Small businesses are expected to be hit hardest by the UK’s decision to leave the EU. Surveys show many businesses have already been affected. Business investment fell for four consecutive quarters in 2018 for the first time since the financial crisis, according to the ONS.\u0026nbspEighty per cent of businesses considered Brexit uncertainty to have already had a negative impact on their investment decisions, according to a survey conducted in October 2018 by the Confederation of British Industry. Falling numbers of migrants have created a squeeze among employers, with the manufacturing industry in particular facing the biggest worker shortage in 30 years, according to the British Chambers of Commerce.Are we heading for a softer Brexit next week?What exactly will be better for small businesses after Brexit? Mr Zahawi doesn’t pause for breath: “One, we’ll be able to trade with the rest of the world. Two, we should be able to trade healthily with Europe and continue to have that trade. And three we’ll have our own policies on immigration or any other issues delivered in the UK.”Despite the challenges of his work, Mr Zahawi says he pinches himself every morning to think that he has ended up where he has. “Look at me today, a boy born in Baghdad, now a member of parliament for Shakespeare and a minister in Her Majesty’s government,” he says. “This country is an amazing country, it really is.”We’ll tell you what’s true. You can form your own view.At The Independent, no one tells us what to write. That’s why, in an era of political lies and Brexit bias, more readers are turning to an independent source.

Most were friendly\u0026nbspand willing to have a chat, and several shared stories. One, though, stood out resolutely as always not wanting to know.\u0026nbspWhile I knew left-wing MPs and was able to share a cup of tea or a beer with them, Jeremy Corbyn remained aloof. Attempts to engage with him came to nought.\u0026nbspIt wasn’t personal. I checked with colleagues and journalists at other papers, and he would not talk to them either. His preferred contact was with the Morning Star. The rest of us, it seems, were puppets of the capitalist money-making machine.\u0026nbspReading Tom Bower’s insightful new biography,\u0026nbspDangerous Hero:\u0026nbspCorbyn’s Ruthless Plot for Power, I was reminded of his isolation and single-mindedness. What struck me back then was Corbyn’s determination. He never flinched, did not once drop his guard, would not throw his hands in the air and say, “pull up a chair”.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.The most ridiculous claims made about Jeremy Corbyn Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.111 He called Hezbollah and Hamas ‘friends’True.

The group lists its purpose as the following: “To increase awareness of issues surrounding the dairy industry and focus on economic issues affecting the dairy industry and producers.”It’s a memory that has stayed. Talk to business people and they cite their fear of John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor. Corbyn, they dismiss as lacking the intellect and robustness of his lieutenant. But that’s the point, as Bower makes clear –\u0026nbspCorbyn is the leader, the orchestrator, the politician who has travelled a long, singular road to the top. He may not have the academic qualifications, he may seem to lack gravitas and at times appear woolly. He is undoubtedly surrounded by people sharper and brighter than he is, like McDonnell. None of it matters. They answer to him.\u0026nbspThere is a fascinating section in Bower’s book that focuses on Corbyn’s economic beliefs. What makes it especially interesting is because it’s rare for Corbyn to expound on domestic policy –\u0026nbsphe’s much more at home discussing a conflict between socialist rebels and an incumbent administration in some far-flung territory.\u0026nbspCorbyn believes that the UK wealthy do not pay enough tax. Writes Bower, he would like a return to the James Callaghan era, when the country’s richest paid a top rate of 98 per cent tax on income. Bower tries to counter that with the correct assertion that the top 1 per cent of British taxpayers already contribute 27 per cent of the nation’s income tax take, and the top 10 per cent pay 59 per cent a higher proportion than the richest 10 per cent of Germany’s population pay.\u0026nbspSuch comparisons almost certainly count for little with Corbyn –\u0026nbspthe man who would rather sit on his own reading the Morning Star is not going to be easily persuaded, not least with a glance in the direction of what he must regard as the loathsomely financially corrupt and socially unjust Germany.\u0026nbspLikewise, when Corbyn proposed “people’s quantitative easing”, the printing by the Bank of England of new money sufficient to meet the government’s requirements he brushed aside the possibility that this would lead to hyperinflation, and repetition of what occurred in Weimar Germany in the 1920s, Zimbabwe after 2010, and more recently, Venezuela. He simply did not want to listen.\u0026nbspJeremy Corbyn should realise Labour’s heartlands want a Final SaySimilarly, he would like to recreate a new national investment bank pumping hundreds of millions of pounds into Britain’s motor industry. The route to prosperity “is a collective process between workers, public investment and services, and yes, often innovative and creative iniduals”. You can feel the hesitancy and reluctance accompanying the citation of that last grouping.\u0026nbspIt is true that in the 1970s, Britain did make cars. But the sector now is a shadow of its former self. Worse, Nissan will not be using Sunderland to manufacture its new X-Trail SUV, and Honda in Swindon has signalled its intention to shut completely.\u0026nbspIt’s as if Corbyn has failed to register the onset of globalisation, the closure of factories across the land caused by cheaper labour and greater productivity elsewhere, and the fact that a large measure of what success Britain has achieved economically in the last few decades is down to the growth of the City of London and financial services.\u0026nbspIn his eyes, the City was to blame for the crisis of 2008 and its aftermath. That may be so but he chooses to discount the explosion in jobs in finance and the success it enjoyed before and since. Indeed, without the City, the UK would be in far worse shape.\u0026nbspBut the rose-tinted spectacles of this class warrior only see romance in metal-bashing and the honest sweat and toil of the shop floor. Quite how he intends to deal with the advent of the likes of artificial intelligence, robots and 3D printing is not clear.Reading Bower, you’re left in no doubt that Corbyn wants to turn the clock back, that his solution to those problematic examples and awkward developments that upset his path is merely to ignore them. This makes him very dangerous indeed, hard to reason with, oblivious to criticism and\u0026nbspset in his ways. It’s a troubling account, one that should give every entrepreneur pause and anyone who works in business pause. I want to scream and tell Corbyn to follow current events in Venezuela, and examine the chaos and strife that have befallen that country. I would, I fear, be wasting my time.\u0026nbspChris Blackhurst is a former editor of The Independent, and director of C|T|F Partners, the campaigns, strategic, crisis and reputational, and communications advisory firmWe’ll tell you what’s true.

If you live in the UK you’re in danger of losing all your rights.\u0026nbspThe airline has warned in the past that it will, in effect, disenfranchise its UK shareholders if this country’s catastrophically stupid\u0026nbspgovernment tips us off the no-deal Brexit cliff edge.With the clock ticking down, its warning has gone from threat to reality, as with so much else in the quite astonishing political freak show.\u0026nbspRyanair passenger whose name autocorrected to Lukewarm faces £100 billRyanair’s Michael O’Leary wants a woman to replace him as CEORyanair boss calls May and Corbyn ‘idiots’ and demands end to BrexitThe airline this morning announced that its board on Friday passed resolutions meaning that from the date of a “hard” no-deal Brexit, ordinary shares held by Britons\u0026nbspwill be classed as “restricted”.\u0026nbspWhat that means is that their holders, regardless of whether they are institutions or iniduals, will not longer be eligible to vote on company resolutions. They will thus be\u0026nbspdenied\u0026nbspa say on the appointment of company directors, including the CEO and chair, on deals the company might enter into, on the annual report, boardroom pay, on anything of consequence in fact.\u0026nbspThey will no longer be able to speak at or even attend the company’s AGM for as long as the shares are treated as restricted. Britons will also be blocked from buying any new\u0026nbspshares in Ryanair.\u0026nbspAt this point you might very well be asking how on earth can the company can do this.Well, Ryanair’s an airline, and under the rather arcane rules that exist around the world concerning airline ownership, it needs to be majority owned and controlled by EU investors to be able to fly around the bloc, which is where its majority of the business comes from.\u0026nbspTo ensure this remains the case in the event of a no-deal Brexit, the company has taken the step courtesy of the powers granted to its board by its articles of association.\u0026nbspIt is possible someone may attempt to challenge the move. But if the no-deal cliff edge crumbles they, and everyone else, will likely have bigger issues to deal with. So I wouldn’t get your hopes up.\u0026nbspThere is an interesting wrinkle to this. According to Ryanair’s most recent annual report, EU citizens held 52.8 per cent of the company. UK institutions and iniduals make up a significant proportion of that.\u0026nbspMuch of the non-EU part is owned by Americans via American Depository Receipts (ADRs) which are a specific type of paper that non-US companies sell to US investors and that are tradable on US exchanges.\u0026nbspSo in theory, EU shareholders could be in the minority even if its UK shareholders are stripped of their rights. It will be interesting to see how the company works its way around that one.\u0026nbspBut this being Ryanair, you would presume the company had considered the issue and worked out a plan.\u0026nbspRyanair is popular in with US investors because it is very low cost, and not overly fond of unions. Its directors won’t want to upset what has been a largely supportive part of its investor base.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.High-end slipper retailer Mahabis has gone into administration. 2 Jan 2019Coca-Cola has paid £3.9bn for Costa Coffee.

A street is marked “dark @ night” and another “hangout spot”. The groups are identifying what’s already available in neighbourhoods and what is desirable. It is part of the social action lab, a project with the British Council and the University of Central Lancashire to encourage Preston residents to become more active within their communities by offering them seed funding to develop projects.\u0026nbspThe social action lab, which brings together artists, community activists and residents, is exactly the kind of thing Ruth Heritage hoped to support in Preston when she opened the People’s Production Lab in November 2017. The next step is to turn the many businesses and artists\u0026nbspworking within the Lab into a cooperative, owned and run by the people who work there, to make it sustainable.\u0026nbspThe design secrets of the UK’s biggest cooperativeCould co-operative shops be the answer to expensive organic foods?Preston has become a testing ground for a new way to run a local economy. The “Preston model” is rooted in the development of cooperatives, or businesses owned by workers, rather than shareholders in remote locations looking to extract value with stocks and idends.Cooperative startups have been shown to be more resilient during times of economic stress. While 44 per cent of new businesses survive their early years, 80 per cent of cooperatives go on to thrive, according to a 2018 report on the cooperative economy by Cooperatives UK.\u0026nbspPreston Council has just announced up to £1m in funding to support the development of cooperatives in the area. The funding will come from Preston City Council, the University of Central Lancashire and the Open Society Foundations, which was started by hedge fund billionaire George Soros. It will create 10 new cooperatives, owned and run by workers in Preston, building on the work of community businesses with ambitions to become cooperatives, like the People’s Production Lab and others.\u0026nbsp“We want to provide equitable employment for graduates in the first instance,” says Mark Porter, a senior lecturer in web design at the University of Central Lancashire who is starting a cooperative called Preston Digital Foundation.\u0026nbspMr Porter believes working at the People’s Production Lab will provide the basis for cooperation between cooperatives, one of the seven basic principles of working in this way. “Our next steps are to complete the registration process to get the coop up and running in time for summer and the next cohort of graduates and enable us to start generating revenue.”Heritage started producing and commissioning arts and culture in Preston a decade ago under the name They Eat Culture. She began to imagine a fully-equipped creative space for the people of Preston, where digital businesses and artists could share resources and work together. In 2017, Michael Conlon, the manager of a local construction firm, suggested Heritage take on the multi-storey building at 55 Guildhall Street in the town centre. The building, previously used as offices by Lancashire County Council, had been empty since the departure of a faith school.\u0026nbspWithin a year, Heritage and They Eat Culture have transformed the commercial building into creative spaces. Peering through the windows, I see white walls of former corporate spaces\u0026nbspfilled with equipment for a\u0026nbspwood shop and tool library, a co-working space with desks and chairs donated by a local solicitor, a hack space with 3D printers and a sound studio with a green screen for video work. Art hangs from a washing line from the ceiling of one of the offices\u0026nbsp– now a screen printing studio. In the hallway, Heritage gets inside a makeshift photo-booth that went on tour with accompanying interview cards saying “talk to me about crime” and “talk to me about loneliness”.“There are artists studios and shared spaces in Preston, but we’re trying to evolve a way of creating shared facilities that people can use rather than inidual spaces,” Heritage says.Anthony King runs a startup screen printing studio called Priestown Press from the People’s Production Lab. “I was out of work for quite a while after some surgery,” King says. “My wife suggested I get back into art. The Lab has allowed us to expand and have the space to be artists. It’s subsidised, so it’s beneficial for artists who are struggling. There aren’t that many in Preston.”Priestown Press prints garments for street artists in Preston and London. Through the social action lab, King has been working on turning the studio into a community resource and a place for art therapy.\u0026nbsp“It’s evolving into a social enterprise,” King says. “Especially for mental health, art can be very therapeutic. Suicide is on the rise among men and younger people, so if we can do projects that get kids doing things, rather than keeping themselves to themselves, then it can only help.”Tom Stables is the chair of Digital Lancashire, a non-profit organisation that supports the digital economy in Lancashire. Stables says the area is already home to multiple agencies, software houses and creative enterprises. Digital Lancashire has worked with accountants and TV companies, helping them develop their digital clientele and acquire funding to expand.\u0026nbspStables is considering basing Digital Lancashire within the People’s Production Lab where it can nurture partnerships with other businesses. “Having the People’s Production Lab on our doorstep is terrific,” he says. “As well as being a place that our board meet, a number of our members have the space to grow and thrive.”Heritage talks breathlessly of plans for live storytelling projects, comedy programmes developing new talent, a community culture guide and a vegan pop-up experience. “I want there to be a lot of action on the ground,” she says. “Preston has been held back by being off the beaten track and by not having relationships with central government but the tide is turning. The time is now.”We’ll tell you what’s true. You can form your own view.At The Independent, no one tells us what to write.

The company continues its shift to towards online-only sales, but now says it won\u0027t close as many stores as originally thought.\u0026nbspThe $35,000 base Model 3 will still be available, but the company is raising prices by 3 per cent on all other models.\u0026nbspIn a Monday filing with government regulators, Tesla now says it closed 10 per cent of its stores, but a few of those will now remain open. Another 20 per cent are being evaluated and some could remain open.\u0026nbspThe company gave no numbers, but said it would close only about half the stores that it had intended to. It has 378 stores and service centres worldwide and about 100 stores in the US.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch. Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.“As a result of keeping significantly more stores open, Tesla will need to raise vehicle prices by about 3 percent on average worldwide,” a company\u0027s statement said. “We will only close about half as many stores, but the cost savings are therefore only about half.”\u0026nbspRemaining stores could have fewer workers, but will have vehicles available for test drives and a small inventory in case people want to buy immediately, the statement said.\u0026nbspThe company also announced on Monday that it has purchased car-hauling trucks and trailers from a California company in a stock deal worth about $14.2m. Tesla paid for the purchase with about 50,000 previously authorised shares. Tesla wants to increase its vehicle transportation capacity and cut delivery times.\u0026nbspThe reversal shows that Tesla had second thoughts about shuttering the stores and whether buyers would make such a large purchase without a test drive. The company says it still plans to offer buyers the ability to return purchased vehicles at no cost after a seven-day or 1,000 mile test drive.\u0026nbspGartner analyst Michael Ramsey called the move “startling” and said it undermines the credibility of Mr Musk and Tesla\u0027s management.\u0026nbsp“How else can you view it except to see it as a remarkable example of lack of foresight or planning?” Mr Ramsey asked. “It\u0027s almost as if the decision was announced and made without any analysis of what the outcome would be.”\u0026nbspMr Musk probably realised that he was locked into long-term leases on the stores that he would have to pay regardless of whether they were closed, Mr Ramsey said.\u0026nbspThe move made no sense to begin with because Tesla had spent millions fighting in courts and state legislatures trying to change laws that prevented companies from selling vehicles at their own stores, Ramsey said.\u0026nbspTesla starts taking orders for Model 3 electric carBut he also said the move to close 10 per cent of stores and evaluate others is the right thing to do, and said most retail companies do that all of the time.\u0026nbspMessages were left Monday seeking comment from a Tesla spokesman.\u0026nbspShares of Tesla edged up less than 1 per cent in trading early Monday.\u0026nbspIn announcing the move on 28 February, chief executive Elon Musk said it was necessary to cut costs in order to profitably sell the mass-market version of the Model 3 sedan for $35,000. That\u0027s a price point needed to reach more consumers and generate the sales that the company needs to survive, Mr Musk has said.\u0026nbspBefore the announcement, the cheapest Model 3 started at $42,900.\u0026nbsp“This is the only way to achieve the savings for this car and be financially sustainable,” Mr Musk told reporters during a conference call announcing the change. “It is excruciatingly difficult to make this car for $35,000 and be financially sustainable.”\u0026nbspElon Musk branded \u0027a liar\u0027 by investor as US regulators seeks to oust Tesla bossOn 28 February, the company said shifting totally to online sales would allow it to lower all vehicle prices by 6 per cent, on average, including its higher-end Model S and Model X.\u0026nbspAt the time, Mr Musk also walked back the company\u0027s guidance that it would be profitable in all future quarters, saying it would post a loss in the first quarter of this year.\u0026nbspAll other major car manufacturers rely on vast dealer networks, but Mr Musk co-founded Tesla in 2003 in an effort to shake up the industry, starting with a focus entirely on a fleet of cars powered by electricity instead of petrol.\u0026nbspWe’ll tell you what’s true.

And the saintly and regal Danny Dyer stands as its finest ambassador.” 1318 The Secret Life of the Zoo (Channel 4)“This documentary goes behind the shrubbery to show off these animals and their s. The humans are a pretty exotic bunch too, judging by some of the lines they come out with.”1418 A Year of British Murder (Channel 4)“The programme-makers must have done much to win the confidence of so many friends and families, as they went through unspeakable personal pain but they repay that confidence with an understated and powerful film.” “Despite what some feared, the casting of Cumberbatch doesn’t simply flatter Cummings – the A-lister is too good a chameleon for that. But, inevitably, as he scrawls out his campaigning brainwaves on a whiteboard, there is a touch of that deductive maverick Sherlock in his portrayal of this scruffy, balding political saboteur.” 1618 The Paras: Men of War (ITV)“From the outset the production is elevated by its sensitive handling of the men – and the Paratroopers remain exclusively male – involved. These kinds of programmes have a tendency to fetishise toughness, lingering on assault courses and weaponry.”1718 Billy Connolly: Made in Scotland (BBC2)“Billy Connolly: Made in Scotland is a meandering look back over his life, career, and national identity – a “Proustian wander through Scotland”. There’s a lot of mordant chat about the weather, illustrated with shots of dark grey clouds above even darker grey lochs.” “As a slightly cheesy reminder of what we love about Doctor Who – i.e. the fact it gives us an intergalactic eccentric in a big flappy overcoat shouting at Daleks  – this is a New Year treat that more than delivers” He previously co-presented\u0026nbspTop Gear\u0026nbspwith Clarkson and Hammond from 2003 to 2015.\u0026nbspThe trio reunited on\u0026nbspThe Grand Tour, which premiered in 2016.May told Variety\u0026nbspof his journey to Japan: “I intend to immerse myself in it completely, in the pursuit of enlightenment and life balance.

If you’re a creator of comic books featuring the adventures of super-powered, costumed heroes, that might be a difficult rule of thumb to apply. But perhaps not for Tom King. In Mister Miracle, from DC Comics, King and artist Mitch Gerads have created one of the most critically acclaimed graphic novels of the last year, and for the Washington-based writer, he drew on experiences that not a lot of other creators working in the field today have access to.King, 40, who was born in California, spent several years as a counter-terrorism officer for the CIA, working out in the field in Iraq and Afghanistan. It’s fascinating to think about what King saw and did, and how that later informed his writing. Obviously, I suggest, if he tells me too much about it he’ll have to kill me.\u0026nbspHe’s heard that one before, of course, probably more times than he can count. “No,” he says, with what feels like an oft-trodden out reply, “if I tell you too much about it, they’ll have to kill me.”Born to a film-writer mother in Southern California, King developed a love of storytelling and an understanding of narrative from an early age. During the 1990s he interned at the offices of the two big comics publishers, Marvel and DC. His ambition, though, was to become a lawyer\u0026nbspand he graduated from Columbia University in the year 2000, intending to follow this path. He started working for the Justice Department.And then came 11 September. Like everyone else in America, King was appalled and shocked and numbed. But he also knew he wanted to do something in response. So he went on to the CIA website and discovered that they were recruiting.“They were looking to bring in a new generation of operatives to serve in this new world,” he says. “They wanted people who were good at connecting the dots. I went in maybe hoping to get a job as an information guy, I took the psych tests, and ended up as an operations officer.”Created with Sketch.Mister Miracle: The critically acclaimed graphic novel in pictures Show all 7Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Photos by DC ComicsPhotos by DC ComicsKing worked out in the field in Afghanistan and Iraq for seven years, and the exact nature of his work out there is necessarily vague. When his wife fell pregnant with their first son (they have three children now) he knew he had a difficult decision to make.“The part of the job I loved was being overseas, out in the war zone, as bizarre as that might sound,” he says. “But I knew I didn’t want to do that and have a family. I didn’t want to be away from my wife and kid for a year at a time.”Returning to the US, King didn’t resume his plan to become a lawyer but instead turned to his first love, writing. But he wasn’t back in the world of comic books just yet… or at least, not quite. King wrote a prose novel, but about superheroes. A Once-Crowded Sky was published in 2012, to good notices. Writing about superheroes had regalvanised his love of comics\u0026nbspand opened the door for him to work at DC.His first gig was a series about Dick Grayson, the original Batman side-kick Robin who grew up and adopted a new persona, Nightwing. Co-written with Tim Seeley with art by Mikel Jannen, the series was the first time that King was able to draw on his CIA past, as the character quit the superhero business to become a spy.That led to more work, and to the series that first brought King to wider notice – and his first collaboration with Mitch Gerads, his Mister Miracle co-creator. Published in late 2015, The Sheriff of Babylon was a critically-acclaimed crime series about a San Diego cop who becomes a military consultant in Iraq\u0026nbspand has to solve the murder of a young local police trainee.More work followed, with King getting to write characters both classic and obscure, from Batman to the Omega Men for DC, and the Vision (the character played by Paul Bettany in The Avengers movies) for Marvel.Which led to King and Gerads working together again on what has become one of the most well-received comic books in recent years, earning plaudits from mainstream reviewers and publications especially… Mister Miracle.Mister Miracle is a character who was first introduced in 1971, created by the towering genius that was Jack Kirby for DC comics. Real name Scott Free (ouch. But it was the 1970s, and King and Gerads do a fine job of contextualising that), Mister Miracle is billed as a “super escape artist”, Houdini in a cape and mask and yellow, green and red livery. He’s always been one of those B-List characters, except to the most devoted fans, in terms of recognisability.But in an age where, thanks to the big comics companies mining their intellectual properties and breathing fresh life and mainstream appeal into characters formerly known only to the cognoscenti – s of the Galaxy, anyone? Ant-Man? Black Panther? Aquaman? Suicide Squad? – even the non-rabid comics fan seems more willing to accept stories featuring characters who aren’t Superman, Batman, Captain America or Spider-Man.DC cancels comic where Jesus learns from superhero after backlash Still, a super escape artist in a garish costume. Possibly limited scope there for anything beyond a series of set-piece daring feats, you might think. Which is possibly why Mister Miracle won so much praise by being one of the most literary and absorbing stories released by DC in some years.It opens with a shocking image… the titular character slumped on his bathroom floor, wrists cut and bleeding out over the tiles. Yes, it begins with a superhero attempting to commit suicide.“Scott Free can escape from anything,” says King. “So we thought… he’s going to keep pushing it, trying to escape from more and more difficult situations. And eventually he thinks, can I escape from death?”King and Gerads had wanted to work on another big series after the Sheriff of Babylon, and initially they pitched an idea for a Batman comic but focussing on two big villains, the Joker and the Riddler. However, the characters were already earmarked for a storyline in the main Batman comic, so it was vetoed. DC, however, threw them another option.Gerads says, “I got a call from Tom and he told me that we couldn’t do the Batman story. He said what would your second choice be, and straight away I said Mister Miracle.” Gerads pauses. “That’s absolutely true. And Tom said, well, that’s what they’ve offered us. And he sent me the pitch and the first line was, ‘Mister Miracle attempts suicide’.”Starting from that dark place, the story then expands out into an exploration of, really, the anxieties of living in the modern era. Scott Free is married to the unlikely-named Big Barda, and they are attempting to navigate the mores of family life in present-day Los Angeles. But Scott and Barda are also not of this Earth.Original Mister Miracle creator Jack Kirby dreamed up for DC comics in the 1970s a series of books that became known as the Fourth World, existing within the normal DC continuity of Batman and Wonder Woman, but also slightly apart from it. It focussed on two worlds, New Genesis, where the benevolent New Gods lived, and Apokolips, brutal realm of the tyrannical Darkseid. New Genesis and Apokolips are perpetually at war, and in a bid to broker peace, their rulers Darkseid and the Highfather agree to swap infant sons. Scott Free is the child of New Genesis, brought up in the hellish Apokolips, where he learns his craft and meets Barda, one of the fearsome Female Furies. Together they escape, and make a new life on Earth, but are called back into the war, which is where we find them in this story.Mister Miracle was originally released as a 12-issue monthly series, and has just now been collected into a single volume. But it was always meant to be read as a graphic novel. King says, “It’s like a Dickens novel, which were originally serialised. It’s meant to be read as one story.” He pauses. “Not that I’m comparing myself to Dickens, obviously.”The story is a mix of domestic life and the horrors of war. In one memorable scene, Scott and Barda fight their way over several pages through the terrors of Apokolips, holding a conversation as they do about redecorating their condo flat, building up to the tender moment – delivered as each character despatches bad guys in a sequence that looks like a platform video game – that Barda reveals she is pregnant.Mister Miracle is a very personal book for both King and Gerads. The sheer exhausting nature of war comes across in several scenes, obviously drawn from King’s experiences. And Gerads’ son was born right in the middle of him working on the series, adding extra dimension to the point where Barda gives birth.Gerads has also done artwork for Batman (DC Comics)It should be noted that comics are a very collaborative medium, and King and Gerads worked closely on the distinctive look of the story. The trend in comics these days is for big, break-out images, kaleidoscopic panels, imaginative layouts. With Mister Miracle, the team went for a nine-panel grid, most closely associated with the classic of the genre from 30 years ago, Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons’ Watchmen.That’s perhaps informed the mainstream success of Mister Miracle. It might be an odd thing to say, but reading comics is a learned skill, and not everybody gets on with the medium. A strict page design allows for easier digesting of the narrative. Gerads says, “Some people in comics think doing a grid like this must be very constricting for the artist, but that’s not the case. The magic with this is that you know exactly how the reader is going to read your page.”King likens it to “almost like three Charlie Brown cartoons on each page, three panels each, and everybody knows how to read those”.Aside from being a meditation on war and a domestic drama with dialogue that would satisfy any Netflix drama binge-watcher, there’s also a bigger storyline at play in Mister Miracle. To wit, is any of it actually happening? Is it all, in fact, the dream of a superhero who’s lying on his bathroom floor, his life slowly ebbing away?“Living life is full of ambiguities,” says King, perhaps a little ambiguously himself.Gerads is more forthcoming, and points out that Scott Free is in every single scene in the story. “We never leave Scott’s side in the entire book, we go on this ride with Scott through the story. Perhaps by the end Scott realises that it doesn’t matter if it’s real or not, because one way or another this is what he’s lived through.”It was announced last year that one of DC’s next big movie projects will be based on the New Gods world, with Ava DuVernay (A Wrinkle In Time) lined up to direct. Rumours emerged in the last few weeks that Scott Free and Big Barda will actually form the central focus of the movie. Whether it will end up as an adaptation of this story, neither King nor Gerads could say, but if it does it could end up DC’s most interesting movie yet.King and Gerads are hatching another collaboration for DC, which they aren’t at liberty to discuss (though King drops the hint that there’s a clue within Mister Miracle as to what that might be) and in the meantime, King is writing for the publisher Heroes in Crisis, which deals with the post-traumatic stress disorder that could actually affect superheroes given the ongoing violence and battles they deal with on a daily basis.Does he find writing about the things he’s seen and experience during his time with the CIA cathartic? Or is it painful? Perhaps a bit of both, he says.“I think me writing about war has been more necessary than anything else,” he says. “War and the damage that war does has formed the basis for a lot of my work.

Yeah, she’s 93. Scarred for life.’ But you leave it, don’t you? Pete went, ‘Well, that’s not scarred for life then, is it?’”“She went, ‘What?’ ‘You scar a baby for life, don’t you?\u0026nbspIf she lives till she’s 100, she’s only been scarred for seven per cent of her life.’ He did the maths for her!

It’s aiming for a morning splashdown in the Atlantic off Florida’s coast, the final hurdle of the six-day test flight. Saturday’s launch and Sunday’s docking were spot on.\u0026nbspNASA astronauts have been stuck riding Russian rockets since space shuttles retired eight years ago. NASA is counting on SpaceX and Boeing to start launching astronauts this year. SpaceX is aiming for summer.(For context, there\u0027s no way the US can do this at the moment: its hope was always the Space Shuttle programme, so when that was cancelled it was left without a way of travelling up and down. Now it has to rely on the Russian space agency, which it pays to take astronauts to the ISS.\u0026nbspIf this works, it could change all that, by completing a plan to let private US companies build the rockets and capsules that will allow them to fly to space again. So it\u0027s a big day for Nasa and space travel generally, as well as SpaceX.)We\u0027re not going to\u0026nbspsee\u0026nbspevery part of the mission because of a communications blackout.

The company continues its shift to towards online-only sales, but now says it won\u0027t close as many stores as originally thought.\u0026nbspThe $35,000 base Model 3 will still be available, but the company is raising prices by 3 per cent on all other models.\u0026nbspIn a Monday filing with government regulators, Tesla now says it closed 10 per cent of its stores, but a few of those will now remain open. Another 20 per cent are being evaluated and some could remain open.\u0026nbspThe company gave no numbers, but said it would close only about half the stores that it had intended to. It has 378 stores and service centres worldwide and about 100 stores in the US.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch. Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.“As a result of keeping significantly more stores open, Tesla will need to raise vehicle prices by about 3 percent on average worldwide,” a company\u0027s statement said. “We will only close about half as many stores, but the cost savings are therefore only about half.”\u0026nbspRemaining stores could have fewer workers, but will have vehicles available for test drives and a small inventory in case people want to buy immediately, the statement said.\u0026nbspThe company also announced on Monday that it has purchased car-hauling trucks and trailers from a California company in a stock deal worth about $14.2m. Tesla paid for the purchase with about 50,000 previously authorised shares. Tesla wants to increase its vehicle transportation capacity and cut delivery times.\u0026nbspThe reversal shows that Tesla had second thoughts about shuttering the stores and whether buyers would make such a large purchase without a test drive. The company says it still plans to offer buyers the ability to return purchased vehicles at no cost after a seven-day or 1,000 mile test drive.\u0026nbspGartner analyst Michael Ramsey called the move “startling” and said it undermines the credibility of Mr Musk and Tesla\u0027s management.\u0026nbsp“How else can you view it except to see it as a remarkable example of lack of foresight or planning?” Mr Ramsey asked. “It\u0027s almost as if the decision was announced and made without any analysis of what the outcome would be.”\u0026nbspMr Musk probably realised that he was locked into long-term leases on the stores that he would have to pay regardless of whether they were closed, Mr Ramsey said.\u0026nbspThe move made no sense to begin with because Tesla had spent millions fighting in courts and state legislatures trying to change laws that prevented companies from selling vehicles at their own stores, Ramsey said.\u0026nbspTesla starts taking orders for Model 3 electric carBut he also said the move to close 10 per cent of stores and evaluate others is the right thing to do, and said most retail companies do that all of the time.\u0026nbspMessages were left Monday seeking comment from a Tesla spokesman.\u0026nbspShares of Tesla edged up less than 1 per cent in trading early Monday.\u0026nbspIn announcing the move on 28 February, chief executive Elon Musk said it was necessary to cut costs in order to profitably sell the mass-market version of the Model 3 sedan for $35,000. That\u0027s a price point needed to reach more consumers and generate the sales that the company needs to survive, Mr Musk has said.\u0026nbspBefore the announcement, the cheapest Model 3 started at $42,900.\u0026nbsp“This is the only way to achieve the savings for this car and be financially sustainable,” Mr Musk told reporters during a conference call announcing the change. “It is excruciatingly difficult to make this car for $35,000 and be financially sustainable.”\u0026nbspElon Musk branded \u0027a liar\u0027 by investor as US regulators seeks to oust Tesla bossOn 28 February, the company said shifting totally to online sales would allow it to lower all vehicle prices by 6 per cent, on average, including its higher-end Model S and Model X.\u0026nbspAt the time, Mr Musk also walked back the company\u0027s guidance that it would be profitable in all future quarters, saying it would post a loss in the first quarter of this year.\u0026nbspAll other major car manufacturers rely on vast dealer networks, but Mr Musk co-founded Tesla in 2003 in an effort to shake up the industry, starting with a focus entirely on a fleet of cars powered by electricity instead of petrol.\u0026nbspWe’ll tell you what’s true.

Many had hoped we would have clarity at this stage, particularly in advance of the vote tomorrow. We don’t yet.“The British prime minister is travelling to Strasbourg this evening, I understand, to try to finalise an agreement, if that is possible, to be able to put that to a meaningful vote in Westminster tomorrow.”Created with Sketch.

Is this true, he asks?\u0026nbspAnd even if an agreement is reached between Ms May and Jean-Claude Juncker tonight, will it have the approval of EU heads of government, he says?\u0026nbspWalker again completely refuses to answer either question.The SNP\u0027s Ian\u0026nbspBlackford demands to know whether the agreement that MPs will\u0026nbspvote\u0026nbspon tomorrow will include changes to the Northern Ireland backstop.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspRobin Walker ignores the question.\u0026nbspBrexit minister Robin Walker confirms there will be a meaningful vote tomorrow.\u0026nbspHe repeats that negotiations are ongoing and that the government is still seeking legally-binding changes to the backstop.\u0026nbspHe re-iterates that the attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, will publish his updated legal advice on the Brexit deal before the vote tomorrow.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspPressed by Tory grandee Ken Clarke, he also confirms - significantly - that the plan is still for votes on no-deal and extending Article 50\u0026nbspto take place on Wednesday and Thursday if Ms May\u0027s deal is rejected tomorrow.\u0026nbspJeremy Corbyn says the government is in chaos.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspHe says that time\u0026nbspand time again this prime minister has failed to negotiate, failed to compromise and delayed and delayed and delayed.\u0026nbspThe government is running down the clock until 29 March in a bid to force its deal through Parliament, he says.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspJeremy Corbyn is now asking his Urgent Question in the Commons.

The Opposition is demanding that Theresa May come to the Commons herself, but it is still unclear whether or not she plans to do so.\u0026nbspThat decision appears to partly depend on whether or not the prime minister travels to Strasbourg this afternoon to try to seal some sort of last-ditch compromise offer with EU leaders.

However, the most significant amendment, for a referendum on the deal, is not going to be tabled by its advocates, the Labour MPs Phil Wilson and Peter Kyle, despite having attracted widespread cross-party support.\u0026nbspThey have been persuaded that their amendment would distract from efforts by supporters of a new referendum to defeat Theresa May’s deal.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.

A common way to cover up the messy process of (de)construction. The housing development claims to be affecting time and space, moving people into new places and better futures, fundamentally altering their existenceAlastair Campbell, one of the leading advocates of a Final Say referendum, says that Tuesday “must belong to May being made to see her deal will not – and cannot – fly”.\u0026nbspThe decisive factor in withdrawing the amendment, though, was probably the reluctance of Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, to commit to whipping his MPs to back it. He and John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, had already persuaded Wilson and Kyle to remove any reference in the draft amendment to “approving” the government’s deal – even on condition of a referendum.\u0026nbspThe left-wing case for Brexit is becoming more ridiculous by the dayEven if the Labour leadership supported it, however, a referendum amendment is almost certain to lose. I estimate that there are currently 283 MPs\u0026nbspwho support a second referendum, which means there are 355 against. So it makes sense for Wilson and Kyle to bide their time.\u0026nbspOther amendments are likely to be tabled by other MPs on Tuesday, and it may be that some of them will call for a new referendum. Vince Cable, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, has recently tabled mischievous amendments calling for “a public vote” to Corbyn’s amendments, in an attempt to embarrass the Labour leader for failing to press the policy.\u0026nbspBut such an amendment is unlikely to be selected by John Bercow, the speaker, who chooses which amendments should be put to the vote, depending on the level of support they have in the Commons.\u0026nbspSo there will probably be no vote on the principle of another referendum on Tuesday, but, if the prime minister’s deal is defeated, there will be further votes and further chances for Wilson and Kyle to table their amendment. As Kyle said today: “We’re ready to go when the moment for compromise emerges.”\u0026nbspIf the deal is defeated and the House of Commons votes to delay Brexit, which would be the likely next step, then a referendum will become a real possibility, and Wilson and Kyle’s moment may have arrived.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

Ironically Brexit also sounds like a constipation relief medicine.After losing the vote in January, Ms May said she would head back to Brussels with the aim of reopening the withdrawal agreement, and securing legally binding changes to the Northern Irish backstop. So far, she has failed on both counts, with the EU 27 united in resistance to such efforts.\u0026nbspUnless the prime minister secures last-minute concessions this weekend, in an eleventh-hour dash to Brussels, many in Westminster expect the second “meaningful vote” to be resoundingly defeated too.\u0026nbspBritain does not want a long delay to Brexit saga, poll showsHowever, if parliament springs a surprise and her deal passes on Tuesday, Brexit will be secured – although\u0026nbspMs May would probably have to request a short extension to the Article 50 timeframe so that\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspcan\u0026nbspdebate and vote on key pieces of legislation that are required to be in place for exit day.\u0026nbspAssuming the prime minister does not win the day, the scale of defeat will be key.If it is similar\u0026nbspto January, it could be fatal for Ms May, who will undoubtedly face claims\u0026nbspthat she has wasted precious time in the last two months. Her deal will be considered dead.In this case, the prime minister would probably be out of options, and will be under considerable pressure to go down a softer Brexit route. This would risk\u0026nbspa potential\u0026nbspsplit in\u0026nbspher party while she seeks a majority for an alternative deal and effectively forms a parliamentary alliance\u0026nbspwith Jeremy Corbyn.Created with Sketch.

This would almost certainly require a short delay to the Brexit process.Mr Corbyn may also decide the time is opportune –\u0026nbspif Ms May loses badly –\u0026nbspto put down a second no-confidence motion in the government in an effort to force a general election, though\u0026nbspit still does not appear the Labour leader has the numbers in the Commons to win such a vote. \u0026nbspHe has also committed his party to backing an\u0026nbspamendment\u0026nbspon a second referendum, so this could also be the week in which MPs finally test whether there\u0026nbspis a majority for such a path. The consensus is that there is not, and it may be that proponents of a further public vote on Brexit do not test the Commons just yet.Votes on no-deal and Article 50 extensionCrucially, if the prime minister loses the “meaningful vote” on her deal, she has vowed to hold two further votes this week: one on a no-deal Brexit (due to take place on Wednesday), and a second an approving an extension to Article 50 and delaying Britain’s exit from the EU (Thursday). This is where there might be fireworks.EU accused of ‘playing games’ in last-ditch Brexit negotiationsBanks ‘broke agreement to suspend Brexit campaigning’ after Cox murderCorbyn tells May second defeat for her deal is ‘the end of the road’EU says Britain can leave backstop but Northern Ireland must stayPound falls after May warns of ‘moment of crisis’ over BrexitIt has been clear for some\u0026nbsptime that there is no majority in the House of Commons for a disorderly (or “cliff-edge”)\u0026nbspbreak from the bloc. As such, it is likely that MPs will vote to take a no-deal departure off the table.The following day there will be a vote on extending Article 50, and it is anticipated\u0026nbspthere will be a majority for this course of action.Ultimately, it is up to the EU 27 whether to grant any extension: if they agree,\u0026nbspterms and conditions might easily be attached. They could, for example, demand a lengthy extension rather than the\u0026nbsptwo-month period preferred at Westminster.Ms May will have to decide whether or not to give her own MPs\u0026nbspa free vote on the contentious issue of the no-deal scenario. It is an incredibly isive topic among Conservatives, and throughout the negotiations,\u0026nbspthe prime minister has deployed the threat of a no-deal outcome. \u0026nbspIf the prime minister decides not\u0026nbspto give Tory\u0026nbspMPs a free\u0026nbspvote, and whips them\u0026nbspto keep no deal on the table, it could easily lead to a significant number of ministerial resignations from the Remain-leaning figures at the top of government who would probably rebel.\u0026nbspAs the prime minister herself said, reject the deal and “no-one knows what will happen”\u0026nbspbut what we do know is that\u0026nbspMs May is about to enter one of the most dangerous weeks of her time in office.\u0026nbspGot an unanswered question about Brexit?

The PM\u0027s half-hearted proposals don\u0027t come anywhere near that protection.His concern was echoed by TSSA general secretary Manuel Cortes, who warned that the prime minister was playing fast and loose on the issue of workers\u0027 rights.He said: Our rights are not poker chips to be played with in the Conservative Brexit casino.Our rights are hard won and it\u0027s the duty of every Labour MP not to collude with the Tories to get rid of them.This clear expert legal opinion only goes to show that May\u0027s offer was never a serious prospect on workers\u0027 rights.Labour MP Jo Stevens, who supports the Best for Britain campaign,\u0026nbspsaid the PM\u0027s promises were meaningless and not worth the paper they are written on and urged her Labour colleagues not to be taken in.We’ll tell you what’s true.

No one knew it just yet\u0026nbspbut they heralded a dramatic escalation of tensions in which two nuclear-armed nations would launch airstrikes against each other for the first time in history. \u0026nbsp“Everyone woke up, everyone was frightened and ran outside the house,” Mr Yusuf, who lives with his wife and three children, tells\u0026nbspThe Independent.“They looked towards the sky to see what was happening. It was night, we couldn’t see anything but we heard the jets. They were very loud.“I had never heard that sound, but I knew what it must be. We thought something must be happening at the borders…\u0026nbspWe thought a war was starting.”Created with Sketch.Grenade attack injures at least 18 in Kashmir: in pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Glass shattered in the explosion litters the floor around the bus in Jammu, IndiaPolicemen inspect the bus that was subject of a grenade attack in Jammu, IndiaA sniffer dog and policemen inspect the site of a grenade attack in Jammu, IndiaPolicemen and onlookers stand at the site of a grenade blast in Jammu, IndiaPeople injured in a grenade attack are treated at the government medical hospital in Jammu, IndiaPolicemen inspect the site of a grenade attack in Jammu, IndiaA person injured in a grenade attack is carried for treatment to a government medical hospital in Jammu, IndiaPeople injured in a grenade blast are taken to the hospital for treatment in Jammu, IndiaPolicemen inspect the bus that was subject of a grenade attack in Jammu, IndiaGlass shattered in the explosion litters the floor around the bus in Jammu, IndiaPolicemen inspect the bus that was subject of a grenade attack in Jammu, IndiaA sniffer dog and policemen inspect the site of a grenade attack in Jammu, IndiaPolicemen and onlookers stand at the site of a grenade blast in Jammu, IndiaPeople injured in a grenade attack are treated at the government medical hospital in Jammu, IndiaPolicemen inspect the site of a grenade attack in Jammu, IndiaA person injured in a grenade attack is carried for treatment to a government medical hospital in Jammu, IndiaPeople injured in a grenade blast are taken to the hospital for treatment in Jammu, IndiaPolicemen inspect the bus that was subject of a grenade attack in Jammu, IndiaMr Yusuf is not the only resident of Srinagar who describes lying to his children that day. Though he knew it wasn’t true, he told his youngest son, 10-year-old Azar, that “everything was OK, it was a regular movement of jets”.This is the reality of life in Srinagar, caught in the middle of a row between India, Pakistan and Kashmiri leaders over the future of the region.For although both India and Pakistan administer part of Kashmir, they both claim it in its entirety.The tensions at the border mean that, even in the best of recent times, Kashmir has been described as the most highly militarised place on Earth, with an estimated 650,000 armed Indian security personnel stationed in a small valley surrounded on all sides by mountains.Srinagar, KashmirWere it not teeming with armed police, Srinagar would be an inviting tourist destination. It boasts excellent skiing, trekking, stunning views over the great Dal Lake and exceptional heritage architecture.Yet even the Pari Mahal, a 400-year-old terraced Mughal garden overlooking the valley, has its ancient stone pavilions stuffed with sandbags. The Indian paramilitary police force has moved in with a small camp here, too.For residents, tensions have spiked dramatically since the 14 February car bomb attack by a separatist militant on an army convoy, and the aerial engagement that followed between India and Pakistan.Abdul Karim Kaloo, a boatman in his seventies offering rides across the Jhelum river, says the last time he saw fighter jets flying over Srinagar was in the 1965 India-Pakistan war.“This reminds me of that time,” he says.With traders’ associations calling regular strikes and the city on edge, Mr Kaloo says his business is suffering. “It’s really down, and there is also a lot of fear among the people of Kashmir because of this conflict.”He has two grandchildren, and worries for their safety most of all. “People don’t know if they leave their home in the morning, whether they’ll come back in the evening,” he says.There are no shoppers along the downtown street where tourist groups would normally be taken to see handicrafts and Kashmiri textiles, much sought after in the rest of India.One elderly shopkeeper is too nervous to talk in the current climate.Another, 25-year-old Aabid Kapra, speaks passionately about how, between the strikes and tensions with the security forces, the current crisis is killing his business.“Day by day we are becoming more stressed. Financially we are losing, our education is disappearing, our businesses are being lost, and it is taking its toll on our minds.”The armed police have been enforcing greater restrictions on movement and crackdowns on separatist political groups since the Pulwama attack, and Mr Kapra spoke angrily about being blocked from walking to his own shop.“Whenever I go outside and see the armed troops standing there, I feel harassed,” he says. “In the rest of India, the army are there to help you. Here, because they are a show of force, you can’t even ask them for an address. And if you see them doing something wrong, they are not accountable for anything.”Pari Mahal,\u0026nbsp400-year-old\u0026nbspMughal garden overlooking the valley\u0026nbsp(Adam Withnall)Speaking in a cafe where chronic food shortages meant most items were struck off the menu, medical student Aabru Jaan, 22, says she has felt a change in the behaviour of the Indian paramilitary forces since 40 of their officers were killed at Pulwama.“We feel like the soldiers think we are their enemies now,” she said.\u0026nbspShe sympathises with their emotions. “Being a Kashmiri, we all know what it is to lose a family member,” she says. “We have all lost someone. In my village we have lost lives, and youngsters have been injured by pellet guns.”Like Mr Kapra, she says\u0026nbsp“just going out and about” has become a challenge.“There are so many restrictions, more soldiers have been called here, and because the situation has been so intense I feel like Kashmir is no longer safe for Kashmiris,” she says.“Before Pulwama, we felt like the situation was improving – still not normal\u0026nbspbut it was OK. Now this is all leading to a crisis between Pakistan and India, and Kashmir is getting stuck in the middle.”Father of Kashmir suicide bomber defends his son’s actionsIs it safe to go to India given the conflict in Kashmir?Six civilians killed as India and Pakistan continue shelling Tensions rise between India and Pakistan after jets shot downSitting with a friend on the grassy riverbank, 21-year-old computer engineer Mohammad Abrar has a good job and, it would seem, plenty of reason\u0026nbspto be optimistic.\u0026nbspHe says, though,\u0026nbspit has been a week of “sleepless nights” for the city, and “the first time in my life that I had seen tension like this on the streets of Srinagar”.\u0026nbspWhen the jets were flying overhead last week it was “like a scene from a war movie”, he says. “We were very worried, we didn’t feel safe in our homes.”Even if tensions ease a little in the future, he is not optimistic for a long-term solution that might bring hope to the people of Srinagar. “There is no future here for anyone,” he says. “For any child, any man, in any home, there is nothing.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

The Kumbh Mela is a series of ritual baths by Hindu sadhus, or holy men, and other pilgrims at Sangam that dates back to at least medieval times. Pilgrims bathe in the river believing it cleanses them of their sins and ends their process of reincarnation.

The arctic spots where winter itself is under threat. The cities where a combination of climate change and bad planning has resulted in devastation. That is why Puerto Rico earned the number one spot on our annual list of 52 places to visit in the coming year. The island and the other beautiful places at risk raise an urgent question: do we owe something to the places that make us happy? “This is the new normal, and people have to look at this new normal and embrace it,” says Martha Honey, executive director of the Centre for Responsible Travel in Washington DC. The idea that as visitors we should not cause harm and should seek out authentic experiences that get us deep into the local culture. Perhaps it would not be such a stretch to redefine the relationship between leisure travellers and their dream destinations. Mireya Navarro252 Hampi, India: An ancient archaeological complex becomes more accessibleAt the height of the Vijayanagar empire in the 16th century, Hampi thrived as one of the largest and richest cities in the world. Its architectural legacy lives on in the southwestern state of Karnataka with over 1,000 well-preserved stone monuments, including Hindu temples, forts and palaces. Spread over 16 miles near the banks of the Tungabhadra river, and surrounded by a sea of granite boulders, the Unesco world heritage site has been notoriously difficult to reach, until now. TruJet recently began daily direct flights from Hyderabad and Bangalore to Ballari, a 25-mile drive from Hampi. Travellers can stay in the newly refreshed Evolve Back Kamalapura Palace or at Ultimate Travelling Camp’s new Kishkinda Camp, which introduced 10 stately tents in December. The outfitters Black Tomato and Remote Lands now offer journeys in the region, from guided archaeological tours to rock climbing and river jaunts in basket boats. Nora Walsh352 Santa Barbara, California: The ‘American Riviera’ becomes a hip food and wine havenLong known for drawing movie stars and millionaires to its resorts, Santa Barbara is now a foodie magnet. Acclaimed chef Jesse Singh oversees Bibi Ji, an edgy Indian restaurant –  try the uni biryani –  with a wine list curated by noted sommelier Rajat Parr. Top Chef alum Phillip Frankland Lee presides over the Monarch, a posh Californian restaurant, and Chaplin’s Martini Bar he will open Silver Bough, a 10-seat tasting menu venue in January. The Santa Barbara Inn’s Convivo offers upmarket Italian fare and ocean views nearby, at Tyger Tyger, Daniel Palaima, a veteran of the kitchens of Chicago-based chef Grant Achatz, serves southeast Asian fare (try the Szechuan pepper soft serve ice cream at Monkeyshine to finish off the night). The city has over 30 wine tasting rooms that don’t look like their more staid cousins up north. Frequency and Melville feature modern furnishings and party-ready playlists vinyl rules at Sanguis, a winery run by drummers. Sheila Marikar452 Panama: New eco-friendly resorts open on the country’s Pacific coastTwo new Pacific island resorts are expanding Panama’s west coast appeal, not far from the marine preserve around Isla Coiba. Cayuga Hospitality recently opened Isla Palenque in the Gulf of Chiriqui, with eight casitas and one villa on a lush 400-acre island. Besides offering access to seven beaches, mangrove kayaking and whale-watching, the resort grows some of its own food, has furniture made from fallen trees and maintains a no-plastics policy, including subbing papaya shoots for straws. In the Gulf of Chiriqui, Islas Secas Reserve and Panama Lodge opened in January on a 14-island archipelago. The solar-powered, nine-bungalow lodge offers sport fishing and scuba ing, and composts food waste and recycles water for irrigation. A Ritz-Carlton Reserve property is also under construction in the Pearl Islands. Elaine Glusac552 Munich, Germany: Theatre. Art. Opera. What more do you want?As far as cultural triple threats go, it’s hard to beat Munich. Its theatres are considered among the most creative and ambitious in Europe, with its two main companies, the Münchner Kammerspiele and the Residenztheater producing more than 30 premieres between January and May 2019. And its museums are decidedly world class, especially since the renovation and reopening of the Lenbachhaus museum in 2017, with its unmatched collection of the German artists known as the Blue Rider school. But perhaps the best argument for visiting Munich right now is the Bavarian State Opera, which has emerged as one of the most exciting opera houses in Europe. The reason? In the words of a New York Times classical music critic, “the miracle of Kirill Petrenko”. Petrenko has just two more years remaining on his contract as music director at the opera. This summer, he will conduct a new production of Richard Strauss’s Salome, with the opening night performance on 27 June. Stuart EmmrichBeneath the prismatic waters of this Red Sea resort on Israel’s southern tip lies a coral reef with hundreds of varieties of neon fish, sharks and stingrays. To get there, visitors used to have to catch a charter flight from Tel Aviv or brave the dusty drive through the Negev desert. But with the opening early this year of Ramon Airport, set in the Timna Valley and capable of handling 4 million international transit passengers a year, the world will finally get a direct route –  with nonstops from Munich and Frankfurt on Lufthansa, and budget carriers flying in from Prague, London and across Europe. New hotels, including the luxurious Six Senses Shaharut, opening just in time for Israel’s turn at hosting the Eurovision Song Contest 2018, are ready for the crowds. Debra Kamin752 Setouchi, Japan: Art and nature harmonise in Japan’s inland seaThe Setouchi region will host the Setouchi Triennale 2019, a major art fair held in three seasonal instalments. One hour south via ferry or the Shinkansen bullet train, the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum reopens this spring after an eight-year refurbishment. New trails and a dedicated Shimanami bike ferry that opened in October connect Japan’s main island of Honshu to the region’s lesser-visited island of Shikoku. For those seeking more sybaritic forms of transport, the Guntu –  more a minimalist floating ryokan than a cruise ship –  with 19 walnut-clad rooms and open-air cypress soaking baths. In 2019, Setouchi Sea Planes will expand its scenic flights to several smaller islands and towns via Kodiak 100s. And a Japanese startup, Ale, launched the Shooting Star Challenge, a microsatellite that will create the world’s first artificial meteor shower, aiming to fill Setouchi’s skies in spring 2020, a taste of the high-tech one-upmanship to come in Tokyo’s 2020 Olympics. Adam H Graham852 Aalborg, Denmark: Architecture revitalises the waterfrontViking long ships once glided through Aalborg’s mighty Limfjord. Today, the city is turning its most famous natural asset into an artistic one. Wildly innovative buildings have sprouted on its shores, including the Utzon Centre, designed by Jorn Utzon, the architect of the Sydney Opera House – its new exhibition series on inspiring Nordic architects, runs through May. The curvilinear concert hall Musikkens Hus was recently followed by the vibrant Aalborg Street Food market the pedestrian and cycling Culture Bridge and the undulating Vestre Fjordpark, with an open-air swimming pool that meets the sea. Nordkraft, a power plant that was converted into a cultural hub, is celebrating its 10th anniversary with events in September. The Aalborg Akvavit distillery is being transformed into a new creative district over the next two years, presided over by a soaring glass polygonal sculpture by artist Tomás Saraceno, Harbour Gate from architect Bjarke Ingels, a hotel and more. Annelisa Sorensen952 The Azores, Portugal: The Caribbean comes to the middle of the AtlanticIn the nippy Atlantic Ocean a four-hour flight from the US, the subtropical volcanic islands of the Azores, complete with Unesco world heritage sites and biospheres, await discovery. Mystical green lushness, oversize volcanic craters now turned into lakes, steaming natural hot springs that puff out from the earth, blue hydrangeas by the thousands and the only coffee growers in Europe distinguish the island chain. New restaurants in Ponta Delgada include the locavore Casa do Abel, the Japanese-influenced Otaka, and Tasquinha Vieira, which specialises in local, organic cuisine, while new hotels include the Lava Homes on Pico Island, and the Grand Hotel Açores Atlântico, opening in July. Daniel Scheffler1052 Ontario Ice Caves, Canada: See them now, as climate change may pose a threatThe ice caves that emerge from the winds and waves that pound the north shore of Lake Superior have always been somewhat ephemeral. But climate change has brought an element of doubt into their future. For now, the caves are a regularly occurring feature, notably along the shoreline near Sault Ste Marie, Ontario. Made from snow and ice, the caves vary in size, shape and colour. Large waves before they freeze up are the essential ingredient for large caverns. The wind, shifts in the ice and the effects of the sun constantly remake the formations. February is the most reliable month for a visit. Getting to the caves involves driving one of the more scenic sections of the Trans-Canada Highway. Alona Bay and Coppermine Point are two of the more popular destinations. The staff members at Stokely Creek Lodge, a cross-country skiing and snowshoeing resort just outside of the Sault, keep track of where the most dramatic, but accessible, caves have formed each winter. Ian Austen1152 Zadar, Croatia: Incomparable sunsets, a ‘sea organ’ and untrammelled islandsAfter the Croatian football team captured the world’s attention in the World Cup –  its captain Luka Modric’s was particularly notable –  fans revved up their search engines and learned that he hails from Zadar, a pretty, compact town on the Dalmatian Coast. Ryanair have added regular flights from Prague, Hamburg, Cologne and Nuremberg, starting this spring. Beyond Zadar’s medieval core, the city’s seaside promenade and music-making “sea organ”, created by architect Nikola Basic, is a must-see (or hear). The magical sunsets alone were enough to wow Alfred Hitchcock, who visited the city in 1964. The town is also a gateway to untrammelled islands, like Dugi Otok an hour-and-20-minute ferry ride takes visitors to the sparsely populated island with uncrowded beaches and taverns. Seeking ultraclean waters? Then head to the island of Pasman, where the currents often change, making the surrounding waters some of the cleanest in the Adriatic. David Farley1252 Williamsburg, Virginia: The cradle of American democracy reflects on its pastIn 1619, the area that includes the Jamestown Settlement, Williamsburg and Yorktown was home to some of the most significant events in American history: the official arrival of the first African slaves to North America, the convening of the first representative assembly in America and the first recorded proclamation of Thanksgiving in the New World. The area will observe the 400th anniversary of these events all year, highlighted by the Tenacity exhibition at the Jamestown Settlement, which recognises the contributions of women during the Colonial era, along with an archaeology-focused exhibit. Colonial Williamsburg, the expansive living-history museum, will give visitors a taste of life in the 18th century, along with the reimagined American Revolution Museum at Yorktown. For thrill seekers, Busch Gardens Williamsburg, the European-theme amusement park, will unveil a new pendulum swing ride, while Water Country USA will unveil the state’s first hybrid water coaster. John L Dorman1352 Las Vegas: Sin City bets big on cultureSure, there are still slot machines, strip clubs and steaks aplenty, but other options for culture in America’s playground abound. The new Park MGM hosts residencies from two music legends through 2019: Lady Gaga, doing one show of her pop hits and another riffing on American classics, and starting in April, Aerosmith. Also a rollicking iteration of the Italian emporium Eataly and Best Friend, a Korean restaurant by Roy Choi, the LA food truck pioneer, that becomes a hip-hop club afterwards. The Wynn recently added live, Dixieland-style jazz to its lakeside brunch it also offers masterclasses on subjects like dumpling-making. Nearby, the Venetian debuted three craft cocktail bars, the Dorsey, Rosina and Electra, where guests can actually sit down and hear one another talk. Downtown, the Life Is Beautiful festival, which corrals an array of musicians and artists each fall, enters its seventh year 2018 stars included the Weeknd and Florence and the Machine. Sheila MarikarAfter completing a five-year historical preservation initiative to save its Unesco designation, Salvador, with its sherbet-coloured colonial facades, cobblestone streets and beaches, is gleaming. Rising along the coast of northeastern Bahia, the city’s downtown historic district thrums with vibrant Afro-Brazilian culture, ranging from free weekly performances by samba and drum corps to classical music and capoeira. Visitors can also find Salvador’s history exhibited in the new House of Carnival and, opening in 2020, the Museum of Music or catch a live concert at the Convention Centre, opening this year. The Fera Palace Hotel, a refurbished art deco gem, and the freshly minted Fasano Salvador, housed in a former 1930s newspaper building, both overlook All Saints Bay, which in November will host the finish of the International Regatta Transat Jacques Vabre, a 4,350-mile race along the historic coffee trading route between France and Brazil. Nora Walsh1552 Danang, Vietnam: A spot for foodies and beachgoersVietnam’s third largest city, is known for being a gateway to the nearby Unesco Heritage town of Hoi An. But it’s begun to develop a reputation as the Miami of Vietnam, with a strong foodie scene and new hotels and resorts popping up on a five-mile beach strip. A typical day might start with a morning swim on the crescent-shape Non Nuoc Beach and perhaps a quick stop at the Han Market. Then, an afternoon visit to the Marble Mountains, where travellers can explore the temples and pagodas that look out over My Khe Beach and, later, dinner back in the city, perhaps at Nén, a new restaurant from much-followed food blogger Summer Le. Perhaps finish the day with a visit to Cau Rong Dragon Bridge in the hills above the city. Don’t leave without sampling a bowl of mi quang, the justifiably famous local noodle soup made with a turmeric-infused broth, chicken, pork, local seafood and shredded cabbage, and available for about $1 (78p) at any number of street food stalls. Stuart Emmrich1652 Costalegre, Mexico: A beach vacation, without the crowdsCostalegre is a stretch of 43 largely unpopulated beaches, capes and bays along Mexico’s gorgeous Pacific coast, about halfway between the better known destinations of Puerto Vallarta and Manzanillo, and one that has so far escaped the attention of vacationers flocking to its popular neighbours to the north, Punta Mita and the surfer’s haven of Sayulita. One factor keeping away the crowds: lack of easy access. Up until now, the nearest airport has been more than a two-hour drive away, in Puerto Vallarta. But that will change with the planned opening of the Chalacatepec Airport in the second half of this year, which will cut travel time by more than half. And a clutch of luxury hotels will soon follow. For now, the best luxury option is Las Alamandas Resort, set on a 1,500-acre nature reserve, with just 16 suites in seven brightly painted casitas, as well as two restaurants, a spa and a large pool. Smaller hotels and even bungalows near the beaches can also be rented. Stuart Emmrich1752 Paparoa Track, New Zealand: A new wilderness trail explores a remote national parkOutdoor enthusiasts can head to New Zealand starting in October to trek the country’s first Great Walk trail to open in more than 25 years. Tracing the Pororari river along the west coast of the South Island, the Paparoa Track winds through Paparoa National Park, a reserve largely inaccessible until now. Built by the Department of Conservation for hikers and mountain bikers, the 34-mile trail (hiked in three days biked in two) departs from a historic mining town and traverses epic limestone gorges, beech forests and sandstone bluffs before culminating at the Punakaiki Blowholes. For a small fee, travellers can stay overnight in two new 20-bunk huts overlooking the southern Alps and Tasman Sea. The Pike29 Memorial Track, which honours victims of the 2010 Pike River Mine tragedy, intersects the route. Reservations can be made on the Department of Conservation’s website both tracks are free and no permit is required. Nora Walsh1852 Puglia, Italy: Baroque architecture and Adriatic beaches in Italy’s heelThe ancient fortified farmhouses called masserie, found only in the region of Puglia, are increasingly being turned into boutique hotels, most notably Rocco Forte’s Masseria Torre Maizza, and the 17th century Castello di Ugento, where guests can take cooking classes at the Puglia Culinary Centre. And the region’s 1,000-year-old wine culture, which began when the Greeks planted vines from their land across the Adriatic, is attracting more oenophiles to the area, including the owners of the London restaurant Bocca di Lupo, who recently bought a 600-acre estate in Salento called Tormaresca, where tastings are offered to visitors (you can also dine in their new restaurant in the town of Lecce). Puglia is also home to Europe’s Virgin Galactic spaceport, which is scheduled to open in 2019, with the promise of eventually sending passengers into space. No wonder Abercrombie and Kent’s new Italian cruise includes Puglia and Gargano National Park. Daniel Scheffler1952 Tatra Mountains, Slovakia: Off-the-grid skiing, rock climbing and moreWhile most visitors focus on Slovakia’s capital, Bratislava, the soaring Tatra Mountains have emerged as an under-the-radar destination for skiing and outdoor activities, with new gondolas at the Bachledka and Jasna ski areas slopes planned at Mlynicka Dolina and new chair lifts at Oravska Lesna in the nearby Fatra range to the northwest. And it’s not just about winter sports: there is excellent hiking, rock climbing, mountain biking and fly-fishing, while beyond the Tatras, Kosice, a regional capital, offers colourful street art and plenty of cafes and restaurants, thanks to its three universities and associated night life. Plan on posting plenty of photos: you’ll find untouched folk architecture throughout the region, as well as perfectly preserved gothic and baroque buildings awaiting your lens. Evan Rail2052 Calgary, Alberta: A spectacular library adds to a once-neglected neighbourhoodCalgary’s new Central Library, from the architectural firm Snohetta, creates not just a design destination, with daily tours, but also a gateway in the form of an arched cedar-clad passageway linking downtown to the city’s evolving East Village, a booming neighbourhood where the Bow and Elbow rivers meet. Calgary was founded in the East Village area in 1875, with a fort built to curb the growing whiskey trade, but the area suffered roughly 70 years of neglect before the Calgary Municipal Land Corp, formed in 2007, began transforming the area, adding parks, attractions and high-rises. The 240,000-square-foot library, with a performance hall, cafe, children’s play area and outdoor electromagnetic sculptures by Christian Moeller, is next to Studio Bell, home to the National Music Centre museum and performance space, and near the just opened Alt Hotel. Later this year, the multiuse building M2 promises more shops and restaurants beside the Bow river. Elaine Glusac2152 Olkhon Island, Lake Baikal, Russia: A natural wonder resisting the threats of developmentLake Baikal in Siberia is the world’s deepest lake, plunging 1 mile into the Earth’s crust. It contains nearly 20 per cent of the world’s unfrozen fresh water and is so abundant in wildlife –  bears, foxes, sables, rare and endangered freshwater seals –  that Unesco calls it “the Galapagos of Russia”. The wildlife, like the lake itself, has been under threat for years, from indifferent Soviet industrial policy, from climate change and from today’s rising tourism, especially from China. Even so, it remains largely unspoiled, and activists are working hard to keep it that way. Olkhon Island, Baikal’s largest, and a place that Buddhists consider one of the holiest in Asia, is a popular base for excursions year round, even from December to April or May, when the surface freezes into turquoise sheets of ice that Siberian winds churn into natural sculptures. The Baikal Ice Marathon, a charity devoted to the lake’s conservation, will be held 2 March. Steven Lee Myers2252 Huntsville, Alabama: Time to party like it’s 1969The 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing will draw crowds to Huntsville –  aka Rocket City –  home of the Marshall Space Flight Centre, where the spacecraft that launched astronauts to the moon were developed. Throughout the year, there will be daily reenactments of the moon landing at the US Space and Rocket Centre, but the biggest thrills are planned for the anniversary week of the Apollo 11 lunar landing mission in July. Beginning on launch day, 16 July, the centre will attempt to break a Guinness World Record by launching 5,000 model rockets at 8.32 am, the precise time that rocket engines ignited in 1969. Festivities will continue with a classic car show, concerts, a homecoming parade and a street party in downtown Huntsville –  the same location where Apollo workers celebrated after the successful mission. If that’s not fun enough, 2019 also marks the state’s bicentennial, giving Alabamians yet another excuse to party. Ingrid K Williams2352 Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas): Five kinds of penguins, easier to reachThe Falkland Islands, far off the coast of Argentina, offer an astonishing variety of wildlife that includes five kinds of penguins, hundreds of bird species, seals, sea lions and whales, as well as remote natural beauty that travellers often have to themselves. Two new local touring companies are increasing accessibility to the riches of the islands. Falklands Outdoors opened in November 2018 and offers mountain climbing, foraging, hiking and sea kayaking expeditions to beaches and penguin colonies that can’t be reached by road in January, Falklands Helicopter Services will start scenic flights to Volunteer Point (home to an enormous king penguin colony), and other isolated spots. While there’s a single weekly commercial flight in and out of the Falklands, the first new route to the islands from South America in more than 20 years is being planned: LATAM is expected to begin weekly flights to the islands from Brazil by late this year. Nell McShane Wulfhart2452 Aberdeen, Scotland: The granite city via brand new old-fashioned trainsJust as many famous European overnight train routes have been retired, the Caledonian Sleeper, the train that travels through the night from London to the north of Scotland, is rolling out new carriages for summer. The new cars preserve the romance of overnight trains, in contemporary comfort, with a choice of hotel-style suites, classic bunk beds or seats. The Highlander route to Aberdeen leaves Euston station in the evening and hits the Scottish coast by 5 am, so travellers who take an early breakfast in the dining car can enjoy coastal views as the sun rises (get off at Leuchars for medieval St Andrews). Off the train, Aberdeen and its surroundings offer historic castles set in fields of purple heather, in pine woods and along the dramatic coastline. Hiking trails abound on and around the queen’s estate at Balmoral, and rail buffs can visit the former royal train station in Ballater, closed since 1966, and ride on the Royal Deeside Railway a short drive from there. Palko Karasz2552 Golfo Paradiso, Italy: A rare unspoiled gem on the Italian RivieraThe well-known pearls of the Ligurian Riviera –  Portofino, Cinque Terre, Portovenere –  are overwhelmed with tourists, a problem so acute that in some areas authorities have debated measures to stem the flow of daytrippers. But just a few miles away, between Portofino and Genoa, remains a peaceful sliver of coastline rarely explored by travellers to the region. Known as the Golfo Paradiso, this small gulf is home to five often-overlooked villages, including Camogli, a colourful fishing hamlet as charming as any of the Cinque Terre. Italians will boast about the renowned local cuisine: fresh-caught anchovies, hand-rolled trofie pasta and cheese-filled focaccia from the town of Recco, a speciality that recently earned IGP status, a prestigious Italian designation for quality food products. Between meals, explore blooming gardens in Pieve Ligure, beaches in Sori and the romanesque abbey of San Fruttuoso, which is accessible only by boat or a long, sweaty hike. 2652 Dessau, Germany: A big birthday for BauhausThis year marks the 100th anniversary of the publication of German architect Walter Gropius’ “Proclamation of the Bauhaus”, a radical reimagining of art, architecture and design. To celebrate the Bauhaus centennial, cities around Germany will hold events, from the opening festival in Berlin –  several days of art, dance, concerts, theatre, lectures and more this month –  to the debut of the Bauhaus Museum in Weimar, where the movement was born. But the most compelling destination might be Dessau. Home of the Bauhaus school during the 1920s and 1930s, the northeastern German city still contains the school’s pioneering (and Unesco-listed) Bauhaus Building, the Gropius-designed Masters Houses, and the Prellerhaus studio building (a warren of former Bauhaus ateliers that now contains a hotel). And in September, Dessau opens its long-awaited Bauhaus Museum, a glassy, minimalist rectangle that will showcase typefaces, textiles, artwork, furniture and more from the movement. Seth Sherwood2752 Tunis, Tunisia: The spark for the Arab Spring, still litFreedom is what makes Tunis unique. Eight years after it kicked off the Arab Spring, it remains the only Arab capital with real freedom of expression, not to mention the peaceful rotation of power. But the city holds many other charms. Among them are the ruins of the ancient city of Carthage, from which Hannibal’s elephants once threatened Rome. The carefully preserved old medina dates from the 12th to the 16th century, when Tunis was a major centre of the Islamic world. The tree-lined Avenue Habib Bourguiba downtown bears the influence of decades of French rule. And the cafes, art galleries and blue-and-white hues of the neighbourhood of Sidi Bou Said, overlooking the Mediterranean, have long lured European painters, writers and thinkers. A short taxi ride away are the beaches and nightclubs of La Marsa. The French-influenced north African food is delicious. The local red wines are not bad. And, in another regional rarity, Tunis in 2018 elected a woman its mayor. David D Kirkpatrick2852 Gambia: Hippos and chimpanzees –  and a renewed sense of hopeGambia’s tourism industry was hit hard in 2017, when its long-time authoritarian ruler Yahya Jammeh refused to cede leadership after an election loss, forcing a political standoff that brought foreign troops in. But with its new president, Adama Barrow, now safely in place, there’s a renewed sense of hope across continental Africa’s smallest country –  now more accessible than ever. In January, a new bridge over the Gambia river, three decades in the making, will be inaugurated with a nearly 200-mile relay run to Dakar, Senegal. Peregrine Adventures launches its first cruise up the 700-mile river, with a stop at Baboon Island, home to hippos, crocodiles and chimpanzees, part of Africa’s longest-running centre for rehabilitating chimpanzees into the wild. New and coming hotels, including the African Princess Beach Hotel, and two properties by Thomas Cook, will serve as stylish bases. And new direct flights from Europe make getting to this west African country easier than ever. Ratha TepThe coastline just below the New South Wales-Queensland border is known as the Northern Rivers thanks to the tidal system snaking through it. Anchored by Byron Bay, the area has become a beacon for those seeking a breezy boho way of life. In recent years a more moneyed, stylish vibe has settled in and seeped from Byron into neighbouring small towns. Mullumbimby hosts one of the country’s most vibrant weekly farmers’ markets. Brunswick Heads, is home to a huge historic pub with a sprawling patio, and offers great shopping and Fleet, a restaurant that serves some of Australia’s most delightful cooking. Up and down the coast, the restaurant scene is thriving: Paper Daisy in Cabarita Beach sits in the ground floor of an old surf motel turned boutique hotel in Lennox Heads, Shelter’s dining room is open to the ocean breeze. For a taste of the old-school hippie wonderland from which all of this sprang, check out the Crystal Castle, a “crystal experience” in a hilltop garden. Besha Rodell3052 Frisian Islands and Wadden Sea: Oysters, seals, birds and dark skies on Europe’s wild left coastEurope’s windswept Frisian Islands are shared by Denmark, Germany and the Netherlands and linked by the Wadden Sea. Holland’s Lauwersmeer National Park offers dark-sky safaris and will open a seal rescue centre in 2019 that lets visitors rehabilitate and release two native seal species. Dutch campground resorts like Beleef Lauwersoog offer excursions to nearby Schiermonnikoog island and have expanded lodging options with new barrel-shaped sleeping pods and refurbished overwater bunkers, once used by duck hunters, on remote swaths of the North Sea. Denmark’s Fanoe island started offering DIY oyster foraging safaris, where visitors can rent boots and shucking tools to gather invasive, but delicious, Pacific oysters, thus helping preserve Denmark’s native Limfjorden oyster habitat. The Fanoe Oyster Festival, next in October 2019, has lured chefs across Denmark with an annual oyster cooking competition. Adam H Graham3152 New York City: New cultural monuments, and remembrances of the pastredefine the city’s physical and cultural infrastructure. At Hudson Yards, the largest single development since Rockefeller Centre took shape in the Depression, a cultural arts centre called the Shed will go into gear. Its largest theatre is a retractable structure on wheels that creeps back and forth like a giant steel caterpillar, turning the outdoor space of a plaza into indoor space for performances. Not far away will be what the developers are calling New York’s Staircase, an eight-storey structure with 154 flights of stairs and 2,000 steps. The wraps are to come off the Museum of Modern Art’s $400m expansion, increasing its space by almost a third. The TWA Hotel at Kennedy International Airport is a flight centre relic from 1962, with 512 hotel rooms in two new buildings. In June, the city will host World Pride – first time in the US – for the 50th anniversary. James BarronThe leadup to the next Winter Games is well underway in and around Beijing, and the spectacle is breathtaking. The most stunning transformations are happening a four-hour drive north in Chongli, once one of the country’s poorest areas and now home to several multibillion-dollar ski resorts, towering condominiums and flashy hotels. It has transformed into a glistening winter sports hub filled with restaurants, inns and watering holes. At least five ski resorts now surround the city, including places like Genting Secret Gardens, Fulong and Thaiwoo, which has an on-property brewery, a mid-mountain chalet that serves Swiss and Austrian fare, and brand new gondolas. A high-speed train from Beijing to Chongli should open in 2019. The skiing isn’t world-class. Nearly all of the snow comes from a cannon, and runs average about 1,300 vertical feet. But go now to see firsthand how the world’s most populous country is working overtime to become a competitive winter sports nation. Tim NevilleThe horseshoe-shaped Orcas, one of the largest islands that make up the San Juan archipelago, has gained fame in recent years for its impressive tide-to-table culinary scene and experimental wines, attracting, among others, Oprah Winfrey (in 2018, Winfrey bought a 43-acre estate on the island for a reported $8.275m). A new wine enterprise, Doe Bay Wine Co, is presenting its Orcas Project in 2019 –  a collaboration between acclaimed winemakers and vineyards in the Pacific northwest. Ventures from James Beard-nominated chef Jay Blackinton, who owns Hogstone, a former pizzeria now featuring ambitious nose-to-tail fare, and its more upscale counterpart Aelder, are also on the horizon. Another addition to the island are the luxury suites at Outlook Inn, in the town of Eastsound, overlooking Fishing Bay. If you want to hike, or ride a horse, the island’s Moran State Park will be adding trails to its 38-mile network this year. 3452 Uzbekistan: Visa-free travel and reopened borders along the Silk RoadIf you have ever wanted to travel the Silk Road, now may be the time to go. After more than 25 years since the fall of the Soviet Union, the former member country of Uzbekistan is going through its own perestroika. Among the modernising reforms are better official exchange rates and the ability to book flights and apply for visas online. Ground and air travel have also improved regionally, in part because of China’s $800bn One Belt, One Road initiative (which links countries stretching between east Asia and Europe), as well as reopened borders with neighbouring countries, reestablished flight routes between central Asian capitals, like Tashkent and Dushanbe, and increased flight service between New York and Tashkent. In addition to the relatively new Hyatt Regency in Tashkent, other international hotels are expected to open in the coming years. Erin Levi3552 Vestlandet, Norway: A bucolic paradise for mountain-climbing beer lovers Rural Vestlandet, in western Norway, home to some of Scandinavia’s most beautiful landscapes, is piquing the interest of outdoorsy types, especially those who take Rural Vestlandet is home to some of Scandinavia’s most beautiful landscapes and is piquing the interest of outdoorsy types. The Loen Skylift ferries travel more than 3,280 feet to the top of Mount Hoven in just a few minutes, while fearless climbers can put on a harness, hire a guide and make roughly the same journey in six hours, following a path that features one of the longest suspension bridges in Europe. After sightseeing, relax over an ale made with kveik, a local yeast that has enthralled brewers and scientists around the world in recent years for its fruity aromas and higher-than-normal fermentation temperatures. You can find it at bars like Tre Bror, in Voss, the Smalahovetunet restaurant and brewery nearby. Beer lovers who want to learn (and taste) more can time their visit to coincide with the October Norsk Kornolfestival, which features close to 100 beers made with kveik, often including juniper and other traditional regional ingredients. Evan Rail3652 Lyon, France: Soccer, sausage and fresh airFootball fans should set their sights on France this summer, especially Lyon, where we could see the US women will clinch their fourth World Cup title in the final match 7 July. Even if you can’t get tickets –  or détestez le football –  the city of half a million people and 4,000 restaurants is worth a visit. This year, Lyon plays host to an International City of Gastronomy project. The indoor, one-acre exhibition will include interactive workshops and conferences designed to showcase France’s cuisine and its contributions to health and pleasure. Held at the Grand Hôtel Dieu, a sprawling complex first founded in the 1300s that reopens after four years of renovations with shops, restaurants, public spaces. When it comes time to work off all those plates of pork sausage, hike in nearby Écrins National Park, where traditional working dogs protect herds of sheep. Book a stay at the Temple-Écrins hut, where workers recently wrapped up three years of renovations. Tim Neville3752 Doha, Qatar: Avant-garde architecture blooms in the desertAs the next men’s soccer World Cup approaches in 2022, the host nation, Qatar, is loading its capital with structures from the biggest names in international architecture. The sharp-angled, futuristic Qatar National Library, designed by Rem Koolhaas and his OMA firm, opened in 2018 2019 will welcome the National Museum of Qatar, a sprawling expanse of interlocking tilted circular discs by Jean Nouvel. A contribution from a third Pritzker prize-winner, Zaha Hadid, is slated to materialise in the form of a swooping, curvaceous stadium another stadium, from Pritzker-winner Norman Foster, is also under construction. The new structures add further dazzle to the Doha skyline, which already includes Nouvel’s syringe-like Doha Tower and the blocky white jumble of the Museum of Islamic Art, by IM Pei. Seth SherwoodTbilisi, Georgia’s charming capital, has been flooded with tourists over the past decade. But Batumi, a hushed seaside city where verdant mountains slope down to the Black Sea’s smooth stone beaches, offers a different experience. Already a popular escape for Russians, Iranians, Turks and Israelis, the city is preparing itself for its inevitable discovery by the rest of the world: new hotels –  including Le Meridien Batumi and a Batumi instalment of the design-centric boutique Rooms Hotel line –  are rising, and a cable car will swing straight to the coast from the hilltop Batumi Botanical Garden. Winemaking is another draw –  at the family-run BQ Wine Bar and the underground Karalashvili’s Wine Cellar, which pours the same rosé and amber-hued chkaveri varietals that Josef Stalin adored. Debra Kamin3952 Marseille, France: An influx of young creatives gives the city a new edgeSix years after Marseille was named European Capital of Culture in 2013, the city’s renewal is still galloping along. Jean Nouvel has just finished his striking new red, white and blue skyscraper La Marseillaise. The real proof of the city’s metamorphosis, however, is that it is attracting young creative types from all over France and beyond. Laura Vidal, a sommelier from Quebec, and British chef Harry Cummins opened La Mercerie, a market-driven bistro in an old notions shop in the city’s Noailles district last spring. Noailles is brimming with shops (don’t miss Épicerie I’ldeal, the best new food store), cafes and restaurants. Other districts in the heart of Marseille are being transformed as well. Near the opera, Tony Collins recently opened Deep, a coffee shop that roasts its own beans and also sells vinyl records and the mixologists at the Copper Bay bar shake it up for locals and guests from the nearby Les Bords de Mer, the city’s best new boutique hotel. Alexander Lobrano4052 Wyoming: A sesquicentennial celebration of women’s suffrage in the Equality StateIn 1869, the Territory of Wyoming passed the first law in US history granting women the right to vote –  nearly 51 years before the 19th amendment guaranteed the same entitlement to all women. This year, visitors can celebrate the 150th anniversary of Wyoming women’s suffrage at the Wyoming House for Historic Women, which honours the first woman to officially cast a ballot in a general election, and 13 other trailblazing women in the state’s political history. The restored Capitol building (reopening midyear), Wyoming State Museum and Cowgirls of the West museum also feature exhibits and artefacts celebrating women’s history. In addition, a variety of all-female trips are on offer throughout the year including Women’s Wellness Pack Trips on horseback from Allen’s Diamond 4 Ranch, cattle herding and archery at the WYLD West Women retreat, Hike Like a Woman nature adventures and fly-fishing clinics at the Proud Wyoming Woman Retreat. Nora Walsh4152 Los Angeles: Finally, more than Grauman’s (groan)Los Angeles too often gets boiled down to its least interesting element: Hollywood. It’s an insult to a region with a vibrant Koreatown (sit in the hot salt at Wi Spa and then feast on roast gui at Dong Il Jang) two nationally recognised high school show choirs (John Burroughs and Burbank) art galleries like the quirky Parker, in a Los Feliz mansion and several big-league sports teams, two of them soon moving to a new $2.6bn stadium. But in summer 2019 there will be an honest-to-goodness Hollywood reason to visit the area. After delays, the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures is scheduled to open in a Renzo Piano-designed complex on Wilshire Boulevard. Promised are interactive exhibits about the art and science of filmmaking, starry screenings in two theatres and to-die-for memorabilia –  the collection includes a pair of ruby slippers, 12 million photographs, 61,000 posters and 190,000 video assets. Brooks Barnes4252 Dakar, Senegal: An oasis of freedom in a region of unrestNgor or rent a board for a few hours to surf the more than a half dozen beaches that offer a terrific year-round break. Or just sit back and watch the surfers while eating grilled fish at a long strip of beach restaurants. A Museum of Black Civilisations will be opening early this year and will showcase artefacts as well as contemporary art from Africa and the diaspora. The city’s design and fashion creations would fit right in at New York showrooms. Take in a late-night concert with legends like Cheikh Lo and Youssou N’Dor crooning into the wee hours and a lively bar scene that offers all-hours entertainment. Day trips let you sleep in a baobab tree, zip line through a baobab forest or swim in a pink lake. But climate change, overfishing and a booming population may eventually take their toll. Dionne Searcey4352 Perth, Australia: A city transformed and enlivenedA decade-long development boom has supercharged Perth. Among the new attractions: Yagan Square, with its distinctive market hall, art park and 147-foot digital tower showcases work by local artists and livestreams events Optus Stadium, a 60,000-seat venue for concerts and sporting events and Raine Square, a $200m redevelopment that includes a movie theatre, shopping and restaurants including dim sum chain Tim Ho Wan, considered the world’s most affordable Michelin-starred restaurant. To accommodate the expected growth in tourism, 31 new or redeveloped hotels have opened in the past five years, including the luxury COMO, the hip QT and a Westin. Since 2007, liquor law reforms, including a 2018 change that let restaurants serve drinks without a meal, have changed the drinking and dining scene with more than 100 small bars opening in the central business district alone. And Qantas started a nonstop flight from London to Perth this year, the first from Europe. Kelly DiNardo4452 Hong Kong: Dazzling infrastructure eases travel but could threaten independenceAfter Britain returned its former colony to China in 1997, Hong Kong prided itself on resisting mainland interference. Last year saw the opening of a high-speed train that takes passengers all the way to Beijing, and a 34-mile sea bridge linking Hong Kong to the mainland for the first time, opening the question of whether that independent streak can survive. For travellers, though, boarding a train at the new West Kowloon station bound for Beijing –  and more than 30 other destinations in China –  is a game changer. The 1,200-mile trip to Beijing is just nine hours, and the business-class seats are roomy. Whether they are headed to China or not, travellers can indulge in British nostalgia at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel. The 25th-floor M bar offers fabulous views of the harbour, exotic cocktails like Sarawak Tea Punch and memories of the 1960s when the hotel opened as a symbol of luxury and style in this ever-glamorous city. Jane Perlez4552 Iran: Tourism cautiously returns to this Middle East jewelThe appeal of Iran for adventurous travellers is obvious: the monumental ruins of ancient Persia the spectacular, centuries-old mosques of Shiraz and Isfahan the Grand Bazaar and Golestan Palace in bustling Tehran. One additional reason to visit in 2019 is a major exhibition scheduled to open at the Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art. “Portrait, Still-life, Landscape” (21 February to 20 April) will take over the entire museum, with a selection of about 500 works, including pieces by Andy Warhol, Mark Rothko and Marcel Duchamp, as well as about 40 Picassos recently discovered in the museum’s storage facilities (much of the collection has been kept under wraps since the 1979 revolution). The US State Department discourages, but does not prohibit, travel to Iran by American citizens, and Americans can travel to Iran only as part of an organised tour. Options for 2019 include three expeditions from Intrepid Travel, including the company’s first-ever all-female tour. Stuart Emmrich4652 Houston: Rebounding bigger and better after a hurricaneAfter Hurricane Harvey, the city is back on its feet and showing off the everything-is-bigger-in-Texas attitude. Four food halls opened in 2018, including Finn Hall, which features up-and-coming chefs like James Beard-nominated Jianyun Ye and a downtown outpost of his Chinese hotspot Mala Sichuan and a taqueria from local favourite Goode Co. The five-diamond Post Oak Hotel has a two-storey Rolls-Royce showroom, art by Frank Stella and a 30,000-bottle wine cellar. The Menil Collection, known for its eclectic art ranging from Byzantine antiques to 20th century pop art, underwent a renovation and opened the 30,000-square-foot Menil Drawing Institute. The city’s museum boom continues with an expansion of the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, to be completed in 2020, a newly built location for the Holocaust Museum, which will move in this spring, and a restoration of the Apollo Mission Centre that will open in time for the 50th anniversary of the moon landing in July. Kelly DiNardo4752 Columbus, Ohio: Is this the American city of the future?With a revitalised riverfront and booming downtown, Columbus is already one of the nation’s fastest-growing cities. Now, it’s poised to become the model for the future of innovative urban transportation, with self-driving shuttles carrying travellers along the Scioto Mile, recently revitalised, adding 33 acres of riverfront green space for festivals, water sports and outdoor art. Among the newest dining options are Veritas, which specializes in small-plate offerings Service Bar, run by young chef Avishar Barua, a veteran of New York’s Mission Chinese and WD-50 and, in the North Market neighborhood, veggie-forward Little Eater. The Short North Arts District offers access to the city’s local businesses like the new fashion store Thread and the original Jeni’s ice cream store. But don’t skip Italian Village and German Village neighborhoods, where innovators and dreamers have opened destination shops like Stump Plants and Vernacular and bars like Cosecha. Daniel Scheffler4852 Plov, Bulgaria: A city ready for the spotlightWith its colourful, cobblestoned historic centre, well-preserved Roman ruins and lively art scene, Bulgaria’s second-largest city is surprisingly overlooked by tourists who favour the quirky, post-Soviet charm of the country’s capital, Sofia. But as a European cultural capital of 2019, this gem is ready to shine. Organisers have planned more than 500 events throughout the city and its region, including concerts, open-air theatre performances and street-food fairs. Tucked into the heart of central Bulgaria and built on seven hills, Plov features an artistic quarter called Kapana, whose winding streets are lined with galleries and stylish cafes, as well as a beautifully restored Roman amphitheatre that hosts summer opera performances under the stars. The city’s location at the foot of the Rhodope Mountains –  with their stunning views of peaks and deep gorges — makes it an excellent launch point for hiking day trips. Ann Mah4952 Vevey, Switzerland: A once-in-a-generation winegrowers’ festival on the Swiss RivieraEverything runs like clockwork in Switzerland, including the Fête des Vignerons, although its timetable is considerably extended. This Unesco-recognised wine festival, which celebrates the viticultural traditions of the Lavaux and Chablais regions near Lake Geneva, takes place every 20 to 25 years in the heart of Vevey, a breathtaking lakeside town beneath sloping vineyards in the canton of Vaud. Since 1797, the date has been decided by the Confrérie des Vignerons, which has spent the past several years (and a reported 99 million Swiss francs, or roughly $98m) planning for the 12th edition, which will run from 18 July to 11 August. For the first time, tickets for the two-hour show can be purchased online. Oenophiles seeking a “full-bodied” experience of Helvetian wines, which are rarely exported, can also download the new app from the Canton of Vaud featuring eight wine-centric hiking routes, including one above Vevey. Erin Levi5052 Cádiz province, Spain: Sparkling cities and towns in southwest AndalusiaAt the tip of a peninsula thrust into the Atlantic, the city of Cádiz, a trading hub since 1100, has a vibe that’s more Havana than Madrid. A culinary renaissance is underway, with newcomers like Saja River and Codigo de Barra joining classics like El Faro. But the biggest gastronomic news lies across the bay in Puerto de Santa Maria, where Angel León’s Aponiente, which has three Michelin stars, offers a lyric poem to seafood (plankton risotto). A second León restaurant, Alevante, in nearby Sancti Petri just received its first star. Twenty minutes inland, Jerez de la Frontera is a cradle of the fortified wines known as sherry, which are now on the hot list of sommeliers and the craft-cocktail crowd. Beyond the cities, hilltop villages like Vejer de la Frontera lure expatriates with a blend of hip luxury hotels and art by the likes of Olafur Eliasson at NMAC sculpture garden. Add a stretch of Atlantic shore, and the province of Cádiz ticks all the boxes. Andrew Ferren5152 Elqui Valley, Chile: Eclipse mania, and nights of dark skiesThe Elqui Valley in Chile attracts a erse group of wine and pisco aficionados, stargazers and nature lovers. In 2019, this tranquil agricultural region takes centre stage in the path of totality of a full solar eclipse 2 July. Demand for lodging around this time has far outstripped supply, with an estimated 300,000 people expected in the area, and even hotels at the nearby coastal town of La Serena are booked solid. But those travelling outside eclipse mania still have many reasons to stare at the exceptionally clear sky the Elqui Valley was named the world’s first International Dark Sky Sanctuary as well as a centre of international global astronomy. When the sun is up, travellers can hike through vineyards or stroll through the streets of Vicuña, the largest city. It is a centre of pisco (brandy made in Chile and Peru) production and also the birthplace of poet Gabriela Mistral, winner of the 1945 Nobel Prize in Literature. Peter Kujawinski5252 The islands of Tahiti: The birthplace of the overwater bungalow ups its ecotourismThose looking to escape the news cycle can’t get much farther away than this south Pacific archipelago, also known as French Polynesia, which in 2019 celebrates the 250th anniversary of Captain James Cook’s arrival and subsequent trumpeting of its riches. Overwater bungalows were invented here: Tahiti’s clear waters offer views of more than 1,000 species of marine life. To guard against the climate change threatening parts of the region, the 118 islands and atolls have bolstered their conservation and ecotourism options. Paul Gauguin Cruises offers wildlife discovery immersions. Hotels are trying to decrease their carbon footprints: the Brando resort’s eco-friendly facilities include a coconut-oil-powered electric plant, an organic garden and solar panels. Resorts aren’t the only lodging option. The Tahitian Guesthouse experience unchains visitors from hotels and offers a more authentic Polynesian experience. Air Tahiti Nui just unveiled new jets with high-speed wifi. Sheila Marikar152 Puerto Rico: After a devastating hurricane, an island on its way backPuerto Rico is representative of the many fragile places around the globe right now: the islands facing a future of sea level rise and extreme weather. The arctic spots where winter itself is under threat. The cities where a combination of climate change and bad planning has resulted in devastation. That is why Puerto Rico earned the number one spot on our annual list of 52 places to visit in the coming year. The island and the other beautiful places at risk raise an urgent question: do we owe something to the places that make us happy? “This is the new normal, and people have to look at this new normal and embrace it,” says Martha Honey, executive director of the Centre for Responsible Travel in Washington DC. The idea that as visitors we should not cause harm and should seek out authentic experiences that get us deep into the local culture. Perhaps it would not be such a stretch to redefine the relationship between leisure travellers and their dream destinations. Mireya Navarro252 Hampi, India: An ancient archaeological complex becomes more accessibleAt the height of the Vijayanagar empire in the 16th century, Hampi thrived as one of the largest and richest cities in the world. Its architectural legacy lives on in the southwestern state of Karnataka with over 1,000 well-preserved stone monuments, including Hindu temples, forts and palaces. Spread over 16 miles near the banks of the Tungabhadra river, and surrounded by a sea of granite boulders, the Unesco world heritage site has been notoriously difficult to reach, until now. TruJet recently began daily direct flights from Hyderabad and Bangalore to Ballari, a 25-mile drive from Hampi. Travellers can stay in the newly refreshed Evolve Back Kamalapura Palace or at Ultimate Travelling Camp’s new Kishkinda Camp, which introduced 10 stately tents in December. The outfitters Black Tomato and Remote Lands now offer journeys in the region, from guided archaeological tours to rock climbing and river jaunts in basket boats. Nora Walsh352 Santa Barbara, California: The ‘American Riviera’ becomes a hip food and wine havenLong known for drawing movie stars and millionaires to its resorts, Santa Barbara is now a foodie magnet. Acclaimed chef Jesse Singh oversees Bibi Ji, an edgy Indian restaurant –  try the uni biryani –  with a wine list curated by noted sommelier Rajat Parr. Top Chef alum Phillip Frankland Lee presides over the Monarch, a posh Californian restaurant, and Chaplin’s Martini Bar he will open Silver Bough, a 10-seat tasting menu venue in January. The Santa Barbara Inn’s Convivo offers upmarket Italian fare and ocean views nearby, at Tyger Tyger, Daniel Palaima, a veteran of the kitchens of Chicago-based chef Grant Achatz, serves southeast Asian fare (try the Szechuan pepper soft serve ice cream at Monkeyshine to finish off the night). The city has over 30 wine tasting rooms that don’t look like their more staid cousins up north. Frequency and Melville feature modern furnishings and party-ready playlists vinyl rules at Sanguis, a winery run by drummers. Sheila Marikar452 Panama: New eco-friendly resorts open on the country’s Pacific coastTwo new Pacific island resorts are expanding Panama’s west coast appeal, not far from the marine preserve around Isla Coiba. Cayuga Hospitality recently opened Isla Palenque in the Gulf of Chiriqui, with eight casitas and one villa on a lush 400-acre island. Besides offering access to seven beaches, mangrove kayaking and whale-watching, the resort grows some of its own food, has furniture made from fallen trees and maintains a no-plastics policy, including subbing papaya shoots for straws. In the Gulf of Chiriqui, Islas Secas Reserve and Panama Lodge opened in January on a 14-island archipelago. The solar-powered, nine-bungalow lodge offers sport fishing and scuba ing, and composts food waste and recycles water for irrigation. A Ritz-Carlton Reserve property is also under construction in the Pearl Islands. Elaine Glusac552 Munich, Germany: Theatre. Art. Opera. What more do you want?As far as cultural triple threats go, it’s hard to beat Munich. Its theatres are considered among the most creative and ambitious in Europe, with its two main companies, the Münchner Kammerspiele and the Residenztheater producing more than 30 premieres between January and May 2019. And its museums are decidedly world class, especially since the renovation and reopening of the Lenbachhaus museum in 2017, with its unmatched collection of the German artists known as the Blue Rider school. But perhaps the best argument for visiting Munich right now is the Bavarian State Opera, which has emerged as one of the most exciting opera houses in Europe. The reason? In the words of a New York Times classical music critic, “the miracle of Kirill Petrenko”. Petrenko has just two more years remaining on his contract as music director at the opera. This summer, he will conduct a new production of Richard Strauss’s Salome, with the opening night performance on 27 June. Stuart EmmrichBeneath the prismatic waters of this Red Sea resort on Israel’s southern tip lies a coral reef with hundreds of varieties of neon fish, sharks and stingrays. To get there, visitors used to have to catch a charter flight from Tel Aviv or brave the dusty drive through the Negev desert. But with the opening early this year of Ramon Airport, set in the Timna Valley and capable of handling 4 million international transit passengers a year, the world will finally get a direct route –  with nonstops from Munich and Frankfurt on Lufthansa, and budget carriers flying in from Prague, London and across Europe. New hotels, including the luxurious Six Senses Shaharut, opening just in time for Israel’s turn at hosting the Eurovision Song Contest 2018, are ready for the crowds. Debra Kamin752 Setouchi, Japan: Art and nature harmonise in Japan’s inland seaThe Setouchi region will host the Setouchi Triennale 2019, a major art fair held in three seasonal instalments. One hour south via ferry or the Shinkansen bullet train, the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum reopens this spring after an eight-year refurbishment. New trails and a dedicated Shimanami bike ferry that opened in October connect Japan’s main island of Honshu to the region’s lesser-visited island of Shikoku. For those seeking more sybaritic forms of transport, the Guntu –  more a minimalist floating ryokan than a cruise ship –  with 19 walnut-clad rooms and open-air cypress soaking baths. In 2019, Setouchi Sea Planes will expand its scenic flights to several smaller islands and towns via Kodiak 100s. And a Japanese startup, Ale, launched the Shooting Star Challenge, a microsatellite that will create the world’s first artificial meteor shower, aiming to fill Setouchi’s skies in spring 2020, a taste of the high-tech one-upmanship to come in Tokyo’s 2020 Olympics. Adam H Graham852 Aalborg, Denmark: Architecture revitalises the waterfrontViking long ships once glided through Aalborg’s mighty Limfjord. Today, the city is turning its most famous natural asset into an artistic one. Wildly innovative buildings have sprouted on its shores, including the Utzon Centre, designed by Jorn Utzon, the architect of the Sydney Opera House – its new exhibition series on inspiring Nordic architects, runs through May. The curvilinear concert hall Musikkens Hus was recently followed by the vibrant Aalborg Street Food market the pedestrian and cycling Culture Bridge and the undulating Vestre Fjordpark, with an open-air swimming pool that meets the sea. Nordkraft, a power plant that was converted into a cultural hub, is celebrating its 10th anniversary with events in September. The Aalborg Akvavit distillery is being transformed into a new creative district over the next two years, presided over by a soaring glass polygonal sculpture by artist Tomás Saraceno, Harbour Gate from architect Bjarke Ingels, a hotel and more. Annelisa Sorensen952 The Azores, Portugal: The Caribbean comes to the middle of the AtlanticIn the nippy Atlantic Ocean a four-hour flight from the US, the subtropical volcanic islands of the Azores, complete with Unesco world heritage sites and biospheres, await discovery. Mystical green lushness, oversize volcanic craters now turned into lakes, steaming natural hot springs that puff out from the earth, blue hydrangeas by the thousands and the only coffee growers in Europe distinguish the island chain. New restaurants in Ponta Delgada include the locavore Casa do Abel, the Japanese-influenced Otaka, and Tasquinha Vieira, which specialises in local, organic cuisine, while new hotels include the Lava Homes on Pico Island, and the Grand Hotel Açores Atlântico, opening in July. Daniel Scheffler1052 Ontario Ice Caves, Canada: See them now, as climate change may pose a threatThe ice caves that emerge from the winds and waves that pound the north shore of Lake Superior have always been somewhat ephemeral. But climate change has brought an element of doubt into their future. For now, the caves are a regularly occurring feature, notably along the shoreline near Sault Ste Marie, Ontario. Made from snow and ice, the caves vary in size, shape and colour. Large waves before they freeze up are the essential ingredient for large caverns. The wind, shifts in the ice and the effects of the sun constantly remake the formations. February is the most reliable month for a visit. Getting to the caves involves driving one of the more scenic sections of the Trans-Canada Highway. Alona Bay and Coppermine Point are two of the more popular destinations. The staff members at Stokely Creek Lodge, a cross-country skiing and snowshoeing resort just outside of the Sault, keep track of where the most dramatic, but accessible, caves have formed each winter. Ian Austen1152 Zadar, Croatia: Incomparable sunsets, a ‘sea organ’ and untrammelled islandsAfter the Croatian football team captured the world’s attention in the World Cup –  its captain Luka Modric’s was particularly notable –  fans revved up their search engines and learned that he hails from Zadar, a pretty, compact town on the Dalmatian Coast. Ryanair have added regular flights from Prague, Hamburg, Cologne and Nuremberg, starting this spring. Beyond Zadar’s medieval core, the city’s seaside promenade and music-making “sea organ”, created by architect Nikola Basic, is a must-see (or hear). The magical sunsets alone were enough to wow Alfred Hitchcock, who visited the city in 1964. The town is also a gateway to untrammelled islands, like Dugi Otok an hour-and-20-minute ferry ride takes visitors to the sparsely populated island with uncrowded beaches and taverns. Seeking ultraclean waters? Then head to the island of Pasman, where the currents often change, making the surrounding waters some of the cleanest in the Adriatic. David Farley1252 Williamsburg, Virginia: The cradle of American democracy reflects on its pastIn 1619, the area that includes the Jamestown Settlement, Williamsburg and Yorktown was home to some of the most significant events in American history: the official arrival of the first African slaves to North America, the convening of the first representative assembly in America and the first recorded proclamation of Thanksgiving in the New World. The area will observe the 400th anniversary of these events all year, highlighted by the Tenacity exhibition at the Jamestown Settlement, which recognises the contributions of women during the Colonial era, along with an archaeology-focused exhibit. Colonial Williamsburg, the expansive living-history museum, will give visitors a taste of life in the 18th century, along with the reimagined American Revolution Museum at Yorktown. For thrill seekers, Busch Gardens Williamsburg, the European-theme amusement park, will unveil a new pendulum swing ride, while Water Country USA will unveil the state’s first hybrid water coaster. John L Dorman1352 Las Vegas: Sin City bets big on cultureSure, there are still slot machines, strip clubs and steaks aplenty, but other options for culture in America’s playground abound. The new Park MGM hosts residencies from two music legends through 2019: Lady Gaga, doing one show of her pop hits and another riffing on American classics, and starting in April, Aerosmith. Also a rollicking iteration of the Italian emporium Eataly and Best Friend, a Korean restaurant by Roy Choi, the LA food truck pioneer, that becomes a hip-hop club afterwards. The Wynn recently added live, Dixieland-style jazz to its lakeside brunch it also offers masterclasses on subjects like dumpling-making. Nearby, the Venetian debuted three craft cocktail bars, the Dorsey, Rosina and Electra, where guests can actually sit down and hear one another talk. Downtown, the Life Is Beautiful festival, which corrals an array of musicians and artists each fall, enters its seventh year 2018 stars included the Weeknd and Florence and the Machine. Sheila MarikarAfter completing a five-year historical preservation initiative to save its Unesco designation, Salvador, with its sherbet-coloured colonial facades, cobblestone streets and beaches, is gleaming. Rising along the coast of northeastern Bahia, the city’s downtown historic district thrums with vibrant Afro-Brazilian culture, ranging from free weekly performances by samba and drum corps to classical music and capoeira. Visitors can also find Salvador’s history exhibited in the new House of Carnival and, opening in 2020, the Museum of Music or catch a live concert at the Convention Centre, opening this year. The Fera Palace Hotel, a refurbished art deco gem, and the freshly minted Fasano Salvador, housed in a former 1930s newspaper building, both overlook All Saints Bay, which in November will host the finish of the International Regatta Transat Jacques Vabre, a 4,350-mile race along the historic coffee trading route between France and Brazil. Nora Walsh1552 Danang, Vietnam: A spot for foodies and beachgoersVietnam’s third largest city, is known for being a gateway to the nearby Unesco Heritage town of Hoi An. But it’s begun to develop a reputation as the Miami of Vietnam, with a strong foodie scene and new hotels and resorts popping up on a five-mile beach strip. A typical day might start with a morning swim on the crescent-shape Non Nuoc Beach and perhaps a quick stop at the Han Market. Then, an afternoon visit to the Marble Mountains, where travellers can explore the temples and pagodas that look out over My Khe Beach and, later, dinner back in the city, perhaps at Nén, a new restaurant from much-followed food blogger Summer Le. Perhaps finish the day with a visit to Cau Rong Dragon Bridge in the hills above the city. Don’t leave without sampling a bowl of mi quang, the justifiably famous local noodle soup made with a turmeric-infused broth, chicken, pork, local seafood and shredded cabbage, and available for about $1 (78p) at any number of street food stalls. Stuart Emmrich1652 Costalegre, Mexico: A beach vacation, without the crowdsCostalegre is a stretch of 43 largely unpopulated beaches, capes and bays along Mexico’s gorgeous Pacific coast, about halfway between the better known destinations of Puerto Vallarta and Manzanillo, and one that has so far escaped the attention of vacationers flocking to its popular neighbours to the north, Punta Mita and the surfer’s haven of Sayulita. One factor keeping away the crowds: lack of easy access. Up until now, the nearest airport has been more than a two-hour drive away, in Puerto Vallarta. But that will change with the planned opening of the Chalacatepec Airport in the second half of this year, which will cut travel time by more than half. And a clutch of luxury hotels will soon follow. For now, the best luxury option is Las Alamandas Resort, set on a 1,500-acre nature reserve, with just 16 suites in seven brightly painted casitas, as well as two restaurants, a spa and a large pool. Smaller hotels and even bungalows near the beaches can also be rented. Stuart Emmrich1752 Paparoa Track, New Zealand: A new wilderness trail explores a remote national parkOutdoor enthusiasts can head to New Zealand starting in October to trek the country’s first Great Walk trail to open in more than 25 years. Tracing the Pororari river along the west coast of the South Island, the Paparoa Track winds through Paparoa National Park, a reserve largely inaccessible until now. Built by the Department of Conservation for hikers and mountain bikers, the 34-mile trail (hiked in three days biked in two) departs from a historic mining town and traverses epic limestone gorges, beech forests and sandstone bluffs before culminating at the Punakaiki Blowholes. For a small fee, travellers can stay overnight in two new 20-bunk huts overlooking the southern Alps and Tasman Sea. The Pike29 Memorial Track, which honours victims of the 2010 Pike River Mine tragedy, intersects the route. Reservations can be made on the Department of Conservation’s website both tracks are free and no permit is required. Nora Walsh1852 Puglia, Italy: Baroque architecture and Adriatic beaches in Italy’s heelThe ancient fortified farmhouses called masserie, found only in the region of Puglia, are increasingly being turned into boutique hotels, most notably Rocco Forte’s Masseria Torre Maizza, and the 17th century Castello di Ugento, where guests can take cooking classes at the Puglia Culinary Centre. And the region’s 1,000-year-old wine culture, which began when the Greeks planted vines from their land across the Adriatic, is attracting more oenophiles to the area, including the owners of the London restaurant Bocca di Lupo, who recently bought a 600-acre estate in Salento called Tormaresca, where tastings are offered to visitors (you can also dine in their new restaurant in the town of Lecce). Puglia is also home to Europe’s Virgin Galactic spaceport, which is scheduled to open in 2019, with the promise of eventually sending passengers into space. No wonder Abercrombie and Kent’s new Italian cruise includes Puglia and Gargano National Park. Daniel Scheffler1952 Tatra Mountains, Slovakia: Off-the-grid skiing, rock climbing and moreWhile most visitors focus on Slovakia’s capital, Bratislava, the soaring Tatra Mountains have emerged as an under-the-radar destination for skiing and outdoor activities, with new gondolas at the Bachledka and Jasna ski areas slopes planned at Mlynicka Dolina and new chair lifts at Oravska Lesna in the nearby Fatra range to the northwest. And it’s not just about winter sports: there is excellent hiking, rock climbing, mountain biking and fly-fishing, while beyond the Tatras, Kosice, a regional capital, offers colourful street art and plenty of cafes and restaurants, thanks to its three universities and associated night life. Plan on posting plenty of photos: you’ll find untouched folk architecture throughout the region, as well as perfectly preserved gothic and baroque buildings awaiting your lens. Evan Rail2052 Calgary, Alberta: A spectacular library adds to a once-neglected neighbourhoodCalgary’s new Central Library, from the architectural firm Snohetta, creates not just a design destination, with daily tours, but also a gateway in the form of an arched cedar-clad passageway linking downtown to the city’s evolving East Village, a booming neighbourhood where the Bow and Elbow rivers meet. Calgary was founded in the East Village area in 1875, with a fort built to curb the growing whiskey trade, but the area suffered roughly 70 years of neglect before the Calgary Municipal Land Corp, formed in 2007, began transforming the area, adding parks, attractions and high-rises. The 240,000-square-foot library, with a performance hall, cafe, children’s play area and outdoor electromagnetic sculptures by Christian Moeller, is next to Studio Bell, home to the National Music Centre museum and performance space, and near the just opened Alt Hotel. Later this year, the multiuse building M2 promises more shops and restaurants beside the Bow river. Elaine Glusac2152 Olkhon Island, Lake Baikal, Russia: A natural wonder resisting the threats of developmentLake Baikal in Siberia is the world’s deepest lake, plunging 1 mile into the Earth’s crust. It contains nearly 20 per cent of the world’s unfrozen fresh water and is so abundant in wildlife –  bears, foxes, sables, rare and endangered freshwater seals –  that Unesco calls it “the Galapagos of Russia”. The wildlife, like the lake itself, has been under threat for years, from indifferent Soviet industrial policy, from climate change and from today’s rising tourism, especially from China. Even so, it remains largely unspoiled, and activists are working hard to keep it that way. Olkhon Island, Baikal’s largest, and a place that Buddhists consider one of the holiest in Asia, is a popular base for excursions year round, even from December to April or May, when the surface freezes into turquoise sheets of ice that Siberian winds churn into natural sculptures. The Baikal Ice Marathon, a charity devoted to the lake’s conservation, will be held 2 March. Steven Lee Myers2252 Huntsville, Alabama: Time to party like it’s 1969The 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing will draw crowds to Huntsville –  aka Rocket City –  home of the Marshall Space Flight Centre, where the spacecraft that launched astronauts to the moon were developed. Throughout the year, there will be daily reenactments of the moon landing at the US Space and Rocket Centre, but the biggest thrills are planned for the anniversary week of the Apollo 11 lunar landing mission in July. Beginning on launch day, 16 July, the centre will attempt to break a Guinness World Record by launching 5,000 model rockets at 8.32 am, the precise time that rocket engines ignited in 1969. Festivities will continue with a classic car show, concerts, a homecoming parade and a street party in downtown Huntsville –  the same location where Apollo workers celebrated after the successful mission. If that’s not fun enough, 2019 also marks the state’s bicentennial, giving Alabamians yet another excuse to party. Ingrid K Williams2352 Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas): Five kinds of penguins, easier to reachThe Falkland Islands, far off the coast of Argentina, offer an astonishing variety of wildlife that includes five kinds of penguins, hundreds of bird species, seals, sea lions and whales, as well as remote natural beauty that travellers often have to themselves. Two new local touring companies are increasing accessibility to the riches of the islands. Falklands Outdoors opened in November 2018 and offers mountain climbing, foraging, hiking and sea kayaking expeditions to beaches and penguin colonies that can’t be reached by road in January, Falklands Helicopter Services will start scenic flights to Volunteer Point (home to an enormous king penguin colony), and other isolated spots. While there’s a single weekly commercial flight in and out of the Falklands, the first new route to the islands from South America in more than 20 years is being planned: LATAM is expected to begin weekly flights to the islands from Brazil by late this year. Nell McShane Wulfhart2452 Aberdeen, Scotland: The granite city via brand new old-fashioned trainsJust as many famous European overnight train routes have been retired, the Caledonian Sleeper, the train that travels through the night from London to the north of Scotland, is rolling out new carriages for summer. The new cars preserve the romance of overnight trains, in contemporary comfort, with a choice of hotel-style suites, classic bunk beds or seats. The Highlander route to Aberdeen leaves Euston station in the evening and hits the Scottish coast by 5 am, so travellers who take an early breakfast in the dining car can enjoy coastal views as the sun rises (get off at Leuchars for medieval St Andrews). Off the train, Aberdeen and its surroundings offer historic castles set in fields of purple heather, in pine woods and along the dramatic coastline. Hiking trails abound on and around the queen’s estate at Balmoral, and rail buffs can visit the former royal train station in Ballater, closed since 1966, and ride on the Royal Deeside Railway a short drive from there. Palko Karasz2552 Golfo Paradiso, Italy: A rare unspoiled gem on the Italian RivieraThe well-known pearls of the Ligurian Riviera –  Portofino, Cinque Terre, Portovenere –  are overwhelmed with tourists, a problem so acute that in some areas authorities have debated measures to stem the flow of daytrippers. But just a few miles away, between Portofino and Genoa, remains a peaceful sliver of coastline rarely explored by travellers to the region. Known as the Golfo Paradiso, this small gulf is home to five often-overlooked villages, including Camogli, a colourful fishing hamlet as charming as any of the Cinque Terre. Italians will boast about the renowned local cuisine: fresh-caught anchovies, hand-rolled trofie pasta and cheese-filled focaccia from the town of Recco, a speciality that recently earned IGP status, a prestigious Italian designation for quality food products. Between meals, explore blooming gardens in Pieve Ligure, beaches in Sori and the romanesque abbey of San Fruttuoso, which is accessible only by boat or a long, sweaty hike. 2652 Dessau, Germany: A big birthday for BauhausThis year marks the 100th anniversary of the publication of German architect Walter Gropius’ “Proclamation of the Bauhaus”, a radical reimagining of art, architecture and design. To celebrate the Bauhaus centennial, cities around Germany will hold events, from the opening festival in Berlin –  several days of art, dance, concerts, theatre, lectures and more this month –  to the debut of the Bauhaus Museum in Weimar, where the movement was born. But the most compelling destination might be Dessau. Home of the Bauhaus school during the 1920s and 1930s, the northeastern German city still contains the school’s pioneering (and Unesco-listed) Bauhaus Building, the Gropius-designed Masters Houses, and the Prellerhaus studio building (a warren of former Bauhaus ateliers that now contains a hotel). And in September, Dessau opens its long-awaited Bauhaus Museum, a glassy, minimalist rectangle that will showcase typefaces, textiles, artwork, furniture and more from the movement. Seth Sherwood2752 Tunis, Tunisia: The spark for the Arab Spring, still litFreedom is what makes Tunis unique. Eight years after it kicked off the Arab Spring, it remains the only Arab capital with real freedom of expression, not to mention the peaceful rotation of power. But the city holds many other charms. Among them are the ruins of the ancient city of Carthage, from which Hannibal’s elephants once threatened Rome. The carefully preserved old medina dates from the 12th to the 16th century, when Tunis was a major centre of the Islamic world. The tree-lined Avenue Habib Bourguiba downtown bears the influence of decades of French rule. And the cafes, art galleries and blue-and-white hues of the neighbourhood of Sidi Bou Said, overlooking the Mediterranean, have long lured European painters, writers and thinkers. A short taxi ride away are the beaches and nightclubs of La Marsa. The French-influenced north African food is delicious. The local red wines are not bad. And, in another regional rarity, Tunis in 2018 elected a woman its mayor. David D Kirkpatrick2852 Gambia: Hippos and chimpanzees –  and a renewed sense of hopeGambia’s tourism industry was hit hard in 2017, when its long-time authoritarian ruler Yahya Jammeh refused to cede leadership after an election loss, forcing a political standoff that brought foreign troops in. But with its new president, Adama Barrow, now safely in place, there’s a renewed sense of hope across continental Africa’s smallest country –  now more accessible than ever. In January, a new bridge over the Gambia river, three decades in the making, will be inaugurated with a nearly 200-mile relay run to Dakar, Senegal. Peregrine Adventures launches its first cruise up the 700-mile river, with a stop at Baboon Island, home to hippos, crocodiles and chimpanzees, part of Africa’s longest-running centre for rehabilitating chimpanzees into the wild. New and coming hotels, including the African Princess Beach Hotel, and two properties by Thomas Cook, will serve as stylish bases. And new direct flights from Europe make getting to this west African country easier than ever. Ratha TepThe coastline just below the New South Wales-Queensland border is known as the Northern Rivers thanks to the tidal system snaking through it. Anchored by Byron Bay, the area has become a beacon for those seeking a breezy boho way of life. In recent years a more moneyed, stylish vibe has settled in and seeped from Byron into neighbouring small towns. Mullumbimby hosts one of the country’s most vibrant weekly farmers’ markets. Brunswick Heads, is home to a huge historic pub with a sprawling patio, and offers great shopping and Fleet, a restaurant that serves some of Australia’s most delightful cooking. Up and down the coast, the restaurant scene is thriving: Paper Daisy in Cabarita Beach sits in the ground floor of an old surf motel turned boutique hotel in Lennox Heads, Shelter’s dining room is open to the ocean breeze. For a taste of the old-school hippie wonderland from which all of this sprang, check out the Crystal Castle, a “crystal experience” in a hilltop garden. Besha Rodell3052 Frisian Islands and Wadden Sea: Oysters, seals, birds and dark skies on Europe’s wild left coastEurope’s windswept Frisian Islands are shared by Denmark, Germany and the Netherlands and linked by the Wadden Sea. Holland’s Lauwersmeer National Park offers dark-sky safaris and will open a seal rescue centre in 2019 that lets visitors rehabilitate and release two native seal species. Dutch campground resorts like Beleef Lauwersoog offer excursions to nearby Schiermonnikoog island and have expanded lodging options with new barrel-shaped sleeping pods and refurbished overwater bunkers, once used by duck hunters, on remote swaths of the North Sea. Denmark’s Fanoe island started offering DIY oyster foraging safaris, where visitors can rent boots and shucking tools to gather invasive, but delicious, Pacific oysters, thus helping preserve Denmark’s native Limfjorden oyster habitat. The Fanoe Oyster Festival, next in October 2019, has lured chefs across Denmark with an annual oyster cooking competition. Adam H Graham3152 New York City: New cultural monuments, and remembrances of the pastredefine the city’s physical and cultural infrastructure. At Hudson Yards, the largest single development since Rockefeller Centre took shape in the Depression, a cultural arts centre called the Shed will go into gear. Its largest theatre is a retractable structure on wheels that creeps back and forth like a giant steel caterpillar, turning the outdoor space of a plaza into indoor space for performances. Not far away will be what the developers are calling New York’s Staircase, an eight-storey structure with 154 flights of stairs and 2,000 steps. The wraps are to come off the Museum of Modern Art’s $400m expansion, increasing its space by almost a third. The TWA Hotel at Kennedy International Airport is a flight centre relic from 1962, with 512 hotel rooms in two new buildings. In June, the city will host World Pride – first time in the US – for the 50th anniversary. James BarronThe leadup to the next Winter Games is well underway in and around Beijing, and the spectacle is breathtaking. The most stunning transformations are happening a four-hour drive north in Chongli, once one of the country’s poorest areas and now home to several multibillion-dollar ski resorts, towering condominiums and flashy hotels. It has transformed into a glistening winter sports hub filled with restaurants, inns and watering holes. At least five ski resorts now surround the city, including places like Genting Secret Gardens, Fulong and Thaiwoo, which has an on-property brewery, a mid-mountain chalet that serves Swiss and Austrian fare, and brand new gondolas. A high-speed train from Beijing to Chongli should open in 2019. The skiing isn’t world-class. Nearly all of the snow comes from a cannon, and runs average about 1,300 vertical feet. But go now to see firsthand how the world’s most populous country is working overtime to become a competitive winter sports nation. Tim NevilleThe horseshoe-shaped Orcas, one of the largest islands that make up the San Juan archipelago, has gained fame in recent years for its impressive tide-to-table culinary scene and experimental wines, attracting, among others, Oprah Winfrey (in 2018, Winfrey bought a 43-acre estate on the island for a reported $8.275m). A new wine enterprise, Doe Bay Wine Co, is presenting its Orcas Project in 2019 –  a collaboration between acclaimed winemakers and vineyards in the Pacific northwest. Ventures from James Beard-nominated chef Jay Blackinton, who owns Hogstone, a former pizzeria now featuring ambitious nose-to-tail fare, and its more upscale counterpart Aelder, are also on the horizon. Another addition to the island are the luxury suites at Outlook Inn, in the town of Eastsound, overlooking Fishing Bay. If you want to hike, or ride a horse, the island’s Moran State Park will be adding trails to its 38-mile network this year. 3452 Uzbekistan: Visa-free travel and reopened borders along the Silk RoadIf you have ever wanted to travel the Silk Road, now may be the time to go. After more than 25 years since the fall of the Soviet Union, the former member country of Uzbekistan is going through its own perestroika. Among the modernising reforms are better official exchange rates and the ability to book flights and apply for visas online. Ground and air travel have also improved regionally, in part because of China’s $800bn One Belt, One Road initiative (which links countries stretching between east Asia and Europe), as well as reopened borders with neighbouring countries, reestablished flight routes between central Asian capitals, like Tashkent and Dushanbe, and increased flight service between New York and Tashkent. In addition to the relatively new Hyatt Regency in Tashkent, other international hotels are expected to open in the coming years. Erin Levi3552 Vestlandet, Norway: A bucolic paradise for mountain-climbing beer lovers Rural Vestlandet, in western Norway, home to some of Scandinavia’s most beautiful landscapes, is piquing the interest of outdoorsy types, especially those who take Rural Vestlandet is home to some of Scandinavia’s most beautiful landscapes and is piquing the interest of outdoorsy types. The Loen Skylift ferries travel more than 3,280 feet to the top of Mount Hoven in just a few minutes, while fearless climbers can put on a harness, hire a guide and make roughly the same journey in six hours, following a path that features one of the longest suspension bridges in Europe. After sightseeing, relax over an ale made with kveik, a local yeast that has enthralled brewers and scientists around the world in recent years for its fruity aromas and higher-than-normal fermentation temperatures. You can find it at bars like Tre Bror, in Voss, the Smalahovetunet restaurant and brewery nearby. Beer lovers who want to learn (and taste) more can time their visit to coincide with the October Norsk Kornolfestival, which features close to 100 beers made with kveik, often including juniper and other traditional regional ingredients. Evan Rail3652 Lyon, France: Soccer, sausage and fresh airFootball fans should set their sights on France this summer, especially Lyon, where we could see the US women will clinch their fourth World Cup title in the final match 7 July. Even if you can’t get tickets –  or détestez le football –  the city of half a million people and 4,000 restaurants is worth a visit. This year, Lyon plays host to an International City of Gastronomy project. The indoor, one-acre exhibition will include interactive workshops and conferences designed to showcase France’s cuisine and its contributions to health and pleasure. Held at the Grand Hôtel Dieu, a sprawling complex first founded in the 1300s that reopens after four years of renovations with shops, restaurants, public spaces. When it comes time to work off all those plates of pork sausage, hike in nearby Écrins National Park, where traditional working dogs protect herds of sheep. Book a stay at the Temple-Écrins hut, where workers recently wrapped up three years of renovations. Tim Neville3752 Doha, Qatar: Avant-garde architecture blooms in the desertAs the next men’s soccer World Cup approaches in 2022, the host nation, Qatar, is loading its capital with structures from the biggest names in international architecture. The sharp-angled, futuristic Qatar National Library, designed by Rem Koolhaas and his OMA firm, opened in 2018 2019 will welcome the National Museum of Qatar, a sprawling expanse of interlocking tilted circular discs by Jean Nouvel. A contribution from a third Pritzker prize-winner, Zaha Hadid, is slated to materialise in the form of a swooping, curvaceous stadium another stadium, from Pritzker-winner Norman Foster, is also under construction. The new structures add further dazzle to the Doha skyline, which already includes Nouvel’s syringe-like Doha Tower and the blocky white jumble of the Museum of Islamic Art, by IM Pei. Seth SherwoodTbilisi, Georgia’s charming capital, has been flooded with tourists over the past decade. But Batumi, a hushed seaside city where verdant mountains slope down to the Black Sea’s smooth stone beaches, offers a different experience. Already a popular escape for Russians, Iranians, Turks and Israelis, the city is preparing itself for its inevitable discovery by the rest of the world: new hotels –  including Le Meridien Batumi and a Batumi instalment of the design-centric boutique Rooms Hotel line –  are rising, and a cable car will swing straight to the coast from the hilltop Batumi Botanical Garden. Winemaking is another draw –  at the family-run BQ Wine Bar and the underground Karalashvili’s Wine Cellar, which pours the same rosé and amber-hued chkaveri varietals that Josef Stalin adored. Debra Kamin3952 Marseille, France: An influx of young creatives gives the city a new edgeSix years after Marseille was named European Capital of Culture in 2013, the city’s renewal is still galloping along. Jean Nouvel has just finished his striking new red, white and blue skyscraper La Marseillaise. The real proof of the city’s metamorphosis, however, is that it is attracting young creative types from all over France and beyond. Laura Vidal, a sommelier from Quebec, and British chef Harry Cummins opened La Mercerie, a market-driven bistro in an old notions shop in the city’s Noailles district last spring. Noailles is brimming with shops (don’t miss Épicerie I’ldeal, the best new food store), cafes and restaurants. Other districts in the heart of Marseille are being transformed as well. Near the opera, Tony Collins recently opened Deep, a coffee shop that roasts its own beans and also sells vinyl records and the mixologists at the Copper Bay bar shake it up for locals and guests from the nearby Les Bords de Mer, the city’s best new boutique hotel. Alexander Lobrano4052 Wyoming: A sesquicentennial celebration of women’s suffrage in the Equality StateIn 1869, the Territory of Wyoming passed the first law in US history granting women the right to vote –  nearly 51 years before the 19th amendment guaranteed the same entitlement to all women. This year, visitors can celebrate the 150th anniversary of Wyoming women’s suffrage at the Wyoming House for Historic Women, which honours the first woman to officially cast a ballot in a general election, and 13 other trailblazing women in the state’s political history. The restored Capitol building (reopening midyear), Wyoming State Museum and Cowgirls of the West museum also feature exhibits and artefacts celebrating women’s history. In addition, a variety of all-female trips are on offer throughout the year including Women’s Wellness Pack Trips on horseback from Allen’s Diamond 4 Ranch, cattle herding and archery at the WYLD West Women retreat, Hike Like a Woman nature adventures and fly-fishing clinics at the Proud Wyoming Woman Retreat. Nora Walsh4152 Los Angeles: Finally, more than Grauman’s (groan)Los Angeles too often gets boiled down to its least interesting element: Hollywood. It’s an insult to a region with a vibrant Koreatown (sit in the hot salt at Wi Spa and then feast on roast gui at Dong Il Jang) two nationally recognised high school show choirs (John Burroughs and Burbank) art galleries like the quirky Parker, in a Los Feliz mansion and several big-league sports teams, two of them soon moving to a new $2.6bn stadium. But in summer 2019 there will be an honest-to-goodness Hollywood reason to visit the area. After delays, the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures is scheduled to open in a Renzo Piano-designed complex on Wilshire Boulevard. Promised are interactive exhibits about the art and science of filmmaking, starry screenings in two theatres and to-die-for memorabilia –  the collection includes a pair of ruby slippers, 12 million photographs, 61,000 posters and 190,000 video assets. Brooks Barnes4252 Dakar, Senegal: An oasis of freedom in a region of unrestNgor or rent a board for a few hours to surf the more than a half dozen beaches that offer a terrific year-round break. Or just sit back and watch the surfers while eating grilled fish at a long strip of beach restaurants. A Museum of Black Civilisations will be opening early this year and will showcase artefacts as well as contemporary art from Africa and the diaspora. The city’s design and fashion creations would fit right in at New York showrooms. Take in a late-night concert with legends like Cheikh Lo and Youssou N’Dor crooning into the wee hours and a lively bar scene that offers all-hours entertainment. Day trips let you sleep in a baobab tree, zip line through a baobab forest or swim in a pink lake. But climate change, overfishing and a booming population may eventually take their toll. Dionne Searcey4352 Perth, Australia: A city transformed and enlivenedA decade-long development boom has supercharged Perth. Among the new attractions: Yagan Square, with its distinctive market hall, art park and 147-foot digital tower showcases work by local artists and livestreams events Optus Stadium, a 60,000-seat venue for concerts and sporting events and Raine Square, a $200m redevelopment that includes a movie theatre, shopping and restaurants including dim sum chain Tim Ho Wan, considered the world’s most affordable Michelin-starred restaurant. To accommodate the expected growth in tourism, 31 new or redeveloped hotels have opened in the past five years, including the luxury COMO, the hip QT and a Westin. Since 2007, liquor law reforms, including a 2018 change that let restaurants serve drinks without a meal, have changed the drinking and dining scene with more than 100 small bars opening in the central business district alone. And Qantas started a nonstop flight from London to Perth this year, the first from Europe. Kelly DiNardo4452 Hong Kong: Dazzling infrastructure eases travel but could threaten independenceAfter Britain returned its former colony to China in 1997, Hong Kong prided itself on resisting mainland interference. Last year saw the opening of a high-speed train that takes passengers all the way to Beijing, and a 34-mile sea bridge linking Hong Kong to the mainland for the first time, opening the question of whether that independent streak can survive. For travellers, though, boarding a train at the new West Kowloon station bound for Beijing –  and more than 30 other destinations in China –  is a game changer. The 1,200-mile trip to Beijing is just nine hours, and the business-class seats are roomy. Whether they are headed to China or not, travellers can indulge in British nostalgia at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel. The 25th-floor M bar offers fabulous views of the harbour, exotic cocktails like Sarawak Tea Punch and memories of the 1960s when the hotel opened as a symbol of luxury and style in this ever-glamorous city. Jane Perlez4552 Iran: Tourism cautiously returns to this Middle East jewelThe appeal of Iran for adventurous travellers is obvious: the monumental ruins of ancient Persia the spectacular, centuries-old mosques of Shiraz and Isfahan the Grand Bazaar and Golestan Palace in bustling Tehran. One additional reason to visit in 2019 is a major exhibition scheduled to open at the Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art. “Portrait, Still-life, Landscape” (21 February to 20 April) will take over the entire museum, with a selection of about 500 works, including pieces by Andy Warhol, Mark Rothko and Marcel Duchamp, as well as about 40 Picassos recently discovered in the museum’s storage facilities (much of the collection has been kept under wraps since the 1979 revolution). The US State Department discourages, but does not prohibit, travel to Iran by American citizens, and Americans can travel to Iran only as part of an organised tour. Options for 2019 include three expeditions from Intrepid Travel, including the company’s first-ever all-female tour. Stuart Emmrich4652 Houston: Rebounding bigger and better after a hurricaneAfter Hurricane Harvey, the city is back on its feet and showing off the everything-is-bigger-in-Texas attitude. Four food halls opened in 2018, including Finn Hall, which features up-and-coming chefs like James Beard-nominated Jianyun Ye and a downtown outpost of his Chinese hotspot Mala Sichuan and a taqueria from local favourite Goode Co. The five-diamond Post Oak Hotel has a two-storey Rolls-Royce showroom, art by Frank Stella and a 30,000-bottle wine cellar. The Menil Collection, known for its eclectic art ranging from Byzantine antiques to 20th century pop art, underwent a renovation and opened the 30,000-square-foot Menil Drawing Institute. The city’s museum boom continues with an expansion of the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, to be completed in 2020, a newly built location for the Holocaust Museum, which will move in this spring, and a restoration of the Apollo Mission Centre that will open in time for the 50th anniversary of the moon landing in July. Kelly DiNardo4752 Columbus, Ohio: Is this the American city of the future?With a revitalised riverfront and booming downtown, Columbus is already one of the nation’s fastest-growing cities. Now, it’s poised to become the model for the future of innovative urban transportation, with self-driving shuttles carrying travellers along the Scioto Mile, recently revitalised, adding 33 acres of riverfront green space for festivals, water sports and outdoor art. Among the newest dining options are Veritas, which specializes in small-plate offerings Service Bar, run by young chef Avishar Barua, a veteran of New York’s Mission Chinese and WD-50 and, in the North Market neighborhood, veggie-forward Little Eater. The Short North Arts District offers access to the city’s local businesses like the new fashion store Thread and the original Jeni’s ice cream store. But don’t skip Italian Village and German Village neighborhoods, where innovators and dreamers have opened destination shops like Stump Plants and Vernacular and bars like Cosecha. Daniel Scheffler4852 Plov, Bulgaria: A city ready for the spotlightWith its colourful, cobblestoned historic centre, well-preserved Roman ruins and lively art scene, Bulgaria’s second-largest city is surprisingly overlooked by tourists who favour the quirky, post-Soviet charm of the country’s capital, Sofia. But as a European cultural capital of 2019, this gem is ready to shine. Organisers have planned more than 500 events throughout the city and its region, including concerts, open-air theatre performances and street-food fairs. Tucked into the heart of central Bulgaria and built on seven hills, Plov features an artistic quarter called Kapana, whose winding streets are lined with galleries and stylish cafes, as well as a beautifully restored Roman amphitheatre that hosts summer opera performances under the stars. The city’s location at the foot of the Rhodope Mountains –  with their stunning views of peaks and deep gorges — makes it an excellent launch point for hiking day trips. Ann Mah4952 Vevey, Switzerland: A once-in-a-generation winegrowers’ festival on the Swiss RivieraEverything runs like clockwork in Switzerland, including the Fête des Vignerons, although its timetable is considerably extended. This Unesco-recognised wine festival, which celebrates the viticultural traditions of the Lavaux and Chablais regions near Lake Geneva, takes place every 20 to 25 years in the heart of Vevey, a breathtaking lakeside town beneath sloping vineyards in the canton of Vaud. Since 1797, the date has been decided by the Confrérie des Vignerons, which has spent the past several years (and a reported 99 million Swiss francs, or roughly $98m) planning for the 12th edition, which will run from 18 July to 11 August. For the first time, tickets for the two-hour show can be purchased online. Oenophiles seeking a “full-bodied” experience of Helvetian wines, which are rarely exported, can also download the new app from the Canton of Vaud featuring eight wine-centric hiking routes, including one above Vevey. Erin Levi5052 Cádiz province, Spain: Sparkling cities and towns in southwest AndalusiaAt the tip of a peninsula thrust into the Atlantic, the city of Cádiz, a trading hub since 1100, has a vibe that’s more Havana than Madrid. A culinary renaissance is underway, with newcomers like Saja River and Codigo de Barra joining classics like El Faro. But the biggest gastronomic news lies across the bay in Puerto de Santa Maria, where Angel León’s Aponiente, which has three Michelin stars, offers a lyric poem to seafood (plankton risotto). A second León restaurant, Alevante, in nearby Sancti Petri just received its first star. Twenty minutes inland, Jerez de la Frontera is a cradle of the fortified wines known as sherry, which are now on the hot list of sommeliers and the craft-cocktail crowd. Beyond the cities, hilltop villages like Vejer de la Frontera lure expatriates with a blend of hip luxury hotels and art by the likes of Olafur Eliasson at NMAC sculpture garden. Add a stretch of Atlantic shore, and the province of Cádiz ticks all the boxes. Andrew Ferren5152 Elqui Valley, Chile: Eclipse mania, and nights of dark skiesThe Elqui Valley in Chile attracts a erse group of wine and pisco aficionados, stargazers and nature lovers. In 2019, this tranquil agricultural region takes centre stage in the path of totality of a full solar eclipse 2 July. Demand for lodging around this time has far outstripped supply, with an estimated 300,000 people expected in the area, and even hotels at the nearby coastal town of La Serena are booked solid. But those travelling outside eclipse mania still have many reasons to stare at the exceptionally clear sky the Elqui Valley was named the world’s first International Dark Sky Sanctuary as well as a centre of international global astronomy. When the sun is up, travellers can hike through vineyards or stroll through the streets of Vicuña, the largest city. It is a centre of pisco (brandy made in Chile and Peru) production and also the birthplace of poet Gabriela Mistral, winner of the 1945 Nobel Prize in Literature. Peter Kujawinski5252 The islands of Tahiti: The birthplace of the overwater bungalow ups its ecotourismThose looking to escape the news cycle can’t get much farther away than this south Pacific archipelago, also known as French Polynesia, which in 2019 celebrates the 250th anniversary of Captain James Cook’s arrival and subsequent trumpeting of its riches. Overwater bungalows were invented here: Tahiti’s clear waters offer views of more than 1,000 species of marine life. To guard against the climate change threatening parts of the region, the 118 islands and atolls have bolstered their conservation and ecotourism options. Paul Gauguin Cruises offers wildlife discovery immersions. Hotels are trying to decrease their carbon footprints: the Brando resort’s eco-friendly facilities include a coconut-oil-powered electric plant, an organic garden and solar panels. Resorts aren’t the only lodging option. The Tahitian Guesthouse experience unchains visitors from hotels and offers a more authentic Polynesian experience. Air Tahiti Nui just unveiled new jets with high-speed wifi. Sheila Marikar“Luckily, I knew the trick with the jeans,” he said. “Without the jeans I wouldn’t be here today - they were really the thing that saved me.”He added: “I saw it many years ago and I always thought if I ever go overboard without a life jacket I’m going to do that.“I took a deep breath, took out my jeans, made knots at the end of the legs and inflated the jeans, pull it over water and get air inside and then push it underwater - I had an improvised life vest.”Tolaga Bay, on New Zealand\u0027s east coast (Ulrich Lange  Creative Commons)A rescue helicopter managed to locate the German sailor three-and-a-half-hours after he was knocked overboard on 6 March.“Two times it was really close to me but they didn\u0027t see me and flew away,” Mr Murke\u0026nbspsaid. Fortunately it returned 20 minutes later and spotted him in the water.Mr Murke said he spent much of his time lost at sea thinking about his 10-month-old daughter, who lives with his girlfriend in the Philippines.“While I was in the water I was just thinking, I can’t leave my daughter behind without a father. That was the biggest motivation,” he said.The Lowe Corporation Rescue Helicopter Trust shared footage of the rescue on its Facebook page.The trust wrote: “Imagine being stuck in the middle of the ocean for two hours without any idea if you will be saved, with 2.5 metre swells pushing you from side to side… that is what our Rescue Crew attended yesterday.“A man had gone overboard from a yacht and through the quick response from our team and other rescue services, we were able to find him. He is so incredibly lucky to be alive.”We’ll tell you what’s true. You can form your own view.At The Independent, no one tells us what to write.

There are no first-class citizens, and there are no second-class voters. We are all equal in the voting booth. We are all represented at the Knesset.”Mr Netanyahu’s\u0026nbspoutburst comes as he is fighting to wrench back support of the right from Benny Gantz, the country’s popular ex-chief of staff who has formed powerful alliance with two former army chiefs and Yair Lapid, a leading centrist opposition figure.The premier had hoped to secure a fourth consecutive term in office making him the longest-serving prime minister in Israeli history.Netanyahu has shattered the illusion that Israel is a democracyNetanyahu says Israel ‘belongs to Jewish people alone’Antisemitism accusations aimed at Ilhan Omar intensifies Israel debateWill Trump’s immoral bribes serve to destroy Palestinian statehood?What did Ilhan Omar say and why has it shaken Washington?But support for his ruling Likud Party has plunged in polls after the country’s prosecutor-general said last month he planned to indict Mr Netanyahu in three corruption cases.The premier is due to face a pre-trial hearing in the coming months, after which the top prosecutor will issue a final decision on whether to send him to trial on a slew of charges including bribery.Mr Netanyahu, who is under pressure to rally the right,\u0026nbsphas come under fire for his comments targeting Israel’s Arab minority, who make up nearly 20 per cent of the population or 1.8 million people.On Monday he wrote on Instagram: “Israel is not a state of all its citizens”“According to the basic nationality law we passed, Israel is the nation-state of the Jewish people – and only it,” he concluded.The post was addressed to Israeli model and television actress Rotem Sela who had herself taken to social media to express disgust at anti-Arab comments made by Netanyahu’s firebrand culture minister Miri Regev.Ms Sela had written: “Even the Arabs – believe it or not – are human beings”.Israel is the nation-state of the Jewish people – and only itThe Israeli president was not the only prominent figure to criticise the prime minister.Hollywood actor Gal Gadot, best known for her role as Wonder Woman, posted in support of Ms Sela saying late Sunday: “Love your neighbour as yourself.”“This isn’t a matter of right or left. Jew or Arab. Secular or religious,” the Israeli-born actress wrote on Instagram.“It’s a matter of dialogue, of dialogue for peace and security and of our tolerance of one towards the other,” she added.Last month Mr Netanyahu sparked fury in Israel and among powerful pro-Israel lobby groups abroad, when he facilitated a controversial merger between key coalition partner Jewish Home, a nationalist religious party, and the extremist Jewish Power, an offshoot of the banned Kach movement.He also faced backlash for saying Arab parties “not only do not recognise Israel, they are working to eliminate Israel”.We’ll tell you what’s true.

The EU knows those Cabinet rebels will help vote down No Deal.Tory Nick Boles is conspiring with Corbyn over his disastrous “Norway Plus” idea — the worst possible option.Remainer Lords are trying AGAIN to force the Government into a permanent restrictive customs union with Brussels.Most appallingly, ex-Attorney General Dominic Grieve is openly colluding with the French to postpone Brexit for  months, long enough for a second referendum. If MPs vote to delay on March , Theresa May will be virtually powerless to refuse France’s demands. Why does Grieve still have the Tory whip And yet some Brexiteer MPs still think it’s safe to vote down the deal next Tuesday. That the law’s on their side. That we will still leave, but with No Deal.We would love to be proved wrong — but they seem dangerously delusional.Reject the deal, and a non-Brexit they will regret forever and which will destroy their party seems vastly more likely.Brexiteers will have made the biggest gamble of their lives and lost.THE Sun has always liked Prince Harry. But he needs to remember who he is — and stop talking out of his backside.It is not the job of the Royals, living an immensely privileged le on taxpayers’ money and goodwill, to preach vacuous politics to children.We don’t know, though we can guess, where Harry gets hollow profundities such as “every blade of grass, ray of sun and raindrop is crucial to our survival”. But at least that does no actual harm.Unlike telling kids the media “distorts the truth”, “tries to manipulate the power of positive thinking” and should be ignored. Or to imply the young generation are morally superior to those who, for example, fought the war or suffered the bleak economic hardships since.If he wants to be a social justice warrior regurgitating fashionable conspiracy theories and hippie banalities, so be it.But we can’t help feeling Harry and Meghan are riding for a fall.LABOUR, to its shame, is finally being investigated for illegal anti-Jewish racism by the very equalities body it once set up.Only the BNP merited a similar probe.The Equality and Human Rights ­Commission suspects Corbyn’s mob “discriminated against people because of ethnicity and religious beliefs”.Decent members will be horried, says Labour MP Ruth Smeeth.Indeed they will.

The EU thinks, with justication, that MPs won’t allow No Deal so it feels under no pressure to make signicant concessions.Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator, is telling the UK thatit doesn’t like the backstop, it can have a Northern Ireland-only version of it — which the UK has already rejected. One minister fully briefed on the negotiations tells me: “We’re at ‘what the hell do we do ’ time.”But without a change to the backstop, Theresa May’s deal is going down to another heavy defeat on Tuesday.That won’t be the end of the matter, though. For the very next day Parliament will vote against leaving on March  with No Deal. Parliament will then almost certainly vote to request an extension to Article , the two-year process for leaving the EU.At this moment, the UK would be in the EU’s hands. As one weary No source admits: “They’d be in a position of being able to dictate terms.”It would be up to the EU to decide whether to grant an extension, how long it would be for and what conditions would be attached to it. How humiliating: This country’s future would be being determined in Brussels, not Westminster.The EU would almost certainly grant an extension. But what terms it would come with remains to be seen.What should worry those MPs who are voting against Mrs May’s deal because it is not a clean enough Brexit, is what Parliament would do with this extension. I understand that unless the Government indicates that it will allow the Commons to vote on ious Brexit options, an amendment will be tacked on to the extension vote to ensure that “indicative votes” are held.These votes would be on March  and the Commons would move to bind the Government to negotiate what it wants it to.Ministers would have to report back regularly to the Commons on the progress they are making. Mrs May might be in office, but she would not be in power. It is inevitable that the Brexit the Commons would mandate would be softer than Mrs May’s deal.So why, then, are so many Brexiteers not voting for her deal  Well, the problem is that many of them regard it as so flawed that they have no desire to rescue it. They would, in the words of one Cabinet minister: “Rather their hands be clean of all this.”But this isn’t PRACTICAL POLITICS. If Brexiteers won’t back Mrs May’s deal, then Brexit is ONLY GOING TO GET SOFTER.Is there any hope of avoiding this crisis  Today, it looks unlikely. But the DUP does want a deal.While they won’t accept the backstop as it currently is and were, in the words of one source, “not entirely happy” with the proposal Geoffrey Cox took to Brussels, they are eager for an agreement.If progress on the backstop was combined with a commitment from Mrs May that she would step down before phase two of the negotiations, then the deal might pass.I understand that a leading Brexiteer backbencher conveyed this message to influential figures in the Government this week. One normally loyal minister tells me: “If there’s nothing , that is the thing that has to work.”One outcome next week would avoid a crisis: Some progress on the backstop, Mrs May’s deal passing and a new PM coming in to do the next phase of the negotiations. All other roads lead to crisis.But right now, that is where we are headed.LABOUR will, officially, back a second referendum next week.But with as many as  Labour MPs opposed to the idea, it isn’t going to pass the Commons.Jeremy Corbyn has never been enthusiastic about a second referendum – he only backed one to prevent more defections to The Independent Group of MPs.Once he has gone through the motions of supporting one, he will feel free to pivot to other options.This was demonstrated by the fact he had a meeting with the Norway Plus group of MPs this week, who want the UK to stay in the EU single market.A soft Brexit has an obvious appeal for Corbyn. It would offer a solution to the issue while splitting the Tory Party.IT is now looking increasingly likely that the UK won’t be able to get anything on the backstop.“The EU are just not budging,” one of those intimately involved in the negotiations tells me.Bringing back a pretty much unchanged deal for a vote on Tuesday would lead to a heavy defeat for the Government, and probably by a three-figure margin.But there is another option being discussed in government. Gavin Barwell, the Prime Minister’s chief of staff, told ministers this week that one option was to bring to the Commons the proposal that the UK has taken to Brussels. The idea would then be to try to win a vote on that, to prove to the EU that such a change would get the deal through.Right now, one Downing Street source says, there is a “chicken and egg problem” as the EU doesn’t think that what the UK is proposing would get the deal through the Commons, and so doesn’t see the point in engaging with it.Some in government think that doing this would offer a way out of the votes on No Deal and an extension that threaten to create the bitterest Tory split yet over Europe.This strategy is not without risks. It isn’t certain that the Government would win this vote. There is also a danger that holding a vote on a proposal that has been rejected by the EU would end up looking absurd.But walking into a vote knowing that you are going to lose heavily is rarely a sensible governing strategy.ON Wednesday, Alan Duncan urged the Prime Minister’s chief of staff, Gavin Barwell, to have the Government whip against No DealMrs May’s deal is defeated next week.Duncan warned of an eruption from the “moderate” wing of the partythis didn’t happen. Barwell pointed out that Leave ministers have accepted a lot of compromises over the past few years.The exchange demonstrated how dficult the next week will be for the Tories. The votes that would follow Mrs May’s deal failing would make every previous Tory argument over Europe look like small beer.I understand the Government is looking to contain the row through a motion that would say the UK would not leave on March  without a deal, but would try to make clear that it was still an option after that.AS Mrs May was saying there was “no direct correlation between certain crimes and police numbers”, a leaflet from the Tories’ mayoral candidate Shaun Bailey was dropping on London doormats declaring thatthe party took City Hall they would hire , more police “Helping to bring an end to rising crime”.This pledge shows the position the Government has got itself into is politically preposterous.What is needed is more police to deal with the current crisis, then action to stop children from being drawn into these gangs.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We are almost there.”And he’s right.In the sneering words of ex-Whitehall panjandrum John Kerr, who devised the Hotel Calornia-style check-out-but-never-leave rules for Brexit, Britain has “come to heel”.Whatever emerges from the ashes of this week’s Commons votes, nothing can conceal the humiliation this country has suffered under Theresa May’s lock-jawed leadership.The PM has tarnished one of the jewels in the British crown — respect for this once-great nation in the eyes of the world.Thanks to her, a clutch of faceless EU bureaucrats and their feckless Tory allies have shredded the UK’s reputation for statesmanship and cool diplomacy. Great Britain — the world’s fth-largest economy, nuclear power and permanent member of the UN Security Council — has been reduced to an object of international pity.Allies across the Commonwealth, America and even our erstwhile EU partnersare embarrassed to watch a great democracy grovelling before the unelected Burghers of Brussels.EvenAttorney General Geoffrey Cox s today with his famous cod-piece bulging, it’s lose-lose for Brexit.He might persuade enough Tory MPs to vote Mrs May’s botched and rebadged Chequers Deal through Parliament. But it will be at enormous cost.Barring an unlikely last- minute face-saver, Remainers have won this battle and the .million people who voted for Brexit have been comprehensively whipped.We can blame conspirators such as Tony Blair and ex-Chancellor George Osborne. We can point the finger at the BBC, Whitehall and a clutch of Cabinet plotters.We can blame the Brexiteers themselves for tripping over while stabbing each other in the back.And we can certainly blame Phil Hammond for blocking preparations for No Deal — our sole trump card in Brexit negotiations.But in the end, responsibility for this carnage lies with Mrs May. Indeed, thanks to her, Spreadsheet Phil can now bribe MPs with the £billion he saved by selling us down the river.If his chicanery succeeds, there is a remote chance Parliament will support Chequers and sign up to Brino — Brexit In Name Only. It will be a sour “victory”.History might be kind to Mrs May’s decency and her sense of public duty. But it will not ignore the catastrophic blunders which risk condemning this country to permanent vassal status.Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt correctly warns Europe has just as much to lose. “This is a moment of change in our relationship between the UK and the EU and history will judge both sides very badlywe get this wrong,” he says.“We want to remain the best of friends. That means getting this agreement through in a way that doesn’t poison our relations for many years to come.”Stubborn as she is, Mrs May must know her days as PM are numbered.Losing three babies in quick succession is an unimaginable tragedy in any circumstances.In Shamima Begum’s case it underlines the recklessness of bringing children into the world of terrorist anarchy. Nothing Home Secretary Sajid Javid could have done in the few weeks since she emerged in public is likely to have saved her innocent child.The responsibility lies entirely with Shamima and her jihadi husband, Dutchman Yago Riedijk.There is no chance of her surviving what threatens to be disastrous spring council elections.Certainly there is no question of leading the Government into the next round of EU negotiations, still less risk another general election meltdown.Countless Tory supporters will risk letting Jeremy Corbyn in rather than vote for another May-led government.There is a deal to be had with pro-Brexit MPs who are threatening to inflict a final defeat on Chequers tomorrow.The consequences are unpredictable.If she promises to go by mid-summer, they will vote for her deal.

Its where we were with the exposure of children to combusted tobacco  years ago.Big tobacco markets e-cigarettes as healthy products without any consideration or warnings about the harms to infants and children.The truth is that all vape products create an invisible plume of nicotine and ultrafine toxic particles that spreads into the air and coats surfaces.Do people really want to wait another  years to see how this corporate experiment ends E-cigarettes are recommended by the NHS as a means of helping smokers quit their habit.The health service states the devices do not produce tar or carbon monoxide, two of the main toxins in conventional cigarette smoke.But studies have found the vapour does contain other harmful chemicals, though at lower levels than cigarette smoke, the NHS states.It adds on its website: E-cigarettes are still fairly new and we will not have a full picture on their safety until they have been in use for many years.But according to current evidence... they carry a fraction of the risk of cigarettes.Last week another expert admitted he has banned his family from using e-cigarettes after his team found they increase the risk of heart attacks and depression.Other studies have shown flavoured e-liquids destroy lungand trigger deadly diseases.While other links have been found between vaping and the risk of stroke.So while they may be safer for smokers looking to quit, theres mounting evidence the devices are not harm-free.The new findings are published in the journal Pediatrics.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

After a deluge of replies to her tweet, many asking whether she believed MPs posting bafflingly untrue statements had any bearing on the public’s trust in politics, Ms McVey released another dazzling display of social media point-missing, appearing to suggest facts were something that one could “agree” or “disagree” with. She wrote: “From reading the comments, evenyou don’t agree with the article I posted, I think we can all agree on one thing - we never want the UK to join the Euro. True or  ” Ms McVey has since deleted the original tweet which included the link to the article. But savvy social media users took screenshots of it, to secure its place in the history books.

Labour ’s Shadow Chancellor accused his Tory opposite number of “abdicating his responsibility” as chancellor to protect the economy.And he claimed claimed slow economic growth, falling investment and firms announcing their intention to leave the UK were all avoidable were it not for the political weakness and cowardice of the Chancellor. He said Mr Hammonds failure to stand up for the economy and the interests of the country were to blame.   Askedhe thought the Prime Minister had also been cowardly, he told the Mirror: “In terms of my description of Theresa May, best not in public really. “The thing that defines Theresa May I think, and Philip Hammond is almost a brutal complacency on what’s been happening in our society. A brutal complacency. “But you combine that with incompetence and it’s the worst of all worlds. “So we have turning a blind eye to the real suffering of our people, and at the same time being totally incompetent at managing the basic elements of government.” He added: “I don’t think we’ve ever been in this situation.”   In a speech at Bloomberg ahead of Wednesdays Spring Statement, Mr McDonnell said: The position of the Chancellor of the Exchequer comes with a responsibility which I think Philip Hammond actually has abdicated in his current role.If Brexit ends up leading to even half of what the Governments own forecasts suggest could happen, I think history will judge harshly the few who could have prevented and averted this potential disaster and did so little.He said the effects of their complicity are already there, including the slowest growth in six years, investment falling, manufacturing in recession, a trade deficit of over pound billion last quarter, growth forecasts being revised downwards by the Bank of England and others ... firms announcing their intentions to leave the UK. I think all this was avoidable were it not for the political weakness and yes, these are strong words, the cowardice of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, he said. Failure to stand up for our economy and failure to stand up for the interests of our country. And whatever happens with Brexit, thats damage to peoples lives that cannot be undone.   The Chancellor is due to deliver his Spring Statement to the Commons on Wednesday afternoon. Mr McDonnell predicted the speech would include warm words about the need to avoid a no-deal Brexit. He said while there may be more rhetoric about the end of austerity, there would be nothing to relieve the suffering of millions out there today - or to prepare us for tomorrow. Mr McDonnell said: This is a week where we say no more. Where we will lay bare the failures of this Government and the damage it has done to our society. But also where we will seek in Parliament a route through the Brexit chaos that the Government has created and an end to austerity once and for all.

As of February , a shocking % of Universal Credit claimants did not receive their first payment on time and in full. The standard waiting time for the benefit, paid to .million claimants and counting, is five weeks. The recommendation is made by the liberal Conservative-leaning think tank Bright Blue in a major report on reforming UC.  The groups report, Helping Hand  Improving Universal Credit, calls for an Independent Case Examiner to examine cases the DWP has handled wrongly. The case examiner could set standards for the DWP, such as delivering payment on time, as well as standards for the claimants. The amount of compensation issued to UC claimants should to some degree mirror the amount lost by claimants because of sanctions, Bright Blue said. Specically, the financial compensation offered to claimants as a result of non-compliance by DWP should be tiered according to the number of weeks a claimant has waited for their UC award. The Bright Blue report also recommended the DWP introduce a UC phone app and a live chat facility, and cap the number of claimants dealt with by each work coach.   The think tank said a certain amount of overpayments by the DWP should be disregardedthe government made the mistake. And it recommended a relaxing of the Minimum Income Floor, a cap on benefits for self-employed claimants that is currently being challenged in the High Court.  Ryan Shorthouse, Director at Bright Blue and co-author of the report, said: “Universal Credit has plenty of potential. A majority of claimants are coping with and adapting to Universal Credit. There are positive experiences with work coaches. And there are positive attitudes too: especially towards the single payment model and the use of conditionality. “However, as it has gone from idea to implementation, the initial widespread support Universal Credit enjoyed has dissipated. Despite welcome improvements made by the Government in recent years, there are too many examples and too much evidence of signicant hardship experienced by a sizable minority of those on Universal Credit.” A DWP spokesperson said: “We welcome the report’s finding that the majority of people have had a smooth move onto Universal Credit, appreciating the simple monthly payment and work coach support. “Universal Credit is a force for good, supporting over . million people. The majority of claimants are happy with the service and where challenges remain, we will continue to make improvements.” "},{"url":null,"title":"brit couple face 140k singapore","story":"NewsBrit couple face £k Singapore hospital bill after mum suddenly gives birth earlyChloe Wilkinsons travel insurance did not cover the unexpected birth of little baby Lorcan during a stopover in SingaporeShareCommentsByLouie Smith:,  MAR NewsThe couple were planning to tell their parents about the pregnancy once home - but little Lorcan wasnt waiting\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA British couple stranded in Singapore face a poundk hospital bill after their baby was born premature at  weeks. Chloe Wilkinson, , and Patraic Walsh-Kavanagh, , were travelling back to the UK to tell their parents about the surprise pregnancy. But Chloe went into labour during a stopover in Singapore and gave birth to their son Lorcan, who weighed just .lbs. He is currently in intensive care and will have to stay in hospital for at least the next three months.    Chloe and Patraic took out travel insurance ahead of their once-in-a-letime trip, which began in December . But the policy didnt cover the unexpected pregnancy. Teaching assistant Chloe said: Lorcan’s been fighting with all his might and we are bursting with pride at the strength he is showing so far. “However, we are on our own, a  hour flight away from our family and friends, and it has been a very dficult start to parenthood whilst Lorcan remains in hospital.    Its still such a huge shock to us both that hes here but were doing everything we possibly can to ensure we all get back to the UK. Patraic added: We were in a complete state of shock and fear completely took over as we were faced with a severely premature baby with potentially multiple health issues whilst being stuck in a country with no support. “On top of this I was handed an estimated bill of poundk [, SGD] assuming there will be no further complications with Chloe or the baby. Teaching assistant Chloe and Patraic left the UK in December  to go travelling around Asia.    They then found work together in Australia before discovering Chloe was pregnant last November. The couple, who wanted to tell their parents the news in person, began flying home last month. But during a two-day stopover in Singapore Chloe was rushed to hospital after experiencing bleeding and cramps. Doctors told her she had started dilating at just  weeks - meaning flying home was no longer an option. Patraic, from Nottingham, East Mids, said: All the doctors and nurses seemed very concerned.   After numerous tests it was found that she had an infection so she was started on antibiotics and medication to reduce contractions and prolong labour to give baby the best chance of survival. However, Chloe, from Lincoln, fell more seriously ill and medics decided they had to deliver Lorcan immediately. She said: I was absolutely terried because I knew it was too early. When my water broke the room was quickly filled with doctors, midwives and paediatricians As soon as he was delivered he went straight into an incubator where the paediatricians started to help him breathe and stabilise him before whisking him off to intensive care. Hes fighting and doing his best but we feel so helpless.    Lorcan is currently in intensive care while his parents are living in a shared flat near the hospital. Their lack of working visas means they are unable to seek employment to support themselves. So the couple are trying to raise as close to pound, on GoFundMe to help pay for Lorcans hospital bills. By Monday afternoon they had raised more than pound,. Chloe added: Were professional people who work hard but its obviously a huge sum and anything anyone can offer to help would be greatly appreciated. We would like to take this opportunity to thank everyone at home and across the world for their continued love and support.

Mum-of-three Laura McQueenie has been plagued by the germ-carrying animals at her council flat in Niddrie, Edinburgh, where she lives with her sons and young niece. The -year-old said the living conditions were disgraceful and describing overflowing bins as a health hazard. After the birth of her youngest son seven months ago, the social work student began to realise the scale of the problem. Laura said: Two rats have died in my kitchen sink and there are many more we have seen.   Every evening I hoover and sanitise all surfaces before bed. When I wake in the morning there are rat droppings all over the kitchen workspaces, window sill – they are even inside the bread bag. There are droppings all over the living room window sills, the floors. The young mum lives with her sons, aged eight, two and seven months, as well as her -month old niece. Laura said problems with rats were affecting the health of her youngest child - and said poison poured into the rodents’ holes did nothing to solve the problem. “The flat is absolutely disgraceful and it’s disgusting that we have to stay here because there’s nowhere  suitable for us. It’s been horric living here and it’s heartbreaking that I have no other option.   “I now go to my mum’s during the day because I can’t bear to be there. It’s filthy. The bins outside are a severe health hazard and I’ve been down with rubber gloves trying to clean some of it.” Pest control firm Wee Critters Pest Control estimated that there was a  per cent increase in call-outs year on year, while owner Sylvia Hill said amateur poisons bought by concerned residents would barely make a dference to the problem. Sylvia believes the Gorgie area of Edinburgh could be the worst in Scotland for rat infestations - and described the problem as a plague. She said: “We are struggling with the high demand at the moment. Ive had to share some of our jobs with other pest control companies. The city centre is full of rat problems but Gorgie is the worst area by far and possibly the worst in Scotland. We are honestly never out of there. Some of the problems are caused by laziness to be honest.   Rather than opening the bin lid to throw away the rubbish, people are leaving their rubbish and dog poo at the side of their bins.” She added: I have seen people buying amateur rat poison but although it may kill a mouse or two, adult mice and rats are hardly affected by it. The rats are just a major issue in Edinburgh at the moment. A total of , pest control requests were received by the City of Edinburgh Council last year with the Forth, Sighthill Gorgie and Craigentinny Duddingston wards proving to be the most problematic areas of the city. And there were , complaints about missed bin collections. However, although it appears that the rat population is increasing, the local authority said it had not experienced a signicant increase in vermin callouts. Cllr Lesley Macinnes, convener for Transport and Environment, said: We remain surprised by these comments and would be interested in hearing from the pest control firm, as this information goes against our evidence of what is happening in the city.

Horried Mr Cole-Hamilton sprang into action, recalling skills he had learned in a first aid course more than  years ago. The Lib-Dem health spokesman inverted the youngster and slapped her back with an open palm five times until she was sick.

The ambulance guy saidI hadn’t done what I did the outcome would have been very dferent.” The dad-of-threes voice trembled with emotion as he spoke. He told the Record: “I remembered from  years ago the ABC rule - I managed to clear the airway, I’m just glad I didn’t need to breathe for her. “Darcy was blue lighted to the sick kids hospital.

The self-confessed health fanatic insists the move is in the best interests of pupils.   She said: First of all, Im not the head teacher of all evil and saying no. Ive banned birthday sweets because they were becoming a huge problem in the school and mean the children were consuming processed sugar almost every day. Mrs Crawford-Usher, from New England, America, admits she wasnt allowed sweets growing up and claims her mother was a Whole Foods mum before it was trendy. She noted that children are provided with healthy and wholesome school dinners such as spaghetti bolognese, shepherds pie and roast dinners - all made with fresh ingredients.The strict head of Wateringbury Primary School also said desserts were on the table but they too were natural and unprocessed.  Despite the drastic measures, Mrs Crawford-Usher claimed students and parents have seldom complained. She said: People are angry about it for about a week and then it just becomes normal. I really havent had much of a backlash. Children can eat and drink whatever they want when they get home, I just want to provide them with healthier choices at school. The dental problems among schoolchildren now are awful and I want to do what I can to prevent it.   Its a terribly traumatic ordeal for a child to have their tooth extracted and its something I want to avoid. It comes after recent figures revealed ,  under-s needed tooth extractions last year. Public Health England estimated that youngsters were eating around eight more cubes of sugar per day than the recommended guidelines.However, Mrs Crawford-Ushers decision has come under fire on social media from Olympic race walker Tom Bosworth.He said: Again, common sense needs to be used here. Really what is happening to society to ban kids from having sweets on their birthday. - ban them every other dayyou like, but let a child be a child on their birthday though. The head hit back and said the Olympian had perhaps missed the point. She said: Yes, I think pupils should be able to eat sweets on their birthday buteach and every child brings them in to celebrate, the children would be eating them nearly every day. Also it puts an unfair pressure on parents to bring in sweets when perhaps they dont agree with them. Wateringbury CE Primary School is based near Maidstone, Kent.   Its mission statement reads: Our vision...to be an excellent primary school at the heart of the community where we inspire, excite and enable children to achieve.

The school had previously banned sugary drinks like fizzy sodas and fruit juices too.

The -year-old was terrfied when her face started to drop and immediately pulled over to call her mum. But she couldnt even manage to get the words out to tell her mum where she was stranded. Initially fearing she had suffered a stroke, Amelia-Rose was temporarily paralysed and unable to speak a single word. She said: I had left work at pm after parents evening and I got three minutes down the road when I suddenly felt like I didnt know who I was.   I had a blinding headache and the left side of my body quickly became limp. My immediate thought was oh my God, Im having a stroke so I pulled over and called my mum. When she asked where I was, I didnt recognise anything.Her mum called  and the ambulance rushed her to hospital , where she spent nine days in recovery. But when her music professor, Professor Grenville Hancox, arrived with his guitar and encouraged her to sing she was able to perform a faultless rendition of Yesterday, by The Beatles , despite still not being able to speak properly. Amelia-Rose, from Staplehurst in Kent, had suffered a hemiplegic migraine and throgh singing has now managed to regain her voice and speak again.She said: It was absolutely amazing, its incredible really. I went from not being able to get a single word out to singing without any stuttering at all.   It felt like my brain fog had evaporated - the dficulty and confusion was melting away. The scholar was Amelia-Roses music professor at Canterbury Christ Church University and the pair remained in contact after she graduated, running singing groups across the UK. She said: Grenville had just come from choir and had his guitar so we decided to put it to the test. Singing comes from a dferent part of the brain to speech so we knew that was something I was going to be able to do - but we didnt realise it would be to that extent so quickly.Prof Hancox filmed the moment Amelia-Rose broke her silence and burst into song at the hospital and the remarkable clip has received almost , Facebook hits.She was discharged from hospital on February  but has only been able to have a proper conversation since last week.  Following the ordeal, Amelia-Rose called the professor but was still struggling to speak - so he suggested again that she try singing instead. She said: I phoned Grenville after what had happened. He said I dont know what you are saying, sing it to me and so we spent  minutes singing down the phone to one another and his we even joined in in the background. Amelia-Rose suffers from Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, which affects the tissues in her body, and believes a recent flare in her condition caused stress, which triggered the migraines and loss of speech. She is still recovering at home and continues to have migraines but said she is singing every day to help regain her speech. Amelia-Rose said: Ive had another three migraines since and when they kick in, I cant talk and I cant move. It is only two days since I have been talking like this but I have made sure I am singing every day to keep that going. Prof Hancox helped Amelia-Rose at university, where she was a mute due to anxiety caused by childhood trauma. Over a two-year period, the music professor helped her to regain her confidence and her speech by singing. Her recent migraine is the first time in more than five years she has struggled with her speech. She said: Previously, my loss of speech was caused by my mental health but this time it was caused by a physical chemical reaction in the brain.

Meghan, , had changed out of her earlier outfit - a custom green wool embellished coat and matching dress - into a Victoria Beckham dress.She matched it with a chic hat and green suede heels. Duke and Duchess of Cambridge arrived at Westminster Abbey moments later for the Commonwealth event, to celebrate its  countries and . billion people. Meghan and Kate kissed each other on both cheeks and their brothers-in-law, just as the Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall arrived.

In other pictures, Prime Minister Theresa May could be seen arriving at the abbey, wearing a feathered hat and a brightly coloured necklace.  She smiled and held on to her hat as she walked towards the abbey.The Queen today praised how the Commonwealth inspires its member states to find ways of protecting the planet and it citizens.In a written message, the monarch said: In April last year, I welcomed the leaders of our  nations to Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle for the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, and we all witnessed how the Commonwealth vision offers hope, and inspires us to find ways of protecting our planet, and our people. We are able to look to the future with greater confidence and optimism as a result of the links that we share, and thanks to the networks of co-operation and mutual support to which we contribute, and on which we draw.   With enduring commitment through times of great change, successive generations have demonstrated that whilst the goodwill for which the Commonwealth is renowned may be intangible, its impact is very real. Earlier today, Meghan and Harry had visited Canadas High Commission in London, where they got an insight into Canadian culture. In a stark contrast, Meghan wore a custom green wool embellished coat and matching dress by Canadian and Turkish fashion designer Erdem for this .

Maple syrup was poured on to crushed ice and, as it hardened, the children rolled it onto a stick and quickly devoured the delicacy traditionally served at this time of year from sugar shacks in the woods.   After watching the youngsters and listening as Harry asked how many of these are you allowed , the Duchess tried making one for herself. She then gave it to nine-year-old Elodie-Rose Dugua-Inegbese. The schoolgirl said about being given Meghans taffy: I was so excited. She said does anyone want one  And she said to me would you like it  Thenhanded it to me. It was really fun meeting Meghan and shes really pretty and was really friendly.

Canadas High Commissioner to the UK Janice Charette said: We kind of claim them a little bit as Canadians for two reasons one of course because of the duchess long timeshes worked in Canada both in Toronto and Vancouver. But as well, one of their first outings as a couple was actually at the Invictus Games in Toronto so we like to think of them as having come home here to Canada House. She added that it was signicant hosting the royal visit in the th anniversary year of the formation of the modern Commonwealth.   The high commissioner said: For me, the chance to have them here and focus on Canadian youth, withthe youth ambassador of the Commonwealth and the duchess, who has responsibilities with the Commonwealth Trust most newly, this is about the future of the Commonwealth, talking to the young people. Before leaving, the couple were given clothes for their baby. Meghan said Oh Hudsons Bay goodies when the gt box was opened and she recognised a tiny striped hat and mittens. Harry, meanwhile, made a crowd of high commission staff laugh when he picked up a tiny pair of Manitobah Mukluks - moccasins - and snfed them to seethey were real leather.The final present was an organic cotton Canadian maple leaf decorated baby bodysuit.

Susan Morgan claims she was denied the purchase at the supermarket’s Paignton branch in Devon after admitting the cigarettes were for a -year-old friend. Speaking to Devon Live , Susan said: “She is a good friend so I decided to buy her some flowers and a small bottle of vodka which I paid for and then I went to the kiosk to buy her some cigarettes. “I don’t buy myself cigarettes so I wasn’t exactly sure what to ask for and said they were for a friend.  “I was then told I couldn’t have them, even when I said how old my friend was because I was told I couldn’t prove it. “I know they have to do their job but I felt like they had made a judgement on my character immediately.” Describing the experience, Susan added: “It was so devastating because I felt insulted, embarrassed and like a criminal. “I rarely go out because I suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder and it made me feel terrible afterwards.

Along the way, Carmine “The Snake” Persico is suspected of killing  people and ordering hits on hundreds more, while surviving attempts on his own le – in one legendary incident by catching a bullet in his teeth.Now The Snake is sleeping with the fishes after dying in jail, aged , on Thursday.He grew up in the golden age of New York’s La Cosa Nostra, its five notorious crime families battling for supremacy. Persico wanted a slice of the action, dismissing his ft in stature and using his razor- sharp intelligence to rise to kingpin of the Colombo family, becoming known as “The Snake” as he double-crossed rival families to slither to power. And even after his luck ran out, and he was jailed for  years in , he continued to rule from behind bars, taking out contracts on those who dared to mess with the master.   He never broke the mafia’s Omertagrave, code of silence, and was “an old-school tough guy”, according to Frank Dimatteo, who grew up in the mob and co-wrote biography Carmine the Snake: Carmine Persico and His Murderous Mafia Family. Dimatteo says: “He’s a throwback to the real gangsters, not like these make-believe gangsters. You gotta give him respect for it.” Carmine John Persico Jr was born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, on August , . His father worked as a legal stenographer, but Persico idolised mobsters. As a kid, he was demanding his peers’ lunch money, as a teenager he formed the Garfield Boys gang. At , he was charged with killing a rival gang member, but the charge was dropped. By , he had been arrested for murder a second time.   He caught the eye of Frankie Abbatemarco, a member of the Profaci crime family – later to become the Colombo family – who hired him as an enforcer. He was in. But how to rise through the ranks  On October , , he was involved in one of the decade’s most famous mafia hits, the killing of crime boss Albert Anastasia, gunned down by the so-called “barbershop quartet” while getting a shave in the Park Sheraton hotel in Manhattan. No one was ever charged, but it’s believed Persico acted alongside one of the Gallo brothers, Crazy Joey. Later, when he learned kingpin Joe Profaci was creaming more cash than he should from his foot soldiers, Persico plotted with Gallo brothers, Joey, Albert and Larry, to take him out. Profaci caught wind of it, and bribed Persico to turn on the Gallos. On Profaci’s orders, Persico lured Larry Gallo to the Sahara Lounge in Brooklyn, and very nearly strangled him.   Luckily, for Gallo, a policeman walked in. Charges against Persico were dropped when Gallo refused to give evidence. The double-cross earned Persico his nickname The Snake, which he did not like. The Gallos tried to assassinate Persico, shooting him in the face. One of the bullets lodged in his mouth, but legend has it Persico spat it out and drove off. A few years later, he took revenge, killing Joe Gallo. When Profaci died of cancer, Joe Colombo replaced him, making Persico a “capo” in . Ten years later, Persico got to the top of the tree after Colombo was shot and paralysed. Michael Benson, who co-wrote The Snake’s biography with Dimatteo, says: “Carmine wanted to do just one thing with his le: be the leader of the gang, Top Cat. He acquired power the way other men breathe.”  Persico was in and out of jail throughout his tenure, but ran his operation from inside, making huge profits from loan sharking and racketeering. FBI wiretaps finally caught up with him and all five mafia families, resulting in the Mafia Commission Trial in the s. The Snake defended himself, and one judge said he was “one of the most intelligent people I have ever seen in my le”. He lost anyway and in  was put away for good for extorting millions. Seven others went down with him. An infection in his leg – for which he resisted amputation – and diabetes, ultimately led to Persico’s death at a federal jail in Butner, North Carolina. He leaves a we, two children, and  grandchildren. The Snake’s second nickname was “Immortal”, but, thankfully, it is only the legend that lives on.

Andyou are one of those people who like to keep on top of the housework, youll likely find yourself getting pretty annoyed with your fellow residents, pretty quickly.A student named Ruth Came recently found herself in this situation after her housemates forgot to put the bin out four weeks in a row, leaving her to tackle the task. So she devised a hilarious way to get back at them for not helping out.  Instead of leaving a passive aggressive note on the fridge, or firing off an angry text message to the WhatsApp group, Ruth decided to get creative.She sent a link to a mysterious survey to her housemates, begging them to fill it in as it was regarding a cause thats close and dear to her heart. Little did her pals know that when they clicked the link, they would be forced to answer a series of questions about the bins in their house.Ruths housemate India Ellis shared the survey on Twitter , writing: If anyone wanted an insight into living with students, my housemate has just sent this survey to the house chat for us to fill in.

The survey goes on to ask whether the housemates are aware that when bins are full, they require emptying and jokes about the magical bin pixies that empty the bin while theyre all asleep. The third question asks the housemates to simply empty the bins once in a while and only allows them to select of course as an answer, giving them no choice in the matter. The whole thing concludes with Ruth writing: Did I create this survey PURELY because Im salty about emptying all the bins for the fourth time in a row and wished to communicate this in a passive aggressive yet mildly witty way  Yes, we all know she did.  Indias tweet about the survey went viral, garnering over , retweets and , likes.More than  people also commented on the post, with many praising Ruth, including India who claimed she is her icon.

Among those to lose their lives in the tragedy were UN worker, Joanna Toole, , from Exmouth, Devon, Irishman Michael Mick Ryan, a dad of two who worked for the UNs World Food Programme , Joseph Waithaka - a dual Kenyan and British national and polar tourism expert Sarah Auffret.But this the second time in less than six months a Boeing  MAX has crashed with devastating results.Lion Air Flight  crashed into the sea just  minutes after take-off from Jakarta in Indonesia while on its way to Pangkal Pinang on October  last year.   All  passengers and crew were killed. Crew on the Ethiopian Airlines plane lost contact with air traffic control just after take-off, at around :am yesterday. Ethiopian Airlines CEO, Tewolde GebreMariam, revealed the polit had reported he was experiencing technical dficulties just after take-off and had requested permission toto the airport. This was granted - but just minutes later the plane plummeted to earth, killing all on board. Eyewitnesses have said they saw smoke coming from the plane but GebreMariam insists a pre-flight check didnt reveal any issues.   The pilot had more than , hours flying experience and an excellent flying record. At a press conference, GebreMariam said: As it is a fresh incident, we have not been able to determine the cause. An investigation has now been launched into the aviation tragedy and several airlines have already grounded their Boeing  Max s. Ethiopia along with carriers in China and the Cayman Islands has suspended flying Boeing  MAX s as an extra safety precaution. Ethiopian Airlines, Africas biggest commercial carrier, said: Although we dont yet know the cause of the accident, we have to decide to ground the particular fleet as an extra safety precaution.   China has made the same decision in viewthe fact that the two air crashes were newly delivered Boeing - aircraft. Cayman Airlines has also grounded the planes while the investigation is carried out. At the moment there is no evidence of a link between the two crashes but there are similarities, which is believed to have prompted fears in airlines around the world.And one aviation analyst, Mary Schiavo, told CNN both incidents were highly suspicious.She added: Here we have a brand-new aircraft thats gone down twice in a year.   That rings alarm bells in the aviation industry, because that doesnt just happen. Both planes crashed just minutes into their journeys and neither had reported technical faults. The Boeing  is the companys biggest selling aircraft. It is described as a workhorse for short and medium haul flights and the  max is the newest model. Airlines have already ordered thousands of them. Each month Boeing makes  new s every month.   In a statement on the Ethiopian crash: Boeing is deeply saddened to learn of the passing of the passengers and crew on Ethiopian Airlines Flight , a  MAX  airplane. We extend our heartfelt sympathies to the families and loved ones of the passengers and crew on board and stand ready to support the Ethiopian Airlines team. A Boeing technical team will be travelling to the crash site to provide technical assistance under the direction of the Ethiopia Accident Investigation Bureau and U.S. National Transportation Safety Board. As investigators start the second day on examining exactly what caused the Ethiopian Airlines plane to plummet from the sky, what happened to Lion Air Flight . The probe into what downed the jet last October is still on going but a preliminary investigation revealed both passengers and crew on its previous flight had reported problems.  It has also been reported there were signs of instrument failure on previous flights. Following the fatal crash in October, Boeing warned all airlines using the  MAX to avoid ing abruptly. As with the Ethiopian Airlines crash, crew on board the Lion Air plane had also asked for permission toto the airport. But then, abruptly, contact between the aircraft and air traffic control was lost. The doomed plane went into the ocean close to a oil rig and crew reported that the jet ed into the water with its nose down.  Initial investigations after the Lion Air crash seem to suggest it could have been caused by faulty data, which led the crew to believe the nose was tilted at a higher angle than it was in reality. The new  max s had been fitted with a new safety system which is designed to automatically pull the nose of the plane downdata on board suggests it is not at the correct angle, The prelim report also highlighted six other identied problems, which had occurred since October . Just the day before the planes fatal crash, the s angle-of-attack sensor had been replaced after it encountered problems. This measures the angle between the wings and the flow of air around the plane.  And chillingly in the flight before the doomed take-off to pilot had issued a Pan Pan call. The aircraft was travelling between Denpasar on Bali to Jakarta and the Pan Pan alert is one less serious than Mayday. Abormal conditions becayse of instrument failure were blamed but the crew managed to land the aircraft safely. A warning device, known as the stick shaker, which alerts flight crew as tothe aircraft is about to stall was active throughout the final flight before the crash. The preliminary report says the flight should not have continuedthe stick shaker was active because it was an un-airworthy condition.  And even during Flight JT, the system was active, possibly due to a faulty sensor. This could have forced the planes nose down, even when it wasnt stalling. In the minutes after take-off, the flight also failed to gain normal height. It should have reached , feet but remained at around , feet. The speed, which should have risen steadily, was also erratic. Damage to the aircraft was said to have been caused by a high energy impact although the cockpit voice recorder has not yet been recovered, which could provide more detailed information as to what happened. A full investigation report into what happened to Lion Air Flight  is expected later this year.

The barber didnt find out until after he had cooked it and eaten it - and he claims his family hasnt talked to him since. Mr Paul, from Blenheim, New Zealand, is now demanding the Countdown supermarket pay for a trip to his native India so he can be puried by priests after he broke his religious vow. Hindus consider the cow to be a sacred symbol of le. Mr Paul, who runs his own barber shop, told Stuff.co.nz: According to my religion, I have to go back to my country and do sacred things for four to six weeks, and be puried by priests, so I can continue on my religious path. Its a long process. Travelling to Delhi, he said, would require him to close his shop and pay thousands for flights, accommodation and food. Mr Paul said he complained to the supermarket and was offered a voucher as a goodwill gesture.   But he refused and asked the company to pay for his trip instead. That hasnt happened and he is not considering legal action as a last resort. He said: I understand this looks like a simple matter, but for me this is very hard. I break my religion [vows] because of someone s negligence. I know my society back from my home will not accept me with this breach of the religions conditions. It appears Mr Paul wont get his way. A spokeswoman for Countdown told Stuff.co.nz that an in-store labelling error resulted in a pack of beef mince being sold with both beef and lamb labels.

Olivia was placed on me first, then when it was Zoes turn she reached out her left arm and hugged her sister. My tears were flowing, its a moment Ill never forget. The proud mum shared the beautul moment on Instagram .Now Ann is hopeful that she can take her girls home with her by mid-April.

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks.

Transport Minister Michael Matheson, Transport Scotland and our Government must abandon their obsession with mitigation measures and fund a permanent solution. We demand no less.Sir,Calls for assurances that the Rest and Be Thankful section of the A will be improved to resist future landslides were made during a session of Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity questions in the Scottish Parliament.I quizzed transport secretary Michael Matheson, about what was discussed at the last meeting of the A Taskforce in November , and asked what assurances the Cabinet Secretary could give to local residents and businesses who rely on the A being open at all times.The Rest and Be Thankful was closed off for nine days in October  following the largest landslide in a decade, forcing road users to either take a major ersion, or to use the Old Military Road during certain hours of the day.A number of petitions were created during the period of the incident, including one by myself, calling for a permanent solution to the Rest and Be Thankful.The transport secretary said that the meeting was #full and frank#, and that there would be a #review of the potential for additional landslide mitigation measures at the Rest and Be Thankful#, and that this would be discussed at the next A Taskforce meeting in March .There was also a commitment that Argyll and Bute would be #prioritised# in the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.I welcome the assurances by the transport secretary that there will be a review of any additional measures for the Rest and Be Thankful, and that Argyll and Bute will receive priority at the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.Donald Cameron, MSPReserve forcesSir,Last issue#sletter raising concerns about the UK government’s proposed use of the army’s reserve force in the event of a no-deal Brexit is timely.In case anyone out there still thinks a no-deal Brexit is a good idea it’s worth noting that the legal authorityof Reserve Forces Act  allowing the Secretary of State to take this step requires him to establish that it is necessary #for the alleviation of distress or the preservation of le or property in time of disaster or apprehended disaster#.Enough said.Frances Roberts, Ardrishaig"},{"url":null,"title":"honours even for red star in argyll derby","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Ropework played host to this keenly contested local derby which was watched by a healthy crowd on Saturday February .And for the second time this season, Red Star and Campbeltown Pupils shared the points in a match both sides will feel they could have won.Both sides were struggling for fluency in the opening stages but Red Star settled first and grabbed the opening goal after  minutes. A long ball to the right hand side was met by Ryan Caskie who cut the ball back to Stuart McLean. The youngster took a touch before slotting past the Pupils# goalkeeper to give Star a - lead.Star continued to press and doubled their lead when Coll McCallum robbed the Pupils# defender on the edge of the box before cutting the ball across goal. The unfortunate Pupils# defender could only ert the ball into the empty net, with McLean waiting on a tap in. The game continued at a frantic pace, however, there was no further scoring in the first half and Star went in with a - advantage.Pupils came out with purpose in the second half as they looked to force themselves back into the game, however, it was a howler from Red Star which allowed them back into the match.A square ball across the back resulted in a mix-up between Star keeper Luke Kalache and defender Ben Forbes which allowed Donald McCallum to prod the ball home from just inside the box and Pupils were back in the game at - with eight second half minutes gone.The home side didn’t recover from this and you could sense a nervousness that gave the visitors plenty encouragement. The equaliser arrived with  minutes remaining when good play from Pupils down the right by Soudan saw him get a low cross in which was met by the on-rushing run of Ryan Deans and he finished well to level the score at -.This set up a frantic finish and both sides could have nicked it towards the end. Pupils went close with a headed effort which was clawed to safety while at the other end there was a goalmouth scramble which Star couldn’t convert and both sides had to settle for a draw in the end as referee Jimmy Litster blew for full time.Red Star were dealt a blow as it emerged that captain Aaron Moore suffered a dislocated shoulder. Hopefully this will not keep him out for too long.On Saturday February , Star have another important home game as they look to move off the bottom of the table when they take on Claremont AFC.

Documents such as rent records, estate census papers, military papers, letters, maps and legal documents can offer a glimpse into the lives of people who lived across Argyll.The two-year Written in the Landscape project is set to wind up in July this year and has entailed cataloguing and digitising the Argyll Estate and other records to make them more accessible to the public.As Hannah and Jen travel round Argyll on their tour, the intention is to offer a local flavour from the archives aimed at each venue.For the Lochgilphead workshop on February , Jen and Hannah presented such erse items as #registers of the poor# and burgh court rolls from Lochgilphead, th century wage books from Kilmory Estate alongside military commission documents from the th century and a  map of the proposed Crinan Canal, surveyed by John Rennie.Each record offers a dferent insight among a treasure trove of detail.The Lochgilphead presentation followed a similar event in Campbeltown in January. Workshops will be held in March on Mull, Helensburgh in April before travelling to Strachur, Dunoon, Inveraray and Tiree in May.Further information on the Argyll Paper records can be obtained by emailing archives@inveraray-castle.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":null,"title":"bob sheilds make new recycling","story":"NewsBob Shields: Make new recycling system in South Ayrshire work for usNew leaflets needed to inform the publicShareByAyrshire Post:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR News\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAfter a first glance at last week’s report on noisy bin men – I had to check out my calendar to make sure I wasn’t getting a month ahead of myself. Let’s face it, stories about a Mr Paine and some broken glass usually appear on April . But no – it really was only March ! Mr Paine’s issue is the emptying of his street’s bottle bins at am. On the morning of his first collection, he mistook the noise of breaking glass for a robber breaking into his house. “I was terried,” he said. And then added, “This is noise pollution and most of the street must have been up.” Well, I too have suffered Mr Paine’s ‘noise pollution’ - perhaps an even noisier version. Chez Shields is no stranger to a well chilled Petit Chablis washing down the foie gras before Eastenders. In fact, I’ve been known to pop a second cork just to recover from Eastenders! Based on Mr Paine’s video recording, the noise made by the emptying of my bottle bin is right up there - somewhere between a small public house and a decent sized restaurant. Andit wakes up my neighbours – I couldn’t give a Chateau Le Clos! On my street’s first collection, I didn’t wake up thinking I was being burgled. House-breakers don’t usually make enough noise to get “most of the street up”. I seem to remember thinking, “That’ll be the bin men . . .” and going back to sleep. And on the  days a year that the glass bins are emptied in “quiet, residential Masonhill”, I respectfully suggest Mr Paine does the same. After all, we’re talking about saving the world here . . . not saving an hour’s kip! Greenhouse gas emissions are asphyxiating the planet. Plastic bags are strangling dolphins and milk bottle caps are choking sea birds. Our little Earth is throttling itself. To be honest, I’d rather be concentrating on ten decades of industrial pollution than Mr Paine’s ten minutes of noise pollution. And meanwhile, still in bin land, South Ayrshire Council is blaming the public for the latest waste collection problems. I can see the point they’re making – but the word “contamination” is a bit strong for Mrs McGuffie putting Tiddle’s empty Whiskas can in the paper and cardboard bin. And the new recycling system is a little too new for the “red tag” bin police to be targeting offenders. By refusing to lt certain bins – South Ayrshire Council is tempting fate. I’ve heard reports of some people using a neighbour’s bin when their own bin is full and red tagged. I’m also told there are increasing incidences of household waste being stuffed in the street bins reserved for pedestrian litter. And stuck in the middle are the bin men themselves. One told me “If we red tag a bin – we get **** from the householder. If we take back a contaminated bin, we get **** from our supervisors. Basically, were in the **** no matter what we do!” My dear old mum used to use a lovely phrase – “There’s a place for everything . . . .and everything in its place”. That’s exactly how SAC’s new recycling system meant to work. But it’s going to take a little time and a little patience – on both sides. The info leaflets sent out to explain the new system were largely ignored or discarded - most people didn’t understand them. But with the new bins now rolled out – a back-up leaflet might help. “You’ve got your new bins – now here’s how to use them”. Rubbishing the new rubbish system isn’t going to make it go away.

And it becomes reality with the imminent departure of Rev Richard Moffat from Girvan North Parish Church. The area – in the short term at least – will be dependent on the services of elderly retired ministers and lay readers. Mr Moffat has been a popular parish minister at Girvan North for five years. And he was due to become Moderator of the Presbytery of Ayr in April. But he is set to move to a new charge in Morayshire, to be closer to his daughter and her family. He will conduct his last Sunday service in Girvan North on March . Mr Moffat’s departure is the latest factor concentrating minds in the Church of Scotland. For Girvan South, linked with Barr and Dailly is currently without its minister. Popular Rev Ian McLachlan has been on sick leave for several months. And colleagues say he is unlikely toto full-time duties. Rev Stephen Ogston was parish minister at Ballantrae Colmonell from  until August, . But he moved on to Luce Valley Church, and no replacement has been found. The linked charge of Ballantrae St Colmon also takes in services at Barrhill and Glenapp. So communities right across Girvan and South Carrick no longer have a parish minister in their midst. And there is uncertaintly at how things will be resolved. One solution might be a union of the two Girvan churches. And that could leave Girvan North - with its -foot spire – as the last kirk in town. It would presumably also be used as a hub to minister to village churches. The Post understands there can be as few as six worshippers in Barr Parish Church on Sundays. This isn’t helped by Barr being last in the pecking order for services, after Girvan South and Dailly. So it’s virtually lunchtime before a Sunday service gets under way. A Presbytery of Ayr meeting was due in the Carrick Centre in Maybole on Tuesday this week.And the Post understands this will see Rev Ian Stirling Fisherton Kirkoswald appointed interim moderator at Girvan North. Locum minister will be retired minister Rev Edgar Ogston – father of Stephen – who livesin Girvan.The Post has spoken to kirk elders in Girvan who say they’re uncertain about the future. And a retired church minister suspects that the two Girvan churches will be required to amalgamate. He said: “Things are changing. We’ve been a clergy-centred church for  years. “But one positive thing we’re seeing is the rise of worship groups which are prompting people to think about their faith, without necessarily being preached at.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnChurch of ScotlandAyrMoffatGirvan"},{"url":null,"title":"college staging wine fuelled feast","story":"NewsCollege staging wine-fuelled feast as job cuts loomLeaked emails tell of lavish bash at cash-strapped Ayrshire CollegeShareByStephen Houston:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR News\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailCollege bosses have defended holding a celebration to honour their success amid a climate of drastic job cuts and cash problems. Ayrshire College supremos and invited senior staff will stage a sit-down feast later this month to mark five years since its formation. The dinner for  will also include free wine after a sponsored deal by college chairman Willie Mackie. Leaked emails state the claim the college is “now regarded as one of the most successful colleges in Scotland.” But our inside source said: “It adds insult to injury that this celebration is being held less than one week before the final jobs structure is issued to staff. “It is in extremely poor taste given the circumstances of potential job losses due to lack of funds.” Evening classes are having to be cancelled so the event can be staged at the Kilmarnock campus on March . Retiring principal Heather Dunk is also to be honoured during the evening. Chairman Willie Mackie said: “She has made a signicant contribution to Ayrshire for over  years.” Ms Dunk retired on February , leaving an impending restructure which will cost jobs. A consultation ends tomorrowand it has emerged the Private Finance Initiative which built the Kilwinning campus is a huge drain on funds. An email which Ms Dunk sent to staff in January read: “We need to make signicant savings to be financially sustainable due to the costs associated with the PFI, unfunded national bargaining costs and the increasing costs of pensions, utilities and other services. I am very disappointed that an organisational review is necessary, it is not what I want to be focused on in my last weeks as principal. “However, we must manage within the financial allocation we receive in this very dficult fiscal climate.” Under the consultation, one of the four vice-principals would be axed, three directors culled, heads of learning cut from  to nine, and three marketing coms staff would go. Also at risk of the chop are two posts within estates as well as a shake-up of duties among departments. The board of management will approve the final structure and staff impacted will get a severance package. Ayrshire College acknowledged finance was a major challenge for all Scottish colleges but said the dinner costs were met by sponsorship. A spokeswoman said: “Our main financial challenge for the year ahead is to meet the costs associated with the Kilwinning PFI Campus, national bargaining costs and the increasing costs of pensions, utilities and services. “While the Scottish Funding Council has agreed to provide further strategic funds to help manage these rising costs, the college still requires to make signicant savings to secure its financial sustainability and jobs for the future. “We are, therefore, considering proposals for an organisational review. “All staff are aware of the challenges the college faces, and have contributed to a consultation regarding potential efficiencies and opportunities for income generation. “We have just passed our five-year anniversary as Ayrshire College, and have planned an event, ‘Celebrating Five Years of Success. It is important to recognise this milestone and celebrate success – for learners, staff, the college and the region. “We are mindful of the costs of holding such an event and so have secured full sponsorship.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnUniversities and CollegesAyr NewsAyrEducationKilmarnockSchoolsKilwinning"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"first minister must act over","story":"NewsFirst Minister must act over Tarbolton landfill, says MSPThe South of Scotland Tory MSP says he is hearing growing concerns from villagers about the condition of the site.ShareByAyrshire Post:,  MAR NewsBrian Whittle MSP challenges the First Minister in the Scottish Parliament \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMore than eight months after Tarbolton Landfill’s owners entered liquidation, MSP Brian Whittle has challenged the First Minister to act, writes Edwin Lawrence. The South of Scotland Tory MSP says he is hearing growing concerns from villagers about the condition of the site. He said: “Since the landfill closed its gates, worries have been expressed about smells and also about contaminated water running off the site.” These would normally be dealt with by the site owner, so Mr Whittle took up the issue with both the Scottish Environment Protection Agencyand the Scottish Government. However, in the absence of a clear answer on ultimate responsibility, he decided to raise it at Holyrood, during First Minister’s questions. In response, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said:   “I am not able to give that information to Brian Whittle right now. “I undertake to raise the issue with the environment secretary and to come back to Brian Whittle as quickly as possible about our understanding of the lines of accountability and the action that the Scottish Government can take to try to reach a resolution of what certainly seems to be a deeply unsatisfactory situation. “I can understand that people in the local area will be very concerned about any prospect of contamination and it is absolutely necessary that all relevant agencies and organisations respond as quickly as possible.” Speaking afterwards, Brian Whittle MSP said: “The situation with the Tarbolton Landfill has been allowed to drag on for too long already. “Aside from the obvious concerns local residents have, it’s troubling that there doesn’t appear to be a clearly defined process for when the operator of a site like this is no longer able to carry out their duties to protect the surrounding environment. “I hope the First Minister will be able to provide some much needed clarity on this issue.” "},{"url":null,"title":"giant bins placed right outside","story":"NewsGiant bins placed right outside a restaurant and pub in scenic townAnger in Troon as bin squad set up town corral without asking anyone for permissionShareByStephen Houston:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR News \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA council works gang put up a new big bin enclosure – right outside a restaurant and pub in the scenic centre of town. Now a row has broken out after it emerged one council department had not even bothered to speak to another. The unsightly corral cluster for five bins was secured in place near The Cross in Troon without any consultation. Troon Councillors have now become aware after a multitude of complaints. The cleansing department is claiming they contacted the planning department about the placing of the bins. But planners are denying any knowledge of a consultation. Troon SNP Councillor Craig Mackay is now leading the charge to find somewhere  for the bins to be situated, rather than outside the Jade Garden Chinese and Macintyre’s bar. He is asking for officials to meet councillors at the spot in Templehill to try and find a resolution. Councillor Mackay said: “We are trying to develop a coherent vision for our town centre. “I’m not convinced this is the best we can manage for such a high profile location. Cleansing regrettably installed these enclosures without any prior consultation. While it is arguably an operational matter that doesn’t require any such input,they had asked any of the councillors or the community council for comment then I am certain we would not have found ourselves in this situation. “The council’s Planning service disappointingly also appear not to have been consulted on the siting or design of this bin store within the conservation area. I don’t wish to play departments off against each other, but would seek to find a community consensus about what is appropriate for our public realm. “This will almost certainly involve an alternative solution for the bins.” A council spokesman confirmed they are investigating, saying: ““We introduced communal bins to keep the litter secure and away from gulls. The early indications are that this system is working well, however we are currently reviewing the location of the bins.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnScottish National PartyTroonAyrAyr News"},{"url":null,"title":"look out sooty sweep heading","story":"NewsLook out, Sooty and Sweep are heading to AyrStage show insists laughs will come thick and fast at Ayr GaietyShareByStephen Houston:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR News \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailSooty is set to SWEEP into Ayr next month.

He has a levitating sausage, which certainly creates a vision. Special guests circus star Michael Jordan and the ultraviolet specialties of Fantasie de la Nuit promise a thrilling -minute show. Tickets are between pound and pound and there are two shows – am and .pm. Sooty has celebrated his th birthday and Richard says he’s still as young as ever. Richard revealed: “This show is Sooty doing what he does best – magic. “So the Gaiety audience can expect to be saying ‘Izzy whizzy let’s get busy’ a great deal. “Sooty will be performing some amazing tricks including sawing a lady in half, floating a child from the audience and making it snow. “Sweep will be getting in the way with his own disastrous magic tricks most of which revolve around sausages.” He added: “Performing live is what we love most. Of course, making the television show is a lot of fun but Sooty has always been at his best in front of a live audience where he can make not only the children laugh, but all the adults too. Plus after each performance there is a chance for everybody to meet Sooty and it’s always such a pleasure to meet fans old and new.” Sooty and Sweep performed for Prince Charles for his th birthday. Richard added: “I think it was possibly the highlight of Sooty’s career. It was just an amazing experience to be there at the London Palladium at the request of Prince Charles. “It turns out that Sooty and Sweep have always been personal favourites of the Prince. We also received a lovely personal letter saying how much he had enjoyed Sooty and Sweep’s performance.

If we did not encourage change, we would still be living in caves.Mr Howardrsquos arguments have not swayed principal planning officer Carlos Clarke as he recommends that councillors reject the application and force him to cease trading from the premises.He writes: ldquoAspects of the development are acceptable, subject to conditions, particularly to rationalise the number and appearance of the ious small structures proposed.ldquoHowever, the joinerrsquos workshop and retail sales would be contrary to the local development plan, and this conflict is not overridden by other considerations.ldquoAs these elements form a signicant part of the development proposal, it would not be appropriate to delete them from a prospective consent by condition.ldquoUltimately, therefore, the application should be refused because of the proposed retail and joinerrsquos workshoprsquos conflicts with council planning policy.The proposed joinerrsquos workshop would be contrary to the local development plan in that there is inadequate justication for the proposed use on this site, which is not located within an allocated employment, mixed-use or redevelopment area, and would be potentially detrimental to the character and amenity of the surrounding area.ldquoThe proposed retail use would also be contrary to the local development plan in that the site is not within the town centre and it is not been demonstrated that there are no sequentially preferable sites closer to or within the town centre or that the proposed development would not detract from the vitality and viability of the town centre, and because the visual impact of the retail use proposed would be detrimental to the character of the surrounding area.ldquoOther material considerations do not outweigh this conflict."},{"url":null,"title":"readers-photo","story":"This photo, entitled lsquoRainy Days... rain drops and reflectionsrsquo was posted by BorderCamera Club member Hazel Dunbar.

This was his first goal for the Pupils and just reward for his perseverance.It was good to see two teenagers making their mark for the club, with Ross Brown joining his academy teammate MacBrayne in a fine first half performance on opposite flanks of midfield.Nevertheless, the home side ‘stole’ into the lead in the st minute, a comic-cut situation that saw Ellis Robertson unbelievably penalised for stumbling over his own heels.The resultant free kick was delivered with venom and a headed deflection thundered into the net to restore the home side’s lead.The setback was short-lived as almost immediately the in-form Donald McCallum cut inside past two defenders to drive the ball high into the roof of the net for a superb equaliser.This heralded the Pupils# best spell of the match, with Ross Brown ending a great move with a volley that left the keeper rooted to the spot.But the goal, arguably the best of the match, was ruled out for offside.Ryan McConnachie was next to try his luck with an audacious overhead kick that just cleared the bar.Lady luck deserted the cause when the referee awarded a soft penalty kick to home club.The visitors were a goal behind despite dominating most of the second half.With  minutes remaining the league leaders looked to have sealed the points when a tactical long throw was forced home to give ‘the Port’ a two goal advantage.However, in an exciting end to another close fought match, Lee Allen scored a towering header from a Donald McCallum corner to make the score -.Despite a great effort in the closing minutes, the Pupils couldn’t score to get their just reward.Having played well and given everything, the visitors ed home with nothing to show for their efforts.TomorrowCampbeltown Pupilsto home action with another dficult match against third-placed Hillington at Kintyre Park with a pm kick off.  See social media and posters for confirmation of venue.Fraser MacBrayne in action earlier this season at Kintyre Park. _cpupils"},{"url":null,"title":"letter 1949 play about europe","story":"Courier readers may be as amused as I was to discover at the commemorative exhibition in Aqualibrium that the winner of the first Kintyre Drama Festival, back in , was Highland Church Drama Club.The club won with a play entitled #Sad about Europe#.

After his first two space launch attempts ended in failure, it is no surprise that Elon Musk#s SpaceX recently took a dummy to the International Space Station.Solo ocean crossings in a sailing boat are another example of a sport that seems too risky to many.Free Solo tells of Honnold#s perfectionism but ultimately he relies on  practice, friction, magnesium carbonate chalk for his sweaty palms and his wits.Throughout the ascent, and the preamble which leads to it, including romance and his girlfriend#s struggle #to understand#, Honnold is filmed by his friends, some of whom cannot bear to watch the final solo.Extreme solo feats have existed as long as humans. The marathon developed in Ancient Greece as a solo running challenge and people still die in the st century emulating those barefoot warriors.Climbing and mountaineering has a long history of solo risk taking and many of its protagonists live relatively short lives.Some though, such as legendary Italian Walter Bonatti, were hard wired for solitary ascents. He shot to fame in the s with a solo ascent of a climb on the Dru, renamed the Bonatti Pillar, in the French alps.Bonatti finished his hard climbing career in  with a solo in winter of the north face of the Matterhorn for the centenary of that mountain#s first attempt. He passed away, aged , in bed.Up till Free Solo, many films about climbing have only been of real interest to climbers and have not made it into mainstream cinema.Using the latest techniques including drones, remote cameras, huge telephoto lenses on digital cameras from the valley floor and cameras wielded by dangling climbers has created a National Geographic movie which has transfixed audiences.Even climbers emerge after an-hour-and-a-half with sweaty palms after the glimpse into Honnold#s seemingly nihilistic world.A still of Alex Honnold during his climb.

sweeping changes to targets including on AE, cancer and planned operations.At present, patients are expected to be seen and treated, discharged or admitted to hospital, within four hours at AE.Under the new plans, those patients in England with the most serious conditions such as heart attacks, strokes and sepsis, would receive rapid treatment within an hour, while people with more minor conditions could expect to wait longer.Data would be published on how long patients spend on average in AE.Other changes mean the current -week target for people to start planned treatment, such as hip operations, could also be replaced by one measuring the average time it takes to start treatment.The proportion of people waiting more than  weeks for treatment is currently at its highest level for a decade.On AE, the existing four-hour target has not been met since July  and some experts say it is unlikely the NHS could ever hit it again.Figures for January showed that AE waiting times in England reached their worst level since records began.Just .% of patients were treated or admitted in four hours, against a % target, meaningnearly , patients waited longer than they should.The data also showed that , people in January endured very long waits, often called trolley waits, to be admitted to hospital.Under the new plans, patients would receive an assessment by a medical professional when they walk through the door of AE, and cases would then be prioritised according to the level of urgency.NHS England has long said that the current four-hour AE target is outdated, with data suggesting hospitals are being driven to hit the target.About a fth of all emergency admissions from AE happen in the final  minutes before the four-hour deadline.On cancer, the two-week wait to see a cancer specialist could be scrapped and replaced with a target that says people must receive a diagnosis within  days of first being referred by their GP.Four other -day cancer targets, which mark the time from diagnosis to first treatment for all cancers, would also be replaced by a single -day target.This would mark  days from a decision to treat to a person to them receiving their first treatment.Patients would also start their first treatment for cancer within  daysfollowing an urgent GP referral for suspected cancer.People who arrive at AE experiencing a mental health crisis will also receive emergency care within one hour.Professor Stephen Powis, national medical director of NHS England and leader of the review of targets, said: ldquoThe NHS is aiming to improve care for patients and save hundreds of thousands more lives over the coming years, with greater access to mental health support, better treatment for the major killer conditions and services which are more joined up, personalised and closer to home.ldquoSo, as we build an NHS that is fit for the future, now is the right time to look again at the old targets which have such a big influence on how care is delivered, to make sure that they take account of the latest treatments and techniques, and support, not hinder, staff to deliver the kind of responsive, high-quality services that people want to see.Professor Ted Baker, chief inspector of hospitals for the Care Quality Commission, said: ldquoEmergency departments need a set of standards which gives priority to patients with le-threatening conditions, ensures people get care in a timely way, and puts pressure on the whole hospital to end long corridor waits for those who need admitting.The Royal College of Emergency Medicinesaid that ldquorather than scrapping the four-hour access standard, it should be supported by a series of complementary metrics that help understanding of the causes of long waits and crowding in emergency departments.President Dr Taj Hassan said the College was ldquokeen to ensure that any changes are not imposed due to political will but are developed responsibly, collaboratively and are based upon clinical expert consensus in the best interests of patients.Dr Nick Scriven, president of the Society for Acute Medicine, said the organisation had been calling for change since .ldquoThe review of the target is an opportunity to focus on a range of patient outcomes and quality standards to measure pressures and take effective action earlier ndash a lack of wide-ranging information heaps further pressure on already-stretched hospitals, he said.Nuffield Trust chief executive Nigel Edwards said: ldquoNHS targets never work as expected in the real world, so the idea of testing out new proposals and carefully monitoring the effect on patients is a big improvement on the usual directive approach.ldquoI agree that the AE target is overdue a check-up: it has started rewarding the wrong behaviours, like moving patients just to stop the clock.ldquoThe new target to treat patients with a mental health crisis within an hour at AE sends exactly the right message about the urgency called for in those situations.ldquoGiven the history of targets having unintended consequences, we will need to watch closely as these trials go ahead, looking at the actual effect on peoplersquos health as well as access to care.ldquoThere is a risk that getting rid of the -week limit on waits for planned procedures could mean the proportion of people going without care for an unacceptably long time drts upwards.ldquoAnd we need to be hard-headed about how much dference fine tuning targets will make ndash the root causes of poor performance lie in a lack of staff and capacity, which we have barely started solving.Baroness Delyth Morgan, chief executive of Breast Cancer Now, said: ldquoThe current lsquotwo-week waitrsquo for breast cancer has been hugely successful in transforming the experiences of people referred to a specialist to investigate their symptoms.ldquoWith these proposals representing a sht to instead give reassurance of a -day wait for diagnosis, itrsquos vital we ensure they will further improve patient experience and build on years of progress.ldquoBeing referred with breast symptoms can be an incredibly worrying time for thousands of women and their families, and itrsquos critical that they are given answers and can begin treatment or be given peace of mind as soon as possible.Dame Donna Kinnair, acting chief executive of the Royal College of Nursing, said: ldquoMoves to give cancer patients a diagnosis within  days are a welcome step forward, and all nurses, not just those working in mental health, will support the plan to provide emergency care within an hour to people who go to AE with a mental health crisis.ldquoHowever, itrsquos hard to see exactly how it will be possible to meet these new more stringent standards without more staff ndash or they would already be taking these sensible measures.ldquoWe will need accurate and honest feedback from the pilots to ascertain whether it is possible to roll out these measures nationally with the huge workforce gaps we currently have."},{"url":null,"title":"queen-leads-nation-to-mark-commonwealth-day","story":"With her family gathered around her, the Queen joined the

They achieved two platinum albums and seven top ten hits, blazing a trail through the music industry of the early Noughties.She was all set to become a PE teacher, however, before Mis-Teeq came along.ldquoI had such affection for performing at school ndash I always felt like I was my best self when I was up on stage in the plays, or singing or dancing, she says.ldquoAnd yet, in my pragmatic head, I thought it couldnrsquot possibly be my career, so I set myself what I thought were more realistic goals.ldquoI knew and understood the path to becoming a PE teacher ndash I had no idea what path you took to become a singer. I didnrsquot want to be some airy fairy person, running around wanting to be a pop star.ldquoI was on my way to Loughborough University when I met a woman who had her own production company, who was looking for developing artists and I got talking to her. Suddenly it felt like the music industry might not be on planet Mars, maybe it was something I could get into.She pauses. ldquoThat was the thing, see  I think deep down in my heart I knew I always wanted to be a singer, I just didnrsquot know how to get there, she says. ldquoI lived in a small town, I didnrsquot have any connections whatsoever with that world so it seemed like something to look on and admire from afar, but not actually be part of.ldquoAnd yet ndash at college, there was an instinct in me, a niggle that made me think I should be doing something dferent. I never ignore that niggle.She adds, laughing: ldquoTherersquos a le lesson in there ndash never ignore your gut instinct.When she looks back at the years she spent in Mis-Teeq, Dixon says it feels ldquotoo good to be true.ldquoI was in a girl band, we had hits and awards and travelled the world ndash Irsquod never been on an aeroplane before Mis-Teeq, she marvels. ldquoWe did everything. On paper it shouldnrsquot have worked. But it did and it changed my le.ldquoIt made me believe. Even now, when I look back, I think ndashthatrsquos what I achieved when I had nothing, then imagine what I can achieve now ldquoI was so happy in Mis-Teeq. I wouldnrsquot be here, writing books, judging on BGT, doing Strictly,it hadnrsquot been for the girls. I owe everything to them.Dixon admits there were times when the group considered giving up.Who are Scotlands funniest  people ldquoWe were broke, she says, simply. ldquoFor four years, we had no money. We had walked away from college courses and university places to join a girl band, and what was our plan B  Was there ever a back-up  I honestly donrsquot think so. It was ludicrous. I think we were so in the moment, so caught up in what we wanted to do, that there was just no option other than it working.ldquoBut my mum always says to me,you wake up every day and it feels right and you are happy, then trust your instinct and do it. And maybe itrsquos because we were so headstrong and focussed that we didnrsquot give up.ldquoPeople try to put you in a box or dismiss you, but what we achieved proves thatyou work hard,you are authentic, then eventhe odds are against you it doesnrsquot mean you canrsquot succeed.The group split in .ldquoThe end of Mis-Teeq felt like the end of a marriage, says Dixon. ldquoIt was amicable, a joint decision, but there was still heartache and a lot of tears.ldquoThings had come to a natural end and we decided to go our separate ways. It was a walk into the unknown ndash and then, I had the dream scenario.Dixon was offered a lucrative deal with Polydor, and she spent  months writing and recording her solo debut album, Fired Up, alongside producers like Richard X, Brian Higgins, Estelle and Paul Epworth. But her joy evaporated when in November , Dixon was dropped by the label just as her one-year-old marriage to rapper MC Harvey collapsed, following revelations he had had an affair with singer Javine Hylton.ldquoIrsquod spent  months working on my solo album, putting all my eggs in one basket and they dropped me, says Dixon. ldquoI was left fumbling in the dark. I lost everything.She adds: ldquoWhen I finally stopped feeling sorry for myself, I realised I had to come up with a new plan. I made some calls, sent some emails.One of those calls was to Charlotte Oates, celebrity producer and talent scout for Strictly Come Dancing.ldquoA lot of people were a bit snobby about reality shows, but I loved Strictly and I told Charlotte Irsquod love to do itI could, she recalls.Dixon signed up for the fth series of Strictly in , partnered with professional dancer Matthew Cutler. She quickly became the favourite and beat actor Matt Di Angelo and Flavia Cacace in the final to win the glitterball trophy.ldquoIt was lovely, she sighs. ldquoIf I ever watch the dances back, it brings up so many emotions and Irsquom in floods of tears. It felt transformational, that show. I got a lot of love and support when I won Strictly and it made me feel, actually, that things were going to be okay after all. Strictly saved me.After a spell as a judge on the dance show, Dixon switched seats to Britainrsquos Got Talent, where she currently resides alongside Simon Cowell, Amanda Holden and David Walliams. She has hosted many TV shows, including Alesharsquos Street Dance Stars on CBBC, Children in Need and ITVrsquos Dance, Dance, Dance.Her third book, Secret Supervillain vs Lightning Girl, will be published on March . It is the latest adventure of Aurora Beam, a little girl who discovers she is descended from a long line of superheroes.Dixon has written the books in collaboration with The It Girl author Katy Birchall.ldquoIrsquom really grateful to Katy and the team at Scholastic, they have really helped me bring all of my characters and ideas to le, she says.ldquoIrsquove always loved the idea of writing something. Irsquom not mad about doing an autobiography, but Irsquod thought something on wellness maybe, or a childrenrsquos book. The inspiration came from wanting my daughter to feel empowered. I wanted to create a positive role model, to say that itrsquos okay to be dferent, itrsquos okay to be me.Shaun Ryder: \"If it hadnt been for music I dont think I would be here.\"ldquoEvery single child deserves to feel included. I want readers to see themselves in Aurora, who is dealing with troubles at home and at school alongside finding she has new superpowers.As a child, Dixon read a lot but says no one character struck a chord with her.ldquoI liked Judy Blume, because she was a bit edgy, she says. ldquoWith Are You There God, Itrsquos Me Margaret, you always kind of felt you shouldnrsquot be reading it, and I loved that.ldquoBut there was no single character I really identied with ndash none that stayed with me, that I could see myself in.She adds: ldquoI donrsquot want my daughter to feel like that. I think things are changing, slowly ndash we live in a time where anything feels possible and it is great that underdogs, people who may have once just been pushed aside or overlooked, finally have a voice.ldquoBut only one per cent of British childrenrsquos books feature a main character who is black or minority ethnic, and statistics like that show there is still a long, long way to go.Finding space and time to write can be tricky, Dixon admits.ldquoDo I hide away for hours and write and write  God no, she laughs. ldquoWith Azura about, not a chance.ldquoI write on aeroplanes, or in the car, or at night in bed when Azura is asleep. Itrsquos the same with songwriting ndash I can never do it in the house, I have to go into the studio and physically put some distance between me and everyday le. I love writing, and I hope I always do it now. But finding a quiet place in my house to do it for hours on end  Never going to happen.Away from her multiple day jobs, Dixon lends her name and time to a range of good causes. She is currently working on a documentary about animals being used for entertainment.ldquoIf you are blessed with a , you should use it wisely, she says, adding emphatically: ldquoElephant rides, tiger selfies ndash itrsquos all just wrong. I feel very passionately about animal protection. My mother educated me. She showed me things that maybe people donrsquot like to look at, because they are afraid to. Irsquom the kind of person who looks, evenit hurts, because I believe knowledge is power. If you see it, you can do something about it.ldquoI canrsquot watch distressing videos, like the ones that come up on social media, and then just go about my day as usual.ldquoI have to act. AndI can do something that makes a few people look dferently at an issue, then job done. Irsquom quite a heart-on-my-sleeve kind of person.Itrsquos why, she thinks, audiences have warmed to her as a judge on shows like Britainrsquos Got Talent, where a string of hopefuls put themselves in the firing line in a bid to become famous.ldquoI never forget itrsquos a human being standing in front of me, she says. ldquoI always try to have a connection with that person ndash this is someone who is putting themselves out there, taking a step and we are all dferent and we all have our stories and experiences.ldquoYou shouldnrsquot forget that in the heat of making a television programme.ALESHArsquoS TRIUMPHSMIS-TEEQ: As part of Mis-Teeq, alongside Sabrina Washington and Su-Elise Nash, Alesha Dixon achieved two platinum albums and seven top ten hits, a Mobo award and a Brit nomination.SOLO CAREER: Alesha is the singer and author of nine top  singles and three platinum albums.

A majority of all main partiesrsquo supporters backed an elected second chamber.The Bryan paper that kicks off Labours review of its constitutional policy is set to take the party much closer to backing full federalism and a new constitutional settlement for the UK \"based on the commitment to redistribute power and wealth, and that takes account of the consequences of Brexit\".In her analysis of future principles, she says a new federal set-up will \"move from the existing model, where power is devolved from the central state to Scotland\".Baroness Bryan, who is the designated lead for updating the partyrsquos policy on federalism and Lords reform says the lsquopartnershiprsquo model for Westminster and Scotland would be backed by the reformed second chamber.The peer adds: \"The point is to change the relationship so that the Scottish Parliament is no longer subordinate to Westminster. A second chamber of the Regions and Nations would change the nature of the relations to shared government on the cross territorial issues.\"UK-wide, ldquoInstead of the House of Commons having automatic primacy, this would be a new settlement of shared sovereignty, Baroness Bryan says.She believes a reformed ndash most-likely directly elected ndash second chamber would have a key role in this, bringing the nations and regions together to agree what powers should be devolved and which should be shared.Willie Sullivan, director of ERS Scotland, said: ldquoThe piecemeal, ad hoc approach to democratic change in the UK has held us back, with a constant, low-level constitutional crisis: with Scotland and the other nations pitted against Westminster, and vice versa.\"That is not a sustainable relationship and it is time for an approach the puts citizens at the centre, not the needs of politicians. What form this reform takes is up for discussion, but it is good to see parties considering this in the round.ldquoAs this briefing points out, the primary way to reform the bloated, unelected House of Lords is to replace it with a fairly-elected revising chamber, with a clearly defined remit and which can speak up for the nations and regions of the whole UK.\"Voters are tired of seeing scandal after scandal in the Lords with no way of kicking them out. A much-smaller, more effective second chamber would help draw to a close the era of unaccountable power and bring our democracy into the st century.Bryans other key claims include concerns that the Scottish Parliament has gained additional powers in response to political pressures, which can be \"curtailed as easily as they were granted\".She says that while the Sewel convention established that Westminster would not legislate on devolved issues without the express consent of the Scottish Parliament, \"we have seen from the repatriation of powers through Brexit that this may not always be adhered to\".She also states that local government in Scotland has lost powers to increasing centralisation by the Scottish Government.Nancy Platts, co-ordinator of Politics for the Many ndash the trade union campaign for political reform ndash said: ldquoThis is a fundamental step [forward] in developing Labourrsquos thinking on constitutional reform. Labour must now adopt these proposals as the starting point to ensuring that our politics works for the many, not an unelected few.The report will be unveiled at a Labour fringe meeting titled: \"Remaking the state: Transforming Scotland for Worker and Citizen Power\".Mass poll by BMG for ERS.

All we did was occasionally call each other some names on Twitter. The idea that Scottish people are shocked by a few swear words is laughable.Meanwhile, the documentary also revealed the anguish of Salmondrsquos key advisers after they watched their boss perform badly in the first debate with Darling.Salmond was expected to win the debate, but he noseed after focusing on what he regarded as Unionist scare stories about outer space and Scots having to drive on the right hand side of the road.Geoff Aberdein, who was Salmondrsquos chief of staff, said he was ldquodevastated by the performance: ldquoI walked into an adjacent auditoriumhellip.and just put my head in my hands for a good forty minutes.Kevin Pringle, who was Salmondrsquos trusted spin doctor, added: ldquoIt just didnrsquot really work terribly well.Salmond, in his own interview, admitted making a ldquomistake, adding: ldquoItrsquos like having a great idea last thing at night.

It was a family one for more than  years, but the ice cream war between brothers Aldo and Peter Nardini, feuding over the business and its direction, led to court cases, bitter accusations of treachery, plummeting fortunes and the shutters finally going up on the place, the familyrsquos heritage sadly melting away. Aldo Nardini died in , his brother Peter, the previous year. They had never properly reconciled.Only the name remained when Guiseppe lsquoSeprsquo Mirini and David Equi took the business out of receivership, revamped the interior and reopened after four years. Now they, too, have split, although itrsquos not about ldquoice cream dferences, it is stressed, but pursuing their separate businesses. Mirini owns the Tony Macaroni chain, Equi the eponymous Hamilton-based ice cream company.The two were joint owners of Nardinirsquos, but Mirini is now sole shareholder through his company Italgelat, although Equi remains a director. A spokesperson for Mirini stressed that the parting was perfectly amicable and that the two men remain good friends. Equi is in America and out of contact.Nardinirsquos has its roots in the Tuscan town of Barga, where so many emigrants to Scotland come from. In , Pietro Nardini arrived in Scotland with his family. After years of peddling round the country selling from a suitcase, he saved enough to open, in , the Largs cafeacute.It served food, too, but it was the ice cream created there from a secret family recipe which put the place on the map.Nardinirsquos heyday was in the s and early s when hordes of Glaswegians and others from further afield, in flat caps and best dresses, would go lsquodoon the watterrsquo, by train or ferry, to queue for a seat and taste the award-winning ice cream. What started as a humble cafeacute grew into a large space, an ice cream factory and a restaurant. Each weekend it would serve , gallons of ice cream, five tonnes of potatoes and  stone of haddock to holidaymakers.In the s, when cheap package holidays took off, the slide began. It was now being run by Pietrorsquos grandsons, Aldo and Peter, and they struggled to keep the business in the black.The two brothers could hardly have been more dferent. Aldo was tall, handsome and fit ndash the local paper dubbing him ldquothe Sean Connery of Largs ndash whereas Peter was shorter, a heavy smoker with a heart condition.In , they hired a non-family member, a friend of Peterrsquos, to turn round the ailing company, but it soon became clear that there were familial dferences over the appointment. David Hendry was a local businessman, who had built a fortune from a chain of funeral parlours and, to the brothers, at that time, he seemed to be the only hope to stop the family firm spiralling into bankruptcy.Three cousins, and fellow board members with the Nardini name, started legal moves to stop the appointment, but in what was the first of the internecine battles they failed and were quickly purged.The Hendry regime was initially successful and the business seemed to have turned the corner until the brothers fell out over future direction. The plan, resisted by Aldo, was to franchise the Nardini name to  cafeacutes and challenge new brands like Haumlagen-Dazs and Ben  Jerryrsquos, by selling Nardini ice cream through supermarkets.Aldo was implacably opposed. He said that while the firm wouldnrsquot make the profits of yesteryear ldquoit was still a good businessyou retained the family presence. The dference split the brothers. Peter owned  per cent of Nardinirsquos andAldo wasnrsquot coming with it, then he was going. In May  Aldo was removed from the board. He said that he was deeply shocked when his brother lted his hand to vote against him.Aldo set up his own business, Il Caffe Casa, but the family fallout took another corrosive turn which ended in the two brothers facing each other in court. Peter accused his brotherrsquos company of misleading customers into believing they were eating Nardinirsquos ice cream from Largs. The sherf ruled for Aldo but the ide was now unbridgeable.Aldorsquos daughter, the actress Daniela Nardini, stood by his side, fiercely and vocally loyal. She said: ldquoI would quite like to throw a stone through the window [of Nardinirsquos]hellipThe business has been taken over. It is just our name and our reputation.In , with debts of pound. million, Nardinirsquos went into receivership. Aldo revealed his sorrow.ldquoI am absolutely heartbroken. I said when David Hendry was brought into the company that running a funeral parlour was dferent to running an ice cream parlour. Sadly I am right. I have had no control over the company in recent years, as I had just a small share. The company is worth nothing ndash so I have lost nothing. But my children have lost what they should have inherited my grandfatherrsquos heart would break.The Nardinirsquos had lost control of their empire and only the name would survive . In , Marini and Equi formed a consortium to bring the cafeacute back and after four years, along with a pound.m refit of the listed building under the eye of Scottish Natural Heritage, Nardinirsquos reopened.The two partners opened another Nardinirsquos in Glasgowrsquos Byres road but a fortnight ago a lsquoto letrsquo sign was slapped on the window and a poster promising a refurbishment was removed. It had closed its doors just after Christmas, promising to reopen in the spring.The company had been embroiled in a planning dispute with the city council over change of use. A retrospective application for a cafeacute was rejected last year. The outlet had seemed to be popular, with queues out of the door in summer, but when it went down the blame was put on high rents.In recent years, the chain had also opened Nardinirsquos premises in Edinburgh and St Andrews as part of the firmrsquos expansion plans, but they have also since closed.This month a Nardini trading company in which Marini and Equi were directors , NOL Realisations ndash formerly Nardinirsquos of Largs ndash went into liquidation. According to liquidator Ian Wright there were no assets, only stock and cash. Lenders to the company ndash including the Bank of Scotland and the Royal Bank ndash as principal creditors, are unlikely to receive much of the loans they made.Nardinirsquos of Largs in now a branch of the Tony Macaroni empire, Viva Italia. Sep Marini, now the sole owner of the business, promised ldquoitrsquos business as usual for the restaurant in Largs going forward.Business, for Nardinirsquos in the past, has been anything but usual. Who would risk predicting the next turn in the ice cream saga ITrsquoS a -minute sail from Largs to Cumbrae, a mile away across the Clyde, and from one of the window tables inside the cafeacute you can watch the CalMac ferry the Loch Shira come and go, while the waitresses, in black aprons, skirt or trousers and white shirts, ply you with coffee, scones or, of course, ice cream.When the actress Daniela Nardini was still a child she scooped ice cream for her dad Aldo in the cafeacute foyer. Although there was a major refit when Sep Mirini and David Equi took over, it remains true to the style of the old deacutecor, one that Daniela would recognise, although she probably hasnrsquot been inside since her father lost the business in the bitter dispute with his brother Peter. What has changed is the Italian restaurant specialising in pizzas, the Tony Macaroni addition, at a right angle to the frontage along Nelson Street.The cafeacute is still bustling,nothing like the fties, middle-aged women sit around sipping their morning coffee, in a space which can cater for , the light from the panoramic windows facing the water reflected off the mirrored glass over the bar area and onto the cutlery and the monogrammed cups and saucers. If you turn your head away from the quay view, a large, metal statue of a stocky Viking dominates, with his eyes focused on the inside of the cafeacute. It marks the Battle of Largs in , the last one between the kingdoms of Scotland and Norway.In , when Aldo was still at primary school, Prime Minister Winston Churchill, General Dwight Eisenhower, later to become US President, and Lord Mountbatten were spotted coming and going at the nearby Hollywood Hotel, which had been taken over by the military. They were holding secret meetings to plan the D-Day invasion of Normandy. Legend has it, whether true or not, that they ordered takeaway ice creams from Nardinirsquos.When Nardinirsquos opened in  a bandstand was included, with a six-piece orchestra playing from it and a male crooner moved around the tables serenading the girls.

Less generous pension schemes have to stretch further as people are living for longer post-retirement.ldquoAuto-enrolment is welcome, but will not solve the basic problem of low levels of pension saving.ldquoWe would urge everyone to seek free, impartial and confidential advice from their local Citizens Advice Bureau, so they can make informed choices and plan effectively for their retirement.Mr Holmyard added that CAS is also becoming more aware of people dipping into their pension pots while working as a result of falling into debt.ldquoOur advisers are also increasingly hearing from people who are considering accessing their pension funds to solve debt problems, at the expense of their retirement income, which of course brings the risk of long-term financial problems, he said.Age Scotland argued that Scots should be offered a ldquocareer MOT at age  to allow them to ldquomake informed choices about training, pensions provision and future career options.Brian Sloan, chief executive of the charity, said: ldquoRight now more than half of older people age  and over have not retired because they arenrsquot ready to stop working.ldquoHowever, itrsquos worrying to hear that more than six out of  Scots donrsquot think their state pension will financially support them through retirement and that more than half do not have any plans to financially support themselves through retirement.ldquoTherersquos a clear need for more guidance to help people plan ahead for their working le and retirement.Mr Sloan added that the number of older workers is increasing faster in Scotland than the rest of the UK and called for employers to do more to support them.ldquoIt makes sense to invest in older workers, who bring a wealth of experience and skills and can provide valuable mentoring to younger generations, he said.The new full state pension is currently pound. per week, however the actual amount you get depends on your national insurance record.Under current UK Government plans, the state pension age will eventually extend to  for both men and women.However, the Censuswide survey showed that  per cent of Scots believe it will continue to increase beyond this.The data also revealed that more than a quarter of Scots do not have a private pension, with this breaking down into  per cent of men, compared to  per cent of women.Of those Scots who do have plans in place to support themselves financially in retirement, the majority plan to use savings to fund their lestyle, while others plan to sell their homes or other assets.Jordan Ferguson, of Censuswide Scotland, said: ldquoOur research indicates that Scots, of all ages, have growing number of concerns about their retirement.ldquoThe younger respondents polled seemed apprehensive that retirement age would continue to increase.ldquoWhile older respondents raised a number issues around financing their retirement."},{"url":null,"title":"john-mcdonnell-independent-group-of-mps-have-become-completely-irrelevant","story":"John McDonnell branded the decision of eight of his partyrsquos MPs to leave and form The Independent Groupldquoabsolutely bizarre, and warned any support for them risked handing power to the Tories.It came as he announced a Labour Government would create , new jobs in Scotland as part of a ldquogreen industrial revolution which would see hundreds of wind turbines constructed north of the Border.Addressing a fringe meeting at the Scottish Labour conference in Dundee, Mr McDonnell said he was ldquodisappointed and to a certain extent perplexed that Labour MPs had left the party for TIG, which is made up of  pro-Remain MPs.:John McDonnell says Labour is preparing for GovernmentHe said one of the main reasons they gave was Labourrsquos failure to support a Peoplersquos Vote.

When he died in , John Buchan was given a state funeral and was revered as a novelist, scholar, politician, publisher, war correspondent and imperial proconsul, but, as with many other great Victorian figures, there has since been a reassessment. Was Buchan just a ldquoScotsman on the make out to use his connections to get on  Was he anti-Semitic  Was he racist  His granddaughter Ursula Buchan has set out to give her answers to those questions in a new biography Beyond The  Steps and, as the title suggests, she also wants to remind us there was more to John Buchan than his most famous book.One of the most surprising episodes in the new biography is Buchanrsquos experiences in the Gorbals as a child. If we think of Buchan, we probably think of him as a slightly grand Victorian figure, but his childhood was anything but. His father was a minister at the John Knox Free Church in the Gorbals and John went to school in the area, at Hutchesonrsquos on Crown Street, where he came to know the population and their problems. Many years later, he featured a gang of Gorbals schoolkids, the Diehards, in one of his novels, Huntingtower, and Ursula Buchan is convinced his time in Glasgowrsquos most notorious slum had a profound effect on him.ldquoIt had a huge influence, she says. ldquoThough Huntingtower, which is the first book where the Gorbals Diehards appear, doesnrsquot come out until the s, hersquos remembering his walking through the Gorbals to school every day. And, also, when he went to Glasgow University, he walked everywhere so this was the Glasgow he knew and of course because his father was a minister in the Gorbals, he was brought up knowing about what it was like to be poor and I think that was huge for him. He never forgot it and it was one of the reasons he could get on with anybody ndash he could walk with kings but never lost the common touch.The other extraordinary thing about Buchanrsquos time at Glasgow University, and then Oxford, was his capacity for work ndash something that never left him. He was studying for a classics degree, but he was also writing short stories, articles for The Glasgow Herald about what it was like to be a student, and a history of Brasenose College. A journalist at the time noticed Buchan and called him a ldquomiracle of precocity. Mind you, the journalist also said that there was no sign that he would ever do much in fiction.Read more: the men and women of Scotland who made a stand against warTo be fair, that was pretty much true until The  Steps was published in  when Buchan was . It was an immediate success and even now,  years on, you can see why: Hannay is hugely likeable, the prose is pacey, and Ursula Buchan believes the modern novel of espionage would not have developed along the same lines without it. Certainly, both Graham Greene and Ian Fleming acknowledged their debt to him.However, Ursula Buchan does get slightly frustrated that the story of her grandfather has become pretty much all about The  Steps. ldquoThatrsquos why I called my book Beyond the  Steps, she says. ldquoI knew I had to have it in there somewhere but he wrote that book in six weeks when he was ill to amuse himself because hersquod run out of thrillers. He never made any literary claims for it, but he realised he could make some money.Ursula Buchan believes her grandfatherrsquos real legacy lies in the fact that he lived a good and useful le and says she has tried her best to emulate it in her own work as a gardening journalist and writer. But just look at the list of what he did and you can see how hard that would be: he wrote more than  books, he was an MP, he was a publisher in Edinburgh, he was Governor General of Canada, he worked as a journalist during the First World War and wrote a -volume history of it. He also worked as an administrator in South Africa on improving the conditions in the concentration camps that had been set up by the British Army to accommodate Boer prisoners. The conditions at the time were a scandal and Buchan managed to get the death rate down by improving sanitation and water supplies.ldquoPeople donrsquot understand that the concentration camp in South Africa is not the same as an extermination camp in Germany, says Ursula Buchan, ldquobut they werenrsquot nice places and when the civil authorities took them away from Kitchener and the military, they were absolutely horried by the death toll. The army werenrsquot, I donrsquot think, actively cruel but itrsquos not what armies do ndash they donrsquot know how to look after civilian populations.ldquoBy the time John Buchan got there in October , there was already deep disquiet in Britain. That was what impelled them to turn it over to the civilian authorities and really try and do something. And they did. Within six months they had cut the death toll substantially and the protests in Britain died down.Ursula Buchan says her grandfatherrsquos approach to the camps was typical of his pragmatic views. ldquoHe was not a jingoist, she says, ldquoand he worried the Empire,clever energetic and public-spirited people didnrsquot continue to be involved with it, would decline to the detriment of everybody. In some ways, he was very much ahead of his time.Read more: The  Steps PlanIn other, more controversial ways of course, he was very much of his time and Ursula Buchan acknowledges this of her ancestor: his occasional use of the n-word, for example, or his use of language, mainly in The  Steps and the other Hannay books, that would now be considered anti-Semitic. His granddaughter points out that there are favourable depictions of Jews where in Buchanrsquos work he also supported the Balfour Declaration and in , less than three months after Hitler came to power, he was one of only  MPs who signed a motion deploring the treatment of Jews in Germany.ldquoThose were dferent days, says Ursula Buchan, ldquoand we have to be very careful about wagging a disapproving finger becausewe do that, we donrsquot allow ourselves to understand people in earlier times. We put a distance between them and us ndash lsquothey use the n word, theyrsquore deplorable, Irsquom not going to connect with these peoplersquo. Itrsquos very interesting that nobody criticised him at the time because everybody was using the same language ndash they generalised about peoples and races in a way that wersquore very much more reticent about.Ursula Buchan also has a warning for Scottish Nationalists who might seek to claim John Buchan as one of them, based mostly on his famous statement ldquoevery Scotsman should be a Scottish nationalist. In fact, Buchan was a ldquounionist nationalist who supported Scotlandrsquos place in the British union and Ursula Buchan is clear about where his loyalties lay. ldquoI donrsquot think he would have supported the modern Scottish Nationalist Party, she says firmly.As for Buchanrsquos Scottish background, his granddaughter says it is the key to understanding him and that the memory of his minister father with his poor, shabby congregation scattered round inner Glasgow influenced him hugely and drove him to push himself. Ursula also laughs about him being a hard act to follow. She never met her grandfather but having him as a relative, she says, meant writing was always considered a good and worthy thing to do.Ultimately, she would like to encourage people to read some of her grandfatherrsquos lesser-known works and find some of the gems embedded there. Such as this one about the fragility of civilisation: ldquoThere is a narrow line between the warm room and the savage out-of-doors hellip You call it miles of rampart I call the ision a line, a thread, a sheet of glass.And this one about his fears for the consequences of scientic development. Everybody in the future will be comfortable, he said, but easily distracted. ldquoTheir shallow minds would be easily bored, he said, ldquotherefore unstable. Their le would be largely a quest for amusement. In other words, John Buchan predicted the effects of the internet. It seems there was no end to his genius.Ursula Buchan is appearing at Aye Write at the Mitchell Library in Glasgow on March  at .pm. See ayewrite for more details.

It is therefore unsurprising that barn owls in the north of Scotland have a hard time during the winter months, with peak mortality rates being between December and March due to starvation.As temperatures start to drop in winter, small mammals become less active, meaning a lot less food is available for barn owls, and they need to work extra-hard to find it. This often results in the owls being forced to feed during daylight, even though they are naturally nocturnal hunters.This lack of food is particularly dangerous for barn owls as they are poorly insulated and need more food in winter to provide them with enough energy to stay warm.The Barn Owl Trust estimates that between  and  barn owls are killed each year on UK roads.RSPB Scotland site manager Dave Jones recently sent a deceased barn owl to the Scottish Agricultural College in Thurso for autopsy, when some concerned neighbours reported it after finding it at the roadside.The results of the autopsy showed that the bird was fit and healthy, \"in good shape and hunting successfully\", and that the death followed trauma to its wing and abdomen ndash suggesting that the bird died as a result of being hit by a vehicle.Dave said: \"It is extremely sad to discover that a fit and healthy birds le ended in this way. The barn owls in Caithness really are at the edge of their natural comfort zone and are particularly vulnerable in winter, so it isnt an unusual result, unfortunately. Its not all doom and gloom, though. Although we still find some casualties in this way, our population of barn owls in Caithness has recovered from the particularly poor winters of   and  , and they are considered to be the most northerly population of barn owls in the world.\"While we cant control the weather, there are some things we can do to help. If putting up a nest box, please make sure it isnt placed close to any busy roads. If you see a road casualty and it is safe to do so, please stop and report the find to your local wildle officer and to the Barn Owl Trust. This is helpful in identying accident black spots and monitoring for environmental hazards and poisons, and potential wildle crime.\"Monday  Mar  : PM"},{"url":null,"title":"Businesses in Thurso urged to work together to help develop tourism","story":"BUSINESSES must work together to help develop tourism in Thurso.That was the key message from a meeting attended by more than  people representing ious aspects of the industry, including accommodation, tours, transport and town centre shops.They met on Friday to discuss the Destination Thurso project which is being run by Thurso Community Development Trust .Last year, it conducted a community consultation which found development of tourism in the town was a priority need.The trust has since secured funding from Highland Leader and the Caithness and North Sutherland Fund to run its Destination Thurso project which employs a tourism development officer to oversee a project that will create a website, associated social media, workshops and a tourism development plan.Helen Allan, vice-chairperson of the trust, said: ldquoWe had a strong iety of dferent tourism businesses and organisations attending the meeting.ldquoI think sometimes it might be thought that tourism is only reliant on accommodation providers but that isnrsquot strictly true ndash visitors come into contact with a wide iety of services when coming to our town, from taxi drivers to town centre shops.

He questioned Minister for Public Finance, Kate Forbes MSP, in the Scottish Parliament earlier this afternoon, Wednesday, asking how this shortfall squares with the government’s commitment to the principle of fair funding for our leline internal ferry services.According to the Orkney MSP, the minister responded by saying that the government recognise the challenges in running these ferry services and that they have been clear in their budget that adequate funding is to be delivered.Commenting after the exchange, Mr McArthur said: “We now know that the Scottish Government has cut funding for Orkney’s internal ferry services by £, compared to last year.  This has left a £.m shortfall in the Council’s budget for delivering these leline services.#It is baffling how Ministers think this approach is consistent with their commitment to the principle of fair ferry funding.  It certainly flies in the face of the will of parliament, which voted for the government to deliver on its earlier promises.“Meantime, the island communities that rely on these leline services are left picking up the tab, including a three per cent increase in fares this year.  Ministers may ‘recognise’ the challenges of running these services, but they also must recognise their obligations genuinely to provide adequate funding.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

After all-male representation in the last two parliaments, however, it is good to see that Orkney’s next MSYPs will both be female,“I would also make a plea to all those eligible to vote in these elections to make sure they do so. Voting takes place between March  #  and anyone aged - can cast vote online using their young scot card number.“Meantime, I wish all six candidates the best of luck and hope they enjoy the campaign experience.

It’s interesting because, no matter where I go, these are the three predominant issues, and they are all related.”There are around  EIS members in Orkney.On Monday, EIS members voted to reject a new pay offer.According to Mr Ramsey, the next step will be to hold a ballot on industrial action, although the union remains open to further negotiation.“Assuming that our members decide to vote for a strike, there will be two or three weeks before that goes through,” the vice-president explained.“We intend to continue to negotiate. We realise that teachers don’t want to strike — they do not do this lightly. We have even made a decision not to strike during the SQA exams.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

FACT: Scotland has a mandate to pursue independence.” Ignoring the obvious hood that the SNP is not Scotland and cannot speak for it, it is important to establishthe Scottish people – whom the SNP says are sovereign – have authorised a second referendum in pursuit of independence. It will, after all, be upon the back of any such mandate that denial of the legal process of a Section  order from Westminster will be turned into the mother of all grievances.The chronology for the SNP claim starts six years ago when, in January , David Cameron promised a referendum on EU membershiphe were to command a majority following the  general election. As the Conservatives were in coalition with the Liberal Democrats, the party published in June  a private member’s Bill to emphasise its intentions. It passed its first and second readings in the Commons but was stopped in the House of Lords.When the  Scottish independence referendum came along the following year, there could be no doubt in anyone’s mind that a referendum to leave the EU could take place and that it would be possible for the UK to vote to leave. Nor could there be any doubt that it would be an issue for the UK to decide as the member state – and so Scottish voters might take a dferent view from the rest of the UK electorate.Indeed, so likely was this scenario to become reality that during the independence referendum the Scottish Government warned Scottish voters that remaining in the UK could mean Scotland would leave the EU against their will. It was also clear during that referendum that, were Scots to choose independence, Scotland would leave the EU the same day that it left the UK – which was being suggested by the SNP would take place before the next general election. By the SNP’s own words, it is beyond challenge that the “circumstances” of the  referendum were that the SNP was willing to take Scotland out of the EU as a price for achieving independence, and that, were Scotland to remain in the UK, it might still leave the EU later, irrespective of how Scots voted. Scots voted to stay with the UK.Once the Conservatives’  general election victory arrived, it was announced that the promised referendum would take place in June  and would be a UK-wide decision.Nicola Sturgeon, by then First Minister, had the opportunity to put at the centre of her May  Holyrood election campaign a promise to hold a second independence referendum. Instead she relegated the idea as a priority, burying it on page  with the caveat there would need to be “a signicant and material change in the circumstances that prevailed in , such as Scotland being taken out of the EU against our will”.The Scottish public was by then getting fed-up with Sturgeon’s fixation with holding a second referendum and in May  she lost the SNP’s overall majority. The unionist parties won . per cent of the constituency vote. Together this meanteven her caveat was rejected – she had no moral or legal claim and no public mandate to hold a referendum.The next month the UK voted to leave the EU, but a majority of Scots preferred that the UK should stay. This has been claimed ever since as a “material change” of circumstances that justies the SNP Government demanding the authority to call a second independence referendum. Only it is no such thing.As I have explained above, the possibility of the UK leaving the EU with the majority of Scots opposed was already well known and foreseen the fact that it materialised was not therefore a change – the circumstance had always been there. Furthermore, the SNP had advocated the very same outcome as the price of Scottish independence two years before . The following June, we then had the  general election, by which time Sturgeon had gone on, and on, and on about a second referendum. The result was her party lost . per cent of votes and  MPs. There could be no doubt that with some . per cent of votes going to unionist parties the Scottish public was in no mood for another referendum – be it about Scotland in the UK or the UK in the EU. It is said there is a mandate because the Scottish Parliament passed a motion in favour of being able to hold a referendum, but MSPs voting for their own policies does not make it a mandate from the Scottish people.There is a way round the claims and counter-claims about the existence of a mandate for a second independence referendum. All Sturgeon has to do is go to the country. She can call time on her minority administration and hold fresh parliamentary elections to show once and for all that the Scottish people will not put up with being “dragged” out of the EU. Every party will need to state, for the avoidance of doubt,they will subsequently vote in Holyrood to call a referendum.If Sturgeon is then able to form a new administration, with or without the support of the Greens, she will have an unimpeachable claim that a Section  order to hold a legal referendum should be granted. Westminster would find it dficult to deny one in such circumstances. If Sturgeon is defeated then a new administration could be formed – but without the prospect of a referendum dominating every issue to the detriment of Scotland’s governance.So, what’s it to be, First Minister  Will you put your faith in your fellow Scots to back you ©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"poll scottish independence more popular than theresa may s brexit deal","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Most Scots think independence is a better option than either a Hard Brexit or the deal being offered by Theresa May#s Government, a poll has suggested.The Panelbase survey found that Scots backed independence over No Deal by % to %, while they backed independence over Theresa May’s deal by % to %.The results were published on the same day the prime minister’s spokesman confirmed that a Brexit vote will go ahead in the Commons on Tuesday.Downing Street was unable to say whether MPs would be deciding whether to formally approve Mrs May’s deal with Brussels. : ‘Bolder SNP approach to separate Scots currency needed’SNP Depute Leader Keith Brown said: “Brexit, on any terms, is deeply unpopular in Scotland – and the Tories are running scared of giving Scotland a say in our own future.“The Tories say that Brexit is like hitting an iceberg – and that Scotland has to go down with the ship. It’s time Scotland took its own decisions instead. “The European Union is a market of  million people – eight times the size of the UK alone.

This is a pro-independence, pro-EU march, and while there won’t be the same numbers of people as last year, it’s just as important.”Admitting the march is small scale compared to the one in , Mr Claridge, an actor, said they were inspired to hit the road again after being angered by Nigel Farage’s  mile “March to Leave”.“The man is a charlatan. He wanted Brexit but still sits as an MEP drawing his EU salary,” he said. “It’s time the people of Scotland and our opinions got as much coverage. Scotland voted to Remain, yet Scotland is being ignored again. We are both originally from England but we are Scots and we are Europeans.“We are going to Westminster to add our voices to staying in the EU, but also to demand independence. Were starting out as a pair but we hope to be joined by many others along the way.”Asked about last week’s remarks by deputy SNP leader Keith Brown that “ we want to have a referendum, then we decide we’re going to have a referendum” and the emphatic “no” by Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt to the possibility of a second independence vote, Mr Claridge said: “The Tories have lost all credibility. Everything Theresa May says is contrary to the last thing she said. No-one can take anything they say seriously.“Keith Brown is right that it’s time for a referendum. I trust Nicola Sturgeon, and all the travelling she’s been doing recently - you don’t do thatyou’re planning to be part of a greater England. She’s playing her cards close to her chest but is giving us a subliminal message.”The pair plan to arrive in Westminster on March  “evenwe’re crawling by that time”, said Ms Chapman. She added: “It is just the two of us but we do have a logistics team who will be there for back up should we need it.

They were discovered by staff in a store at the Museum of Edinburgh, just a few hundred yards away from the Palace of Holyroodhouse, where Mary ruled for six years after ing from France in . The  documents, which are inidually dated, numbered and signed, relate to the rights of deacons and tradesmen in the city, the selling of meat at the Tolbooth and the making of salt in Newhaven.Early conservation work on the documents, which were recently discovered in the Museum of Edinburgh’s own storage facility off the Canongate, has revealed watermarks – one of a goat and another of a flower – which can only been seen when held up to light.It is thought the papers entered the archives of the local authority in the s, but were then “lost” before being rediscovered nearly a century later during conservation work. Intriguingly, some of the documents signed by Mary date from when she was still in France.Experts in the council’s museums and galleries service, which is responsible for the official archives of the city, said the recently unearthed documents revealed an “often overlooked “ aspect of her le.History curator Vicky Garrington said: “Together, the documents shed light on a key part of Scotland’s past. We all know the tragic story of Mary Queen of Scots, her eventful le and eventual execution in , but in these documents we see a dferent side to Mary.“Here, she can be seen carefully managing the everyday affairs of Edinburgh, both from France and Scotland. It’s fascinating to think of her reading through these official papers before carefully applying her signature.“They are staying in storage at the museum for now. But we hope to have them assessed by a conservator and for further research to be done on them by experts on Mary, after which we hope to exhibit them, which will be hugely exciting.”Museums and galleries manager Frank Little said: “We’re constantly reviewing, caring for and researching our collections, and look forward to sharing more of the city’s rich heritage with residents and visitors through our programme of exhibitions and online activities.” Council culture convener Donald Wilson said: “Our museums and galleries hold thousands of historic treasures, many of which are on display in our venues.

Over the last few weeks KPL staff have been busy ferrying equipment, supplies and crews out to it as part of the first such contract secured by the yard. During a visit, I expected to find a hive of activity the roar and clang of big machines.But on Thursday of last week I found the whole site surprisingly quiet. This, I am told, is because most of the activity is now taking place onboard what KPL directors refer to as the OGW.“The rig is crawling with insurance people and regulators right now,” says one of the directors, Simon Russell, as he shows me round. “They are all signing off their bits and pieces before the rig gets the final piece of paper that says it’s good to go.”Every weld is being stress tested. Every item of equipment is being put through its paces.Before the rig can face the punishing swells of the north Atlantic, such attention to detail is a matter of le and death.There are also inquisitive guests onboard, doing a little window shopping. They’ve been helicoptered straight on to the rig, the property of US firm Diamond Offshore. These VIPs are potential customers from major players such as Tarka Oil, here to see what the buzz is all about. While doing so, they may also be mightily impressed with Kishorn Port Ltd. That is the hope, anyway.As you are reading this, there is a good chance the Ocean GreatWhite, with a crew of  aboard, will be making its way back up the Minch. If the weather is favourable it may even be doing so under its own steam, without the need for a fleet of tugs to tow it to the Blackrock prospect, some  miles north west of Shetland.So advanced is the OGW that each corner-leg contains two enormous thrusters, powered by engines capable of generating , brake horse power of thrust. For non-petrol-heads that’s  Ferraris per engine. A top speed of eight knots is the result. Not bad for a structure that isn’t exactly designed to cut through the water. Stability is the name of game: even in the roughest seas the thrusters are meant to ensure that the rig doesn’t deviate by more than a metre from the drill point. West of Shetland, it may need every Newton of force those thrusters can provide. Once safely in place, the Ocean GreatWhite will be used by Siccar Point Energy and Shell UK to test for oil in an unexplored area of the seabed.“This is really cutting edge stuff,” enthuses Alasdair Ferguson, the other director in this   venture involving his own firm, Ferguson Transport and Shipping, and Simon’s LeithsLtd. “The rig can operate in , feet of water and drill a hole , feet deep.”In other words, that’s six miles into the earth’s crust. This is how far down we now have to go to get the black stuff. As the ‘Age of Oil’ wanes, rigs like the OGW could become the workhorses of the near future.However, the days of building giant concrete caissons to support them are long gone. Whatever finished products emerge from Kishorn in the next few years, another Ninian Central will not be among them. Deep water is where the action is – and that means floating oil rigs like the Ocean GreatWhite, a sixth-generation model designed specically to harvest the hard-to-reach hydrocarbons that now makes up much of what the UK still produces. Thankfully for Kishorn, that means west of Shetland.  According to Simon, this trend involves the “centre of gravity” shting away from Aberdeen and towards the west coast.KPL is ready and waiting for that trend to continue.“The same thing is happening with offshore wind,” says Simon. “If you look at the next round of Crown licenses you’ll see that most of them are here on the west coast.”“We want to create a multi-use facility,” adds Alasdair. “We want to build resilience into this facility so that it is not reliant on any one industry.”Offshore wind turbines need concrete caissons, albeit smaller than the Ninian Central’s. That’s another box ticked in favour of Kishorn.From about  metres away, the Ocean GreatWhite does indeed look like a floating hotel, to use Simon’s description. Unfortunately, this is as close as we are allowed to get. Obtaining insurance cover for non-crew is a minefield Diamond Offshore also doesn’t want any photographs taken of their cutting-edge equipment. So circling the rig aboard the ‘Infinity’ will have to do for us.Aside from ferrying crew to and from the Ocean GreatWhite, the ‘Infinity’ usually takes tourists out to St Kilda from the Stein jetty in Waternish. But that happens mostly in the summer.“We have been flat out doing this since the rig arrived,” says skipper Kenny Mackinnon.Regular work over the winter is good for those who don’t usually have it.In fact, the arrival of the OGW has been a boon for the area. Twelve locals have been taken on in ious positions. This is the direct benefit. There is a harder to quanty knock-on effect for local businesses in what Alasdair refers to as the “downstream supply chain”. Everything from additional bed nights to sandwiches bought in the nearest shops are covered by this concept. And there have been quite a few of those over the last six weeks.Food and lodgings for visiting crews and subcontracted workers might sound like small beer, however. But the temporary largesse created by the presence of the OGW could be the start of something much bigger.Nothing like the crazy days of the s and s, though, when a town of , people sprung up in accommodation blocks behind the dry dock. That kind of development, said Simon, will not happen again, partly because of the strain it would place on local infrastructure.  Instead, he envisions - people employed directly at the site.The prefabs of Kishorn’s heyday are long gone but the dry dock is still here, its original concrete floor as good as new, so I’m told. The faint imprint of the Ninian Central , once the biggest manmade object ever moved across the face of the Earth, is still visible a spectral impression of the past.KPL have more modest ambitions than trying to resurrect what was.Simon and Alasdair are building in small steps. They’re making progress, just at a slower pace than many would like to see.Further investment is required to speed things up. That, however, is based partly on more rigs using the yard. KPL have a few irons in the fire on that front, but nothing definite yet.“The revenue this will generate will enable us to extend one of the piers, out into the deeper water, so we can load and unload directly rather than having to ferry equipment and people back and forth,” says Alasdair.Just sixty metres from the shore Loch Kishorn reaches a depth of around  metres, easily enough to accommodate oil rigs which, it should be remembered, need taken apart when they’ve reached the end of their working lives. Decommissioning s is on the KPL menu too.If , jobs were a flash in the pan,  jobs might be the sustainable optimum. By definition, the slow build lasts longer than the quick buck.In this place of big numbers,  might be big enough."},{"url":null,"title":"new recycling centre to create 50 new jobs","story":"Fty new jobs are being created in a new recycling centre in Ballymena by a leading social enterprise that finds work for people with disabilities and long term health conditions.Ulster Supported Employment Ltdhas opened new , sq. ft premises in Ballymena as part of its continuing growth in recycling, creating environmentally friendly products and sustainable employment.The new venture will expand the company’s recycling capacity by  per cent, increasing from , tonnes of material each year to  tonnes.

It taught me the value of hard work, money earned, and motivated me to want to do more of both! “After gaining a degree in Health and Leisure from Queen’s University Belfast, I was keen to move into a business environment and decided to apply to Moy Park’s Graduate Management Programme, to find out more about a career in one of our fastest growing industries, agri-food. “The two-year programme was the ideal way to find out more about ious strands of a business, from operations to finance, HR and marketing, and what might suit my skillset best. “From my time as a sht worker on the factory floor, I had a healthy respect and interest in the processing side of Moy Park, and the opportunities and challenges therein. “Once I completed the Graduate Management Programme - which we still use as a recruitment tool today - I took up a position as a sht manager, capitalising on my people management skills and interest in operations. “Since then, I have worked my way up across a number of Moy Park’s sites – moving from factory manager to area manager and have now been General Manager at Ballymena for two years. “Ballymena is a great place to work. From a business point of view, it’s strategically located with fantastic transport links and from a social standpoint, you’ll never find yourself wanting for something to do – from shopping to socialising over a drink or a bite to eat.

This spirit is still very much evidenced by the people, businesses and organisations in the town today. “Mid and East Antrim Council has an ambitious integrated economic development strategy for the area to help encourage business growth across the borough, and it’s one we are keen to help support. “It’s a strategy important not just to Moy Park as a business, but to me personally. “I sit on Mid and East Antrim Council’s Manufacturing Task Force Team, a working group committed to supporting and fostering growth.

In the last  years, business management has evolved signicantly. “While there might be more paperwork, regulations, travel and late nights, there is also an incredible amount of collaboration - with customers, industry, educational bodies and government and our local communications. “Managers today cannot afford to work in silos, you need to adopt an attitude of knowledge sharing and foster an environment of innovation to truly succeed. “My key piece of advice to anyone viewing management as a career is to do your research and bolster your skillsyou need to. Being a good manager isn’t a static position, you constantly need to challenge yourself, and a good employer is one who lets you not only challenge yourself but equips you with the skills to overcome these challenges. “One of my own personal highlights over the last  years was been being named ‘Young Processor of the Year’ at the Meat and Poultry Processing Awards in . “Given my background working on the factory floor, it was great to win an industry award.

A truly awesome effort from a very talented and committed group of girls.Pictured at the Ulster Schools Cross Country Championships is champion Bethany Nixon from Banbridge Academy.Bethany set the tone when she ran hard from the start at the Mallusk Playing fields venue and took the race by the scruff of the neck. Over the course of the race she kept up the pressure, and the pace, and left everyone trailing in her wake. Despite a late attempt at a comeback by her nearest rival, Bethany responded with a kick at the end and won the race by some  metres.

When Nadia, Ruby and Lucy followed in high places there was jubilationwhen the girls realised they had achieved their own bit of history by being the first Banbridge Academy team to claim a Gold in the long history of the championships. All four girls will now travel to Clongowes Wood College near Dublin on Saturday, March  for the Irish Championships and they have every reason to believe they have a medal shot therethey emulate the fantastic runs they all achieved in the Ulster Finals.In the boys races, the Academy had two other athletes who also qualied for the Irish championships with brilliant runs of their own. In the Junior Boys’ race Simon Ferris ran strongly to finish th in a huge field and in the Minor Boys’ Matthew Stevenson fought off many challengers to finish th and claim his spot.

Professor Maura McAdam, who is from Banbridge, will work with researchers from Norway, Israel, Sweden and Ireland on the three-year project entitled Overcoming the Entrepreneurial Ecosystem Gender Divide: A Cross-Cultural Perspective to provide an understanding of how gender is a decisive factor in women’s participation in entrepreneurship, with a focus on women in technology.It will generate new insights and knowledge whilst providing tools to visualise and challenge underlying gender imbalances that inhibit the process of innovation in entrepreneurship. It is hoped that a cross-cultural comparison between the four partner countries will help to explain iations and similarities with regard to gender in entrepreneurship ecosystems. The funding was awarded under Gender-Net Plus, an EU-funded initiative that aims to strengthen links between researchers in dferent countries, and support gender equality through institutional change.Professor Maura McAdam, Professor of Management and Director of Entrepreneurship at DCU’s Business School said: “There is an assumption that all entrepreneurs have equal access to resources, participation and support, as well as an equal chance of a successful outcome. However, my latest research shows that women are underrepresented in successful entrepreneurial ecosystems, and that a persistent gender bias continues to exist in entrepreneurship discourse and practice. I am delighted to take the lead on this project and look forward to working with all of my international colleagues to ultimately help attain gender equality in the entrepreneurship domain in particular and also within broader society.”Police investigating child arrest Facebook footageTen-year animal ban for man who kept dogs in ‘unsuitable’ state Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"special exhibition celebrating tech","story":"Southern Regional College is hosting a special exhibition event to celebrate the achievements which the Banbridge campus has made over the past  years.Building work on the new £ million state-of-the-art SRC Banbridge campus, scheduled to open in September , is already well under way and this unique event will give former students, staff, associates and members of the public a unique opportunity to say a final farewell to the ‘old’ campus on Castlewellan Road.A rear view of the old library and technical college following its extension in  which remains in existence today.The event, which is open to everyone, takes place on Tuesday, March  at pm and will incorporate a special exhibition to celebrate the Ccollege’s proud history, legacy and successes.

The little trawlers are impounded, their crews taken hostage. But why Captain Jamie Bryson was once the Royal Navy’s most decorated and respected nuclear sub commander. But now he’s living in semi-retirement in the sleepy backwater of Donaghadee, tending his garden by day, chairing the parish council by night. When the call comes from Whitehall for him to take to the conning tower for one last top-secret mission, Captain Jamie has to make a choice between his chrysanths and his country#“Action, romance, danger, flute music. This one has it all.” The Ballymena .“An explosive tale of international intrigue that gallops breathlessly from Glengormley to Dundalk and straight to the gates of hell.” Shankill Buy and Sell.“A really cracking holiday read and, believe me, I know what I’m talking about.” Ian Paisley Jnr.“But Sinn Féin.” Slugger O’Toole.Chapter oneCONTACT‘Up periscope!’Captain Jamie Bryson’s voice was tight with tension as he barked the order. He bent and took the handles, his knuckles whitening with the force of his grip. He welcomed the cold anger, it made him feel alive he channelled it, bent it to his will. Anger and training: the fighting man’s best friends – how well he remembered that from his first day at Submarine School Newtownards.The Astute class hunter-killer nuclear submarine sat sleek and silent  metres below the cold, dark Irish Sea. Captain Jamie’s eyes narrowed as he slowly scanned the still waters of Clogherhead harbour, past the pastel colours of the little trawler fleet until at last his crosshairs came to rest on the dull grey hull of the LÉ Orla. The battlecruiser lay squat and sinister in a corner of the harbour commanding a direct view of the two kidnapped Ulster fishing boats, the Amity and the Boy Joseph, two of its four .mm heavy machine-guns trained on the wheelhouses where captain and crew lay on the floor trussed up like pigs.Captain Jamie pushed the periscope handles into the closed position and took a step backward. “Battle stations,” he rasped, “make ready forward torpedo hatches”Executive Officer Willie Frazer’s face creased into a mask of doubt and uncertainty. “But Captain, we’re under strict orders to maintain a watching brief.”He’d served under Captain Jamie for close on  years and never questioned an order – no need to, for Captain Jamie was a Man of the Sea: confident, experienced, exuding an air of calm authority that brooked no dissent.“Mr Frazer, you have your orders.” Captain Jamie’s words were low, but there was no mistaking his deadly seriousness.“Yes, Captain.”A light wind ruffled the short sleeves of Captain Jamie’s immaculately-pressed white shirt and a weak winter sun glinted off the shiny black peak of his cap as he took his place on the conning tower. He fixed his binoculars on the brooding hulk of the LÉ Orla and stood fixed and resolute as a statue. At his shoulder, XO Frazer gripped the cold metal around him to stop his hands from shaking. Though he didn’t take his eyes from the glass, Captain Jamie sensed his number two’s unease.“Mr Frazer,” he said, his gaze still on the enemy ship. “If those trawlers aren’t released by noon, we open fire.

It is not without irony that the words spoken at that event proved this week to be prescient.Law is meant to provide a moral compass for society, allow us a set of norms by which we agree to conduct society and protect the vulnerable. We live in streets where for decades law was either disregarded or used as a tool in a weaponry of oppression. Those reading this paper who were subjected to the ignominy of its abuse will all know too well what happens when law does not work. It incites and prolongs conflict, harm and pain. But most of all the corruption of law leads to despair. Where can we gowe do not have the protection of law The single most important achievement of the Good Friday Agreement was the review of criminal justice. It was a recognition that the corruption of law needed to be endedwe were to truly ensure our conflict never happened again.When the Supreme Court in London delivered its findings in the challenge by the Finucane family to the decision by the British government not to hold a public inquiry, it was a finding in law. It was not about Weston Park, nor about governmental promises, nor about changing economic environments. It was about what was right in law. And with its clear, non-political eye, saw that an inquiry was required into this pernicious example of state collusion in the killing of an officer of the courts.When last week there was an announcement that inquests would at last have appropriate structure and funding this was because of the domestic and international courts refusing any argument that the application of the rule of law could be subject to political favour or will. Legal compliance is not subject to negotiation.No matter who the citizen is, whatever their background, they should expect the law to defend them. No matter how big the power, whatever their political philosophy, they should expect the law to hold them to account. That is how it works. And it can remedy previous imbalance.Right now, the long arm of those who abused their position and the law in the RUC is reaching into the PSNI to undermine the courts addressing the crimes of the past. Alongside elements of the military and security services these vested interests are doing it because the law, through its courts and processes such as the Police Ombudsman, is holding previous members of state agencies and the narrative of the state as upholders of law and order to account. This is a critical time. Confidence in the building of a truly human rights-compliant system of law, order and justice relies on the rule of law winning against politically motivated vested interests. Some will try to portray these developments as uneven or unbalanced. Quite the reverse is true."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"two more people to stand trial linked to meli case","story":"TWO more people are to stand trial on offences arising out of the murder of Christopher Meli.-year-old Daniel McManus, of Springbank Drive, and Shannon McIIwaine , of Glenalina Park, both in West Belfast, appeared at Belfast Crown Court on Friday for a ruling on their case.Mr Justice Colton dismissed applications by their legal teams to have charges of affray dismissed on the grounds of insufficient evidence.The senior judge said that although they were not accused of engaging in violence on the night of Mr Meli’s murder in December , he had come to the conclusion, “that their conduct taken at its height is sufficient to put each of the defendants on trial for affray.”Dismissing the application, Mr Justice Colton added: “I am satisfied that the affray took place in a public place and in such a manner that a bystander or reasonably firm character might reasonably expect it to be terrying.” Following his ruling, both defendants were formally arraigned on a single count that they “unlawfully displayed force and made affray” on December, , .Both replied “not guilty” and were released on continuing bail ahead of the start of their trial on September .In January this year, six other people were ed for trial in connection with Mr Meli’s murder.Three are charged with murdering the -year-old father-of-one, while their co-accused face other charges linked to alleged incidents on the evening.Mr Meli was beaten to death at Doc’s Path in the Glasvey Close area of Twinbrook.At the time police, believed up to  young people were involved in a number of violent incidents that culminated in his death.All six accused appeared at Belfast Crown Court where they heard the trial could last up to  weeks.The trio accused of murdering Mr Meli are Caolan Lavertyof Belfast Road in Glenavy, Stephen McCannof Dundrinne Road in Castlewellan and -year-old Lee Smyth, who was living at an undisclosed address in County Antrim.

The second half continued to be a feisty affair and a great spectacle for the neutral spectator.With the lowered sun in Ballynahinchrsquos eyes, Ballymena did the smart thing and constantly took the high router, creating numerous scoring opportunities for Ballymena.Unfortunately, for lsquoHinch, their lead didnrsquot last too long as Ballymena bounced back with another great counter-attacking goal to make it -.It was end-to-end stuff, like the first half, the best of the chances falling to Millar, McIlwaine and Campbell only to be denied by the hard-working Ballymena defence and lsquokeeper.Cards were shown to both sides with William Edgar, Andrew Mulholland and Tim Crean doing time on the sideline.Ballymena had decent short corner chances, but were closed down well by Ashley Brown, Rea Coffey and of course Aaron Donnell.lsquoHinch had a few shorts of their own, but couldnrsquot convert. With  minutes remaining on the clock, Ballynahinch patiently played the ball around the back, waiting for an opening.Ashley Brownrsquos pass then found the lurking Stuart Hunter in space. Hunter was able to pick out roaming right back Leslie Harrison, who pulled a perfect pass back into Millar and he made no mistake in finding the net.Ballynahinch could easily have sat back and closed up shop, but they pinned Ballymena into their own half with a series of concerted attacks.Congratulations to everyone involved with the Ballynahinch menrsquos team, especially the supporters who never miss a game.The celebrations were short-lived as Ballynahinch have a huge game this weekend when they face Portrush in Coleraine in the Irish Hockey Challenge semi-final at pm.Ballynahinch: Aaron Donnell, Rea Coffey, Andrew Mulholland , Ashley Brown, Leslie Harrison, Matthew Martin, Stuart Hunter, William Edgar,Tim Crean, Jason Campbell, Alex Millar, Andrew McIlwaine, Luke Curry, Micheal Carney, Josh Higginson, Steven Crean.Joint men of the match: Alex Millar and Rea Coffey.Ballynahinch Ballymena ULSTER INTER LEAGUE.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"£2m tidal turbine providing energy spins in to action  ","story":"A poundm tidal turbine currently in Strangford Lough could provide electricity for between - homes, it has been revealed.The Scottish firm behind the innovative Subhub has said that energy produced from the fast-flowing lough could cost as low as p per kWH for local industrial load customers.However, the Subhub is not connected to the local electricity grid and is being tested for its environmental impact and maintenance needs.The distinctive yellow Subhub mdash which is roughly the size of of a bus mdash has been in Castleward Bay for the last six weeks.Easily seen from Portaferry, it was towed from Belfast Harbour and fixed into position within  hours on January .Jeremy Smith, managing director of QED Naval, said that Strangford Lough was chosen over the Orkneys for the Subhubrsquos final commissioning before being made available for the global market.Mr Smith explained: ldquoThe Subhub is a foundation structure for tidal turbines and provides a means of transporting and fixing tidal turbines to the sea bed.ldquoWe want to prove the environmental credentials of Subhub after developing it since .ldquoWe selected Strangford Lough as the commissioning site specically as it had the iants of conditions that Orkney hadnrsquot. The Orkneys was problematic as itrsquos a long way away.

Lyng took the resultant penalty, but it was saved by a combination of Karen Haughey and then Sara-Louise Carr in the last action of the half.The second period followed a similar trend as Clonduff dominated the third quarter, Sara-Louise Carr banging over her third point and Gribben, who was picking up so much ball around the middle third, putting four between them once more from a placed ball.Gailltiacuter took over from then on, but will rue near-misses with shots for goal from Jackman, Carroll and Fitzgerald.The latter reduced the margin to the minimum with three scores, the third from play in the th minute after wonderful work by Kate Lynch, but crucially Gribben responded with a fantastic conversion of a free outside the  after a heavy challenge on Megan OrsquoReilly.Lyng made it a one-point game once more from a free, but Clonduff defended resolutely to hold out.Clonduff: K Haughey, N OrsquoHagan, J Boden, S Murphy, C McGilligan, E Rafferty, F Carr , B Fitzpatrick, C Cowan, C Fitzpatrick, SL Carr , P Gribben , O Gribben, K McGilligan.

In fact, the South Eastern Trust has been concentrating for some time on trying to find suitable day surgical services which could be delivered in Downpatrick.Miss Ritchie said it appears ldquovery short sighted to relocate services from the Downe to other hospitals, suggesting the bedding down of eye surgery will result in the increased requirement for theatre access for ENT and other services.She added: ldquoAs the Downe has high level computerised technology theatres, it is important that full use is made of them to ensure continued local accessibility to day surgery services at the point of delivery.ldquoI have already written to the Trust urging that ENT surgical clinics are retained in the Downe Hospital.Also this week, Miss Ritchie has issued a fresh call for a permanent MRI scanner to be installed in Downpatrick.She said that for a number of years the local community has been involved in trying to secure a permanent scanner which health chiefs agree is a necessity.She added: ldquoI understand that the permanent facility is subject to a business case which needs a Minister in place to approve. Whilst the devolved institutions remain in cold storage, the approval of such a facility will probably take some time.ldquoIn the meantime, a mobile scanner has been located at the Downe for a limited period to deal with a current overburdened service at the Ulster Hospital in Dundonald. I hope this unit can remain in place until the business case for the permanent scanner has been approved.A South Eastern Trust spokeswoman has confirmed that there are no plans to reduce the number of ENT sessions delivered at the Downpatrick hospital.She added: ldquoThe Trust is planning to increase ENT clinics at the Downe and to relocate an ENT day surgery session from Downpatrick to the Lagan Valley Hospital to facilitate the cataract elective care centre prototype work..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Food firm to create 125 jobs with £17m investment  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK is in line for a major jobs boost.Finnebrogue Artisan has this week unveiled plans to create  new jobs as part of a poundm investment in an ultra-modern nitrite-free bacon facility.The news comes just weeks after the firm unveiled details of a poundm investment in a new vegan and vegetarian factory to support  jobs.Already one of the districtrsquos leading employers and widely regarded as one of Northern Irelandrsquos most innovative food producers, Finnebrogue Artisanrsquos latest investment is being supported by Invest NI.The new manufacturing facility is for the production of the companyrsquos nitrite-free bacon, hailed by many experts as a breakthrough in the food processing sector when it was unveiled to wide acclaim in January last year.The Naked Bacon range is now widely available in leading supermarkets across the UK, with Invest NI offering the Downpatrick company over pound.m of support towards the capital investment in the new nitrate-free bacon facility.The  new posts are expected to be created by , supporting  posts already in place at the ultra-modern plant outside Downpatrick.Finnebrogue chairman Denis Lynn says it has been known for decades that nitrites used in curing meat can cause cancer.ldquoThatrsquos why, despite being the UKrsquos leading top tier sausage maker, we refused to make a single rasher of bacon until we could figure out a way to make it better and safer, he continued.ldquoWe always set out to make food the best it can be, without being bound by the way it has always been done.

The development proposal includes plans for almost  parking spaces, eight of which are reserved for mountain rescue team members.A new pedestrian crossing at the Bryansford Road junction with Shimna Road forms part of the proposal and while planners have received  objections, they have also received five letters in support of the proposal.In papers submitted ahead of next weekrsquos meeting, planners confirm that none of the statutory consultees, including the Department for Infrastructure, Rivers Agency, Environment Agency and the local environmental health department, have lodged any objections to the redevelopment of the former school site.They confirm that roads officials are content that the proposed development will not have any ldquoadverse impact on the existing road infrastructure and is acceptable in terms of road safety.Planners are also insisting that the indicative designs of both the new store and mountain rescue centre would not be inappropriate in this part of the resort.They say it is acknowledged that there are ldquoobvious restrictions for the redevelopment of the existing Lidl store in Railway Street and there are no alternative vacant sites in the town centre which can accommodate the supermarketrsquos needs.ldquoA suitable brownfield site has become available at the edge of the town centre which could accommodate the proposal and has met the requirements of strategic planning policy, say planners.They also confirmed that a study of the impact of the new store on existing retailers shows the proposed investment will not have any ldquosignicant or unacceptable impact on Newcastle town centre.Environmental health officials say they have no objection in principle to the investment, provided conditions are attached restricting hours of business and deliveries, with planners concluding that the overall impact of the proposal, which is close to a number of homes, is not considered to be ldquosignicantly detrimental to warrant a refusal of the application.Lidl has confirmed it plans to develop a new , square metre supermarket, explaining it opted to redevelop the former primary school site as there are limited opportunities to redevelop the storersquos current base at Railway Street in the resort.Lidl says it has been looking for alternative premises in Newcastle town centre for over a decade without success and that while properties have become available, none were suitable because they were too small.It says the current sales area at its Railway Street base is is too small for the store to carry a full range of goods, pointing to narrow aisles with limited circulation space. The company says the car park is too small and fails to meet its requirements, with the general customer experience falling short of a modern food store.Planners say that having assessed the ious planning policies and having regard to all representations made, all consultees engaged and all other material considerations, it is found that the proposal is acceptable in planning terms and approval is recommended..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Newcastle’s pop up beach back on agenda of council  ","story":"A DECISION to reject a proposal for a pop-up beach in Newcastle has been overturned.Last month, a Newry, Mourne and Down Council Committee recommended not to proceed with the articial beach mdash similar to those in Paris and other parts of Europe ndash at the townrsquos promenade.However, the decision was overturned at Monday nightrsquos meeting of the full council when it was agreed to seek funding for the pop-up beach and develop a business case which could pave the way for its introduction.But not all councillors agreed, with Sinn Fein members rejecting it. They said there were health and safety concerns associated with the beach. They expressed support for transporting sand by road from Ballykinlar to Newcastle promenade and implementing an enhanced beach management plan.The radical suggestion to bring a touch of French summer flair to Newcastle was initially discussed last September when it was agreed to further explore the idea, with the initial focus on the cost of developing such a facility.The idea was suggested because of the lack of sand on Newcastle beach.Pop up beaches along the banks of the Seine and other cities and towns across Europe are hugely popular and some local politicians believe they can be a success in Newcastle.Council officials have confirmed that while Newcastle promenade is not suitable for pop-up beaches, two areas adjacent to the Downs Road car park would be suitable and that the cost over a nine-week period would be pound,.At last monthrsquos meeting of the local authorityrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourism Committee, politicians rejected the pop-up proposal and agreed to seek a meeting with the Environment Agency to discuss securing a marine licence to transport sand from Ballykinlar to Newcastle.It was also suggested that groins would be placed along sections of beach to protect the sand and a programme of better beach management introduced.

However, it is not workable.ldquoI have been advised in no uncertain terms by a iety of coastal erosion experts that importing sand to Newcastle or removing stones from the beach simply wonrsquot work due to the movement of sediment and that permission to do this work would be denied by central government.ldquoAs a councillor for Newcastle, I want to improve our tourism product and the pop-up beach proposal is simply my suggestion to try and do something dferent. I also recognise that an articial beach would have to be properly managed and maintained.Cllr Devlin added: ldquoA pop-up beach could not just be created at the start of the summer and left. It would have to be adequately cleaned and looked after. As a mother, I would not want my child playing in dirty sand so the management and cleanliness of the pop up beach is essential.ldquoThis suggestion wonrsquot be without itrsquos issues, but surely as a council it is our job to try and make improvements and better our area where possible, expressing disappointment Sinn Fein opposed her proposal.Sinn Feinrsquos Willie Clarke argued that there was no appetite for a pop-up beach and that the suggestion to move sand from Ballykinlar to Newcastle was to replace the hundreds of tonnes which drt away on a seasonal basis.He continued: ldquoHow are you going to manage a pop-up beach that will be filled with stagnant sand  There is the potential for both dogs and young infants to foul the sand and other health and safety issues which need to be addressed.ldquoWill the sand be cleaned every day  What measures will be taken to prevent sand from blowing up Main Street  Local people and traders want to see a sandy beach, not a pop-up beach. I believe it is a no brainer that we try to secure Environment Agency agreement to place sand on the beach.Cllr Clarke said part of the pleasure of going to the beach was being able to go into the water and suggested that a pop-up beach could not provide such an experience.He added: ldquoWe need to look at anti-social behaviour issues associated with pop-up beaches which could contain broken glass.

Murray launched the ball high into orbit and wasnrsquot the least bit surprised when the wind took over and helped it on its way to the top right hand corner of the net with Ross clutching at thin air.Six minutes later at the other end Anton McGrattan struck yet another free kick from just outside the box past Ryan Walsh to bring the sides level.Olympic continued to see more of the ball, but Jones, when he did receive the ball out wide, was let down on a few occasions by a lack of support in the box and some wasteful finishing from Shane Murray.Kilmore were far from out of it and the bustling Joe McKinney was proving a handful and he almost gave the visitors a nd minute lead when he shot wide after a sizzling breakaway run from Anton McGrattan.Murray missed another good chance for Olympic after Jones carved out another opening before Kilmore seized the lead.Callum Dougan foraged deep and played a delightful through ball into the path of McKinney, who had beaten the offside trap. McKinney wasnrsquot for hanging around and after shrugging off Stevie McGoran, herounded lsquokeeper Walsh to make it -.The unrelenting wind and rain greeted both sets of players back for the second half and it was Kilmore who went on the offensive with Ryan Slavin being denied by Walsh.Two minutes later Kilmore shot themselves in the foot when Murray floated a free kick into the box and Jason Noade had all the time in the world to head the ball past Ross.Things became hot and heavy for a while with the tackles flying in, but clear cut chances at either end were hard to come by.Kilmore were now asking most of the questions, but a resolute Olympic rearguard refused to budge and Walsh had relatively little to do, apart from the odd shot from distance.Extra-time produced little of note, but Kilmore could have wrapped things up in the second period when McKinney crossed for Pete Casey, but, for once, he sliced his effort into no manrsquos land.Jones, Jason and Stevie Noadersquos first three penalties were perfect for Olympic, but they were matched by McGivern, McKinney and Larkin for Kilmore.Adam McLean nudged Olympic - ahead before Anton McGrattan fired his effort wide, advantage Olympic.Murrayrsquos first attempt was saved by Ross, but the referee made him retake the penalty as he insisted Ross had moved forward off his line. Murray was not about to look a gt horse in the mouth and drilled his second attempt to the net, much to the despair of a mightily aggrieved Kilmore side.Ballynahinch Olympic: Ryan Walsh, Dalton Tate, Aaron McClean, Jason Noade, Ryan Noade, Stevie McGoran, Stevie Noade, Ryan Molloy, Shane Murray, Niall Murray.

That really misses the point. We’re two-and-a-half yearsnot nearly three years now since the referendum,” he said.“It is far too late for the United Kingdom to tell us what they want.

Social media was abuzz this morning as pictures emerged of travellers standing in security lines stretching outside the terminal building.It comes after the airport last month said it was expanding its security area from six to eight search lanes to improve wait times at security.However, in order to facilitate the expansion work, the airport has temporarily reduced the number of lanes to five.Some passengers caught up in the delays took to Twitter to vent their frustration.Paul Fitzpatrick tweeted: “Was here in plenty of time but not even in the airport yet. How will I make my . flight ”Mr Fitzpatrick ended up missing his plane to Edinburgh after queuing in security for over an hour, and had to transfer to another flight at George Best Belfast City Airport.He told the News Letter he would never use Belfast international Airport again, describing the situation as “farcical”.The airport’s managing director Graham Keddie revealed that around  passengers had missed their flights as a result of the security delays.Speaking on Radio Ulster this morning, Mr Keddie apologised to those affected by the situation, but asked passengers to be patient as the airport implements its improvements.He added that the airport currently has % less queueing space in the search area due to the ongoing constructions work.“We dropped the number of lanes to five to facilitate our construction work about  days ago and phase one of this is due to complete by Thursday night when we go back to six lanes. Phase two is due to complete before Easter,” he added.He acknowledged that the reputational damage to the airport was signicant, but added: “We will get it right and by Easter we will be on eight lanes fully manned.Security alert: Suspicious object was ‘nothing untoward’ Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“It is embarrassing and humiliating for us as a team. We know what we have to do to fix it and we will fix it.”Mr Keddie also said some passengers who missed their flights may be entitled to a refund, adding: “We will be looking at each inidual case andit is an issue for Belfast International Airport then they will be reimbursed.”Today’s chaotic scenes are not a new occurrence for the airport, which has come in for heavy criticism from disgruntled passengers over several months, with many complaining of long waits to get through security and miss flights on some occasions.Alliance MLA Stewart Dickson has called on the Civil Aviation Authorityto carry out an investigation into the situation at the airportIn response, Mr Keddie stated: “The airport is fit for purpose in terms of our compliance which is CAA monitored constantly.”In a statement, the airport said it was continuing to advise to advise passengers to arrive two hours prior to departure.try catch  TrendingRoad reopens after collisionNewry murders: Distraught father will lsquosell taxirsquo for chance to say goodbyePolice not seeking anyone  in connection with Newry deathsN.I. child reported missing is found safe and wellStorm Gareth worse than originally thought -

Dealing with this type of call prevents our staff from dealing with genuine emergencies.ldquoCalling an ambulance when you donrsquot need one wastes time and resources which could have been better spent responding someone genuinely in need of the high level clinical care ambulance crews provide. Ambulances are not a taxi service and arriving at hospital by ambulance does not mean yoursquoll be seen quicker.\"She added: ldquoIf someone is seriously ill or injured and their le is at risk, you should call  immediately.

These will be considered in accordance with the relevant legislation and guidance, part of which specically relates to the need for an Environmental Impact Assessment.ldquoShould a planning application follow, it will be considered in exactly the same way as any other of its type. In order to gain approval, among other factors, it will need to satisfy national and local policies, including those contained in the LDP, while members of the public will also have the opportunity to express their views before any decision is taken.Welsh Government and the architects have been contacted for comment. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

These will be considered in accordance with the relevant legislation and guidance, part of which specically relates to the need for an Environmental Impact Assessment.ldquoShould a planning application follow, it will be considered in exactly the same way as any other of its type. In order to gain approval, among other factors, it will need to satisfy national and local policies, including those contained in the LDP, while members of the public will also have the opportunity to express their views before any decision is taken.Welsh Government and the architects have been contacted for comment. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

The event ran from Saturday March  to Tuesday March .The Vale brewery Tomos and Lilford produced a special beer called ldquoCarnival - Penarth Pale Ale.Meanwhile the two Penarth butchers, Thompson Family Butchers and David Lush Butchers, both created their own special Penarth carnival sausages.The organisers estimated that more than  people took part in costume in the walk through town on Saturday, which saw the coronation of the lsquoFirst Foolrsquo at am. The procession marched from Sully Terrace through town.At .am in Penarth Library, there was a presentation of the head of Bendigeidfran, from The Mabinogion. The head was made by children from Cogan and Penygarth schools.The lsquoFirst Foolrsquo was then sent by train to the Tower of London to bring news of the Carnival to the traditional resting place of the head of Bendigeidfran, where he met the Raven Master.Long distance cyclist Dave Hann was due to cycle to Harlech, north Wales to raise money for the RNLI Penarth, and bring news to Harlech that Carnival had broken out in Penarth.Unfortunately Mr Hann only got as far as Cardigan before Storm Freya made it too dangerous to continue. Organisers have one barrel of carnival ale left and will take it to Harlech by train in the next few weeks to share it and the storybook of the carnival.On Sunday, two rugby teams took part in a ldquotug-o-sausage to decide which butcherrsquos sausage was better. Congratulations were extended to the winners, Team Thompson.Congratulations were also extended to the traders Ener-chi and Lilypad by the organisers, for having the best-dressed shop windows. Particular praise was singled out for the carnival flowers at Holm House Hotel created by Lilypad.Further nights of partying, songs and dancing were spotted in the Albion, St Faganrsquos Castle, and other pubs, bars and venues across Penarth. There were also celebrations on the Penarth Pier on Tuesday night following a Pancake Day event, while wandering bands of musicians like Wonderbrass kept spirits high.The festival culminated in a grand Mardis Gras party on Tuesday, which saw crowds of costumed residents dance the night away.Richard Parry, one of the carnival organisers, said: ldquoToday is Ash Wednesday, the beginning of Lent. Carnival finished last night on Mardi Gras.ldquoThanks to everyone who took part, contributed, encouraged, sponsored, smiled and partied, especially those people who took a carnival Bank Holiday Monday.ldquoIt was fabulous to hear your Carnival Bank Holiday stories, and to all those people who have had little private carnival moments of joy over the festival, thatrsquos what it has all been about.ldquoAnd some people have already said, lsquosee you next year!rsquoldquoThere were lots of people laughing and smiling on the sidelines, telling me they wanted to take part next year ndash just with a little more notice next time. But now itrsquos established, wersquoll be back next year and ready for even more people to join in the fun! article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Wersquore creating work which is not really necessary.If we want to improve the gateway there are other ways of doing it.ldquoIt really doesnrsquot begin to tackle the active travel . I do feel this is about spending the money before next February.Councillors were told the widened roundabout was one part of a wider strategy for transport improvements in Penarth.Charlotte Pugh, senior planner for the council, said the new scheme would transform the area.She said: ldquoThis whole are is going to be completely transformed. At the moment it is not very welcoming to pedestrians.ldquoI think it will go some way to transforming this gateway into Penarth and make it a safer environment.Previous plans to make part of Plassey Street one-way to incoming traffic, and removing the roundabout altogether, were dropped following opposition from the public.The committee agreed to endorse the transport scheme but requested regular updates on the wider transport plans for Penarth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This fantastic choir is run by The Aloud Charity, which is based here in the constituency, and is doing incredible work all around Wales, involving young people in music and teamwork and giving them the confidence to not only succeed in music but in their lives more generally.It was a real honour to host them in Parliament, where they sang for the Speaker, for MPs, and during the St Davidrsquos Day Service in the Chapel, before heading to the Public Gallery of the Commons to watch the St Davidrsquos Day debate.This annual debate is an important one for Wales, allowing MPs to talk about all sorts of issues. I spoke about transport and train services ndash a long running campaign of mine as you will know.I then spoke in the crucial debate on climate change. Believe it or not, itrsquos been far too long since wersquove had a debate on this issue in Parliament, and I spoke about the importance of our investments and pensions going into renewable sources, not into fossil fuels.I also pointed out my support for the young people across the UK who went on a climate strike the week before. Itrsquos their futures that wersquore concerned about here and they were absolutely right to do what they did.And then of course the Brexit shambles continues ndash we cannot escape it ndash but we were debating it again last week, with hugely important votes to come next week.But last week was a signicant one. The PM was forced into a corner, forced to concede that she might have to rule out No Deal and extend Article , and the Labour Party came out decisively for putting this issue back to the people.And this week we saw the Government attempt to win over MPs with a fund it claims will boost less well-off towns after Brexit ndash but in another shambolic aspect to this hapless attempt to bribe MPs into voting for Theresa Mayrsquos so-called deal, there is no cash for Welsh towns.Another example of the Tories letting Wales down, and yet further reason to support the push for a final say on Brexit for the public through a Peoplersquos Vote. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Last month I met with constituents over disruption to local rail services. I know that many of you will have experienced delays and cancellations to services in the weeks following the handover of the Wales Rail Franchise. I understand and share the frustration that these delays have caused. There has been a shortage of rolling stock as a result of a large maintenance backlog following the handover of the franchise together with planned changes to rail services. This has led to a signicant reduction in services and replacement bus services. I have been in contact with the Minister for Transport and Transport for Wales to raise the concerns of constituents. I have been assured that service levels are now back to normal and they do not anticipate any restrictions to services in the coming year. I will of course maintain my interest to see that those assurances are kept. I will update residents again on future plans to deliver improved station facilities, trains and more regular services.As many of you are aware Cardf Bus has recently announced changes to bus services across Cardf and the Vale. A number of bus routes are at risk as part of these changes. The removal of bus links for work, social links and public services, including hospital routes, would have a signicant impact on my constituents.Cardf Bus are not acting to deliberately hurt our communities. Far from being an uncaring organisation Cardf Bus are stuck with a legal framework that stops them from operating on the same basis as commercial competitors. Competitors can cherry pick and target single profitable routes that undermine the wider social propose that most of us want from local bus services. Cardf Councilrsquos Labour leadership has committed to supporting at risk bus services for  years. Unless the Conservative leadership of the Vale Council agrees to Labour councillors amendments to the budget and protects local bus services in the Vale then bus routes will go. The Vale Council leadership could and should act. If they donrsquot then my constituents will suffer.In future, the regulation of buses is the answer. London was the only part of the UK that was allowed to keep a regulated bus service. It is no mistake that it has the best and most coherent service. We now have the legislative powers to regulate bus services here in Wales. The Welsh Government is currently consulting on proposals to reform bus and taxi services in Wales. More information on the consultation can be found at: https:beta.gov.wales improving-public-transport. The consultation closes on th March ndash please do get in touch and take part. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

replaced","story":"NHS England announced a series of pilots which could see sweeping changes to targets including on AE, cancer and planned operations.At present, patients are expected to be seen and treated, discharged or admitted to hospital, within four hours at AE.Under the new plans, those patients in England with the most serious conditions such as heart attacks, strokes and sepsis, would receive rapid treatment within an hour, while people with more minor conditions could expect to wait longer.Data would be published on how long patients spend on average in AE.Other changes mean the current -week target for people to start planned treatment, such as hip operations, could also be replaced by one measuring the average time it takes to start treatment.The proportion of people waiting more than  weeks for treatment is currently at its highest level for a decade.Targets for cancer care waiting times were also disclosed On AE, the existing four-hour target has not been met since July  and some experts say it is unlikely the NHS could ever hit it again.Figures for January showed that AE waiting times in England reached their worst level since records began.Just .% of patients were treated or admitted in four hours, against a % target, meaningnearly , patients waited longer than they should.The data also showed that , people in January endured very long waits, often called trolley waits, to be admitted to hospital.Under the new plans, patients would receive an assessment by a medical professional when they walk through the door of AE, and cases would then be prioritised according to the level of urgency.NHS England has long said that the current four-hour AE target is outdated, with data suggesting hospitals are being driven to hit the target.About a fth of all emergency admissions from AE happen in the final  minutes before the four-hour deadline.On cancer, the two-week wait to see a cancer specialist could be scrapped and replaced with a target that says people must receive a diagnosis within  days of first being referred by their GP.Four other -day cancer targets, which mark the time from diagnosis to first treatment for all cancers, would also be replaced by a single -day target.This would mark  days from a decision to treat to a person to them receiving their first treatment.Patients would also start their first treatment for cancer within  daysfollowing an urgent GP referral for suspected cancer.People who arrive at AE experiencing a mental health crisis will also receive emergency care within one hour.Professor Stephen Powis, national medical director of NHS England and leader of the review of targets, said: ldquoThe NHS is aiming to improve care for patients and save hundreds of thousands more lives over the coming years, with greater access to mental health support, better treatment for the major killer conditions and services which are more joined up, personalised and closer to home.ldquoSo, as we build an NHS that is fit for the future, now is the right time to look again at the old targets which have such a big influence on how care is delivered, to make sure that they take account of the latest treatments and techniques, and support, not hinder, staff to deliver the kind of responsive, high-quality services that people want to see.Professor Ted Baker, chief inspector of hospitals for the Care Quality Commission, said: ldquoEmergency departments need a set of standards which gives priority to patients with le-threatening conditions, ensures people get care in a timely way, and puts pressure on the whole hospital to end long corridor waits for those who need admitting.The Royal College of Emergency Medicinesaid that ldquorather than scrapping the four-hour access standard, it should be supported by a series of complementary metrics that help understanding of the causes of long waits and crowding in emergency departments.President Dr Taj Hassan said the College was ldquokeen to ensure that any changes are not imposed due to political will but are developed responsibly, collaboratively and are based upon clinical expert consensus in the best interests of patients.Dr Nick Scriven, president of the Society for Acute Medicine, said the organisation had been calling for change since .ldquoThe review of the target is an opportunity to focus on a range of patient outcomes and quality standards to measure pressures and take effective action earlier ndash a lack of wide-ranging information heaps further pressure on already-stretched hospitals, he said.Nuffield Trust chief executive Nigel Edwards said: ldquoNHS targets never work as expected in the real world, so the idea of testing out new proposals and carefully monitoring the effect on patients is a big improvement on the usual directive approach.ldquoI agree that the AE target is overdue a check-up: it has started rewarding the wrong behaviours, like moving patients just to stop the clock.ldquoThe new target to treat patients with a mental health crisis within an hour at AE sends exactly the right message about the urgency called for in those situations.ldquoGiven the history of targets having unintended consequences, we will need to watch closely as these trials go ahead, looking at the actual effect on peoplersquos health as well as access to care.ldquoThere is a risk that getting rid of the -week limit on waits for planned procedures could mean the proportion of people going without care for an unacceptably long time drts upwards.ldquoAnd we need to be hard-headed about how much dference fine tuning targets will make ndash the root causes of poor performance lie in a lack of staff and capacity, which we have barely started solving.Baroness Delyth Morgan, chief executive of Breast Cancer Now, said: ldquoThe current lsquotwo-week waitrsquo for breast cancer has been hugely successful in transforming the experiences of people referred to a specialist to investigate their symptoms.ldquoWith these proposals representing a sht to instead give reassurance of a -day wait for diagnosis, itrsquos vital we ensure they will further improve patient experience and build on years of progress.ldquoBeing referred with breast symptoms can be an incredibly worrying time for thousands of women and their families, and itrsquos critical that they are given answers and can begin treatment or be given peace of mind as soon as possible.Dame Donna Kinnair, acting chief executive of the Royal College of Nursing, said: ldquoMoves to give cancer patients a diagnosis within  days are a welcome step forward, and all nurses, not just those working in mental health, will support the plan to provide emergency care within an hour to people who go to AE with a mental health crisis.ldquoHowever, itrsquos hard to see exactly how it will be possible to meet these new more stringent standards without more staff ndash or they would already be taking these sensible measures.ldquoWe will need accurate and honest feedback from the pilots to ascertain whether it is possible to roll out these measures nationally with the huge workforce gaps we currently have..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Key AE and treatment times targets could be replaced article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url

The interview was filmed in the gardens of #MarlboroughHouse, where the flags of our  member countries fly#CommonwealthDaymdash The CommonwealthMarch , He urged the Commonwealth to lead the world in ocean conservation, and combat the threat posed by the ldquoperfect storm of climate change, over-fishing and plastic pollution.He said: ldquoThe speed of change is alarming. When I first swam in the Arctic the water was three degrees centigrade ndash when I swam there recently it was  degrees centigrade, and that is right on the edge of the Arctic icepack.ldquoWhat we are now doing to the world will impact every single person on this planet, it will impact every future generation and impact the whole of the animal kingdom.Mr Pugh, UN patron of the oceans, told the congregation ldquoour Commonwealth is our oceans, going on to say: ldquoNow is the time to build a new generation of green protected areas and now is also the time to welcome in a new generation of marine protectors.He ended with the words: ldquoItrsquos the moments which challenge us the most that define us.ldquoWe stand at a crucial moment in the history of our planet so must e in together, and without reservation, in order to protect our oceans ndash let this be the Commonwealthrsquos gt to the world..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Queen leads nation to mark Commonwealth Day article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

How did you get started in the industry  When we first opened Asia Supermarket in , it was the family’s ambition to bring a taste of home to Belfast. We brought the Chinese culture to the local community through cuisine and provided authentic and tasty ingredients for the hospitality trade here. We branched out due to demand to also provide Indian, Korean, Philippine, Thai and Middle Eastern food and are always looking for opportunities to extend our range.

What is the most dficult part of your job  One of the most dficult parts of the job is sourcing good quality produce at competitive prices and enhancing the range of products available. However, we’re very proud of our new supermarket and warehouse which provides even more quality and choice for our customers. What are the challenges facing your sector, and the economy in general  One of the biggest challenges facing our sector is the cost of goods from our suppliers, particularly those procured in foreign currencies which in turn has a knock-on effect on what we charge our wholesale and retail customers. To maintain our share of the market we constantly endeavour to get the best prices from our suppliers so that we can pass on competitive prices to our customers to maintain and grow our market share. With Brexit looming it will bring a major impact on imports costs and supplier prices which will present a major challenge for our business.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/cleaver_1.jpg","title":"is the future bright for the ni energy market","story":"Posted on Tuesday  February  by Ulster Business It is clear that there are a number of signicant challenges facing the energy sector in Northern Ireland but where there are challenges, there are also opportunities, according to law firm Cleaver Fulton Rankin.The ExecutiveNorthern Ireland has just completed its second year without a ing local government and in the words of David Sterling, head of the Northern Ireland Civil Service, the Civil Service is “… doing everything we can in the prevailing circumstances…but civil servants cannot take the place of ministers when it comes to strategic policy development or in taking transformative decisions”.  This is very much the case with regard to energy policy. The Department of the Economy’s Strategic Energy Framework, which was endorsed by the Executive in , has over the last nine years, led to some very positive changes to the energy generation and supply mix, particularly from renewable sources.However the  year framework is nearing its end and needs to be replaced. The Department is making such preparations as it can on a draft Strategic Energy Framework across the areas of heat, electricity, transport and energy efficiency which it aims to make public some time in the spring. Whether or not this region has its Assembly back to adopt such a framework will remain to be seen, but in the meantime it will ensure the subject remains live and high on the agenda.Brexit and I-SEMThe new wholesale electricity market known as the Integrated Single Electricity Marketwent live on October , . It is designed to deliver increased levels of competition which, it is hoped, will help put downward pressure on prices as well as encouraging greater levels of security of supply and transparency. While the island of Ireland is now integrated more closely with European markets, there is a risk that Brexit could halt this integration. British and Irish business groups and energy trade associations such as the CBI, IBEC, Electricity Association of Ireland, RenewableUK, British Irish Chamber of Commerce and EnergyUK all refer to the delivery of I-SEM, or to the UK’s continued access to the IEM, as post-Brexit priorities for security of supply and or consumer protection. I-SEM is clearly a priority that must be preserved.While Brexit may present challenges and continuing uncertainty, there are certainly opportunities for investment and acquisition in the electricity market as more complex, specialist expertise will be required to effectively trade power on the I-SEM. Policy barriers or inaction cannot be allowed to prevent I-SEM from realising its potential of fully integrating the market by efficiently moving energy from producer to demand.Renewable incentive schemesDespite being on track to hit its target of % of electricity generation from renewables, Northern Ireland risks being left behind. The lack of a replacement for the development support mechanism, Renewables Obligations Certicateafter its closure in April , means Northern Ireland is lagging behind Great Britain which has established the Contract for Dference regime and Ireland, which has started work on its Renewable Electricity Support Scheme . While neither scheme is perfect, doing nothing is not an option. The devolution of energy presented Northern Ireland with the opportunity to shape its own policy but without a government, will the sector and the infrastructure be able to remain fit for purpose GasWith its development over the last  years, the gas network in Northern Ireland, with its low population density, must be seen as a success story. Consumers and businesses have been offered greater choice in terms of price and security of supply. Nevertheless there are certainly further opportunities for gas distributors and suppliers to expand the natural gas network, particularly in the west of the country and east Co Down. So despite the apparent obstacles and challenges, there is opportunity for development and progress in Northern Ireland’s energy sector. The benefits for Northern Ireland will be in terms of security of supply, price and environmental sustainability. Cleaver Fulton Rankin,  Bedford Street, Belfast BT FW.

The proposal for the work to Broadcasting House on Ormeau Avenue in Belfast was approved last March by the BBC board, with the announcement made to staff by the BBCs director general Lord Tony Hall. Now, the plans – which include the redevelopment of the exisiting BBC Broadcasting House building, including the refurbishment and extension of the buildings – will be put to the public, as part of a necessary pre-application event before planning can be submitted. It includes a new extension to the rear, including a landscaped plaza opening onto Linenhall Street. A spokesman for BBC Northern Ireland told Ulster Business: \"As part of the pre-planning application process, public consultation events will take place this month before we can move on to the next phase. The investment to BBC Broadcasting House in Belfast, announced in March last year, will transform the iconic building, its technology and facilities, highlighting the BBC’s commitment to audiences in Northern Ireland. We will share more detail in due course.\" Money invested will go towards structural work on the -year-old building to ensure its long-term sustainability, addressing what the state broadcaster has said are \"critical deficiencies\". Before the announcement last year that the BBC was to stay put and develop its existing building, it was understood the broadcaster had been eyeing up other city centre locations, or could create a new media hub in the Titanic Quarter. The event will take place at the Clayton Hotel on March , between pm and pm, and March  between pm and .pm.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20190201_0983.jpg","title":"pwc investing in people purpose and belfast","story":"Posted on Wednesday March  by Ulster Business Almost  years after it moved  staff and , paper files into Waterfront Plaza, PwC will move again – this time taking around , people and some very smart technology to Merchant Square in the heart of Belfast Just  months after being appointed to PwC’s national management board as head of UK regions, Paul Terrington, PwC’s NI regional chair, has no plans to reduce his commitment to keep growing the business locally.“This is an incredibly exciting time to be part of PwC. Since I took on the Northern Ireland role six years ago, we’ve doubled the workforce, become the fastest-growing UK region and are now the biggest office outside London with just over , people,” he says. “Our strategy was to be the leading provider of professional services in the Northern Ireland market but there’s no way we’d be the size we are now had we only focused on that.”Instead Paul built on the legacy of his predecessors and accelerated growth in new, technology solutions, while retaining the traditional accounting, tax and consulting services. Today PwC remains the leading provider of advisory services to the region’s family-owned and owner-managed businesses and multinationals, but has also built an impressive portfolio of cutting-edge technologies, opened the door to signicant export markets and is tackling some of society’s most challenging issues. “We’ve grown in many new areas – blockchain, cyber, cloud-based accounting services – but the single biggest impact has come from developing our distinctive ‘Operate’ ision,” Paul says. ”Operate is our service delivery business, which supports and delivers technology and people solutions to large, often regulated organisations. So instead of just advising clients how to solve their problems, we now do the heavy lting for them.”Run by Ian McConnell, a partner who’s been with the firm for  years, Operate is already attracting global attention. “Clients increasingly don’t want a consulting firm just to tell them what to do: they want a problem-solving partnership.” he says. “In its first year of operation, Operate earned over £m, now has , people and is still growing.”Reinforcing Paul’s confidence to invest in Northern Ireland as a strategic location is a  forecast from TheCityUK that it could become the second fastest-growing financial services region outside London by , helping deliver £bn of additional gross value-addedto the UK economy. But that depends on the ability to recruit the right talent, and he says the challenge now is finding and retaining the skills.That’s an issue that particularly concerns Paul as he looks ahead at the economic picture with Brexit and lack of an Assembly to the fore.“The business community wants clarity and certainty. Ideally we want to see a Brexit withdrawal agreement that then gives the scope for a trade deal that offers Northern Ireland the capacity to trade both with the EU and as part of the UK. The potential competitive advantages and ability to attract investment would be terric and the kind of economic accelerator which we have sought for years, but never managed to gain.“However I do worry about the impact of political stalemate on our long term future. Failure to invest, particularly in education and skills, will impair our competitiveness and make this a less attractive place for business.The decreasing effectiveness of health, environment and infrastructure will mean that talented people will opt to make choices to live their lives where.“In my national role, I see other parts of the country fusing partnerships in innovative and exciting ways between business,education and government. Compared to that, we are already getting left behind. We should be moving forward.”Which brings us to Merchant Square, the £m, , sq ft office development which PwC takes over in . “We have great people and one reason why we’re moving to the city centre is because that’s where they want to be. By the time we’re ready to relocate towards the end of , we will have at least , people moving in to the heart of Belfast.“That makes it important for Belfast too and not just because it’s the city’s biggest-ever private sector office deal. As we were making our decision, the whole Bank Buildings issue was at its height, and we wanted to show our support for the city and its future.” The Merchant Square relocation project is led by Kieragh Nelson, a director who joined the firm in . “We’ve got serious ambitions for Merchant Square,” she says. ”There’s a sense of ‘OK, we’ve just opened flagship offices in London, and Manchester – what more can we do in Belfast how can we make it even better ’ And the vast majority of decisions on how it will look, feel and work are made by the team here. Our goal is to create the most technologically-advanced, innovative and collaborative space for ourselves, our clients, and also for the communities around us.”Doing the right thing is a maxim often repeated in PwC, but it gets backed up. On the morning of our interview, a large group of people from the firm, including Paul, took part in one of their regular ‘Darkness Into Light’ walks to raise awareness of mental health. The firm’s commitment to social mobility has seen a number of employment programmes launched, notably the UK’s first technology degree apprenticeships, with Queen’s University one of five universities selected to run the programme. And it’s expanding its Hive Academy programme, which delivers free technology education to primary and secondary schools, to the Channel Islands.This year the firm challenged itself and created a unique charity partnership – the PwC Challenge – to create innovative suicide prevention programmes.“Our purpose is to build trust in society and solve important problems, and it really does feature in how we look at what we do. We strive to celebrate and share our knowledge widely and unselfishly with our people and communities and not be afraid to take a stand and do the right thing. And we put it at the heart of what we do every day. “Take the PwC Challenge: more people in Northern Ireland have died by suicide since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement than from the violence in the years before. This is a crisis, and it’s one which affects our people, and our communities. So we asked local charities in north and west Belfast, the worst affected areas in the UK, to collaborate and devise really innovative approaches programmes to give opportunities to young people and their families through education, technology, sports, and mental health coaching.“As well as the clubs in PwC which fundraise every year for the challenge, our own people are volunteering every week in ious projects – particularly with our Hive Academy. We want to ensure that people, who are high achievers in many dferent fields, are supported to play their fullest part in society.” For Paul, it’s all about the people. Last year PwC invested around £m on staff development here, and this year, a number of people have begun the first Masters in Operation service delivery, run by Ulster University. “It’s important to support people to develop their careers in ways they mightn’t have considered when they joined. That’s a key building block of our purpose – it drives social mobility, equality and ersity.“It’s true thatsomeone decides they want to head off and join PwC Australia or New York, they can. That’s the beauty of working for a global firm – those opportunities are there. But what I really want to make sure is that you don’t have to leave:you want to live and work in Belfast, and have global clients, work with cutting-edge technology and be part of a firm that’s engaged in society, you can do that too.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/eopen_1.jpg","title":"the open its the biggest thing since sliced bread","story":"Posted on Wednesday March  by Ulster Business With just  weeks until Northern Ireland hosts the biggest sporting event in its history, John Mulgrew speaks to the bosses tasked with organising the legendary Open Championship We’ve come a long way in just a short few years. Despite its huge golfing credentials, especially in the modern game, it had been more than  years since Northern Ireland played host to the Irish Open.That all changed in , when it ed north to Royal Portrush. And that, buoyed on a refreshed and renewed interest in both the tournament, and the sport itself.Now, in  weeks, that same links course will see more than , people flock to arguably the world’s greatest golf tournament and the largest sporting event ever hosted on these shores – The Open – transforming a small Co Antrim town for a handful of summer days.“There is a buzz with everyone at the RA,” Johnnie Cole-Hamilton tells Ulster Business. He’s executive director of championships at the RA – the ruling authority of golf throughout the world, aside from areas such as the US, and organisation responsible for organising The Open.“This will be my th Open Championship, and one reason I continue to be involved is that it’s a challenge every time.”It will see Irish golfing greats, including Open winners Rory McIlroy and Darren Clarke, Graeme McDowelland Padraig Harrington – among others – join the biggest name in sport, Tiger Woods.“One of big drivers to ing to Royal Portrush was the success of the Northern Irish and Irish golfers. They have raised the profile of golf immeasurably. “We are absolutely delighted with the response so far – % of tickets sold in  hours, and sold out within a record-breaking eight weeks.”Johnnie says the decision to choose Portrush, bringing it back to the course after a  year hiatus, was the correct one – buoyed by the support from the community, agencies and organisations. The th Open will be held at Royal Portrush from July -.“In my career, we had a similar scenario, ing to Liverpool for the first time in  years, and we had a very similar response. It ed in , and now Royal Liverpool is firmly on the rota, and I hope that Royal Portrush is similar.”Of course, aside from the golf, both the short-term and long-term economic benefits will trickle down and benefit, not on the surrounding areas, but prop Northern Ireland up on yet another global .According to Tourism NI chief executive John McGrillen that longer-term benefit could be worth up to £m for the wider economy.“There will be , tickets sold for championship days, and % of those sold to people out of state, outside Northern Ireland,” he tells Ulster Business.“It allows us to present an extremely positive image for Northern Ireland, and into key markets across the globe. We will never have experienced the opportunity to provide such a positive image of Northern Ireland. Despite what we might think, there are perception issues.“Northern Ireland has a normalised society and some of the most dramatic golf courses, scenery and landscape to see.“More specically, the fact that the Open will have been here, as one of the world’s top golf courses, will drive up the amount of spend, especially from golf tourism.”That alone makes up around % of Northern Ireland’s tourism intake. John says he wants that to grow to £m by . He says golfing visitors spend around four times that of an average tourist.Johnnie says all signs so far suggest that the Open in Portrush is “going to be an enormous” success. But the process hasn’t come without its challenges – namely theIrish Sea.“This is the first Open Championship we have hosted in my time, in which we have a body of water between our base and our contractor base. There’s getting things across water, and an enormous amount of work on the golf course – new holes, a new road system around the course and a tunnel for the players from one of the new greens to tee. You can’t do that without support from the golf club“The members have been hugely supportive, turning the course upside down, but maintaining integrity and enhancing .”He said, along with the blue light services, local authorities, council and tourism groups, the community in and around Portrush “understands that this will bring great benefits” to the area and Northern Ireland as a whole. “You can overcome dficulties with support,” he says.“Royal Portrush has never had more than , people drive to it, or get the train to it, at the same time. It’s a challenge to make sure we deliver a wonderful Open Championship and a spectator experience.”John McGrillen says the triumph in landing the Open itself was down to the success of the Irish Open in the last few years. “You had more than , people turning out at Portrush… visitor numbers had been dwindling.“That allows us to demonstrate that the course can deal with that many people. Everyoneworked very well, collectively, and that gave confidence to the RA that we would have the capacity to deliver it. The risk factors they had were eliminated because of the success of the Irish Open, and that was very critical.”As for boosting many of the hundreds of businesses in and around the area, John said: “It will do, as it’s showing off Northern Ireland… we have seen a big boost in the number of Americans playing golf. We don’t have to wait until after the event. “The visibility the Irish Open has given us. We have Royal County Down, Royal Portrush and Portstewart – that’s increased signicantly. It’s not just those courses which are benefiting – it’s being spread. People will typically stay in Belfast and travel around.”For John, the best outcome is, of course, an Irish winner. Oh, and clear skies. “A local winner would be phenomenal. It would be fantastic to see Rory win, or Tiger Woods.“If Tiger Woods won the Open in Portrush, that would remain in peoples’ memories forever. While we would love Rory or other locals to win, I would not be disappointed in Tiger winning it.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/pwc_1221.jpg","title":"pwc ni to crack  staff by ","story":"Posted on Thursday March  by Ulster Business PwC is set crack the , staff mark by the end of next year as it moves into its new £m offices in the heart of Belfast city centre, Ulster Business can reveal.Just  months after being appointed to PwC’s national management board as head of UK regions, Paul Terrington, PwC’s NI regional chair, has no plans to reduce his commitment to keep growing the business here.“This is an incredibly exciting time to be part of PwC. Since I took on the Northern Ireland role six years ago, we’ve doubled the workforce, become the fastest-growing UK region and are now the biggest office outside London with just over , people,” he says. “Our strategy was to be the leading provider of professional services in the Northern Ireland market but there’s no way we’d be the size we are now had we only focused on that.”Speaking about the move to its new headquarters in Merchant Square – a £m, , sq ft office – Mr Terrington said:“We have great people and one reason why we’re moving to the city centre is because that’s where they want to be. By the time we’re ready to relocate towards the end of , we will have at least , people moving in to the heart of Belfast.”On the current political uncertainty, he says: “The business community wants clarity and certainty. Ideally we want to see a Brexit withdrawal agreement that then gives the scope for a trade deal that offers Northern Ireland the capacity to trade both with the EU and as part of the UK. The potential competitive advantages and ability to attract investment would be terric and the kind of economic accelerator which we have sought for years, but never managed to gain.”Meanwhile, lettings in Belfast are expected to remain buoyant this year despite the uncertain political climate, according to a report from Lambert Smith Hampton. That’s been buoyed by PwC’s pre-letting of the Merchant Square development, which is currently under construction.

As Theresa May is due to bring her withdrawal deal back to Parliament next week, with less than a month to go before the March  deadline, a letter from the CBI, signed by  firms, calls on MPs to unite behind a way forward that avoids a hard border and protects peace and economic progress in Northern Ireland.  It says that “local businesses believe that the failure to approve a deal with Europe on the UK’s withdrawal from the EU will have signicant repercussions for the local economy\". “Such a scenario will both hinder indigenous and foreign direct investment, it would result in signicant job losses and will stle opportunities for the next generation across Northern Ireland.  “We therefore urge MPs across the UK to consider the damaging impact on Northern Ireland’s economy and political stability in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  “The peace and economic progress that flowed from the Belfast  Good Friday Agreement cannot be overlooked at this critical time in the UK’s history. All Members of Parliament must consider the burden of responsibility that they now carry for this region’s future.” Those putting their names to the open letter include aerospace giant Bombardier, which employs around , staff here, Danske Bank and First Trust, along with agribusinesses such as Devenish Nutrition, Fane Valley and Linden Foods.
