There’s no more dating between the two of you and you’re not verbally communicating, but they haven’t disappeared off the face of the earth.Instead they stay in your general orbit, lurking on your Instagram stories, clicking through your Snapchat, and retweeting your retweets, despite knowing that their observation is entirely visible.The thing is, while many of us may have an immediate reaction to such behaviour – ‘that is extremely weird’, for example – it’s such a new form of a post-dating relationship that there’s really no established etiquette to guide us.(Picture: )Facebook was created back in 2004, and we’re still not certain if we should unfriend our exes and delete all our tagged pictures together.Instagram stories only became a thing in 2016. It’s natural that we’re still navigating the appropriateness of silently watching the lives of people we dumped unfold with rants while walking and neon scrawled life updates.The move is called orbiting because it’s in that strange, floating in Space area. You’re close enough to see each other, but not to actually talk or touch.It can get unsettling over time, mostly because of the lack of feedback. You’re not sure if the person is watching your stories with well wishes and an appreciating of your dogspotting, or if they’re bitterly making fun of your selfies in front of your friends.It’s the lack of open communication that makes the whole thing feel strange, alongside your passivity in it. You’re just being silently watched by someone who’s entitled to do so as one of your followers. Is it really weird for them to watch your Stories if you’re posting them?(Picture: Getty)Thankfully, there are some solutions if you’re being orbited and feeling increasingly bothered.You can bring it up to the orbiter and ask what’s going on – do they know their views are visible, do they care, are they getting upset by what you’re uploading – but it’s worth noting that you might come off as being a touch too involved. It’s very easy for an orbiter to play the whole thing off as a casual thing, watching your Stories simply because they’re there with zero emotional attachment.You can block the person. That’s a clean social media break, but it might make you feel uneasy. While being orbited is a passive motion, hitting the block button feels more active, making a choice to cut off all communication.If the person goes to your account it’ll come up as private, so they’ll know what’s gone down. Make sure that if you’re blocking someone, communication’s already been firmly cut off – or your prepared to receive a ‘why did you block me?’ message.Good Sex Bad Sex podcast: Queerness \u0026amp comedy with comedian Sian DockseyThere’s the techy option. Instagram does actually allow you to hide your story from specific people, meaning they’ll never be able to lurk your daily ‘gram action again.Simply go to your profile, tap the settings button in the top right, tap ‘story settings’, and select ‘hide story from’. You can select as many exes as you fancy before pressing done. Easy.They’ll still be able to see your Instagram posts and won’t know your stories are out of their view, so there’ll be no more reminders that they’re always watching.And then there’s the attitude adjustment option.As we mentioned earlier, not everyone finds orbiting weird or creepy. You could also interpret it as supportive, or friendly, or being polite. If it’s not bothering you, it’s perfectly okay to allow your ex to exist in your orbit and add to your view count.MORE: One in three people with an allergy have had a bad experience on a planeMORE: Tinder couple believe meeting was ‘fate’ because they were born on the same day in the same hospital"},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/730133111.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all","title":"get free pint beer london today thanks free proper beer","story":"Get down the pub, pronto!

Having seen the short video clip - but without further details of the circumstances or for how long officers had been in the playground - we can\u0027t comment further.\u0027 "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/02/23/17/04D4BD9D000003E8-5353103-image-a-2_1519408331805.jpg","title":"Aviciis agent said DJ didnt understand value money asked stop performing","story":"    Manager: Arash \u0027Ash\u0027 Pournouri, seen with Avicii in 2013, \u0027discovered\u0027 the star in 2008 and began managing the then-17-year-old DJDespite a meteoric rise to success following the release of hit-single Le7els in 2011, Avicii announced in 2016 that he would not longer perform live, following years health problems caused by stress and alcohol abuse, as well as severe anxiety. Avicii: True Stories, released last year, shows several scenes which, in hindsight, makes for uncomfortable viewing.\u0027I said so many times - I\u0027m going to die\u0027: Avicii said he...Danish submarine inventor is jailed for life for murdering...Share this article    Harsh: The documentary sees Pournouri scornfully declare that Avicii \u0027doesn\u0027t understand the value of money\u0027 following the DJ\u0027s decision to stop touring for his health in 2016          Breakneck speed: The 28-year-old Swedish DJ and producer retired from performing live in 2016 following a battle with alcohol abuse and anxiety          True stories: The documentary, filmed by a friend of Avicii - whose real name was Tim Bergling - during four years, follows his rise to fame, struggle with success and subsequent retirementIn December 2016, six months after the Swedish EDM sensation\u0027s final show in Ibiza, Avicii and his longtime manager, and executive producer, parted ways.  Avicii\u0027s retirement came after a long-documented struggle with his health - both mentally and physically.In the documentary, Avicii, a self-confessed introvert, speaks frequently about using alcohol as a crutch to be able to perform, drinking every day during his hectic tour, and to help him with his crippling anxiety and stress.At the age of 21 he was diagnosed with acute pancreatitis - a potentially life-threatening inflammation of the pancreas - due in part to excessive drinking.In 2014, Bergling was again hospitalised and forced to have his gallbladder and appendix removed.Another scene from the documentary shows Avicii appearing to be on the verge of a panic attack as his management team tries to convince him not to cancel ten upcoming shows in Las Vegas.A member of his management team says: \u0027It’s probably harder to cancel these shows than to just do them.\u0027\u0027As long as you know it could cost you quite a lot.

What about the seriously ill teenagers and young people at Alder Hey?This case is consuming huge medical and legal resources as (increasingly) parents with terminally ill children (like the tragic case of Charlie Gard at Great Ormand Street) challenge experts and demand the right to intervene.I do not have children, so you might think I can’t speak from experience - but that’s not the case.            The family of terminally ill toddler Alfie Evans have released pictures of the little boy clinging to life in his mother\u0027s arms 10 hours after his life support was removedI married a wonderful man whose 7 year old son had suffered brain damage shortly after birth, a condition that was not immediately spotted by the hospital. My step-son had an operation to reverse the fluid on his brain, but was left with disabilities and learning difficulties.Bunny was a wonderful child, and his condition wasn’t life-threatening - he went to a special school and loved music.Aged 11, he was rushed to hospital with suspected appendicitis - following an exploratory operation the doctors told us he had terminal stomach cancer.He died two weeks later, after the longest fortnight of my life.Unlike Alfie’s mum and dad, my husband and his former partner did not attack the doctors and question their diagnosis, they did not demand surgery (having been told the cancer was too advanced).My job was to comfort and support my husband through this nightmare - with its inevitable painful conclusion.Piers Morgan says that in Alfie’s case ‘love must prevail’ and that the doctors should let the parents do whatever they want.That is nonsensical - this is not a war between right and wrong, and that position implies that doctors will never love a child as much as parents.Doctors take an oath to always act in the best interests of a patient - and Alfie’s interests have been represented separately in court.Alfie’s quality of life is paramount - and for his father to say ‘he’s breathing, he’s not suffering’ yesterday after he was taken off a ventilator is plainly wishful thinking.It denies the hard reality that sometimes a doctor will know your child better than you, and understand medical suffering better than you.If you are truly religious and believe in an afterlife, then you will not fear death and nor should you project fear onto a child.Death is inevitable, and the limited time remaining before Alfie’s death should be a quiet time to celebrate his life and treasure these moments forever, not make plans to whisk him away to another country on a wild goose chase.The hardest thing in the world is to let go, to accept that there’s nothing more you can do except give love.My husband managed to do that - at tremendous cost - and I wish that Tom and Kate could put their child first and do the same."},{"url":null,"title":"Fleetwood Mac tour Tickets dates announced Lindsey Buckinghams departure","story":"Golden State Killer: Everything you need to know about the caseFleetwood Mac tour: Tickets and dates announced after Lindsey Buckingham\u0027s departureKate Middleton: Why don\u0027t we call her the Duchess of Cambridge?Kevin Feige reveals Captain Marvel details at Avengers: Infinity War premiereIs Miami Heat\u0027s Dwyane Wade retiring from the NBA?Inside the secrets of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#8217s weddingWho is Meek Mill and why was he in prison?

Par for the course.After mention of both Mrs May and Home Secretary Amber Rudd, Mr Corbyn screamed: ‘Is it not time she took responsibility and resigned?’ It was not clear who that ‘she’ referred to – Theresa or Amber? Miss Rudd, brightening momentarily, pointed between herself and the PM, as if to say ‘which of us do you want to resign, mate?’Questions about the customs union came from the SNP’s Westminster leader, Ian Blackford (who does not deserve the rude groans which greet him every week), and a couple of Tory Brexiteers, Richard Drax (S Dorset) and Julian Lewis (New Forest E). Mrs May’s replies on this matter were a little less emphatic than they had been in the past.But Mr Lewis did eventually get her to say the following: ‘I am very happy to confirm what I have always said – no deal is better than a bad deal. Being in a customs union means we would not be able to negotiate our own trade deals around the rest of the world and we want to be able to do that.           Diane Abbott responding to a statement by Home Secretary Amber Rudd in the House of CommonsAs I saw at the Commonwealth meeting, there is considerable interest around the rest of the world in being able to have those independent trade deals.’ Pin that on your fridge door and let’s see if she keeps to that position in a few months’ time.Not a single MP asked about the sad case of Alfie Evans, the desperately ill little boy whose family were told by the courts that they must not take him abroad for further medical treatment.Perhaps it was too distressing a subject for parliamentary debate at this time. But does it not raise unresolved arguments about the power of the state versus the freedom of parents? When that state power becomes caught up with doctors, does this affect how we see medics? Do they become family doctors or state doctors?Liz McInnes (Lab, Heywood \u0026amp Middleton) asked about Government policies on making us less fat.

Brussels wants British holidaymakers to...Share this articleIn the Thirties, Lawaszeck\u0027s scheme foundered for practical reasons: those giant turbines would have required 27,500 tons of steel each, approaching the amount used in the battleship Scharnhorst.Today, though, huge turbines, even bigger than the ones Lawaszeck envisaged, can be built more efficiently using tubular steel and concrete (for the towers) and carbon fibre (for the blades). At last, the era of Big Wind is upon us, with a new generation of turbines that are bigger — and create more electricity — than ever before.          Danish firm LM Wind Power, a supplier of components to the industry, has since 2016 offered blades 290ft (88.4 metres) long — bigger than the wing of an Airbus A380, or nearly twice the length of an Olympic-sized swimming poolDanish firm LM Wind Power, a supplier of components to the industry, has since 2016 offered blades 290ft (88.4 metres) long — bigger than the wing of an Airbus A380, or nearly twice the length of an Olympic-sized swimming pool.Perched on a rotor, they will sweep an area the size of three football pitches and — according to the manufacturer — pull the same weight as 16 African elephants, and each year produce electricity equivalent to the annual consumption of \u0027around 10,000 homes — that\u0027s a whole town\u0027.Which may sound like a lot except that you would require about 7,500 such turbines to supply the UK at peak time, and in any case, the intermittent nature of wind can\u0027t generate an uninterrupted supply to a single house.These monsters, however, will shortly be dwarfed by the world\u0027s biggest turbine model — the Haliade-X 12 MW — which will soon be tested by GE Renewable Energy at Blyth, Northumberland.Standing 853ft (260 metres) tall with 351ft-long blades (107 metres), it will produce electricity equal to the annual consumption of 16,000 homes. The size of such a turbine will make it too obtrusive to site on land. But one possibility is that it could be erected in large numbers far offshore, in an area such as Dogger Bank — a shallow stretch of the North Sea about 60 miles off the coast.This is the proposed location of a giant wind farm being developed by the Dutch firm TenneT.          Standing 853ft (260 metres) tall with 351ft-long blades (107 metres), it will produce electricity equal to the annual consumption of 16,000 homesWith a man-made island to house its substations, and many hundreds of turbines, it could theoretically have a capacity as huge as 30GW (gigawatts), though because of its low productivity it would still only generate energy equal to about a third of the UK\u0027s needs, and would contribute little, or nothing, to security of supply.What does this all mean for the future of energy? If wind power\u0027s advocates are to be believed, something extraordinary.The average power capacity needed to meet electricity demand at any moment for the UK is 36GW, with a summer low in the 20s and a winter peak of 62GW.So that 30GW Dogger Bank project alone — if it ever comes to fruition — ought nearly to be enough to supply much of Britain\u0027s electricity needs.Imagine: no more \u0027dirty\u0027 fossil fuel power just thousands of offshore turbines swishing in the distance, generating free, \u0027low carbon\u0027 electricity until the end of time.So runs the theory. But then, as with so many utopian schemes, there are huge catches — starting with the eye-watering cost.Electricity produced by onshore wind costs twice as much as conventional gas-fired electricity generation offshore wind three times as much. The only reason the wind industry is viable is because of the massive subsidies it receives. Subsidies raised silently from your energy bill.British Gas has said that by the end of this year, green taxes will add a fifth to the average fuel bill. Iain Conn, boss of parent company Centrica, said: \u0027It is going to be, in our estimates, about £200 on everyone\u0027s bill which is getting on for 20 per cent.\u0027By 202021, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the total cost of all the subsidies for renewable electricity will be nearly £11 billion a year, and wind power will be taking more than half of that. And don\u0027t be taken in by that ad campaign by Greenpeace and a coalition of environmental groups and electricity suppliers last year, claiming that the cost of wind energy is plummeting to the point where it\u0027s now cheaper than fossil fuel power.No it\u0027s not. The ads were withdrawn as the result of a successful complaint to the Advertising Standards Authority, because they were deliberately misleading propaganda, based on projected costs, not real, current figures.In fact, Professor Gordon Hughes, of the University of Edinburgh, and his colleagues showed in a recent study published by the Global Warming Policy Foundation think-tank, that the capital costs of new offshore wind farms do not appear to be falling and indeed appear to be still rising as wind projects move into deeper waters.This new generation of mega-turbines, we\u0027re told by green advocates, will solve most of these problems. Bigger blades and taller towers mean they\u0027ll be able to capture the more plentiful wind that blows at higher altitudes, unlike the smaller turbines beset by \u0027low wind days\u0027 (one in every 5.6 days according to energy union GMB) when they\u0027re generating little, if any, power. Thus they will become more cost-effective.Also, being far out at sea, they won\u0027t alienate all those rural voters who can\u0027t stand having wind turbines industrialising the countryside, disturbing their sleep and killing bats and birds.Despite its huge cost, offshore wind remains a vital part of the Government\u0027s energy strategy — its best hope of meeting its EU-driven CO2 reduction obligations, under the 2008 Climate Change Act. But according to John Constable, of the Renewable Energy Foundation, this is a chimera.          So that 30GW Dogger Bank project alone — if it ever comes to fruition — ought nearly to be enough to supply much of Britain\u0027s electricity needsWind energy, he says, will never be a solution because of \u0027fundamental physics: wind, by its nature, is a low density and intermittent flow of energy. Correcting those deficiencies to supply reliable electricity to consumers means huge capital expense in the turbines and in the electricity system as a whole\u0027.Making turbines bigger and putting them out at sea only makes things worse. They are much more expensive to erect and maintain in a remote, hostile environment, and have a much shorter working life.Analysts have known for years that rising repair costs would mean the economic lifetimes of turbines were way under the 25 years promised by the industry.In February this year, Danish offshore wind operator Ørsted admitted it might have to repair the blades of more than 600 turbines, after just a few years on the water, at a cost of about £1million per turbine.And the bigger they are, the worse this is going to get, for all sorts of reasons.These machines are already dealing with large forces, putting huge loads on their components. Making them bigger just increases the problem, and not just because of increased weight. Wind shear — the difference in wind speed at different heights — leads to uneven loading at the top and bottom of the blade radius and causes huge strain on the working parts. This is really difficult and very expensive engineering.Then there\u0027s the erosion of the blades, due to high-speed impacts with small particles, dust, ice and salt. Ørsted is replacing those blades because their edges had become rough, and as any engineer will tell you, when a wing gets rough it becomes unstable.Then there\u0027s the wind industry\u0027s dirty little secret: according to some concerned ecologists, those spinning blades could be killing millions of birds and protected bats every year.In Spain alone, one survey estimated, up to 330 birds and 670 bats are killed per turbine per year a survey in Sweden put the bird death toll as high as 895 per turbine. The wind industry denies these estimates, which are hard to confirm, not least because the areas below the turbines where the bodies might be found are often jealously guarded.But those figures are for onshore wind turbines. It\u0027s likely that fewer birds are killed offshore because they are more scarce.Indeed, according to a recent study at Vattenfall\u0027s Thanet wind farm seven miles off the coast of Kent, just six collisions were recorded on video and radar over a two-year period — an average of one every four months.The industry (which funded the Vattenfall study) is desperately trying to persuade us all that there isn\u0027t a problem. But the RSPB, which has historically leaned over backwards to help the industry, is finally losing patience and has just rejected the latest impact study.Concerns have also been raised about the damage done to other marine wildlife by offshore wind turbines. There is evidence to suggest the turbines\u0027 lower frequency noise is disrupting the sonar of whales and dolphins, causing them to beach and die. Another offshore wind farm was implicated in the death of baby seals found stillborn on the beach nearby.But if wind is really so expensive, inefficient and environmentally damaging, why does our Government remain so committed to it?Largely because of the lobbying of a hugely powerful industry. An industry desperate not to lose its extraordinarily generous subsidies.For example the (mostly foreign) owners of the London Array — the largest wind farm in the world, off the coast of Kent, which was opened by David Cameron in 2013 — receives about £190 million a year in subsidies, on top of selling electricity they make. That sort of windfall, forgive the pun, ensures the industry presses its case with ruthless efficiency.It is now under real pressure. The Treasury has put a moratorium on new subsidies until the middle of the next decade at the earliest, and the wind industry is trying to survive by pretending that falling generation costs have made them economically viable. Secretly, they are hoping for a change of policy (Jeremy Corbyn?) and a stonking carbon tax.This latest propaganda about \u0027bigger\u0027, \u0027better\u0027, \u0027faster\u0027 new mega-turbines is designed to keep us and the politicians in the industry\u0027s thrall.Even now, they are building the new biggest wind farm in the world, called Hornsea Project One, off the Yorkshire coast. It will have 174 turbines over a 240-square mile area, each 620ft high (189 metres). And that\u0027s before we get on to Hornsea Projects Two and Three, which are already in the pipeline and which, you can bet, will be still larger and with even more monstrous turbines.As the Renewable Energy Foundation\u0027s John Constable explains: \u0027All this is designed to give the illusion that there has been massive technological progress in the industry when in fact the major problems remain unsolved: the energy in the wind is of low quality. Turning it into high quality, reliable energy for the consumer is still very expensive indeed.\u0027Yet the propaganda often finds a ready audience because so many want to believe, against all the evidence, that wind must be a preferable alternative to our gas-fired turbines, vanishing set of coal-fired plants or ageing nuclear reactors.We don\u0027t want to hear about the intermittency of the wind, which makes it so problematic as a reliable source of power for an advanced economy and means we need alternative generating capacity as well.Nor about all the pollution — and extra CO2 — generated by the gas-fired back-up for when the wind\u0027s not blowing. Nor all those birds and bats being killed. Nor the capitalist fat-cats getting rich off all the subsidies we have to pay them.As those Nazis believed in the Thirties, so today\u0027s Greens — and the attendant climate industry — would have us believe today: that wind is the kinder, cheaper, cleaner, more natural solution to our energy problems.Well, it isn\u0027t. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/03/26/10/4A90B2F400000578-0-image-a-20_1522055311213.jpg","title":"British adults internet double time did 10 years ago","story":"    Ofcom has said that for many people not having the internet would be a threat to their livelihood Nine in ten adults are now online – including 96 per cent of those under 55 and 98 per cent of those aged 16 to 24. Smartphones are the most popular device for surfing the web, meaning we are more connected than ever before – not just using the internet at home or work.Ofcom\u0027s Adults Media Use and Attitudes report said: \u0027Whereas in previous years being without internet access would have been an irritating inconvenience, some would now consider it a threat to their livelihood.\u0027As reliance on the net increases \u0027people need the skills to question and make judgements about their online environment\u0027, Ofcom warned.The secret to happiness?

I had just got my first car: an enormous 1999 Crown Victoria, an ex-police car I bought off a Russian cab-driver in North Hollywood for $900. Why Philly? I had a mate living there, so with my new wheels I figured this was an ideal time to hit the road and see the country. It turned out to be fairly gruelling. I’d miscalculated the distance – and the quality of my vehicle – so what I thought would be a three-day drive was a solid five-day slog with little time for stopping. It was intense: a foot-down, white-knuckle, bald-tyres, 4,000-mile drive.Minneapolis was one of the few stops I made, four days in. It was a crisp Sunday morning and I decided to go for a wander with my camera. The streets were empty. It was a ghost town: there was nothing catching my eye. Then I turned a corner and was met with this scene in front of the courthouse: barristers marching around and maybe 60 or 70 Muslims milling about, the women separate from the men. I had no idea what was going on but things seemed a little tense.I knew I only had seconds to get this shot. I walked towards them, lifted my camera and managed to get one photo before they got up and moved. You can see in the image that the women in black look like they’re trying to hide – they weren’t happy I was taking a picture. The one in pink didn’t move, though. She just stared right back at me, which I think is what makes the image interesting. To me, she serves as a bridge: at a time when there is so much Islamophobia and judgment in the western world towards Muslims, it was a moment of connection.Later that day, I looked into what had been happening: it turned out a couple of Somali Americans had been accused of funnelling money to some extremist groups in Somalia. The court was in session and this group of women were the wives, family and friends of the men involved.I don’t trawl the streets looking for this kind of thing, but the subject matter is as interesting as the composition itself. I didn’t crop it, although I may have straightened up some of those lines. Taking photos of people when they don’t want you to isn’t my favourite thing. And the truth is, most people don’t want you to take their photo. But if you ask someone, often you lose whatever it was you wanted to capture. And there’s the rub. You can say that it’s in the cause of art, and this noble profession of documenting the world, which is an important thing to do. But I don’t think that gives you licence to do whatever you like. The key here was proximity: I was maybe 70ft away. I wasn’t in these people’s faces. I don’t think I was making them physically uncomfortable. I’m happy to photograph people from a distance.There are, of course, brilliant American photographers capturing life in the US. But personally, I’ve always been triggered by being in a foreign place. I am more likely to be analytical, to notice every little thing.

Showing the work of 15 leading international photographers in unique locations, this year’s theme, Up, centres on a subtle call to action. The festival’s directors, Lucille Reyboz and Yusuke Nakanishi, say participants were asked to illustrate how social change can be encouraged through self-awareness, action and creation.The use of unusual architectural spaces, from a disused printing works to the sanctuary of a temple, gives the festival a distinct flavour and adds another atmospheric dimension to each photographer’s work.The South African-born photographer’s installation, presented in a former ice factory and anchored by a series of portraits and video exploration of devastated living spaces, seeks to connect people affected by flooding and the catastrophic impact of industrial and environmental change. The Tidelines series is a collection of water-damaged photographs that provide a moving testament to the memories of family life before the floods.Exhibited in the depths of the disused ice factory is the astonishingly personal work by Alberto Garcia-Alix. Renowned for his raw, hedonistic portraiture, the maverick Spanish photographer’s early images focus on some of the people in his life. The photos set the scene for a dreamlike, retrospective film that is woven together with video, still images and his poetic narration, detailing a life led against the grain of convention and the lost aspirations of youth.Regarded as one of the most radical and influential photographers of his generation, the Fukase retrospective is a festival highlight. The extensive exhibition features the acclaimed series Ravens, which explores the artist’s battle with depression, as well as his vivid photographs showing the wild side of his beloved cat, Sasuke. The jewel in the crown is his early colour work, which was previously published but never exhibited. Viewed in its entirety, the Fukase display gives a deeper understanding of the variety and complexity of the photographer’s work.Izumi Miyazaki, one of the rising stars of the festival, is also the star of her work. Reminiscent of Magritte, at first glance her vivid use of colour and character seems whimsical, but her intent is a serious exploration of surrealism that leaves the viewer charmed and unsettled in equal measure. Miyazaki draws inspiration from her daily life, including what she has eaten.The Kyoto central wholesale market is the inspired venue for K-Narf’s tribute to the proud work ethic that is respected in Japanese culture. On the opening day of the festival, the photographer’s almost lifesize portraits of market traders caused a stir of excitement as members of the local community recognised their friends and colleagues. The project is centred on the local people and preserving their respect for the next generation, K-Narf says."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cceb2f32f9554db8d05b832a1b87a97ea6e03550/130_86_1250_750/master/1250.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=16b03be924c52495172d139cbed51f6e","title":"james cook the voyages british library review","story":"British Library, LondonWork by ill-fated illustrators aboard Captain Cook’s first journey to the Pacific sit alongside revelatory images by a Polynesian high priest in this haunting exhibitionSydney Parkinson drew the weird animal in a clear sharp line, looking at it carefully, then looking again, erasing his mistakes until he had an image that was beautifully recognisable. He wondered what to call this creature that was so utterly unlike anything back home in Britain. He found out by speaking with local people and making a brief dictionary of their language. You can picture, from the British Library’s moving and absorbing account of a moment when worlds apart suddenly met – how they communicated by pointing at parts of their bodies: words like belly, hand, foot.Among these basic terms is the name of the creature Parkinson drew. He transcribes it as “kangooroo”. It means, he says, “the leaping quadruped”. What he heard was probably the word “gangurru”, which is indeed the name of a type of kangaroo in the language of the Guugu Yimithirr people who James Cook, his crew, and the artists and scientists they took to the far side of the world met when they landed at the place they named Endeavour River.As an attempt to give an Australian species an Indigenous Australian name, kangooroo isn’t bad. Parkinson’s drawing – the first ever made by a European – is just one of his sensitive scientific images of flora and fauna including a great white shark. The adventure cost him his life: he died (of disease, not a shark bite) on the Endeavour’s voyage home. Another artist, Alexander Buchan, who portrayed the people of Tierra del Fuego, had died earlier in the voyage. The fact that artists, as well as scientists such as the pioneering naturalist Joseph Banks, went on Cook’s voyages was unprecedented. There were none on the ships of Columbus or Cabot. Cook’s first voyage went to Tahiti so a team of astronomers could observe the transit of Venus. They were not there to conquer. They got on well with the Tahitians – too well for Cook, who worried the newcomers would spread venereal disease and was upset when satirists back home had fun with the romantic exploits of Mr Banks.Banks’s friendship with the Tahitian female chieftain Purea led to the most unexpected of the expedition’s artworks. Tupaia, high priest of the god of war, was part of Purea’s retinue. He not only became a translator for the English, but also started to record Tahitian life and beliefs in bold, compelling drawings. When the Endeavour sailed on to New Zealand he went too, and portrayed their encounters with Maori people.Tupaia’s picture of Banks meeting a Maori, done in 1769, is one of the most eye-opening records of cultural encounter you could ever hope to see. For Tupaia, Banks and the Maori are foreign and fascinating. Banks in his blue coat is giving the New Zealander a piece of cloth in exchange for a big, red lobster. “I had a firm fist on the lobster,” remembered Banks. Tupaia also died on the Endeavour’s return to Britain.Given the death rate of the Endeavour’s artists, it’s amazing that an up-and-coming painter, William Hodges, risked it all to go Cook’s second voyage. Not only would he survive, but he proved an accomplished, ambitious artist. His panoramic sketches of war canoes massing off Tahiti and a Polynesian vessel at sea are great works of art that anticipate JMW Turner – but Turner never went to the Pacific. His pictures of the Resolution and the Adventure isolated in the vast black seas of the Antarctic circle, menaced by towering icebergs, are even more daunting.Suddenly, you see how far Cook sailed, how extreme the risks these 18th-century explorers took in their frail wooden ships. Hodges in Antarctica painted the most unearthly journey anyone had ever made. His icy sketches are as incredible as images sent back today by the furthest space probes. But they were made by a human being shivering on a sailing ship with no radio, no contact with home, in a sea with no mercy. “We were the first that ever burst  Into that silent sea,” as Coleridge was to write in 1798, as if dreaming of these images by Hodges. Did Romanticism start in Antarctica?This exhibition sets the remarkable artistic legacy of these voyages alongside a mass of documents from the original journals of Cook and Banks, the beautiful charts the captain made and to some of the first examples of Pacific art ever collected by Europeans.By the end you feel dwarfed by the immensity of the world they sailed and haunted by the faces of the peoples they encountered. The violence of imperialism was coming. Yet this was a moment when strangers looked at one another with open eyes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/01dc1cb9a86473678ee4cd229a498adab2eeff50/0_0_2000_1333/master/2000.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=4aef35935d1db4f45e182b266541d642 1400w","title":"george rr martin winds winter not coming 2018 sixth volume game thrones targaryen","story":"But it won’t be The Winds of Winter, the planned sixth volume of the series. Instead author has revealed a history of the Targaryen dynasty, due in NovemberGeorge RR Martin told fans today that the long-awaited sixth volume in his Game of Thrones fantasy series, The Winds of Winter, would not be published this year – but softened the blow by revealing that his “imaginary history” of the Targaryen family in Westeros would be released on 20 November.Fire and Blood is set 300 years before the events of A Song of Ice and Fire and, said its publishers Bantam and Voyager, will chronicle “the Targaryen civil war that nearly ended their dynasty forever”. In a post on his blog, Martin described the book as his “the GRRMarillion (or the first half of it, at least) that is to say, my version of Tolkien’s mammoth history of Middle Earth”, and revealed it ran to almost 1000 manuscript pages. He first mentioned the volume, the first of a planned two histories of Westeros, last summer, saying at the time that he was not sure if it, or The Winds of Winter, would be released first in 2018.Today, he confirmed that fans would have to content themselves with the history, for this year at least. The fifth book in the sequence on which the hit HBO series Game of Thrones is based, A Dance With Dragons, was published in 2011, with the television series now taking Martin’s characters far beyond the places they have reached in the books.“No, winter is not coming … not in 2018, at least. You’re going to have to keep waiting for The Winds of Winter. You will, however, be able to return to Westeros this year,” Martin said today. He stressed to fans that the book was not a new slice of narrative fiction set in the Game of Thrones world. “I do want to stress... indeed, I want to shout... that Fire and Blood is not a novel. This is not a traditional narrative and was never intended to be… let’s call this one ‘imaginary history’ instead. The essential point being the ‘history’ part. I love reading popular histories myself, and that’s what I was aiming for here,” he wrote on his blog. “So: not a novel. Everyone clear on that? (Though there are enough stories here for twenty novels. Battles, bloodshed, betrayals, love, lust, horror, religious wars, politics, incest, historical revisionism, all the fun stuff).”The book, he revealed on his blog, would cover “all the Targaryen kings from Aegon I (the Conquerer) to the regency of Aegon III (the Dragonbane), along with their wives, wars, siblings, children, friends, rivals, laws, travels, and sundry other matters … Oh, and there are dragons too. Lots of dragons.”Voyager and Bantam described the book as the “definitive history of the Targaryens in Westeros”. “Readers may have glimpsed small parts of this narrative before, in The World of Ice and Fire and various anthologies, but the full tapestry of Martin’s history of the Targaryens is revealed here for the first time,” said the publishers, who will release the book on 20 November, with 75 new illustrations from the artist Doug Wheatley.Martin did not reveal if the prequels to Game of Thrones which are currently being developed by HBO would be based on material from Fire and Blood. “It’s a logical question. The only answer I can give is… ah, well, no one is sure yet, and anyway, I am not allowed to say. So let’s move that to the side,” adding: “As for me, I’m returning once again to The Winds of Winter.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d8517c4e13eff9cb8c5b17d931f7f0ea97da658/0_214_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f3cec38d9ac9a6aefbe4d7bf4d345a84","title":"steven pooles word of the week","story":"Theybe is the hip new thing for parents who want to bring up their offspring in gender-neutral fashion. Bring on the theycare Babies are so passe, even royal ones. The hip new thing to have is a “theyby”, according to a trend spotted by New York magazine that sees parents bringing up their offspring in a gender-neutral fashion.There was of course nothing gender-specific about the “ba-“ part of “baby”, which is already a diminutive form of the original English word “babe”. The Oxford English Dictionary says that its origin is probably onomatopoeic – two syllables of “ba”, which is a typical “early infantile vocalisation”. So while a baby can call itself a baba, even if by accident, it will take much longer to pronounce itself a “theyby”.So “theyby” here points to the desired attitude of others, rather than removing any bias from the traditional description of the object in question. (It is often unimportant whether such bias really existed anyway: replacing “mankind” with “humankind” hurts no one.)Meanwhile, the possibilities for today’s theybies seem endless. If they need looking after they can go to theycare.

Now his shy fans are sharing their Avicii momentsI did not know Tim Bergling, the 28-year-old Swede who died on 20 April. But I knew Avicii well. His bouncy, blatant electronic dance music – how you imagine strobe lights might sound – was the soundtrack to my first few years at university. In 2011, whether you were drinking cheap wine out of a mug in someone’s room, or amid a heaving mass of strangers at the same grimy nightclub you went to every week, or eating pizza outside afterwards, it was only a matter of time before you heard his breakout hit Levels. Often, you would hear it more than once, as DJs, buoyed by the joyous reaction its opening bars elicited, tried their luck to see if the same trick would work twice. It usually did.There was such appetite for Levels that, when the rapper Flo Rida sampled it on Good Feeling just a month after its release, his take also topped the charts. The song was ubiquitous in the way only a smash-hit single can be, the kind that makes a specific time and place feel written into the music. Many of Avicii’s songs were like that: Wake Me Up, You Make Me, Hey Brother, Addicted to You, X You, I Could Be the One.He often paired an upbeat acoustic guitar riff with an unlikely vocal – a 1962, gospel-inspired Etta James sample on Levels the neo-soul singer Aloe Blacc on Wake Me Up an uncredited Adele soundalike (Audra Mae) on Addicted to You – before launching into his trademark frantic synths, irrespective of whether the song had sounded like it was heading in that direction.I now struggle to tell these songs apart, at least until the drop kicks in – but they were never meant to be heard by an inidual, through tinny earbuds, in the daytime. These were the songs of Saturday night, 2011-14. If you are in your 20s now and went to a nightclub, music festival, house party or shopping centre between mid-2011 and early 2012, the chances are you had an Avicii moment, whether you recognised it at the time or not.There is a particular snobbishness towards Avicii’s brand of big, unabashed EDM that relates to the notion that music of value cannot be computer-generated or enormously popular, but the same distaste is generally not applied to Daft Punk, for example, or Taylor Swift. His is the kind of music that is readily dismissed as something you “press a button on a laptop” to make. (Would that such a button existed!)Even now, when the ide between high and low culture is being smoothed out and there is said to be no such thing as a guilty pleasure, you may be more likely to “own up” to liking Levels than to declare it proudly (you might just sequester it on your gym playlist). But Avicii’s music was that rare thing in a world where culture has atomised: the soundtrack to moments of pure, collective euphoria.When, in 2013, Bergling was asked how he felt about criticisms of his music being “too mainstream”, he did not engage with the charge. “I’ve always been mainstream,” he said. “I don’t see it as something negative at all.” By defining the sound of that period, Avicii gave us a way to access it years later. Many of the bars where I first heard Levels have closed down and been reborn as nicer joints – but the opening bars take me straight back there, to Hope Bros and Temperance, to flashing lights and the first flushes of independence and something resembling adulthood. For a friend I had dinner with after news broke of Bergling’s death, the song evoked her last years of high school. We had never spoken about Avicii before, and certainly would never have introduced ourselves as fans – but I suppose I had known innately, by virtue of our ages, that it was likely to be something we shared. That is part of the joy of popular culture when it is properly popular: you are in it with everybody else.My pick for bon mot of the decade? “I hate when I’m on a flight and I wake up with a water bottle next to me like oh great now I gotta be responsible for this water bottle.” That or: “What do I have to do to get a simple persian rug with cherub imagery uuuuugh.”Both are tweets sent by Kanye West in 2010, the first and golden age of Twitter that West played a fundamental role in creating. The platform seemed purpose-built to accommodate his mile-a-minute inner monologue (“Sometimes I get emotional over fonts” “I would like to thank Julius Caesar for originating my hairstyle”) and soon he had tens of millions hanging on his every 140-character observation.But, like many Twitter users, West was clearly conflicted about the platform, deleting his entire oeuvre in 2012 on what NME called “a black day for anyone who enjoys the gushing firehose of randomness and arrogance”.Now he is back (greeted with a hero’s welcome by Twitter founder Jack Dorsey) and apparently in the mood to inspire. “Constantly bringing up the past keeps you stuck there.” “Everyone should be their own biggest fan.” “Prince opened up for Rick James. everybody starts some where.” “You can say anything as long as you put the right emoji next to it.”I have not gone to see the pride of London, the fatberg, on display. I am left cold by the idea. But the seemingly bottomless interest in fatbergs, evinced most recently by Channel 4’s “autopsy from the sewers”, suggests I am in the minority. The most generous explanation for this national fascination is that it allows us to confront the physical impact of our single-use, plastic-is-fantastic society. But my sense is that it is more about voyeurism and our childish glee in being revolted – the same impulse that, when we smell something bad, leads us to urge others to smell it, too. To reiterate: no thanks."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf2946189e1aac8c052383a974efa9ecf1c84908/0_154_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=814a8f1398ea8b3b9f925df9cc483f63","title":"hostile environment britain disabled people windrush benefits","story":"The injustice of the Windrush scandal will be terrifyingly familiar to anyone who has gone through the benefits systemThe unfolding Windrush immigration scandal has reached a height few political events do. Glance at even the Daily Mail seemingly defending immigrants and it’s clear the story has evoked something deeper than any pro-migrant discussion: a sense of betrayal of that so-called British value of fairness. After all, these are long-term UK residents who arrived as children here in the 1960s, being treated as near criminals because of an immigration policy dreamed up decades later. It’s as if the rules were changed midway through the game. Except this is neither a mistake nor an anomaly, as even the former cabinet minister Sayeeda Warsi has suggested.While Theresa May’s government may be positioning Windrush victims as having fallen foul of a terrible administrative error, the fact is that the British state actually treats immigrants generally with disdain, rather than giving them a fair hearing – and this is what enabled the Windrush scandal to happen.Amber Rudd has now offered British citizenship to those affected, as if the government is generously giving them “greater rights” in a move of fair compensation, rather than delivering something the Windrush generation had a right to all along. But this phantom of fairness goes beyond the Home Office to other government departments. In fact, it is rooted in multiple policies affecting hundreds of thousands of people across the country as we speak.Take the social security system, itself defined by an increasingly “hostile environment”. That May is said to have encouraged Britain to adopt a “deport first, appeal later” ethos for immigrants will sound terrifyingly familiar to anyone going through the benefits assessment system – a system marked by “remove people’s income first, appeal later”. (To date, two-thirds of appeals are won by claimants.)In recent years, politicians have proudly promoted the reformed benefit system as fairly reaching the “really disabled”, all the while overseeing assessments that are so faulty people with Down’s syndrome are asked when they “caught it”.That’s someone with severe depression, or battling multiple sclerosis exhaustion, left to take on a long, complex legal case against the government alone. It results in a disability benefit system tilted in one side’s favour: create an assessment that’s proved to wrongly deny disabled people benefits, and then deprive them of the legal aid they need to have a chance to win them back.Or look at the benefit sanction system. This month MPs launched another inquiry into the policy of removing unemployed people’s benefits for supposed infractions – a policy that has been proved to cause destitution, and to be issued trivially for no real benefit. Meanwhile, the pot of money that jobcentre staff are meant to use to help jobseekers into work – say, bus fare to a training course or a suit for a job interview – has been cut by tens of millions of pounds since 2010.With no sense of irony, the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) says the changes are part of wider welfare reform “which is restoring fairness to the system”. Whether it’s towards disabled people, jobseekers, or immigrants, the default position of those with power is vilification and suspicion under the guise of “doing the right thing”.I call it rigged Britain: where the very systems said to give a fair ride are in fact set against disadvantaged groups from the start.The Home Office depriving Windrush citizens of their jobs, healthcare, benefits and freedom, if they could not provide multiple evidence for every year they’ve been here over 50 years, has an eerie similarity to the DWP’s sanction system depriving benefit claimants of food, housing, electricity, heat, and health because, for example, they had a heart attack when they should have been at a jobcentre appointment. Or removing their disability benefits entirely because the pile of medical notes provided by their lifelong consultants was not deemed as credible as half an hour with an Atos assessor.The message from ministers is that certain people shouldn’t be believed. The same government which has overseen an immigration system in which all migrants are considered illegal unless they can prove different has created a disability benefit system that works from the belief all claimants are faking and it’s their responsibility to convince the authorities otherwise. Sometimes this link is actually literal the  reported last week that a Windrush pensioner who has lived in Britain for 62 years was landed with a bill of more than £33,000 from the government for past disability benefits. She was subsequently threatened with deportation.It’s noticeable that, while every part of the media is now covering Windrush, stories about disabled people dying after losing their benefits are continually ignored. This is not to say that Windrush is not an injustice that needs to be highlighted – it is – but to point to the fact injustice is not immune from needing to be the fashion of the day. The same politicians and newspaper editors rushing to show solidarity for Windrush citizens being treated appallingly by the Home Office are strangely silent when the benefit system is doing the same to disabled people.Similarly, non-Windrush immigrants enduring their own problems with the Home Office should hardly hold their breath on gaining the support of the Daily Mail or the Tory frontbench. There are already reports of Home Office mistreatment spreading to Commonwealth-born citizens in countries including Kenya, Cyprus and Canada.But then, the consequences of these attitudes are becoming harder to ignore. Just as it’s now indisputable that cries to get control of immigration have led to Windrush citizens becoming homeless or sick, rhetoric over bloated welfare bills inevitably sees disabled people going hungry and cold. If as a country we never again want to see the barbarity currently being endured by the Windrush generation, it’s surely time to consider how the state can inflict such treatment on anyone. As it stands, fairness is a British value only for the chosen few."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29e2337ff61a96a00c4c7a9d2d177ada827d8bae/0_121_5676_3406/master/5676.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8c41b0cb374033d4b535ac01ff59b332","title":"theresa may go home vans operation vaken ukip","story":"The name is a departure from Home Office protocol, and has some distinctly unsavoury associationsA little-known fact. The pilot scheme to encourage those living illegally in the UK to leave voluntarily was called Operation Vaken. The pilot lasted one month, and took place between 22 July and 22 August 2013 in six London boroughs. The operation was to test the hypothesis that people without leave to remain would depart voluntarily if they were made aware there was “a near and present” danger of being arrested. Operation Vaken is best remembered for the controversial vans carrying the message “In the UK illegally? Go home or face arrest”, also known as the “Go home” vans.Operation Vaken took many people by surprise, not least in its crude populist approach. But perhaps the most surprising thing about it was its name. Why, of all words, Vaken? After all, we’ve had many operations over the years by the Home Office, police and military, but they’ve usually been given simple names, often taken from nature. So Operation Yewtree investigated the sexual abuse allegations against Jimmy Savile and others, Operation Bumblebee was an anti-burglary campaign in the 1990s, Operation Antler was an investigation into alleged malfeasance at Porton Down. We don’t understand the significance of the names attached to the operations for a good reason. There shouldn’t be any. Operation names are intended to be neutral and unrelated to a particular case.Which is where Operation Vaken becomes a little odd. Vaken isn’t an easily recognisable word. Nor is it an English word. Operation names should not stand out. This one does.Operation Vaken was part of the government’s “hostile environment” strategy (first introduced as a phrase by Labour home secretary Alan Johnson, then heartily championed by Theresa May in her six years at the Home Office). The evaluation report on the pilot, published in October 2013, stated: “There have been 60 voluntary departures which we believe can be directly attributed to Operation Vaken.” The report also identified a further 65 cases that were “currently being progressed to departure”.Like much Home Office policy, it appeared to be a response to the then growing popularity of Ukip. If the Conservative-Lib Dem coalition was to keep Ukip at bay, it believed it would have to convince voters it was not a soft touch: that it was equally determined to reduce the number of immigrants (the home secretary, Theresa May, was almost obsessively determined to get the figure down to tens of thousands) and had a zero tolerance policy to those who had no right to be in the country.Last week Bob Kerslake, who headed the civil service between 2012 and 2014, said May’s policy at the Home Office was seen by some ministers as “almost reminiscent of Nazi Germany”.Firstly, a short, screening interview is conducted with the applicant, to obtain basic details about the person and their claim.\u0026nbspNext, the person will have their main interview with the Home Office, which tries to deal with straightforward cases within six months, although some people wait for more than a year.Finally, a caseworker will decide on the person\u0027s need for protection based on their interview, supporting documents, and the Home Office\u0027s country guidance about the applicant\u0027s country of origin.The asylum seeker will usually be interviewed at one of 12 regional casework units by a Home Office representative, with an interpreter present if needed.\u0026nbspDuring the interview, the applicant will be asked why they are seeking asylum and about their journey to\u0026nbsp the UK.Incredibly so. The transcript, which is written by the Home Office representative during the interview, becomes the main record of the claim. People are often refused asylum on the basis that there were inconsistencies in their interview, or between their main and screening interviews, which the Home Office will say undermines the person\u0027s credibility. The transcript is also used heavily if the claim is refused and goes to appeal.Miranda Butler, a barrister at 3 Hare Court Chambers in London, calls the interview a totemic piece of evidence. It’s their chance to tell their story. You’ve got to give your claim in a watertight fashion … It’s very difficult to change your account afterwards and if you do people will assume you’re lying.”If someone is granted refugee status or another protection visa, they have the right to live and work in the UK and may be able to bring their spouse and dependent children over to live with them.Which takes us back to the puzzling name. In 2013, sociologists Les Back and Shamser Sinha wrote an article for the political website Open Democracy, revealing that the government has abandoned plans to send the “Go home” vans around the country. Open Democracy asked the Home Office to explain its origin. A spokesman said Home Office operations were named alphabetically, and that Vaken means “awake” in Swedish, but insisted that was not why it was chosen.So are we to believe it is a codename randomly allocated for security purposes? Or is it an esoteric biblical reference in Swedish (“Vaken fördenskull ty I veten icke dagen, ej heller stunden”, or “Wake therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour”, from Matthew 25:13, makes a scary kind of sense)Or is it something even more insidious? Northern European languages often share many old Norse and proto-Germanic roots the word vaken in Swedish (from the old Norse) equates to awake or awaken in English and erwache or erwachen in modern German. It also has symbolic resonance in many languages – not least German. Dietrich Eckart,who has been labelled “the spiritual father of national socialism”, wrote a famous poem in 1922 called Deutschland Erwache (Germany Awake).It is a call to action against infidels. The poem starts “Storm! Storm! Storm! Storm! Storm! Storm!  Ring the bells from tower to tower!  Ring until sparks begin to fly,  Judas appears to win the Reich!  Ring until the ropes turn red from blood,  With only burning, torture and murder around,  Ring the storm until the Earth rises  Under the thunder of liberating vengeance!” The poem concludes “Germany, awake! Awake!”That poem Deutschland Erwache was adopted, for many years in the 1920s and 1930s, as the Sturmlied (Storm Song) which became the de facto anthem of the Sturmabteilung, the original paramilitary wing of the Nazi party until supplanted by the Horst-Wessel-Lied. The phrase “Deutschland Erwache” was emblazoned on banners that flew at the Nuremberg rallies. Hitler dedicated the second volume of Mein Kampf to Eckart.Another popular marching song, also called Germany Awake, included the lyrics “All these hypocrites, we throw them out, Judea leave our German house!”.In 2016, in the London Review of Books, the political economist William Davies wrote that he had taken part in a project prompted by Operation Vaken to try to understand how the billboard had come about. He spoke to Home Office civil servants off the record, and revealed that “one former official compared the ethos of the Home Office to that of Millwall football fans: ‘No one likes us, we don’t care.’”Perhaps it was a Home Office official with a similar view who dreamed up the name Operation Vaken. Perhaps it was a Home Office official bitterly opposed to the project who hoped to alert us to the historical precedent. Or perhaps, as the Home Office would doubtless assert, the resemblance between Operation Vaken and Deutchsland Erwache is pure coincidence. But if it is, it’s certainly an unfortunate one.• Simon Hattenstone is a features writer for the "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c2110792e540405598d8cfe0f8ae9ff6fb14262/0_182_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7e51daf302efe4644a23b6eb1a55879d","title":"vote womens equality councils budgetary paralysis local elections","story":"Investing in women will save vital council services. At next week’s local elections we can finish the suffragettes’ workEvery Wednesday morning on my street the birdsong is punctuated by the trundling sound of brown and black containers being wheeled into the middle of the pavement. It’s bin collection day. A bit later on come the other familiar morning noises – buggies and small people on scooters navigating those bins with the women who shepherd the school run – and recently the door-knocking of political canvassers.If you’re living in an area going to the polls in May we want to hear from you. Let us know which way you’re thinking of voting, and which issues are most crucial to you locally.You can share your thoughts using our encrypted form here. One of our journalists may contact you to discuss further and we will feature some of your contributions in our reporting.It’s spring and so it’s local election time. The regularity of bin collections will, as usual, dominate doorstep discussions – I was forwarded an email from the Conservatives yesterday with the subject line: “What this election is about?” Their answer? Bin collections and road repairs. But I’m campaigning to include those women in the discussions too. I think local politics needs a shift in focus. Because it’s in crisis, and in that crisis lies opportunity.Two weeks ago, while canvassing in Harrogate, I spoke to a voter who looked suspiciously at my Women’s Equality party leaflet and asked: “Why would I vote for women’s equality? What’s that got to do with my local council? It’s not going to fix the potholes.” My answer to him was: it’s precisely what’s going to fix the potholes. And the bin collection. And the staffing of your local library. Investing in women is vital if councils are to survive, and even one day thrive.This has been allowed to happen because care is not valued in our country. Keir Starmer offered to swap today’s parliamentary debate on the social care crisis in exchange for a crunch vote on a post-Brexit customs union. Labour voters marvelled at Starmer’s cunning in forcing the prime minister’s hand and wresting control of the Brexit debate from the Tories. But the fact that he picked this debate to trade says more about the lack of appetite from both parties to talk about social care than their hunger for a meaningful vote on our future relationship with the EU.So while the chancellor and shadow chancellor alike unveil their national infrastructure projects – jobs for the boys to see us through Brexit – care is relegated to local authorities to be rationed. But there is simply no more rationing to be done. The National Audit Office found that councils were already dipping into financial reserves to cover their overspend on social care, and that one in 10 of them will face bankruptcy within three years if they continue to do so.Unable to raise prices, care providers are lowering wages and employing less-skilled workers. This exacerbates the gender pay gap, drives women into insecure and lower-paid employment, and forces them to take on more and more unpaid care to cover the shortfall. Carers UK estimates that the economic value of women’s unpaid care now stands at £77bn per year. Many of these unpaid carers are forced to give up work and begin to see their own health decline, increasing the demand on the very services that are being cut. Let’s be clear: cuts to social care were sent from Westminster to local government, which then passed them on to women.This debate cannot be delayed any longer. The crisis is here – and other vital services are being hollowed out. Expenditure on libraries, courts, leisure centres and, most importantly, bin collections and potholes is decreasing. By 201920 only 5p of every £1 in council taxes will be spent filling the potholes – and you need quite a few 5p pieces to fill some of them.The Women’s Equality party is running candidates in 30 communities this spring because we understand that social care is the big issue. And because we need to send a clear message to government that care matters. We want a national care service to be funded via pound-for-pound investment in physical and social infrastructure, so that local councils can be freed from this budgetary paralysis to serve their constituents’ needs. Unless and until this happens, all of the other commitments bulleted in neon caps on the endless party literature shoved through your letterbox simply won’t happen either. Because they can’t."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/101f71a27904e48e1f9d42a3551cc44b6ceddb54/63_543_4781_2870/master/4781.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=178bfa19c89b06540ff1492c65f6e2ea","title":"longest penguin dive antarctica emperor","story":"Record-breaking e in Antarctic waters emerges after scientists accidentally tagged wrong emperor penguinsScientists in Antarctica have recorded the world’s longest penguin e, an astounding 32.2 minutes under the water a full five minutes longer than the previous record.Emperor penguins, which live only in Antartica, are the tallest and heaviest penguins in the world, and have the best ing ability. They can e as much as 500 metres down in some of the world’s harshest and coldest seas.The record e emerged after 20 emperor penguins were tagged with satellite transmitters in 2013, to better understand their foraging and ing patterns. The research was conducted by Marine ecologist Dr Kim Goetz from the New Zealand’s National Institute for Water and Atmospheric Research, Dr Gerald Kooyman from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography and Dr Brigitte McDonald from Moss Landing Marine Labratories. Their findings have been published in the Journal of Marine Ecology Progress Series.Although Goetz and her team were aiming to study the behaviors of breeding penguins, they tagged the wrong birds, tracking 20 non-breeding birds that spent most of the next year hunting in the remote eastern Ross sea usually a challenging environment for scientists to study animal behavior, due to its distance from human bases.Goetz and her team discovered that emperor penguins travel and e further than anyone thought possible travelling distances between 273km and nearly 9,000km in the study period, and conducting es that lasted between one and 32.2 minutes. Before the team’s findings the longest recorded emperor penguin e was 27.6 minutes, which is “impressive” and mysterious, said Goetz, given emperor penguins’ physiology suggest they should be capable of comfortably ing for periods up to eight minutes after which they run out of oxygen and their anaerobic system kicks in, placing a significant strain on the body and requiring a longer recovery time.“But if an animal is going deeper and expending itself and using all its oxygen to get down there, it is usually because it is worth it.”Most of the fitted trackers stayed in place for more than six months, and more than 96,000 es were recorded between March and the end of 2013. Penguins dove longer and deeper during the day and twilight than at night, and their e rate was significantly higher during the day (5.5 es per hour) and twilight (5.6 es per hour) than at night (0.4 es per hour). Goetz said the next phase would require placing cameras on the birds to record exactly what they were doing under the ice – and what they were hunting for that was worth the effort.“This study showed that animals go far further than we thought – this has a number of different implications for their survival ... understanding their entire life cycle, especially when birds are not restrained by chick-rearing duties, is critical to predicting how emperor penguins might respond to environmental changes.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0394e7c40126085879289e828deed1196e0630a6/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2126e6a9e2013db0d760ada484b63e6c","title":"biggest style secret designer meghan markle royal wedding dress","story":"With less than a month to go until the royal wedding, speculation is mounting, with Stella McCartney, Erdem and Christopher Bailey among the runners and ridersThe London-based label designed by thirtysomething Australian couple Tamara Ralph and Michael Russo is the odds-on favourite. Britain’s only haute couture house would be a patriotic choice with a full-service couture atelier handily situated close to Markle’s Kensington home. What’s more, the aesthetic – think superyacht glamour – has the requisite scale for the cathedral proportions of St George’s Chapel. January’s haute couture show closed with a wedding dress in double-faced duchess satin with a draped sweetheart bodice embroidered with Swarovski jewelled leaves, grand flounced skirt with pearlescent micro beads and scalloped lace veil. A semi-sheer black gown by Ralph \u0026amp Russo was the most eyecatching look in the couple’s portfolio of engagement photos. A “well-placed source” has apparently been briefing the press from the atelier that there is “talk of lace”, possibly the least revealing revelation in bridal fashion history. The duo have “declined to comment”.The woke choice. The strongest statement Markle could make would be to emphasise ethics with a sustainable, ethically sourced and made gown by Stella McCartney. When I interviewed her last week, McCartney definitely did not deny being The One. (On the other hand, having your name on lists like this one is good PR, so why deny it, even if the phone never rang?) Markle has worn Stella McCartney several times, including the caped gown she chose for the Queen’s birthday party at the weekend. Plus, the McCartneys are, in a way, British royalty. But while McCartney has made wedding dresses, including a corsetted gown with a long train for Madonna’s Scottish castle wedding in 2000, she is not really known for frills or romance. Her sleek, streamlined aesthetic is a more natural fit for Markle’s everyday wardrobe than for a wedding day. Very possibly a contender for a slinky gown for the evening reception.A persistent outlying rumour links Christopher Bailey, the outgoing Burberry designer, with the wedding dress. Bailey has a longstanding relationship with Markle, having dressed her character on Suits. “I wear a lot of Burberry on the show because Rachel’s whole aesthetic is someone who comes from money and has a real classic design sensibility,” Markle has said. Points in favour: Burberry is a marquee name of British fashion the fashion industry would be utterly charmed by a royal swansong for the universally liked Bailey he is a discreet, mature character who could handle the palace and be trusted to keep a secret. Burberry is known for trenchcoats, not fairytale glamour gowns, but Lily James’s inky red-carpet showstopper at February’s Baftas was by Burberry. So you never know. Backstage after Erdem’s most recent London fashion week show, he explained that his inspiration this season was Adele Astaire, Fred Astaire’s sister, who married into the British aristocracy. Later that day, at a fashion week reception at Buckingham Palace, his long-term client the Duchess of Cambridge made a beeline across the room for a chat. So I did ask, obviously, but he just giggled and raised his eyebrows. Make of that what you will. Erdem has Canadian connections in common with Markle, who lived in Toronto for six years. She has also worn Erdem’s clothes for years, choosing a printed maxi-dress for a wedding she attended with Harry in Jamaica last year. The recent expansion of Erdem’s small London team has added fuel to this fire. Aesthetically, this would be the most fashion-forward choice. Last year, he took the young Queen Elizabeth’s meeting with Duke Ellington at a jazz club as a starting point for a catwalk collection of rewired, quirky royal glamour. A charteuse silk gown with a tulip shaped skirt featured dense black embroidery and three outsize red silk bows at the breastbone, worn with flat mules and a quiff. Two words: Norman Hartnell. The logic against Sarah Burton creating a spectacular Alexander McQueen gown for the royal wedding is that Burton created a spectacular Alexander McQueen gown for the last royal wedding seven years ago. But history shows that this does not rule Burton out. Norman Hartnell designed the Queen’s wedding dress in 1947, and her sister Margaret’s in 1960. A second dress commission would strengthen the ties between the royal family and Alexander McQueen, perhaps the most iconic British fashion label of modern times. The royal family set a lot of store by trust, and Burton did an exemplary job both of designing the dress and of not breathing so much as a word about it. The “Fab Four” of William and Kate plus Harry and Meghan is a compelling new framing of the royals, and this would give it an elegant symmetry."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0024010ef14988f2c6c67717725e4cfe4a8a2079/32_655_1883_1130/master/1883.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ba5cd74a2d6f685752fab17d524a8fd5","title":"youre the one that i want grease inspired summer fashion in pictures","story":"Celebrating its 40th anniversary, Grease is still lightning in the style stakes – as these chic Rydell High School-inspired outfits attest"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/94a6f3091e6a2a1f60eb966efc005ee4b6b50a9d/247_133_761_456/master/761.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7c1777aefce93ac00f8dbb8080c82711","title":"nothing like a dame review judi dench eileen atkins maggie smith joan plowright","story":"Judi Dench, Eileen Atkins, Maggie Smith and Joan Plowright engage in a round-table war of theatrical anecdotes in this brutally funny film• Sign up for Film Today and get our film team’s highlights of the dayThe laughter and pure hysteria are infectious in this wildly enjoyable film. I can’t for the life of me think of any other recent documentary in which I have laughed pretty much all the way through. It is nothing more nor less than an acerbic round-table chat between four of British theatre’s most famed dames: Judi Dench, Joan Plowright, Eileen Atkins and Maggie Smith, which takes place at the country home Plowright shared with her late husband, Laurence Olivier (I seem to remember it being the site of Melvyn Bragg’s South Bank Show special on Olivier in the 80s).This is basically an Avengers Infinity War of theatrical anecdotery: outrageously camp, with sensational stills and archive footage and very brisk assessment of the past – utterly unsentimental. Why is it when female stars of this calibre appear in a fiction feature together it’s always a horribly twee ordeal – when this shows they can be brutally funny?Judi Dench has an extraordinary anecdote about being patronised by a 17-year-old paramedic last summer when she was “stung on the bum by a hornet”. She imitates this young man’s wheedling questions: “What’s our name?” “(Irritated) Judi.” “And have we got a carer?” “Fuck off! I’ve just done eight weeks in The Winter’s Tale at the Garrick.”Dench also recounts her reply to Peter Hall’s request that she play Cleopatra: “Are you sure you want a menopausal dwarf?” Atkins interrupts: “That’s what she was.” “That’s how I played it.” The quartet agree that Antony and Cleopatra is very much Cleopatra’s play and the actor playing Antony is always very annoyed to discover this. Alan Bates was a key example, says one: “He actually wanted to play Cleopatra.” There’s an incredible clip of a 60s interview in which Smith says her delivery is stolen from Kenneth Williams – and the resemblance is unmistakable. Dench has another glorious memory of protesting with Vanessa Redgrave against the Vietnam war in Trafalgar Square in the 1960s: “Vanessa got arrested and remembered she had a matinee.” Atkins says she began her career in a sort of children’s gang show touring working men’s clubs called the “KY School” after the leaders’ initials – and couldn’t understand why people looked embarrassed.Inevitably, there is a fair bit of discussion of the male monsters in their lives, particularly Larry. Smith says he would hit her on stage every night when she was Desdemona to his enraged and paranoid Othello: “It was the only time I saw stars at the National Theatre.” I would have loved to hear a discussion on a wider range of issues, particularly #TimesUp, but with a film this much fun, it seems churlish to ask for anything else."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1cc1329955f64b1f583a81696403febf14b89a2d/316_57_1956_1174/master/1956.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eb5b14541fec30bd5eb3088ab4167f5a","title":"arsene wenger leave arsenal not my decision","story":"• Patrick Vieira and Mikel Arteta in frame to replace Frenchman• Wenger: ‘With two or three additions, this team can fight for title’Arsène Wenger believes it would be “even better” for Arsenal if they appoint a former player to succeed him as manager at the end of the season. He also provided the clearest indication yet that he did not want to step down, by revealing the timing of the decision was not down to him.Wenger was in relaxed mood before Thursday night’s Europa League semi-final first leg at home against Atlético Madrid – a tie he feels he has to win in order to avoid an anti-climatic conclusion to his near 22-year tenure.It promises to be an intriguing contest in which Wenger is set to start with David Ospina in goal a surprising move, given the manager played Petr Cech in both legs of the quarter-final against CSKA Moscow.But, perhaps inevitably, the focus remained on the fallout from the announcement last Friday that Wenger was set to leave his post and the discussion as to the identity of his successor.The favourite to take over is Luis Enrique, the former Barcelona manager whose credentials are being pushed by Raul Sanllehi, Arsenal’s new head of football relations. Sanllehi worked with Enrique at Barcelona and Wenger said he had a “high opinion” of him. But the merits of the former Arsenal captains Patrick Vieira and Mikel Arteta have also been advanced.Vieira, the manager of New York City, said on Wednesday that he was flattered to have been linked. “It’s not something which will stop me doing what I am doing at the moment,” he said. “I don’t want this to be perceived that I want to go because I don’t want to leave. But if the question is as simple as: ‘Are you ready to manage any teams in Europe?’ then I would say: ‘Yes. I am ready.’”Wenger has said he will play no part in the recruitment of the new manager but when asked about Vieira and Arteta – the latter is a coach at Manchester City – it was interesting to hear the 68-year-old endorse the notion of a former player, even if they might be less heralded in managerial terms. Arsenal, famously, made the bold move to appoint him in 1996, when ‘Arsène Who?’ was the question on many people’s lips.“The need is to make the right decision, even if you have to be bold,” Wenger said. “Is it former people that worked here? That is even better. But there are many players who had qualities. Some of them are in the job. I don’t influence that choice but I will stand behind the decision.”When Wenger and the club made the announcement that they would go their separate ways, the understanding was he had jumped before he was pushed.Wenger was asked on Wednesday why he was quitting when he had another year to run on his contract. “The timing was not really my decision,” he replied. Arsenal later argued that Wenger’s comment related to the release of the announcement rather than the decision. “After reaching agreement about my departure, I was happy for the club to decide when to announce,” Wenger later said in a statement. “I wish to make it clear the timing of the announcement was right.”He also made it plain he intended to seek another job in management – “I will continue to work, that’s for sure” – but he suggested he might need a period of reflection. “I had no break for 35 years. In our job – you can look around – that doesn’t exist. I don’t know now how addicted I am. I am a bit like a guy who plays Russian roulette every week and suddenly has no gun any more. I will see how much I miss that gun.”There were moments of levity, including one when Wenger predicted the club would have no shortage of managerial applicants. “That shows you the place is a good place. Green outside, nice trees, good grass. Fantastic. No pollution. Until the press conference starts.”The broader point Wenger sought to make was his successor would have a wonderful chance to be successful because he had helped to create such a powerful squad and club. The hurt of the looming separation is clear. Wenger continues to feel the urge to justify himself and his record. “I am convinced in the future, with two or three additions, this team has the quality to fight for the title.”Wenger listed his greatest regret as the 2006 Champions League final defeat against Barcelona, which had come after a couple of highlights – the knock-out wins over Real Madrid and Juventus. “If you look at Arsenal and the number of games they play in Europe in their whole history, it is not Real Madrid. The history of the club has become very demanding but the longer history is not so bright that you can say the club has won 10 European Cups.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e764f58deb0dba77e6c2c39d820d8855e0ddb3a/119_472_5280_3168/master/5280.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=30afff56a586bbd43b3205751a1ef485","title":"bayern munich real madrid champions league","story":"It was Thomas Müller, contorting himself to swipe at an open goal from a matter of feet midway through the second half before missing the ball completely, who confirmed the impression that the die had been cast. Over-familiarity could have bred contempt between two such practised, garlanded powers instead a chess-like opening 30 minutes gave way to a see-sawing and at times pinball-esque affair that, for all its apparent concessions to chance, came to appear eerily like a flashback.Barely a year has passed since, in a quarter-final first leg at the same venue, Bayern Munich threatened to put Real Madrid to the sword before falling to a mixture of their own profligacy and their visitors’ sheer gumption. The pattern repeated itself almost to the letter here nights like this lend the impression that memory is as important a tool as any in football and as a bright Bayern performance eventually faded, it did not take an overactive imagination to perceive the ghosts of failures’ past taunting them in front of the Sudkurve posts.The Champions League trophy was pitch-side in the hour before kick-off, and if that did not seem presumptuous in itself there had been little escaping the narrative that this was the final before the final. You knew what they meant, even if Liverpool have probably done enough to temper any overconfidence in this tie’s victors.If Anfield was wild on Tuesday night then the Allianz Arena, bathed in golden spring light as the teams warmed up, was its usual inimitable mixture of gravitas and confidence. This was serious Champions League stuff for serious Champions League people: two winning machines for this level, unabashed in their self-importance but perfectly entitled to it too.While the sheer exhilaration of the previous evening never quite seemed likely in a meeting of two such familiar foes, the names on display provided a comfort blanket from the off. Here, four minutes in, was a 35-year-old Franck Ribéry, wagging his finger at the referee, Bjorn Kuipers, in search of a non-existent spot kick. There, five minutes later, was Sergio Ramos stepping out of defence before crunching through both Robert Lewandowski and ball, a premeditated early calling card that temporarily left the centre-forward in a heap.This particular collection of old masters wage battle against one another semi-regularly, quality and sheer force of personality lying behind their ability to rise to occasions like this, but the day is nearing when they will yield to the less familiar. Arjen Robben’s injury-enforced substitution after eight minutes was a stark reminder that some treasures are best savoured while one still can. Robben has yet to sign a new deal and looks a fair bet to move on at 34 there is a chance this was his last Champions League appearance and should that be the case, it was an unworthy end.Robben would have enjoyed himself in the subsequent 40 minutes. Real’s left flank was non-existent when Joshua Kimmich outfoxed Keylor Navas to open the scoring and in the period immediately after that Bayern buzzed with menace. James Rodríguez, unwanted by his opponents, has been a figure transformed under Jupp Heynckes – trimmer, zippier, his touch and occasionally extravagant range matched by a willingness to put the yards in.He and Robben’s replacement, Thiago Alcântara, wove patterns and teased black-clad defenders out of shape Müller and Lewandowski provided more brawn and the former, from one of several headed chances, should have done better than nod straight at a grateful Navas before half-time.By then, though, Real had done what Real do. There was to be no Juventus-style miracle from Cristiano Ronaldo, a harmless first-half header and a 48th-minute shot that squirted out for a throw-in the sum of his efforts this time, but in Marcelo he has a team-mate whose mettle for the big stage goes under-appreciated. Marcelo had been exposed during that flurry of Bayern pressure but, like Kimmich, made no mistake when the half-chance presented itself.Marco Asensio’s goal, which came within moments of another opportunity for Lewandowski, thus contained a sense of grim inevitability. Asensio is not yet a Real Madrid grandee and certainly not yet a 30-something his finish displayed something of his older team-mates’ dead-eyed instinct though and while Müller writhed and Bayern strained, the spectres of April 2017 readied themselves."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e056fc90a8457246b02b108d12467ede1431adb/0_162_4052_2431/master/4052.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bdc37beb7dbd7ab076aaf7cd1b8494e2","title":"mohamed salah ronaldo messi ballon dor liverpool","story":"Mohamed Salah has already shot past Kevin De Bruyne to take the first inidual award of the domestic season now bookmakers are starting to wake up to the possibility of Liverpool’s goal machine breaking the Lionel Messi-Cristiano Ronaldo duopoly in the Ballon d’Or at the end of the year.The Egyptian has 43 goals in 47 clubs games this season, which is incredible enough, and thanks in no small part to his contribution against Roma his club are favourites to reach the Champions League final. If Salah can keep up his goalscoring and his knack of influencing the outcome of important matches he will certainly be a contender, and his Anfield team‑mates are backing him all the way.“Mo is becoming a superstar,” Dejan Lovren said after Salah’s performance against Roma. “It looks easy what he does, but it is very difficult. I don’t want to put any extra pressure on him and maybe this is not the right time but if he continues like that he has every right to be regarded as one of the best three in the world at the end of the year.“When people talk about Ronaldo and Messi they should also talk about Salah. He deserves it, he deserves to be mentioned for the Ballon d’Or. At the start of the season I didn’t know he could do this, but you see how he is working, how he wants the ball, he is just a different player to what he was.“I think our style helps him a lot. He didn’t play that way for Basel or Chelsea or Roma, but the way we can find him suits him perfectly. The most important thing now is for him to stay injury free. If he can do that, anything is possible.”Trent Alexander-Arnold, whose improvised pass sent Salah on his way to set up Liverpool’s third goal, agrees it is easy to play with someone who not only finds space but knows how to use it. “You know he is quick, you know he is smart and really intelligent, so I think we all know our game-plan,” the teenage full-back said. “We know if we hit it into the channels there will be a runner on the end of it and more often than not it is Mo on the right.“He’ll get on the end of it and usually manage to make something happen, which is a credit to him. There is still a long way to go to the Ballon d’Or ceremony, so he has another six months or so to carry on, but I think the team would back him to continue doing well.”The only downside as far as Alexander-Arnold is concerned is having to face such a tricky player in training. “It’s a nightmare when you are up against him,” he said. “It’s great to watch him scoring his goals and growing in confidence, he produces cool finishes day in and day out and it’s become second nature to him now, but I can’t say I really like it when he does that stuff to me.“The good thing about the second leg in Rome is that Mo is on our side not theirs. It’s much better to be playing with him rather than against him, and though Roma showed they are a threat in scoring their two goals, they know that we carry a goal threat as well. Maybe in the last 15 minutes of the first leg we lost our concentration, a little bit. I think we will all learn from that, but you don’t expect to be five goals up in a Champions League semi-final. It was hard not to get carried away with the atmosphere and the scoreline at the time, but we know what we need to do now. We have to go to Rome and finish the job.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad6c837eca1d8b85f80835c4fd1d7361cb3c85f1/0_413_2365_1419/master/2365.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=067f9a338ac1e1207f7027edb58a76b9","title":"bake in the box cake only an idiot could mess it up","story":"This bake-by-numbers convenience food is from the same school as boil-in-the-bag – what could go wrong?Dr Oetker’s Bake in the Box sounds like a cautionary tale adapted for Netflix, but is actually a cake. If you’re looking for nuance in the kitchen, this is not for you. But\u0026nbspif you are time-poor, appliance-shy or incompetent,\u0026nbspthen it is. It is so straightforward to make, so utterly bake-by-numbers, I half-expected to find it came with a sachet of enzymes to help you digest the thing. Alas not.Dr Oetker launched its baking kits late last year with little fanfare. The German-owned food company’s UK branch is based on an industrial estate in Lancashire opposite Crossleys, a company that repairs caravans – another sort of box. Yet Dr Oetker has become one of the leading manufacturers of frozen foods and baking equipment. It dominates the market. Put simply, the bake in the box cake is evolution.I get my hands on the lemon and poppy seed loaf (other varieties include banana and choc chip, and double chocolate). To make it, you remove the lid and empty the mix into the box. Whisk seven tablespoons of milk in using a fork (since we’re on a convenience tip, I use the same tablespoon) and pop into an oven, preheated to 190Cgas mark 5. Remove after 10 minutes, score a 1cm-deep groove down the middle of the cake and return to the oven for a further 20\u0026nbspminutes.This is convenience food from the same school as boil in the bag and microwave meals: all designed to help “overcome the barriers consumers face when it comes to home baking”, says the company. It’s a valid argument, although there’s something conflicting about the almost tyrannical convenience and the fact that it still takes 30 minutes to bake. But it works, and the cake is fine: lemony, dense, too sweet but adequate.The good news is that Dr Oetker didn’t try to gender it with a pink box, or deploy a fun font to make it look hip. The bad news – and I discovered this after eating the cake\u0026nbsp– is that Dr Oetker has a Nazi past. Richard Kaselowsky, a past owner of the firm, was a “leading supporter” of Hitler. The company’s president at that time – and son of the original doctor – Rudolf-August Oetker joined the Nazi party in the 1930s, news that was later exposed by his son, August Oetker – to his credit – because, according to a spokesman: “The business felt it important to be transparent about any mistakes that were made in the past, set the facts straight once and for all and do everything to prevent anything like the Third Reich happening again.” So\u0026nbspthere you go.But back to the cake. Dr Oetker’s Bake in the Box is ridiculously simple to make – it would take a colossal muppet to mess it up and yet, I did. Halfway through, I\u0026nbspdecided to add lemon juice to zhoosh it up – but in my attempt to rip up the rulebook, as it were, I\u0026nbspended up ripping the box.

All four have been commissioned to write a piece of poetry or prose which will then be engraved on stones positioned over the eight-mile route between the sisters’ birthplace and the family parsonage.Winterson will celebrate the Brontë legacy as a whole, Duffy will celebrate Charlotte, Kay has Anne and Bush has Emily.The Brontë stones project takes place in the bicentenary year of Emily’s birth and, appropriately, the 40th anniversary year of Bush’s Wuthering Heights, the mindblowing song she released when she was just 18 years old.Bush said she was delighted to be involved in the project. “Each sister being remembered by a stone in the enigmatic landscape where they lived and worked is a striking idea. “Emily only wrote the one novel – an extraordinary work of art that has truly left its mark. To be asked to write a piece for Emily’s stone is an honour and, in a way, a chance to say thank you to her.”The writers have been commissioned by Bradford literature festival, which will unveil the stones in July. Getting Bush involved is a real coup. While not, in her words, the “weirdo recluse” she is sometimes portrayed as, Bush avoids the limelight. She rarely gives interviews. When, out of the blue, she announced a series of live shows in 2014, her first for 35 years, the news made headlines around the world.The festival’s director, Syima Aslam, said Bush had been approached with a degree of trepidation. “We saw it as such a good fit, but equally we were, ‘she might just say no’. But you won’t know unless you ask … and she said yes, which was tremendously exciting.”The stones project is the only way Bush will be marking the 40th anniversary of her song.Aslam said the Charlotte stone will be at the house where the Brontës, including their wayward brother Branwell, were born in the village of Thornton. Anne’s stone will be in a meadow beside the parsonage in Haworth, now the Brontë Parsonage Museum, where the family grew up. The Emily and Brontë legacy stones will be in the landscape.Putting the Emily stone on the wild and exposed moors was not a difficult decision to take. “There was no other way of doing it,” said Aslam. “I remember a long time ago being laughed at by a friend as we were driving through the moors and I said, ‘It’s all so bleak, it reminds me of Wuthering Heights’. She just looked at me and laughed.”Aslam said it had been important to get a northern writer to celebrate the Brontë legacy and was thrilled that Winterson said yes.Winterson recalled growing up in Lancashire and roaming the hills in the rain and feeling both passionate and misunderstood. “I read the Brontës and felt their spirit stand by me,” she said. “The Brontës showed me that hearts beat like mine, that the struggle to know who you are happens across time and generations, and gender. “They showed me that writing needs the power of the personal behind it – but that somehow the story one person tells has to become a story many people can claim as their own. And the Brontës are women. As a woman I needed those ancestors, those guides. I still do.”Aslam said the calibre of the writers was important. “It has just been perfect. I could not have asked for anything more. These are writers who will be remembered. As much as the stones will be a way in to the work of the Brontës, they will also be a way into these writers as well.”Michael Stewart, who lives in Thornton, came up with the idea in 2013. He said he had long wanted “my village to receive recognition for its place in the Brontë story … It’s fantastic to see the project come to fruition”.Stewart will lead a guided walk between Thornton and Haworth, titled In the Footsteps of the Brontës, on 8 July. The day before, Duffy, Kay and Winterson will be in Bradford to inaugurate the stones and read their words."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/34cc932f1bb3dd24f24708969e309a86f4fa440f/0_0_3514_2381/master/3514.jpg?w=480\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bf648bed8a108457e6d0a3c5aed42c4a 480w","title":"heidi alexander thought to be considering role at london city hall","story":"Labour MP quit as shadow health secretary in 2016 in protest at Jeremy Corbyn’s leadershipHeidi Alexander, the former shadow health secretary, is considering quitting the Commons to accept a senior job at City Hall with London mayor Sadiq Khan, the  understands.Alexander was Khan’s campaign chair during the 2016 London mayoral election.

Richards, selected as the party’s candidate for Worcester last week, had claimed on her Twitter account there were “no images … of physical damage” from the bombing last May, and also said there was a “convenient shortage of evidence” in the murder of the MP Jo Cox.A panel from Labour’s national executive committee – including Unite union’s national officer, Jim Kennedy, the GMB union’s national political officer, Cath Speight, and the Islington councillor Claudia Webbe – called Richards to an emergency meeting to explain herself, the  understands. The decision has been taken not to endorse her candidacy.The NEC has the power to remove a candidate if he or she has concealed anything that might be likely to bring the party into disrepute. Richards allegedly did not fill in the form correctly, nor did the selection committee question her about her social media history.Richards has been placed under civil restraint by the high court, preventing her from bringing any legal action without judicial approval.She is reported to have made “false and vexatious claims” against MI5 and MI6 and a long list of others, including her GP and Thames Water. The shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, was called to give evidence against her at the high court, where she said Richards was an “obsessive” whose claims “cannot be true”.Questions are likely to be asked about how Richards passed the selection process, having previously been shortlisted for another target seat in Telford several weeks earlier.Applicants are explicitly asked in the application form and by the interview panel to disclose anything in their background, personal, political or financial, past or present, which could have any potential to embarrass either themselves or the party. Richards was told by the panel she had broken the rules when she did not disclose any information in response to that question in the application form or interview. The panel decided that was a “lack of judgment that is not compatible with the high standards the party expect of candidates and elected representatives”.Richards has said she is a supporter of Jeremy Corbyn, but sources at Momentum, the grassroots leftwing movement, have insisted it does not back her, and said they did not back any candidate in the seat, which has a 2,500 Conservative majority.A source close to the NEC said the committee had decided to take swift action. “The panel is people from right across the political spectrum,” the source said.Kennedy and Webbe are key allies of Corbyn on the committee. “This is not a factional decision but a unanimous one that no one else on the NEC would block,” the source said. “There will be plenty of others now who want to contest that seat.”On Tuesday night, members of the local Worcester party’s committee met to discuss the selection, agreeing to back the NEC’s decision.Speaking after the decision, Richards said she was disappointed but understood the NEC’s decision, which was the result of “adverse publicity” over the past few days.“It has not however dampened my resolve or passion for politics,” she said. “It is unfortunate that the misrepresentation of the circumstances leading up to my selection were allowed to gain traction.”Richards said she had not stated that the Manchester attack and Cox’s death were staged, despite tweets questioning both events. “I would never seek to offend the victims and the bereaved in these incidents, that would be entirely contrary to my motivation,” she said. She hinted that those who had opposed her candidacy were politically motivated, saying that iniduals had “unfairly seized on an opportunity to distort my intention to further their own ambition at the expense of mine … they will need to wrestle with their consciences on that in due course. The conceit, however, will not remain unanswered.”Richards said she wanted to apologise to the people of Worcester. “Your standing ovation at the hustings meeting has left be with the most heartwarming memory of my brief time with you,” she said. “I hope you find another formidable women to take up the mantle for we are aplenty.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f4f423b6bcc385d89b640d7e5898587c79584308/203_198_6498_3899/master/6498.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e7b7fd6ea24ae075dce4af3453a211b9","title":"may loses lords vote on post brexit powers for ministers","story":"Peers rip up ‘blank chequebook that ministers sought to give themselves’, inflicting heavy defeatPeers and MPs claimed a significant victory on Wednesday when an attempt to give sweeping powers to ministers was thrown out of the Brexit bill as complaints about the power of the Lords to reverse the decisions of the Commons grew louder.In the first of a series of votes on how the powers brought back from Brussels would be limited by the balance between ministers and parliament, peers from all parties defeated the government by 349 to 221 – a majority of 128.On Tuesday, the Tory backbencher and vociferous Brexiter Jacob Rees-Mogg accused peers of “playing with fire” over Brexit. A petition calling for a referendum on the abolition of the Lords has attracted more than 100,000 signatures and is eligible for a debate at Westminster.Amnesty International said the Lords had “ripped up the blank chequebook that ministers sought to give themselves. “The Lords have sent a clear message to the Commons: leaving the EU shouldn’t mean leaving rights behind.”The vote on Wednesday, which was one of the biggest majorities against the government so far, overturned an attempt to give ministers the power to decide to make changes to EU laws on the basis of what they “considered appropriate” rather than what was necessary.Critics, led by the crossbencher Lord Lisvane, argued that it was too low a bar to set for what may be very significant decisions. He dismissed a compromise offered by the government to include the phrase “good reason”.“The test for political decision-making is not simply whether there are good reasons. There may be good reasons for doing something and better reasons for not doing it,” Lisvane said.He said the EU withdrawal bill would be a precedent for other legislation resulting from Brexit. “Whichever side of the Brexit debate they stand, people might reasonably believe that taking back control would be under the sovereignty of parliament rather than ceding swaths of power to the executive.”Among other powers sought by the government but expected to be rejected by the Lords was the power to set up new agencies without an act of parliament, and the power to create new criminal offences. The government faces three more days of challenges to the bill, in particular over the row with Scotland over devolved powers, which the Scottish National party has refused to accept. As a result Holyrood could refuse to grant legislative consent, creating another standoff with Westminster.The Brexit minister Lord Callanan argued that the changes risked making the bill unworkable. On Monday, peers overturned a move to exclude the EU charter of fundamental rights from the bill."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e70073aa50588353f183fee2afff09cc8cb28267/141_0_1602_961/master/1602.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=788e67004164964615767ea821d29c48","title":"may puts tories before national interest on brexit says starmer","story":"Labour may try to force vote on customs union after backbench debate, as shadow Brexit secretary criticises PMThe shadow Brexit secretary has accused the prime minister of putting party management before the national interest, as MPs seek to ramp up the pressure on the government over a customs union.Keir Starmer said: “Over the past few weeks it has become abundantly clear that Theresa May is unwilling and unable to put the country’s interests first during the Brexit negotiations.“She has wasted 12 weeks of the Brexit negotiations delaying a Commons vote on the UK negotiating a customs union with the EU for fear of a defeat.”The UK could sign up to all the EU’s rules and regulations, staying in the single market – which provides free movement of goods, services and people – and the customs union, in which EU members agree tariffs on external states. Freedom of movement would continue and the UK would keep paying into the Brussels pot. We would continue to have unfettered access to EU trade, but the pledge to “take back control” of laws, borders and money\u0026nbspwould not have been fulfilled. This\u0026nbspis an unlikely outcome and one that may be possible only by reversing the Brexit decision, after a second referendum or election.Britain could follow Norway, which is in the single market, is subject to freedom of movement rules and pays a fee to Brussels – but is outside the customs union. That combination would tie Britain to EU regulations but allow it to sign trade deals of its own. A “Norway-minus” deal is more likely. That would see the UK leave the single market and customs union and end free movement of people. But Britain would align its rules and regulations with Brussels, hoping this would allow a greater degree of market access. The UK would still be subject to EU rules.A comprehensive trade deal like the one handed to Canada would help British traders, as it would lower or eliminate tariffs. But there would be little on offer for the UK services industry. It is a bad outcome for financial services. Such a deal would leave Britain free to erge from EU rules and regulations but that in turn would lead to border checks and the rise of other “non-tariff barriers” to trade. It would leave Britain free to forge new trade deals with other nations. Many in Brussels see this as a likely outcome, based on Theresa May’s direction so far.Britain leaves with no trade deal, meaning that all trade is governed by World Trade Organization rules. Tariffs would be high, queues at the border long and the Irish border issue severe. In the short term, British aircraft might be unable to fly to some European destinations. The UK would quickly need to establish bilateral agreements to deal with the consequences, but the country would be free to take whatever future direction it wishes. It may need to deregulate to attract international business – a very different future and a lot of disruption.May has delayed contentious votes over amendments to two Brexit bills, aimed at forcing the issue of a customs union.But after the House of Lords overwhelmingly backed a pro-customs union amendment to the Brexit bill last week, 10 select committee chairs, including Tory MPs Nicky Morgan and Sarah Wollaston, have triggered a backbench debate on the issue on Thursday afternoon.Backbench debates do not always result in a vote – though Labour may try to force one – and any resolution would be non-binding. Mel Stride, the financial secretary to the treasury, will set out the government’s position. But backers of a customs union hope it will demonstrate clear support for the cause in parliament.Starmer, speaking in advance of the debate, said: “The prime minister is now solely focused on internal party management and masking the isions within her government. Above all, it shows we have a prime minister governing for narrow party interest, not the national interest.”On Wednesday the leader of the House of Commons, Andrea Leadsom, became the latest senior minister to reject the idea of Britain remaining in a customs union, saying it would be “ludicrous” to do so.A customs union with the EU – which is Labour’s preferred outcome – would help to minimise border checks (though erging from EU rules would be likely to result in some checks being imposed). But it would prevent Britain from being able to sign independent trade deals.It emerged last weekend that the prime minister could be ready to concede on the issue, after Brussels formally rejected Britain’s proposals for avoiding customs checks at the Northern Ireland border. But Michael Gove and Sajid Javid both reiterated their insistence that Britain must remain outside a customs union.Boris Johnson said last week: “Without your ability to do things in a different way if you want, and your ability to do free trade deals, there is very little point in Brexit. I think Theresa totally gets that.”Downing Street said the customs union had not been on the agenda at Wednesday’s meeting of May’s Brexit inner cabinet.Pro-Brexit ministers still believe the government can throw out pro-customs union amendments in the Commons, despite hopes among some backbenchers that Labour could team up with Tory rebels to force May’s hand.Asked whether the issue was back in contention, one cabinet Brexiter said: “The Tory party won’t wear it.”Earlier, David Davis said he would consider it a failure if the UK was forced to extend its membership of the EU customs union, amid mounting concern among MPs that time is running out for talks on alternative solutions.Ruling out this possible compromise route for minimising a hard border for Northern Ireland, the Brexit secretary instead insisted that the problem did not need solving until at least October.He said both the government’s proposals for resolving the Irish border issue were still on the table – a customs “partnership”, which would see the UK collect revenues on the EU’s behalf and so-called “maxfac”, or maximum facilitation, which would use technology to help avoid cumbersome border checks.“I do not expect the solution to be an extension of the customs union,” Davis told the Brexit committee. “I would view that on my part as a failure.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b24db08f348821413f09aa5af171e7a8b112fb3a/0_49_3252_1951/master/3252.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=82fb725a1fbf88b0729c3a23b98f6e20","title":"iaaf testosterone rules caster semenya","story":"• IAAF set to introduce new limits for female athletes• Sports scientist: ‘She will go from a 1:54 to 2:01-2:03’ in 800mThe Olympic 800m champion Caster Semenya could run up to seven seconds slower under new rules requiring her to lower her natural testosterone levels to race internationally, a prominent sports scientist has predicted.Under rules due to be announced on Thursday morning by the IAAF, the world athletics governing body, a separate female classification for an athlete with differences of sexual development (or DSDs) will be introduced. Such athletes, including Semenya, will have to reduce and then maintain their testosterone levels to no greater than 5nmolL by 1 November if they want to compete in events ranging from 400 metres to a mile.The move, which is sure to ide opinion, was unanimously approved by the IAAF council last month. According to the world-renowned sports scientist Ross Tucker, the effect will be significant on athletes such as Semenya. “If this policy passes, then I would predict that Semenya will be five to seven seconds slower over 800 metres,” he wrote.“The other really interesting thing is that, guided by the new IOC transgender policy that lowers the upper limit for testosterone to 5nmolL, the IAAF are setting their limit at 5nmolL. It used to be 10. That will slow the times of these athletes down even more than it did in the past.”He told the : “History suggests Semenya will lose about four seconds to five seconds. Because in 2013 and 2014, when the IAAF were diligent about ensuring her compliance with the upper limit at that time (10nM), she was running 2:00. I don’t think she even qualified for the Commonwealth Games. Now, at 5nM, that effect will be even larger, I suspect. She will go from a 1:54 to 2:01-2:03, is my estimate.”Semenya burst on to the scene in 2009 when she won the world 800m title but was then required to take testosterone-suppressing medicine by the IAAF in order to compete. However, in July 2015 the court of arbitration for sport reversed that rule when it examined the Dutee Chand case – allowing inter-sex athletes to compete without taking testosterone-suppressing medication.The decisive factor for the Cas panel in 2015 was whether testosterone above the 10nmolL threshold set by the IAAF gave female athletes a competitive advantage over their fellow competitors. However research by the IAAF since then shows that in certain events testosterone does make an enormous difference. An IAAF report notes that “most females have low levels of testosterone circulating naturally in their bodies (0.12 to 1.79 nmolL in blood) while after puberty the normal male range is much higher (7.7 – 29.4 nmolL). Absent a DSD or a tumour, no female would have serum levels of testosterone approaching 5 nmolL, but iniduals with DSDs can have very high levels of natural testosterone, extending into and even beyond the normal male range.”The IAAF also makes it clear that science is on its side. In its report it writes: “There is a broad medical and scientific consensus that if these iniduals are sensitive to androgens (ie, they have properly-functioning androgen receptors), such very high levels of natural testosterone can increase their muscle mass and strength, as well as their levels of circulating haemoglobin, and so significantly enhance their sporting potential.“This evidence shows clearly that (at least in certain events) DSD athletes with levels of circulating testosterone in the normal male range have a very significant competitive advantage over female athletes with testosterone levels in the normal female range.”“To the best of our knowledge, there is no other genetic or biological trait encountered in female athletics that confers such a huge performance advantage.”In explaining its decision, the IAAF said it was trying to create “a level playing field and ensure that success is determined by talent, dedication, hard work, and the other values and characteristics that the sport embodies and celebrates”.It added: “The IAAF wants athletes to be incentivised to make the huge commitment and sacrifice required to excel in the sport, and so to inspire new generations to join the sport and aspire to the same excellence. It does not want to risk discouraging those aspirations by having unfair competition conditions that deny athletes a fair opportunity to succeed.“Because of the significant advantages in size, strength and power enjoyed (on average) by men over women from puberty onwards, due in large part to men’s much higher levels of circulating testosterone, and the impact that such advantages can have on sporting performance, it is generally accepted that competition between male and female athletes would not be fair and meaningful, and would risk discouraging women from participation in the sport. Therefore, in addition to separate competition categories based on age, the IAAF has also created separate competition categories for male and female athletes.It added: “The IAAF respects the dignity of all iniduals, including iniduals with DSDs. It also wishes the sport of athletics to be as inclusive as possible, and to encourage and provide a clear path to participation in the sport for all. The IAAF therefore seeks to place conditions on such participation only to the extent necessary to ensure fair and meaningful competition.”In a Q\u0026ampA sent out with its new rules, the IAAF also anticipated a frequent argument made in this debate – namely that all elite athletes have natural genetic andor biological advantages (such as height or lung capacity), so why deny DSD athletes the benefit of their natural levels of circulating testosterone?In response the IAAF wrote: “The IAAF ides competition into male and female classifications because male athletes have clear performance advantages in terms of size, strength and power, as a result (in particular) of increased lean body mass and increased serum haemoglobin, which in turn is due mainly to the fact that, starting from puberty, they produce 10‐30 times more testosterone than women. As noted above, the CAS has found that this difference justifies protecting female athletes from competition from male athletes.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/50e790933b390caed53a164ab1179f0130ff5476/0_192_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=544ffe660e450111464c02be8db97d6e","title":"alexandra palaces hidden theatre to reopen after 188m restoration","story":"Performers to grace the Victorian stage in London after a gap of 80 years, once lottery-funded revamp finishes this summerFor the first time in more than 80 years, regular performances are to be staged at a huge, abandoned, Victorian theatre hidden inside Alexandra Palace, north London.The theatre is being restored with the help of an £18.8m lottery grant – which was one of the biggest ever for a UK heritage project – and the work will near completion over the summer.On Thursday, Alexandra Palace’s charitable trust announced details of the theatre’s opening programme in December, an eclectic line-up that will include a performance by Gareth Malone, Gilbert and George in conversation, an evening of jazz from Ronnie Scott’s, and a run of the Horrible Histories Christmas show. Ahead of that, on 1 September, the Proms will visit with the BBC Concert Orchestra for a performance of Gilbert and Sullivan’s Trial by Jury.The building will not be a gleaming interior, the trust said. “I describe it as a gentle nudge into the modern era,” said Emma Dagnes, the trust’s deputy chief executive. “We do not want to impact on the space too much because that is not its story. It opened with wonder and spectacle and excitement for the Victorians and, like all theatres, it had an interesting and eclectic history. And then it closed its doors. It would have been wrong to crack open the gold leaf and take it back to a pastiche of its former self.”The theatre opened in 1875 with a performance of Offenbach’s operetta Breaking the Spell. Spectacular pantomimes with huge casts followed, as well as opera, ballet, music hall variety and stage drama, in a space capable of holding an audience of 3,000.During the first world war Alexandra Palace was used as an internment camp for German and Austrian “enemy aliens” and the theatre became the camp’s hospital. After the BBC arrived in the 1930s it was employed as a useful prop store. It was mostly hidden away for 80 years until the restoration project started.Dagnes said it had been important to maintain the scars of the theatre’s dereliction. “We have done a lot of work on the ceiling but we have deliberately taken the decision to not fill in all the holes and make it look perfect. That would have been jarring to the space.”One big change is the raising of the floor by about 3.5 metres in an attempt to make the space more intimate. All the original floorboards were taken up and carefully numbered, and will be put back in precisely the same pattern.The theatre will officially re-open on 1 December with an as yet unnamed performance by a headline act. On 2 December there will be a gala night of music, comedy and circus, compered by Adam Hills.The project, part of a wider £27m restoration of Ally Pally’s east wing, is promoted as being all about channelling the original philosophy of a people’s palace. “The Victorians really understood the importance of culture and entertainment, and recreation and leisure, for the wellbeing of the soul,” said Dagnes. “For me, that’s probably even more important now than it was then. It is such an exciting opportunity to give this back.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7d8518db37e77fcadcf8dea20a99effa1c2a01d5/0_36_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5993ab52ac6769463530946a0514507d","title":"facebook first quarter 2018 revenues zuckerberg","story":"Facebook’s data privacy problems have had little impact on its profitability as the company posted record revenues for the first quarter of 2018.“Despite facing important challenges, our community and business are off to a strong start in 2018,” said Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s founder and CEO, in a statement. “We are taking a broader view of our responsibility and investing to make sure our services are used for good. But we also need to keep building new tools to help people connect, strengthen our communities, and bring the world closer together.”Facebook’s approach to privacy has come under intense scrutiny over the last few weeks, following the revelation that the personal data of millions of Americans was harvested from Facebook and improperly shared with the political consultancy Cambridge Analytica. Stoked by fears that the data may have been used to try and influence elections in the US and Europe and the discovery that Facebook collects a lot more data than the average person realises (including web browsing history and, in some cases, text messages), some users have started a #DeleteFacebook movement, including the co-founder of the Facebook-owned WhatsApp.However, much of the momentum behind the movement came in April, when Zuckerberg delivered eight hours of testimony before Congress, after the quarter was over.In the last few weeks, the social network has announced a slew of changes to its privacy tools and to the way that it collects and shares user data. It has also introduced a verification process for political advertisers and page administrators and plans to comply with Europe’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). As if to demonstrate its continued commitment to transparency, this week the company published its content moderation guidelines – a year after the  revealed the secret rules.Facebook’s chief financial officer, Dave Wehner, warned that GDPR could lead to a fall in users and revenue in Europe, particularly as people start tightening up their accounts to prevent so much targeted advertising.“While we don’t expect the changes will have a significant impact on ad revenue, any change in our ability for us and advertisers to use data can impact our optimisation potential at the margin,” he said.In spite of pledging to roll out GDPR-compliant settings to all Facebook users, the chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, said the settings “would not be exactly the same format”. Because of this, Facebook doesn’t expect there to be any impact on ad revenue outside of Europe, indicating that those settings would not make a difference to the way Facebook uses people’s personal data, which is the whole point of GDPR.Sandberg rejected any suggestion that Facebook should ersify its business model away from micro-targeted advertising.“We are proud of the ad model we’ve built,” she said. “It ensures people see more useful ads, allows businesses to grow, and keeps the service free. Advertising-supported businesses like Facebook equalise access and improve opportunity.”Zuckerberg said that changes the company had made to the news feed to prioritise “meaningful interaction” rather than “passive consumption” were already having an effect – with a decline in people passively watching video."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b1e6e2c8eaf0753e19c958f2d753c75cc5fbe88/0_171_5126_3076/master/5126.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4d683eaec0976ea23e568faae3917b62","title":"google youtube kids app parent control what children watch","story":"Enhanced controls will allow parents to handpick videos among a host of new features, but campaigners say YouTube must do moreGoogle is updating its YouTube Kids app to improve the control over the videos and channels that can be watched by children.YouTube Kids is a separate app for smartphones and tablets that provides access to a subset of the videos available on the main site. There have been 70bn video views since the app, which is used by 11m families, launched in 2015. In the app’s biggest change yet, Google is giving parents much greater control over what their children can find and watch.In controls rolling out later this year, parents will be able to manually approve inidual videos or channels that their children can access through the app, giving them the ability to pre-vet and handpick a collection of videos to ensure they are appropriate.Google is also creating collections of videos and channels from trusted channels such as Sesame Workshop and the YouTube Kids team, so that parents can select only the collections or topics they would like their children to have access to.James Beser, product director for YouTube Kids, said said: “From collections of channels from trusted partners to enabling parents to select each video and channel themselves, we’re putting parents in the driver’s seat like never before.”In addition the firm will limit the video recommendations the app will make to only those from channels that have been verified by the YouTube Kids team, when parents turn off the search function within the app. Previously recommendations could include content from any video or channel that is accessible through the YouTube Kids app, not just those verified by Google’s team.Google is also rolling out signed-in profiles for YouTube Kids across Europe, the Middle East and Asia this week, which means parents can create inidual profiles for each of their children on shared devices.Beser said that the current version of the app will still be available for those who are content to use it, but that Google was continuing to “fine tune” its filters for the more open selection of content, encouraging parents to block and flag content they do not see as appropriate.Josh Golin, executive director of the Campaign for a Commercial Free Childhood, saw the move as broadly positive, but said that more parental controls do not absolve Google of its responsibility to keep inappropriate content out of the YouTube Kids app.“It’s been clear for a long time now that algorithmic filtering on YouTube Kids doesn’t work and giving parents the ability to select more human-reviewed content is an improvement,” Golin said. “But let’s not forget that most kids are watching the main YouTube platform, where they not only exposed regularly to inappropriate recommendations and content, but also ensnared by Google’s troubling data collection practices.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb62211994aef7c3a63fc44367ac27e122b87d2d/0_129_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6372adc3d04ad52b639259c360b57920","title":"jeff bezos the boy who wanted to colonise space","story":"From a young age, the Amazon founder had dreamed up unlikely-sounding schemes. And then one took offIn 1994, Jeff Bezos held 60 meetings with family members, friends and potential investors in an attempt to persuade them to invest $50,000 (£35,000) in his revolutionary idea to create an online bookshop. He failed to convince 38 of them, and 24 years later some of them still cannot bring themselves to talk about what life might have been like if they had taken a punt on Bezos and this “Amazon thing” that the then 30-year-old hedge fund manager wouldn’t shut up about.They have given away $68m of it through their Bezos Family Foundation, which focuses on education. The foundation’s mission statement is a Winston Churchill quote: “What is the use of living, if it be not to strive for noble causes and to make this muddled world a better place for those who will live in it after we are gone?”Bezos’s parents have also given $65m to Seattle’s Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. Jackie Bezos, who was 17 and still in high school when Jeff was born, said the donation was: “The gift of time for all those people who will benefit from new treatments and cures. It’s the gift of more hugs, more graduations and more moments.” Bezos tweeted: “My parents rock.”Many industry experts reckon Amazon – which has spread its tentacles into webhosting, TV production and high-end grocery chain Whole Foods – is growing so fast that it will overtake Apple, (Alphabet) Google and Microsoft to become the first trillion-dollar company. Amazon has a market value of $750bn (£538bn) – at Monday night’s share price – making it nearly three times the size of Walmart and more than 30 times the size of the UK’s biggest retailer, Tesco.Bezos has been very, very rich for a long time, but he has only recently started to really spend his billions. In 1999, when he was already worth well north of $9bn, Bezos and his wife, MacKenzie, were still living in the one-bedroom apartment in Seattle they had rented when they moved to the city to set up Amazon five years earlier. That year the couple bought their first big house, a $10m mansion on Lake Washington, in the city’s most chichi neighbourhood.Today, however, Bezos owns almost a dozen homes across the US, and is the country’s 25th-largest landowner, according to the Land Report, a magazine that tracks US land ownership. He has made his first tentative steps into giving away a fraction of his fortune, but Bezos seriously lags behind his technology billionaire contemporaries in philanthropy. Bezos would still be the world’s second-richest man if Microsoft founder Bill Gates had not given away more than $36bn. Gates, along with Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg, Netflix’s Reed Hastings and dozens of the world’s other billionaires have signed up to the Giving Pledge commitment to give away at least half of their fortunes. So far, however, Bezos has not joined up. After being questioned about his apparent reluctance, he tweeted a request for ideas for a “philanthropy strategy”. Last year, he tweeted to thank his 400,000 followers for their input and promised “more to come”.Bezos made his first big donation earlier this year: a $33m grant to a scholarship fund for undocumented immigrants who were brought to the US as children. TheDream.US donation will fund scholarships for 1,000 participants of Barack Obama’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival (Daca) programme, who are often called Dreamers. Undocumented immigrants are not eligible for federal grants or loans, and are prevented from accessing state aid for tuition in 44 states. President Donald Trump has made life harder for Dreamers by announcing the end of Daca.Bezos’s previous biggest donation was also political: $2.5m to a campaign to defend same-sex marriage law in Washington state (the state that includes Seattle) in 2012. Jennifer Cast, a former Amazon employee who is a lesbian, emailed Bezos directly on a Sunday asking him to please consider donating between $100,000 and $200,000. “I want to have the right to marry the love of my life and to let my children and grandchildren know their family is honoured like a ‘real’ family,” Cast told Bezos. “We need help from straight people. To be very frank, we need help from wealthy straight people who care about us and who want to help us win.”Bezos replied on the Tuesday: “Jen, this is right for so many reasons. We’re in for $2.5m. Jeff \u0026amp MacKenzie.”Bezos, whom Trump has repeatedly attacked for avoiding tax at Amazon, did not acknowledge the politics of his Dreamers donation. He said the gift was in recognition of the help given to his father, who was one of 14,000 students who fled to the US from Cuba in the early 60s. His mother married Mike when Jeff was four years old, and he was legally adopted.Jorgensen, a unicyclist and bicycle shop owner, did not know he was the father of a billionaire until he was tracked down by journalist and author Brad Stone. In research for The Everything Store, his biography of Bezos, Stone turned up unannounced at Jorgensen’s Road Runner Bike Center shop in Glendale, Arizona in 2013.“I didn’t know where he was, if he had a good job or not, or if he was alive or dead,” Jorgensen told Stone. Jorgensen died in 2015.By all accounts, Bezos was gifted from a very early age. When he was a toddler he used a screwdriver to dismantle his cot because he wanted to sleep in a real bed. His genius at school is recorded for posterity in a 1977 book Turning On Bright Minds: A Parent Looks at Gifted Education in Texas, which profiles a sixth-grade Houston pupil called “Tim”. Tim, who was enrolled in a gifted children programme, is described as reading dozens of books far in advance of his years and of being incredibly interested in science. The author described him as “friendly, but serious” and of general intellectual excellence, but according to his teachers “not particularly gifted in leadership”. Tim was revealed in Stone’s book to be a pseudonym for Jeff Bezos.While Stone was widely praised for such an intimate portrait of Bezos, one reviewer on Amazon gave his book one star (the lowest possible). The reviewer was MacKenzie Bezos, who said it was littered with “numerous factual inaccuracies”.Bezos met MacKenzie at D E Shaw, a hedge fund run by computer scientist David Shaw, who is known as “King Quant” because of the firm’s pioneering role in high-speed quantitative trading. Until he met MacKenzie, when he interviewed her for a job at the hedge fund, Bezos had attempted to apply analytics to finding love. He called it “women flow” and reckoned he could increase the number of women he’d have a chance with if he took up ballroom dancing.In a profile of MacKenzie to promote her novel Traps, she told Vogue that it was she who had chased Bezos and not the other way round. Within three months, they were engaged and after another three months they married. Shortly afterwards Bezos described his idea for selling books over the internet, and while admitting she had “no business sense whatsoever” she could see “how excited he was” and agreed they should leave New York for Seattle to explore his idea. Seattle was chosen because it was close to a big book distributor and under US law the company was only required to collect sales tax for in-state sales.At high school near Miami, Bezos decided he wanted to go into space when he grew up. But, his ambition was not to be an astronaut he wanted to colonise space. He was named valedictorian of his high school class and when he graduated in 1982, the Miami Herald asked for an interview. The 18-year-old Bezos told the paper he wanted to “build space hotels, amusement parks and colonies for 2 million or 3 million people who would be in orbit”. “The whole idea is to preserve the Earth,” he told the paper. “The goal was to be able to evacuate humans. The planet would become a park.”Recently a Bezos-owned rocket called New Shepard sent a mannequin named Skywalker into orbit and the billionaire’s Blue Origin space tourism and exploration company is planning to send its first customers – including Bezos – into space next year. Blue Origin is funded by Bezos selling roughly $1bn-worth of Amazon shares a year. No prospective passengers have yet been named, but Bezos has publicly extended an invitation to Trump, tweeting that he would “reserve him a seat on the rocket, adding #sendDonaldtospace.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbd4a8dc93392eab349ef3aedda9df9d58396298/0_511_5405_3243/master/5405.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3fe1b53cd43b5888e59fef8e502c50b2","title":"malta azerbaijan energy deal losing money claim experts","story":"Leaked files reveal cost of agreement to taxpayers as opposition calls for more transparency The European commission approved a monopoly energy deal with Azerbaijan under which Maltese taxpayers could be losing tens of million of euros a year, according to an analysis of leaked files.A whistleblower gave a cache of data to the journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia, who was killed by a car bomb in October.The leaked material has been shared with the Daphne Project, a collaboration of 18 media organisations from 15 countries, including the , Reuters and Süddeutsche Zeitung, led by France’s Forbidden Stories.A fearless anti-corruption journalist, Daphne Caruana Galizia’s reporting came to international attention with her exposes in the 2016 Panama Papers project.On 16 October the following year, the Maltese reporter was murdered by a bomb placed under the driver’s seat of her car.The Daphne Project was created to continue her investigations. It is a collaboration of 18 media organisations in 15 different countries, including the , Reuters, Le Monde and the New York Times.The project is the first to be led by\u0026nbspForbidden Stories, an international network of journalists who stand ready to take over when colleagues are silenced through imprisonment or murder.The project will publish a series of fresh revelations, setting out the dangers that alleged political corruption and poor controls on money laundering inside Malta pose to law and order in Europe.Caruana Galizia died before being able to publish any findings from the leak. However, three energy experts in London have examined the files. They contain pricing information and contracts that Malta’s current government has so far refused to share with the public. Some of the material concerns a deal with Azerbaijan’s state-owned oil and gas company Socar, worth more than €1bn, under which Malta agreed to import all the gas needed to supply its power stations for the next 10 years.Over the past year, Malta has paid at least €131.6m ($153m at annualised exchange rates) for its gas – nearly twice the open market rate.Maltese taxpayers were losing money “hand over fist”, according to one expert.The deal was struck with Socar in 2015. Benchmarking indicated Malta was paying a significantly higher rate than similar purchases from the wider market negotiated at that time by Greece, Italy and Turkey. Estimates by the  suggest Socar paid $40m less for the gas than the sum it charged Malta.The gas is transported in liquid form, known as liquefied natural gas. Experts said there were questions to answer about why Socar, which had no relevant experience in producing or trading LNG when the deal was signed, was chosen as Malta’s partner. There is no suggestion of wrongdoing by any of the parties involved. However, the lack of a public tender for the gas contract, and the absence of public information about its structure and costs, have hampered scrutiny and debate about whether the government secured the best deal for taxpayers, opposition politicians claim.Malta’s Labour government says its energy market policy has been a success. By switching its power stations from fuel oil to cheaper, cleaner gas, it has slashed household electricity bills by a quarter.The former Nationalist party leader Simon Busuttil said: “There was a total lack of transparency on this contract.“It took the government two years to publish it and even then, the juicy parts were blacked out. There is now the inexplicable involvement of Socar, when the gas could have been purchased directly from Shell at a cheaper price.“There is a fixed price for an unreasonably long time. And there is also a huge markup being made by Socar for no contribution at all, at the expense of Maltese taxpayers.”The leaked material concerns a company called Electrogas, which is one third owned by Socar.Electrogas has played a key role in Malta’s transition from using fuel oil to LNG. Liquefied gas can arrive by sea, which is crucial to the island nation because it has no gas pipelines connected to mainland Europe.In 2013, Malta held an open competition for a company to build facilities at Delimara on the southern tip of the main island. The company would import LNG, store it, convert the liquid back into gas and pump it into turbines operated by the state-owned utility Enemalta.The winning bidder was also required to build turbines of its own, to supply Enemalta with electricity. The Electrogas consortium was selected, in a public process in which 18 bidders expressed an interest. Leaked tender documents show Enemalta requested a fixed price for the first five years. Because the price of the gas was included in the cost of the bid, there was no separate public tender for the LNG supply contract. In 2015, Electrogas signed contracts to buy all the gas Malta needed from Socar. Regular deliveries began in April 2017, once its facilities at Delimara were built.Azerbaijan is a major oil and gas producer, but it does not produce LNG. The Daphne Project has established that Socar is not supplying the gas from its own reserves. It is in fact buying the gas from Shell and selling it on to Electrogas at a profit. Socar does not handle the gas, organise its transportation or add value in any physical process.The most recent delivery from Shell, on 22 March, appears to have come from fields off Trinidad and Tobago, via a tanker called Maran Gas Apollonia.Until now, Malta’s taxpayers were in the dark about the exact figures, because the government has only published the relevant contracts in redacted form. The Daphne Project has seen the originals.Since April 2017, when regular LNG shipments to Malta began, Socar has apparently benefited from the discrepancy between the fixed and market rates. Oil and gas prices tumbled between 2014 and 2016, and are only just beginning to recover. The cost of LNG is still well below the fixed price Malta is committed to paying.Simon Pirani, a senior visiting research fellow at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, said: “If I were a Maltese taxpayer, I would want to know why such a poor deal was signed, and why a Socar subsidiary had been brought in as a seller of LNG.”Two other specialists, who asked to remain anonymous, reviewed the contracts and said a five-year commitment on the agreed terms was unheard of.“Socar are getting paid double by the Maltese utility,” said one. “That’s a huge margin. Malta should push to renegotiate that contract, because they are losing money hand over fist.”Konrad Mizzi, the Maltese tourism minister, steered the project through in his previous role as minister for energy. In a six-page letter to the , he said his government’s initiatives had secured hundreds of millions in investment from corporations and banks. The switch from oil to gas had lowered electricity prices and improved air quality.He said Malta’s energy sector had been “in desperate need of a complete overhaul”, with Enemalta in debt despite charging some of the highest prices per customer in Europe.The state provider’s financial woes were one of the main reasons for outsourcing the whole gas supply chain, he said. The decision had been shaped by advice from international law firms and specialist consultants, he said, and received financial backing from a consortium of leading banks.Mizzi argued the cost of the five-year fixed term was worth paying because “security of supply and price stability were paramount”.The European commission, which says it was made aware of the pricing details, raised no objections and approved the deal in January 2017.A spokesperson for the commission’s directorate general for competition, which approved the deal, said its role had been to check Electrogas was not being overpaid by Enemalta, rather than inspect the deal with Socar in isolation. It had concluded that the rate of return for Electrogas was “in line” with similar projects. However, among the leaked material is a report by a UK consultancy hired by Electrogas to analyse the costs, in order to convince banks to invest. In the report, the consultancy questioned Socar’s involvement. “The arrangement is unusual,” an adviser noted, “and typically one would expect the LNG supplier, in this case Shell, to contract directly with the project.”In a convoluted chain, the gas Malta needs is sold by Shell to Socar, which then sells it to Electrogas, which sells it on to the majority state-owned grid operator, Enemalta. For the first five years of the 10-year contract with Socar, Malta has committed to a fixed price of €9.40 ($11.50) per mmbtu, a unit of gas. Since deliveries began in April 2017, the average price per unit on the UK NPB, a widely used indicator for Europe’s wholesale liquified gas market, has been $6.20 – nearly half the Maltese fixed rate.This does not include transportation costs, whereas the €9.40 does. But Socar is still paying much less for the gas than the price at which it sells to Malta.Malta buys a minimum of 14m mmbtu per year under the deal with Socar. Using average exchange rates for the past year, Malta paid an estimated $153m to Socar for gas.This represents a potential $40m profit for the Azerbaijani energy company. Socar declined to comment on pricing, saying it was restricted by confidentiality clauses.Malta could not have foreseen the sustained oil and gas price crash that has made its deal with Socar look like poor value. However, it has the option to redraw or cancel the agreement. Other countries have done this: Lithuania secured a price cut from its supplier, Statoil, and the Italian energy company Edison went to court to reduce the cost of its deal with Algeria."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c3d8e12c120d8526fbb5e10c8d3003362736aa47/0_259_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e2a5b19e3b6cf6b113f51a71c05e3979","title":"how palm oil ban has made the eu a dirty word in malaysia","story":"Angry farmers despair at what will happen to their livelihoods when the Brussels biofuels ban takes effect in 2020In the small farming settlement of Palong in rural Malaysia, the EU is a dirty word. A few months ago, these men – mostly in their sixties, their skin brown and weathered from years working the land – had never even heard of the European parliament: but now their livelihoods are at risk because of it.The crop they harvest is palm oil, one of Malaysia’s biggest exports worth $20bn a year. The European Parliament has voted overwhelmingly to ban the use of palm oil in all European biofuels by 2020, citing environmental concerns. If it is approved by the European Commission, the impact on the 650,000 smallholder palm farmers in Malaysia will be devastating. “I have spent all my money on the palm oil farm, I have recently planted new trees that will last for the next 25 years, and my whole family relies on this. It’s how my kids afford to study,” said Hussain Mohamed, 66, who has had his 10-acre plantation for over 30 years, and supports his entire family on the income. “Our whole community here totally depends on palm oil. But now we hear about the EU biofuel ban and this came as a shock to us, we still do not understand it and everybody is scared of what is going to happen to us in two years time. We have all signed petitions,” he said.Shaking his head angrily, he said the uncertainty had already affected the selling price of palm oil. “I am proud of my farm, I really take care of the trees every day. How can they say I am bad for the environment?”In the past few years, campaigners have gathered mountains of damning evidence that the growing demand for palm oil from the EU and China has fuelled massive illegal deforestation in Indonesia and Malaysia by governments and big corporations, forcing several species to the brink of extinction. Lehan Samiran, 62, who has had his 10 acres since 1981, shook his fists angrily. He has three children in university who are all supported by the income from his palm oil farm. “Why are the EU doing this to us?” he said. “They have not thought about the farmers, about the human price. The statement ignored us. They are so far away they do not care. We are not harming the environment, we are looking after it. I am very angry, everybody is very angry. How can we not be, this will affect our rice bowl.”The EU is Malaysia’s third biggest palm oil customer, and much of it is imported to make biofuels. The farmers and Felda also fear the resolution would be just the first step towards banning palm oil outright in the EU. Iceland supermarket has already said it will not use palm oil in its own- brand goods. The proposed ban in biofuels, which is part of a revision of the EU’s renewables directives, has already prompted the rumblings of an international trade dispute, with Malaysia and Indonesia threatening retaliatory sanctions against EU goods in response, and Malaysia reportedly threatened to cancel defence contracts worth £5bn if the UK backed a palm oil ban in Brussels.MEP Kateřina Konečná, who was the first to bring the motion to ban palm oil to the European parliament said that while she understood the plight of the small farmers, “these smallholders are a slice of big national and international corporations who are responsible for deforestation.” But a spokesperson for Felda, questioned why palm oil had been singled out over other vegetable oils used to make biofuels - many of which, like rapeseed, are grown in EU countries - calling it “crop apartheid” and condemned the EU for disregarding “the hundreds of thousands of lives it will destroy”.“It’s the same colonial attitudes, the white man imposing their rule on us from afar.” he said. “If the EU respect Malaysia as a sovereign country and as a partner in development and trade, they should not put this unfair restriction on us, and instead work with us on environmental concerns. Freezing us out is wrong.”He was echoed by Dato’ Haji Aliasak Bin Haji Ambia, the President of the National Association of Small Holders Malaysia. “Palm oil has allowed the rural poor in Malaysia to develop our own land, lift ourselves and our families out of poverty, and take control of our own economic destiny,” he said. With the Malaysian election coming up on 9 May, this is also a pivotal issue. Felda farmers are a key support base for the ruling coalition, Barisan Nasional, and prime minister Najib Razak has made promising to defend palm oil one of the talking points of his campaign. Greenpeace this week published further evidence that palm oil has driven further forest clearance in Papua, Indonesia, tainting its reputation further. Yet a ban does not necessarily solve the environmental problems.The market for biodiesel in the EU is still growing, with a large percentage currently made from palm oil. Should the ban be implemented, other vegetable oils will have to be be used in its place, such as soybean oil, which has also been proved to be environmentally destructive, responsible for mass deforestation of the Amazon rainforest.There are also wider political ramifications of the EU ban. Banning palm oil in biofuels is likely to also weaken the EU’s influence in southeast Asia, and hand even more more power to China – the biggest palm oil customer in the world – at a time when the EU has expressed concern about increasing Chinese domination of the region. But for the country’s farmers, this is simply about sustaining the food in their rice bowls. Nur Harun Muhammad, 64, stood among the palms that he has tended to every day for the past 35 years and smiled widely. “See, not poison, not bad,” Nur said, showing off the bright yellow palm oil that had oozed out onto his hands. “When you go back to England please, please tell them palm oil is good.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a8932e6401b9ea41576af9d4835e808a24864fa5/0_323_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=62b844845f0b3604114c55d747055710","title":"irish eu commissioner urges may to rethink customs union stance","story":"Phil Hogan to call for a ‘softening of the red lines’ between Brexiters and remainersIreland’s EU commissioner has urged Theresa May to face down the “immoderate ideology” of Brexiters and reconsider her position on remaining in a customs union with the EU.Phil Hogan, the commissioner for agriculture, will tell the senate in the Irish parliament on Thursday that remarks by Jacob Rees-Mogg about Ireland’s beef trade with Britain were “unhelpful and irresponsible”.Speaking earlier this week, Rees-Mogg said the UK was in a much stronger negotiating position than May would have parliament believe and called for her to be “much firmer and clearer” about the damage to the EU if Britain crashes out without a deal.“If we were to apply the common external tariff on Irish beef, the Irish agricultural industry is in serious trouble. You’ve got to ask the EU: does it want to sacrifice the economy of Ireland on the altar of EU ideology? My guess is that the answer is no, and therefore we are in a very strong negotiating position,” he said.He added the government should abandon the customs partnership concept, declaring it “completely cretinous”. Hogan is expected to say on Thursday that such remarks highlight a continuing rift in London between Brexiters and remainers. He will say: “Both sides should compare and honestly weigh the costs and benefits of a free trade agreement versus a customs union. This is a moment for balanced judgment, not costly immoderate ideology.“Some form of customs arrangement and softening of the red lines must be in the best interest of all concerned.”He will say he recognises that the UK’s objective is to achieve a better future for its citizens, but that this “cannot be achieved on a wing and a prayer”. The commissioner will also confirm that the EU has “sent the UK back to the drawing board on the Irish border” and it must come up with new ideas before June. His remarks come hours after Brexit secretary David Davis said he believed the Irish border conundrum would remain wrapped up in wider talks and would not be resolved until October.Hogan will warn that the June target set by the EU for fresh ideas on the border has not moved and has consequences. “No decision on the Irish border, no withdrawal treaty, no withdrawal treaty, no transition,” he will say. His words chime with those of Michel Barnier last week, after proposals on the Irish border were comprehensively rejected by the EU.

He has no retirement fund in place and would use the Lifetime Isa to save for the long-term futureUnfortunately, the nature of being self-employed means there’s no regularity in how often I’m paid. Projects can be sporadic and uncertain. Invoices can be delayed, projects can drag on or I can just not win work for a while. If I don’t work, I don’t make money. It’s a scary and risky career but it’s very rewarding at times.I pay myself a set salary that helps me limit how much I spend each month, and keeps the money I shouldn’t spend in my business. I also put some of this salary into my savings. Anything extra I earn at the end of the year usually goes into my savings too. It’s definitely stressful though. I sometimes worry if I’ll carry on making enough money as each year passes, but if I can stay organised with my business and earnings, I can relax a lot more.As well as having an unreliable income, it’s also challenging having to calculate how much I’ll spend in expenses for my business and how much tax I’ll owe each year. There are days I wish I was employed again, so I could rely on a steady stream of income and know how much I can actually put into my savings each month. However, the upside of being freelance is that I can earn a higher amount each month than I normally would when working for a company, which makes the opportunity to save far greater.The main attraction of a Lifetime Isa for me is the prospect of having a retirement fund for when I’m older. Being self-employed, I don’t currently have a pension and it’s scary knowing I have nothing to fall back on. I’m hitting 30 this year and having a Lifetime Isa or a pension is a must for me now. I’m always one to want to find the best option possible and other Isas currently on the market don’t feel worthwhile any more.There’s nothing worse than constantly saving and never enjoying your money. My wife and I are hooked on travel and like to see as much of the world as possible. Aside from wanting to build a financial safety net for the future, our main saving goal is to have enough to enjoy ourselves along the way.Laura Lucas, 29, is a marketing assistant in Manchester and a lifestyle blogger in her spare time. She is considering a Lifetime Isa to save for her first houseI blog most evenings, which doesn’t provide much income, but I hope it’ll be my main job one day. Blogging is good in that I can save money that I might have otherwise spent on dinner out or a new outfit, because I’m lucky enough to get gifted these sorts of things. I feel like I’m currently working two jobs, one that I love but which doesn’t pay, and my main job that I rely on for income. My partner and I got engaged over Christmas, so we’re saving for a wedding in about two years’ time, as well as starting to think about buying our first home together. We’ll probably do the wedding on a budget with some special bits and bobs thrown in, but we’ll have to plan ahead to make sure we can afford the extravagant extras. I’d also love to have an engagement party in the next few months and it’s my partner’s 30th birthday this year, so even though we want to celebrate these occasions in style we might have to dial them down a little to save money. We both work really hard, so we don’t want to cut out anything like holidays or evening drinks with friends. I like to think I’m a good saver, and a Lifetime Isa would help us to save for our first house. It’s great to have something backed by the government to help young people save. It’s challenging these days but a Lifetime Isa encourages you to think long term about home ownership and retirement. I already have a couple of savings accounts that I sometimes dip into for Christmas and birthdays, holidays and more expensive purchases, but setting these accounts up can be stressful. It takes a lot of research and background work to fully understand what you’re getting when you sign up.At the moment, I’m not quite sure where I want to be money-wise. I’m grateful for my living situation and being able to live comfortably. However, there are many more things we’d love to do, like decorating our apartment and travelling more, but with our wedding and buying a house on the horizon, we’re trying to be a bit more sensible and only invest small amounts at a time in things we know we need."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c7367799adc822bdfd24c4f8625cef7eff67e830/0_80_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=35d69f76f4e11be8bdd1e38e50a78438","title":"my financial future can i have my brunch and eat it too","story":"The options appear to be: never socialise and stay in to save for a house, or live a normal, modern urban life and spiral into debt.

Living paycheck to paycheck isn’t the dream and maybe neither is owning a home, but there must be a way I could at least consider the option.I’m certainly not alone, but maybe we’re placing too much value on “Yolo” – apparently a typical habit of young people today – so I’ve asked Paul Bridgwater, head of commercial and proposition at financial services provider OneFamily, and millennial lifestyle and personal finance expert Lisa Rowan from The Penny Hoarder what they think – and luckily neither suggested a five-year period where I give up all that I hold dear.Is it really that hard to save in a big city or am I being led astray?Rowan suggests that, unfortunately, it’s not all in my head. “Affordable, low-amenity units are being replaced with luxury buildings that are simply out of reach for many people, especially young people in the early stages of their careers,” she says. “This competitive housing environment means more workers in their 20s and 30s are enduring long commutes from the suburbs or are living with several roommates in order to make the most of their budgets.” But, Bridgwater says, while it can feel unattainable without the help from “the bank of mum and dad” we do have the benefit of living in a connected, digital age that can help us achieve our financial goals.I really value my social life – do I have to give up a chunk of it for five years?No, says Rowan, but there are some hacks to help make sure you don’t spend most of your monthly wages during the excitement of payday. In short, be at least a bit prepared. “Knowing the type of activity upfront can help you determine whether an event is a social and financial priority for you – then, it’s easier to make compromises. You may skip on the 12-person birthday dinner at a fancy restaurant, but you can still meet the group for drinks or dessert afterward. You can still go on a bar crawl with your friends, but perhaps eat a hearty meal before you leave the house,” she says.Bridgwater agrees, and says it’s safe to assume that most of your friends are in the same boat, so be straight up with them. “Money is a bit of a taboo subject for any age group, especially in the UK. On a practical level, earnings, savings and debts are not really discussed and perhaps they should be,” he says. “Like anything else in life, by talking and sharing issues, interesting solutions will come to light.”OK, so maybe I should be budgeting. What are some handy guidelines?Bridgwater says that budgeting isn’t the same for everyone, but taking away the temptation to spend is often the easiest way to save. “Create different accounts for your big expenses (housing, bills and savings) and then set up a standing order into these accounts one to two days after your wages go in from your main account. You’ll then know the money you have left in your main account is money you can spend,” he says.So, can I think about saving for a big purchase and still keep seeing my friends?Yes, says Rowan: “You can have your instant and delayed gratification at the same time.” A product like OneFamily’s stocks and shares Lifetime Isa is a good start when considering your options. With a Lifetime Isa, for every £4 put in, the government adds £1 – so save up to £4,000 a year and get £1,000 as a bonus (available after 12 months). Lifetime Isas are available either based on cash investments, which can be preferable for first-time house purchases in the short-term or stocks and shares investments, which might be preferable if you are aiming to buy your first home in five or more years, as they offer potentially better returns over the longer term, but be aware that capital is at risk.For information on the OneFamily stocks and shares Lifetime Isa, visit OneFamily.

Photograph: Charles McQuillanGettyIreland has 208 Border crossings, according to the first officially agreed count since the island was partitioned, almost a century ago.Emails between Government technicians reveal they endured a “nightmare” trying to definitively map out all roads, paths and dirt tracks that traverse the 500km frontier. In addition to technical limitations, there was confusion about crossings where the Border runs up the middle of roads or juts in and out of routes, or where roads are privately owned on one side and publicly maintained on the other.The joint mapping exercise involving the Department of Transport and the Northern Ireland Department for Infrastructure, which started last year, came to light after being referred to in minutes released after a Freedom of Information request.Newly disclosed documents charting the process since then show the Border runs along the middle of 11 roads, which is more than twice the number originally believed, while the frontier meets in the middle of at least three bridges and dissects two ferry crossings.On one section of the Dublin to Belfast motorway, traffic travelling in one direction is in the North while that travelling in the opposite direction is in the South, the documents also reveal. It is “half north and half south”, an official says.Previous estimates put the number of road crossings between Ireland and Northern Ireland – the UK’s only land border with another European Union country – at 275. In one of the final emails between Dublin and Belfast in recent weeks, signing off on the first agreed count, an official concludes: “I’m now getting 208 Border crossings in total, hope you are too.” The final figure will confirm there are more crossings in Ireland than along the entire border between the European Union and the countries to its east, which has 137.The emails show officials immediately ran into difficulties when they began working together, last November, over differing classifications between Belfast and Dublin of whether roads were public or private. “It’s almost impossible . . . due to the variation in this on each side,” said one.Another official conceded the final report on Border crossings may have to carry a disclaimer. “With something so ambiguous as the Border there will be a few metres out here and there,” he said.A third added: “There are practical implications when it comes to roads that are split along the middle that probably can’t be represented on maps but that is as good a way of representing it.”The Department for Infrastructure said it expects the final report to be made publicly available in the coming weeks.Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3474314.1524687537!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"independent alliance issues ultimatum to sean canney","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIn an arrangement that was brokered after the general election in 2016, it was agreed that Sean Canney, pictured, and Kevin ’Boxer’ Moran would rotate the ministry.  Photograph: Gareth Chaney CollinsThe Independent Alliance has issued Sean Canney with an ultimatum telling him he must decide whether he wants to remain part of the group by Friday.Mr Canney is understood to be considering his future with the alliance following his failure last week to be reinstated as a Minister of State.The Galway East TD was contacted by Minister of State John Halligan yesterday and urged to publicly state whether he wishes to stay on with the alliance.Mr Halligan told Mr Canney the dispute was damaging the group and requested clarity on his position by Friday.It is understood Mr Canney was also asked about his decision to vote against the alliance’s proposals on drink-driving contained in the controversial Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill in the Dáil on Tuesday night.Mr Halligan told The : “I was asked by the Independent Alliance to make contact and I did. It was not a hostile conversation but I think we need to know whether he wants to be a member of the alliance or not.“We hope we will have clarification by the weekend. We obviously hope he stays but that is a matter for him to decide now.”The  contacted Mr Canney yesterday but was unable to reach him.It is understood he told Mr Halligan he would be consulting his supporters over the coming days before making a final decision.He also defended his decision to oppose the Bill insisting his opposition had been known to the alliance for some time. Mr Canney said he was assured there was a free vote on the legislation.Mr Canney is also believed to have met Taoiseach Leo Varadkar yesterday to discuss the dispute and his future.While he is is thought to be on the verge of leaving the five-member alliance, he ie eager to continue to support the Government on a case-to-case basis.Mr Canney is also looking for clarity on whether he continue in his role as assistant Government chief whip, which earns him an additional €15,000 on top of his TDs salary.The dispute centres on a row over who should remain as Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works.In an arrangement that was brokered after the general election in 2016, it was agreed that Mr Canney and Kevin ’Boxer’ Moran would rotate the ministry.Mr Canney was minister for the first year, after which Mr Moran took over the position.However, when the second anniversary of the Government approached Mr Canney argued to the Alliance that the position should rotate back to him.The other members of the Alliance backed Mr Moran’s argument that given the uncertainty about the longevity of the Government, the understanding had always been that there be one arrangement.The three founding members of the group - Minister for Transport Shane Ross, Minister of State with special responsibility for disability Finian McGrath and Mr Halligan - have ministerial jobs for the duration of the Government’s term.While the role has triggered the dispute, it is understood relations between Mr Canney and members of the alliance have soured in recent months.We send our newsletter out every Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday morningOur politics team’s behind-the-scenes take on events of the day in your inbox each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3474240.1524696521!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"uk trapped by self imposed contradiction on brexit says hogan","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBrexit warning to Theresa May: “The UK has to face up to the fact that decision time is here.” Photograph: AFPGettyThe United Kingdom is trying to invent a new kind of Border that will not work because it is trapped by the “self-imposed contradiction” of its Brexit position, the EU commissioner for agriculture, Phil Hogan, will tell the Seanad today.“The UK has to face up to the fact that decision time is here,” Mr Hogan will say, echoing the warning of the European Council president, Donald Tusk, last week. “The EU must be satisfied the UK’s invention will work or it is the backstop. The deadline is set for June. No decision, no withdrawal treaty. No withdrawal treaty, no transition.”Mr Hogan will also take aim at the unwavering commitment of the British prime minister, Theresa May, to her “red lines” opposing a customs union, hinting that “London-London” discussions, between Brexiteers and Remainers, “will show us how badly the UK wants what the prime minister has asked for”.In Brussels much hope is being placed on the possibility that the House of Commons will overrule Ms May on the customs union.Mr Hogan will also suggest that Ireland, while maintaining its neutrality, needs to think again about its attitude to European security. “For us, bordering the Atlantic Ocean, security questions may sometimes seem remote. But is this a moment for us to review our thinking on these wider, strategic questions?“We have felt the strength and benefit of EU solidarity over the past couple of years. Imagine what it means to our fellow members in the Baltic region, for example, who border Russia and have large Russian-speaking populations. Imagine what it means to those member countries that are in the front line in dealing with immigration from the Middle East and the Mediterranean.“As part of the EU we all share the union’s destiny. We who have felt, and are still feeling, the benefits of its solidarity should be ready to ask how we may better contribute to the solidarity offered to others. We value our neutral status but should not stand aloof because of it. We should also want to play our full part in the union’s security.”Mr Hogan warns that Brexiteers appear to “want to carry on the civil war until there’s not a building left standing on the other side. Is this the sort of victory they seek? If so they don’t only endanger the UK’s economy but its society also.” Mr Rees-Mogg said: “If we were to apply the common external tariff on Irish beef, the Irish agricultural industry is in serious trouble. You’ve got to ask the EU: does it want to sacrifice the economy of Ireland on the altar of EU ideology?

Photograph: Patrick KovarikAFPGettyPresident Emmanuel Macron likes to convince people. In manner and method, he is unlike his predecessors. Nicolas Sarkozy cajoled and bullied. François Hollande just gave up. Macron fixes interlocutors with his intense blue stare and builds a Cartesian argument. If that doesn’t work, he starts over, patiently, but with determination.The past week has tested the young president’s powers of persuasion. Early in the hours of April 14th, Macron used his constitutional power as commander in chief for the first time, joining the US and Britain in launching cruise missiles against three chemical weapons installations in Syria. The goal, Macron said later, was to convince Bashar al Assad and Vladimir Putin that the international community was more than a “nice” and “weak” body they could push around.In a further exercise in persuasion, Macron volunteered for a combative, 2½ hour live television interview on Sunday night, during which he made the surprising claim that, “Ten days ago, President Trump said the US would pull out of Syria. We convinced him it was necessary to stay for the duration.”The White House later issued a statement saying Trump’s view had not changed, and the French president made an embarrassing climbdown on Monday, claiming he “never said” the US or France would remain militarily engaged in Syria for the long term.Perhaps Macron, whose nickname is “Jupiter”, is threatened by hubris, the sin of pride that afflicted Greek gods.The rest of the week was one long attempt to convince Europeans and the French of the rightness of his positions. Macron – who has become the de facto leader of Europe – received the heads of the three Baltic states who have teamed up with five other northern EU countries, including the Netherlands and Ireland, to thwart his efforts to further integrate the euro zone.Then, before a more sympathetic audience at the EU parliament in Strasbourg, Macron pleaded with proponents of liberal democracy to wake up and oppose the populist authoritarians who deny European values. Macron then travelled to Berlin in yet another effort to enlist German chancellor Angela Merkel’s support for his European reform agenda.On Monday, Macron will go to Washington for a three-day state visit, the first of Trump’s presidential term. Although the two men have clashed on climate change, the Iran nuclear accord, trade protectionism and the rise of Eurosceptical populism, Trump appears to have been charmed by the young president, who says Franco-American co-operation is crucial in the fight against terrorism.As the first anniversary of Macron’s election approaches on May 7th, and a half century after the May 1968 revolution, a different kind of spring is flowering in France. For the first time in decades, the country is reversing its post second World War decline, and the persuasive Macron is turning France into the world’s greatest soft power.There is, of course, discontent. It wouldn’t be France if there wasn’t. This week Macron also confronted striking railway workers in the Vosges, telling them to “stop taking people hostage.” The country is struggling through a rolling strike over the reform of the SNCF railway company.And despite Macron’s best efforts to reassure them, many in France suspect their young president is out to destroy the familiar but dysfunctional “French social model”. In their eyes, Macron is pushing France into the chasm of savage, race-to-the bottom capitalism.So what do they make of him in his home town? The  travelled there to find out.Macron was born in Amiens, the capital of Picardy, 40 years ago and lived here until just before his 17th birthday. From age 11 to 16, he studied at the Jesuit school La Providence.Built in the graceless concrete style of the 1950s, “La Pro” is an elementary, secondary and technical school for 2,000 pupils, spread over several acres. Aside from occasional crucifixes, calendars of Pope Francis and portraits of St Ignatius of Loyola, the religious footprint is light. The teachers are lay people. The priest visits only once a week now.Not a single plaque or photograph records that the president and first lady of France passed through these corridors. Yet this is where Macron asked to be baptised at the age of 12, and where, at 15, he fell in love with his future wife, a French and drama teacher called Brigitte Trogneux Auzière.Macron has always been drawn to older people. His maternal grandmother, Germaine “Manette” Nogues, died in his arms five years ago, at the age of 97. The Protestant humanist philosopher Paul Ricoeur was a spiritual father to him the progressive socialist millionaire Henry Hermand his political mentor. “He’s attracted by knowledge, by people who have experience,” his neurologist father, Jean-Michel (67), says over lunch in Amiens.At La Pro and subsequently at Henri IV, France’s leading lycée and prep school in Paris, Macron often stayed after class to talk to teachers.Marc Defernand (78) taught Macron history and geography here, and was principal of Macron’s section. “He was more mature than other students,” says Defernand. “He always asked a lot of questions. Sometimes he would pick up a conversation we’d started eight days earlier, exactly where we’d left off.”In the autumn of 2016, Defernand queued in a local bookshop to ask Macron to sign his autobiographical manifesto, Révolution. The retired educator is moved, recalling what happened. “He grabbed me by the hand and said, ‘Monsieur Defernand! It’s so good to see you!’” Macron inscribed the book: “To Marc, this ‘Revolution’, which owes more to him than he knows. In friendship, Emmanuel.”We visit the 700-seat theatre where Emmanuel Macron and Brigitte Trogneux Auzière adapted a play by Eduardo De Filippo together.“He was dynamite,” Defernand says. “I told him that if he continued, he would be the Gérard Philippe of the 21st century. It was difficult for others to act in the same play with him. In the same way, it’s difficult for his cabinet ministers now.”Defernand wasn’t aware of the relationship at the time, though he knew Macron went often to Auzière’s house. “I assumed there was a flirt between him and her daughter Laurence,” he says.The scandal of a married teacher with three children having an affair with a student nearly 25 years her junior has been transformed into romantic legend. Everyone would rather forget the trauma.“Jesuits never pried into people’s private lives. There was no morality investigation,” Defernand says. “There were unmarried teachers living together at the time. I was more worried about students taking drugs.”The fact that Brigitte continued to teach at La Pro for years after her lover’s departure, and then transferred to Lycée St Louis de Gonzague when they began to live together later in Paris, is further evidence of tolerance, Defernand says.A tragic love story, known to most French people, occurred a quarter-century earlier and helped pave the way for Macron and Auzière.Schoolteacher Gabrielle Russier (32) had an affair with a lycée student half her age, Christian Rossi, in Marseille. The youth’s parents filed a complaint against the teacher and had their son placed in a mental hospital. Russier was given a suspended prison sentence and took her own life. The story became the subject of books, films and songs. Asked about it at a press conference, former president Georges Pompidou famously quoted a poem by Paul Eluard that was sympathetic to women accused of having slept with German soldiers during the war.The historian Jean-François Sirinelli\u0026nbspcompares the Russier and Macron stories in his book Les Révolutions françaises, to show how much France evolved in a single generation. “Gabrielle Russier takes her own life in 1969. Emmanuel Macron and his teacher start an affair in the 1990s, and in May 2017, Brigitte Macron becomes first lady of France.”Macron’s parents learned of the affair by chance. “My wife was much more upset than I was,” Prof Macron says. “It may sound macho, but I thought he’d get over it. He didn’t . . . I thought it was a little early. It wasn’t the way I envisioned life, but it wasn’t my life. I raised my children to be free and independent.”The Macrons didn’t consider filing charges against Brigitte Auzière, but they asked to meet her. “I was requisitioned to impose authority,” Prof Macron laughs. “I told her, ‘He’s a minor. I want him to complete his studies. After that, he’s free to do what he wants.’”The president’s parents have been hurt by press reports that they sent their son to Paris to get him away from Auzière. “He was going to go to Henri IV anyway. It was planned,” Prof Macron says, nonetheless admitting that perhaps Emmanuel “went a little early”.At La Pro, I ask a class of 14-15 year-olds, Macron’s age when he met Brigitte, if they could fall in love with a teacher. The teenagers laugh and say yes. “If it happened to someone our age, it would shock me,” says a student called Grégoire. “But now that he’s an adult, it doesn’t bother me.”The students say it’s “cool” that Macron is president. “He was elected because there was Marine Le Pen,” pipes in Ayoub, of north African origin. Perhaps parroting their parents’ opinions, the youths object to rising taxes and praise the appointment of cabinet ministers who are not professional politicians. For the future, they predict flying cars and tell me France will never know full employment.On a scale of one to 10, they give the young president an approval rating of seven. “He has to prove himself,” one explains. Like France, Macron’s successors at La Pro are waiting to see.The Amienois may seem blasé about their president, but his father attributes this attitude to the “taciturn, reserved” character of Picard people. The region particularly suffered in both world wars, has a miserable climate and has been decimated by de-industralisation.His son is an atypical Picard, “an extrovert” infused with the sun of the southwest on the side of his mother, Françoise Nogues-Macron.History and bloodlines led me to Macron père, to find out more about the family’s English ancestry. In February, Macron spent an evening with the Presidential Press Association. As the representative for foreign journalists, I was part of the welcoming party. I gave him a sepia postcard of English soldiers in Amiens in 1918. \u0026nbspMacron studied the photograph closely. “You know, they found me an English great grandfather,” he said with a laugh, staring at the postcard. “He was called George Robertson.” The president scrutinised the English faces for a long moment. He was looking for a face that resembled his own.Towards the end of last year’s presidential campaign, Brigitte Macron mentioned to British journalists that her husband had a great grandfather called “Mr Robertson from Bristol”. The London Times, Mirror and Daily Mail researched the story and told the Macrons more than they had ever known about “Mr Robertson”.George William Robertson was born in Bristol in December 1887, and is believed to have fought in the Battle of the Somme. Distant relatives in England have preserved his war medals.Robertson married Macron’s great grandmother, Suzanne Leblond, in the town of Abbeville, 40km from Amiens, in 1919. They had three daughters. The middle daughter, Jacqueline, born in 1922, was Emmanuel Macron’s paternal grandmother.“He disappeared from one day to the next,” Prof Macron told me. “No one in the family ever heard from him. Suzanne raised three daughters alone. She kept a very modest grocery shop in Abbeville. My parents sent me to live with her and my aunts for two years as a child.”The failed marriage to an Englishman “was never, never talked about. The family kept no trace of him. I never saw a picture,” Prof Macron continues. George Robertson married again, settled in east London and kept a grocery shop, like his ex-wife, Suzanne. A step-daughter told the Mirror that he liked to sing Roses of Picardy, which he had learned in the trenches.Had a butcher from Bristol not fought in the Somme, married a Frenchwoman and fathered her children, Emmanuel Macron would not exist, would not be president of France today.Macron’s intellectual precociousness and his relationship with Brigitte meant he “skipped his adolescence”, his father says. In the autumn of 1993, three months short of his 17th birthday, the future president moved to a garret near the Lycée Henri IV in Paris. \u0026nbspHe continued his relationship with Brigitte. “When I went to see him in his chambre de bonne, sometimes he called through the door for me to come back later,” Prof Macron laughs. “I knew she was there with him.”Christian Monjou taught Macron American and British civilisation for three years at Henri IV. Though he did not know about the romance, Monjou noticed that Macron raced off to Amiens the moment classes ended on Saturday. “It was a case of\u0026nbsp ‘the ided self’,” Monjou says in an interview in his book-lined study.Macron obtained his baccalauréat with honours, but twice failed the entrance exam for the École Normale Supérieure, which trains French academics. It was the only failure of his life. Had it not been for the distraction of romance with Brigitte, Monjou says, Macron would have succeeded in the exam and become an academic.Against all odds, Brigitte Macron eventually orced and moved to Paris to live with Emmanuel. They married in 2007. “Without her, I would not be me,” Macron said during the campaign.Macron went on to earn a doctorate in philosophy, then reoriented his life towards politics with degrees from Sciences Po and the École Nationale d’Administration (ENA). “He used failure as a launching pad,” says Monjou. “That is typical of a leader.”“Have you brought your helmet and bulletproof vest?” the taxi driver who takes me to the Whirlpool clothes dryer factory in north Amiens asks. It’s a joke, of course, but the “Whirlpools” are notoriously hostile. A year ago, Marine Le Pen promised their factory would not close if she became president. Macron ignored advice and plunged into the crowd of angry strikers, saying, “If you listen to the security guys, you’re dead.”The factory will move to Poland at the end of May. Most of the 290 workers have been promised retraining or jobs building “intelligent” refrigerators by the factory’s new owner. But they’re still angry. On the day I visit, management proposed a clothes dryer in lieu of a severance bonus.“Macron, Macron. He’s not a god. We’re losing jobs. We don’t give a damn about Macron,” François Gorlia, the in-house union leader, tells me on the phone when he refuses to come to the gate to talk to me.“He’s a right-wing guy. Everything for the rich. Nothing for the poor,” Sibylle (39), an assembly line worker says as she arrives for the 1pm shift. She’ll benefit from Macron’s investment in training for the jobless, but she isn’t convinced. “Training is fine and dandy, but there are no jobs.”After lunch in a simple bistro, Macron’s father Jean-Michel guides me through a maze of streets under construction, to the music conservatory where his son studied piano for nine years. When he failed the conservatory exam after his first year, Macron’s mother told his biographer Anne Fulda, the boy insisted on having the same examiner the second year, an early sign of his determination to convince. He played well, Prof Macron recalls, mastering Bach’s devilishly difficult Goldberg Variations.Prof Macron gives me the address of the modest, two-storey brick bungalow where Emmanuel and his two siblings grew up, and where the neurologist still lives with his second wife. “It’s not Neuilly,” Macron père says laughing, referring to the Beverly Hills-like Paris suburb where Nicolas Sarkozy came from. Though they are both doctors, Macron’s parents earned low, public sector salaries. “They weren’t neurosurgeons with private jets,” comments a presidential adviser.The Trogneux chocolate shop, near the cathedral in central Amiens, is where Brigitte Macron’s family have made chocolates and macaroons for five generations. They also own the local Renault dealership.Black-and-white photographs of successive generations of the Trogneux chocolate dynasty hang inside the shop. There is no photograph or mention of Brigitte Trogneux Auzière Macron. Jean-Alexandre Trogneux (57), the first lady’s nephew and godson, agrees to be photographed, but refuses to talk about the presidential couple. “We’ve made it a golden rule,” he says. “We don’t talk about them and they don’t talk about us.”Fabien Dorémus (32) heads the political book section of a shop in central Amiens. Macron’s Révolution sold more than 400 copies there, an “enormous” number, Dorémus says. He had no desire to read it, and dismisses the book – and Macron – as “all slogans and clichés”. A former journalist whose local online newspaper failed for lack of funding, Dorémus is close to the far left party France Unbowed.\u0026nbspSince Macron’s election, Dorémus says, “I’m not optimistic for workers, pensioners and people who need public services. I am very optimistic for the rich.”The bookseller mentions various left-wing grievances against Macron, arising from a handful of disparaging remarks since 2014: Macron referred to slaughterhouse workers who were losing their jobs as “illiterate” Macron told a heckler wearing an anti-Macron T-shirt, “The best way to buy a suit is to get a job” Macron called protesters against his labour reforms “slackers” and accused strikers of wanting to foutre le bordel, or wreak havoc.It’s hardly “let them eat cake”. But the president has been hanged and burned in effigy by protesters. “You have to put yourself in the place of the people who get told they are slackers and freeloaders,” Dorémus says. “He’s contemptuous of the lower classes. People started hating him because they feel disrespected.”Another criticism, made by Macron’s former teachers, is that his speeches are often so long and intellectual that they can be difficult to follow.And attempts to control the president’s image can be counterproductive. The novelist Emmanuel Carrère was given exclusive access to the president and first lady. In two interviews with Macron, there was “one really strong, beautiful sentence”, Carrère wrote in the . “And this really strong, really beautiful sentence was off the record. In its place I was given permission to use a perfectly dull, perfectly formatted variant.”In the course of a day in President Macron’s home town, there is not a single photograph of him to be seen.Brigitte Fouré, the city’s mayor, tells me the poverty rate is two percentage points higher than the national average, and 80 per cent of inhabitants qualify for social housing. Amiens is ided between disadvantaged north and middle-class south. It was ruled by a communist mayor for 18 years in the 1970s and 1980s.Macron spent less than 17 years in Amiens, Fouré notes. He “went up” to Paris nearly a quarter of a century ago. “People here don’t know him. A lot of people are proud that the president is from Amiens, but that’s it. There has never been a real relationship between him and the city. There is no emotional tie.”On a beautiful spring day, the Élysée Palace feels light years away from dreary Picardy. The top-floor office of a close presidential adviser has a view over the gardens and the Eiffel Tower in the distance.Macron’s entourage is comprised mostly of fervently devoted young men with backgrounds similar to his own. No one at the Élysée, other than the president, can be quoted by name. “Our rule is that no one gets inidual credit for anything,” the adviser explains.The adviser reportedly thought up the slogan used by Macron when Trump pulled out of the Paris accord on climate change, “Make our planet great again!” But he refuses to confirm this. “We work collectively. Everything we do belongs to the president.”The adviser counts a resurgence of French pride as Macron’s greatest achievement so far. “It’s been a long time since the French have been proud to be French, in the eyes of the world,” he says. Though it contradicts my experience in Amiens, the statement rings true. Most people in the professional milieus of Paris adore Macron and are proud of his presidency.A few doors from the president’s office, the adviser lists Macron’s “important victories”: the revision of the labour code and the taxation of capital investments the overhaul of the country’s education system changes to the EU’s posted workers directive ending the giant squat at Notre-Dames-des-Landes and dismantling the nuclear reactor at Fessenheim. The last two issues had festered for decades. “They seemed impossible for any preceding majority,” the adviser says.Macron is doing as much for the disadvantaged as for the rich, the adviser insists. “We have increased basic payments to the poor, the disabled and the elderly. We’re decreasing social charges on lower salaries. The pendulum has swung much more towards the least advantaged than the most privileged.”So why isn’t that message getting through? Why do polls indicate that a majority consider Macron the “president of the rich”?For one reason, the adviser says. “He was an investment banker. What’s more, at Rothschild the most symbolic bank in the world. For many people, that proves his competence. The thing that makes him hated by some is the reason why he is respected by others.”Because Macron worked for four years as an investment banker, “everything he does that is perceived as right-wing or for the rich is blown out of proportion”, the adviser says.“And everything he does for the underprivileged, that would be seen as left-wing, is discounted. It’s a problem of perception.”Opinion polls can be read two ways. An Ifop-Fiducial poll published on April 10th gave Macron a 55 per cent approval rating, high for France, 11 months into a presidency. But a BFM poll published four days later showed that 44 per cent of voters are “disappointed”.Nine years of piano and the rigour of France’s best schools have honed Macron’s powers of concentration. On April 17th, he took questions from MEPs in Strasbourg for three hours, without notes, without so much as jotting down a question – a regular performance for Macron.“He is someone with a great capacity of attention and concentration,” says Monjou. “People who’ve met him often tell me they were struck by the intensity with which he looks at them, as if, for the time they are with him, they are all that matters.”“When you talk to him, it is as if he is downloading your brain,” says a former cabinet minister who sometimes advises Macron.Geraldine Byrne-Nason, now Ireland’s Ambassador to the United Nations, is doubtless the Irish official who knows Macron best. She became friends with the future president when both were “sherpas”, responsible for briefing and accompanying Irish and French leaders to EU summits, between 2012 until 2014. Byrne-Nason represented the taoiseach’s office, Macron the Élysée Palace.“We spent hours and hours in corridors through the night while the heads of state and government were locked in meetings,” Byrne-Nason recalls. “Emmanuel would be one of my first points of repair. If you’re going to be there for seven hours, you want someone interesting to talk to.”Byrne-Nason calls Macron “an insider-outsider” who has mastered the system but is able to regard it with detachment. “He has a healthy disrespect for bureaucracy, and Brussels is the home of process and procedure,” she says. “In that regard, we were kindred spirits. There was a slight impatience with the weight of slow-turning wheels.”Macron was particularly understanding of Irish difficulties during the bailout, Byrne-Nason says. She believes he was responsible for support offered by then president François Hollande.Byrne-Nason sent glowing reports about Macron’s potential to Dublin, long before he became a presidential candidate. Last September, she listened to what she calls his “extraordinary speech in favour of international co-operation and law” at the UN General Assembly. “It was poetic. It was powerful. It lit up the place.” Ireland could have signed off on every word, Byrne-Nason says, calling Macron “a superstar president who generates both respect and influence here amongst the 193 countries of the UN”.If Macron were Irish, he might be a hybrid of President Michael D Higgins and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar: part poetic intellectual, rooted in left-wing Christianity and fascinated by ideas part dynamic young liberal, determined to make the economy flourish.When Christian Monjou was Macron’s teacher at Henri IV, he says Macron talked a lot about the Fabians, the centre-left British intellectuals who founded the London School of Economics. The Fabians believed in “the inevitability of gradualness, the idea that everything that is gradual you won’t be able to go back on,” Monjou says. “It is totally anti-French, with our tradition of revolution, not evolution.“French political life is saturated in ideology,” Monjou continues. “With Macron, there is something you might call empirical or pragmatic. It’s familiar to an Anglo-Saxon, but it stands out in France. I suspect this slightly Anglo-Saxon approach may come from listening to me for three years.”Macron’s adviser stresses he is more than a mere pragmatist who would be content to solve one problem after another. “The two legs of Emmanuel Macron are action and reflection,” he says. “He always does both.”Macron’s en même temps mantra seeks to reconcile irreconcilabables, such as liberalism and social protection. The challenge is most obvious in his self-described “humane but realistic” immigration policy. Measures such as the Collomb circular, which authorises police to search emergency shelters for illegal migrants, have alienated some of Macron’s closest allies.In 1997, Macron’s spiritual father Paul Ricoeur delivered a lecture titled Foreigner Myself. Ricoeur cited Leviticus, about “the stranger that dwelleth with you”, and the Gospel of Matthew, which says: “I was a stranger and you took me in.” Opponents of Macron’s tough immigration policy say he has betrayed Ricoeur’s ideals. The criticism must sting, but Macron believes that unless he calms fears of unlimited migration, extreme right-wing populists will continue to gain ground, in France and across Europe.The necessity of ending the “society of status” in which family background, education and profession determine all aspects of one’s life, “gives coherence to everything we are doing”, says the presidential adviser.Philippe Aghion, who teaches economics at Harvard, the London School of Economics and the Collège de France, has greatly influenced the president’s economic thinking.Contrary to Thomas Piketty, the French author of the best-selling Capital in the 21st Century, Aghion and Macron believe that increasing social mobility, not high taxation, is the most effective way of reducing income inequality.Aghion wants to wean France off its post-second World War reliance on the Keynesian welfare state, in which government spending stimulates demand. He is inspired by John Maynard Keynes’s exact contemporary, the Austrian-born economist and Harvard professor Joseph Schumpeter, who believed that innovation and technical progress are the basis of a prosperous economy.Aghion’s theories underlie Macron’s reform of the French labour code last year, and the ongoing reform of professional training. It is, Aghion admitted in an interview, a liberal economic policy. But, he insists, it is also a social policy.Schumpeter believed in creative destruction, “which means you constantly have new jobs replacing old jobs, new firms replacing old firms”, Aghion says. It’s a hard sell to a French public that craves security and is adverse to change.Aghion advocates Danish-style “flexicurity” that combines labour market flexibility with unemployment benefits and retraining for laid-off workers. “In a nutshell: innovation, social protection and social mobility. That’s the triangle you want to achieve,” he says. Listening to him is like hearing Macron speak.Macron’s parents were left-leaning agnostics who did not baptise their children. At the age of 12, probably under the influence of his surroundings at La Pro, Macron asked to make his First Communion. A black-and-white photograph provided by one of his teachers, Gérard Banc, shows the future president making his profession of faith.Macron’s intellectual affiliation has been with the Christian left, with Ricoeur and Esprit magazine, for which he wrote a half-dozen articles, and whose board he sat on. French media interpreted gestures at Macron’s campaign rallies as signs of mysticism, for example when he asked his followers to “show benevolence”, or ended rallies Christ-like, with outstretched arms. On the night of his election, he concluded his speech in front of IM Pei’s glass pyramid at the Louvre with the words, “I will serve you with love”.During his evening with the Presidential Press Association, I asked Macron if, 28 years after his baptism, he still has faith. Personal belief is a taboo subject in secular France. Embarrassed laughter rippled across the room, but he addressed my question.“I believe in something we don’t see, yes,” Macron said. “I have faith in the generic sense of the term. If one doesn’t believe in one’s lucky star, in good fortune, in one’s country, one doesn’t do what I’m doing. I believe in a form of transcendency.”Following Macron’s April 9th speech to French bishops, leftists and Freemasons accused him of attacking la laicité, which has been France’s official policy of state-enforced secularism since 1905.“We share the confused feeling that the link between church and state has been damaged, and that it is as important to you as it is to me to repair it,” Macron said.\u0026nbsp The purpose of laicité was “certainly not to deny spirituality” he argued. \u0026nbsp“For biographical, personal and intellectual reasons, I have the highest opinion of Catholics.”There is something Jesuitical, indeed monklike, about Macron. Unlike his predecessors, he shows no need to eat, sleep or chase women. Asked what has been the “greatest trial” of being in office, the French president said he has “measured the weight and the solitude and the end of innocence” that come with power.“I do not think it is a trial,” Macron continued. “The French have authorised me to do what I committed to do. One thing is certain. There is no respite, which may explain why I sometimes look pale. I do not feel authorised to enjoy any form of leisure. I take time to reflect. I read and write. But in the times we live in, there is no room for respite. That may be the trial of power, though I don’t live it as such. There is undeniably a form of asceticism.”Macron sees his rise to power as the result of a troubled epoch. “I don’t forget where I come from and why I am here today,” he said. “I am the fruit of a form of brutality in history, of a break-in, because France was unhappy and uneasy. If I forget that for one moment, it will be the beginning of the trial.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3474308.1524686689!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"european powers say they are nearing plan to save iran nuclear pact","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIran’s president Hassan Rouhani said he had heard details about the European-US proposals only from media reports. Photograph: Atta KenareAFPGetty ImagesWestern envoys said on Wednesday that Britain, Germany and France were nearing a package to put to US president Donald Trump to try to persuade him to save the Iran nuclear agreement, even as Tehran scorned the US leader as a “tradesman”. Mr Trump has described the 2015 pact, under which Iran agreed to curb its nuclear activities in return for the lifting of sanctions, as the worst deal ever negotiated and has threatened to wreck it by reimposing US sanctions next month. Brian Hook, the chief US negotiator with the three European nations who are seeking a way to keep the United States in the deal, told National Public Radio in Washington: “We’re not there yet, but we’ve made some progress.” Russia, China, Germany, Britain and France, who all struck the accord with Iran and the US, see the deal as the best way to stop Iran from developing a nuclear bomb. Western envoys said three months of meetings were culminating in a package of separate measures that could be taken against Tehran in the hope they would satisfy Mr Trump while keeping the deal intact. “This is about convincing President Trump, it’s not a new deal with Iran,” a senior European Union diplomat said. In Jerusalem, Israel’s intelligence minister, Israel Katz, said a prospective US-European deal on Iran’s nuclear programme might make Mr Trump stay his hand. Mr Katz did not say whether Israel backed a separate arrangement put forward by French president Emmanuel Macron in talks with Mr Trump on Tuesday. Israel has in the past called for the deal, which was signed in Vienna and is officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), to be “fixed or nixed”. In Geneva, a US nonproliferation official, Christopher Ford, told reporters: “We are not aiming to renegotiate the JCPOA or reopen it or change its terms,” but Washington wants a “supplemental agreement” to bring in further rules, terms and restrictions. Britain, France and Germany do not want any renegotiation of the accord. They are trying to draw up separate measures agreed between Europe and the United States to address areas not dealt with by the deal, mainly Tehran’s support for Syrian president Bashar al-Assad and containment of Iran’s ballistic missiles programme. That could include new EU sanctions on Iran, diplomats said. The new measures could include ways to increase the time it would take Iran to develop a nuclear weapon in the future, although that issue is proving the most difficult, diplomats say. Two European diplomats said the plan was broadly in line with stronger measures to contain Iran that Mr Macron discussed with Mr Trump during a visit to the White House on Tuesday. Iranian president Hassan Rouhani earlier told a live television audience that foreign powers had no authority to tinker with the nuclear deal, and questioned Mr Trump’s qualifications to question such a complex international agreement. “They say that with the certain leader of a European country we want to make a decision about a seven-sided agreement,” Mr Rouhani said in a speech broadcast live on state television. “For what? With what right?” he added. He reserved particular scorn for Mr Trump, who informed European powers on January 12th that they must agree to “fix the terrible flaws of the Iran nuclear deal” or he would refuse to extend US sanctions relief on Iran.The US sanctions will resume unless Mr Trump issues fresh “waivers” to suspend them on May 12th. “How can a tradesman, a merchant, a building constructor, a tower constructor make judgments about international affairs,” Rouhani said, referring to Trump’s career as a property developer. Most European governments are behind the diplomatic effort to persuade Mr Trump. “We will continue to discuss the issue with the UK and France, but also with the US,” Germany’s foreign minister Heiko Maas said in Brussels. “The Vienna nuclear agreement is very important and we want to uphold it. We want to help along a situation where the US stays in the agreement beyond May 12th,” he said. Mr Rouhani said he had heard details about the European-US proposals only from media reports but had discussed the issue with Mr Macron. “I have personally spoken with Mr Macron a few times by telephone and one time extensively in person,” Mr Rouhani said. “I told him frankly that not a single sentence will be added or subtracted from the nuclear deal. The deal is the deal.” German chancellor Angela Merkel will hold talks with Mr Trump in Washington on Friday. – Reuters"},{"url":null,"title":"telegraph launches next phase words chosen brand campaign","story":"The  has launched the second phase of the Words Chosen Well brand campaign which aims to showcase its award-winning quality journalism and raise brand awareness.The campaign started with a new television advert debuted during the commercial break of Channel 4’s Gogglebox on Friday 20th April. Created by adam\u0026ampeveDDB  in collaboration with The ’s in-house marketing and creative teams, it builds on the success of last year’s campaign with a bigger and bolder creative that utilises important cultural references and leans on some of the most emotive and impactful events of our times, highlighting iconic moments when words have been considered and chosen well.The ’s new campaign seeks to demonstrate the influence and importance of the spoken and written word, and the role that quality journalism plays in providing news, insight and analysis.

We began focusing on knotweed at a time when there was a great deal of hysteria surrounding it.\u0026quotAt the time, most information for people affected by the plant was largely based on anecdote. This led to the prospect of unscrupulous companies offering expensive and ineffective treatment solutions.\u0026quotIt was incredible to us that there was no long-term, large-scale field trial analysis of the treatment methods used to control Japanese knotweed.\u0026quotProfessor Dan Jones said gardening companies who claim to be able to eradicate the plant were not fully accurate.He said: \u0026quotOff the back of the first three years of data we\u0027ve found that eradication is not possible. Hopefully over the longer term we may move towards that by using new chemicals we\u0027re looking at.\u0026quotBut it\u0027s not a question of eradication, it\u0027s a question of sustained control and management and well informed control and management.\u0026quotClaims made by companies, stating that they could eradicate Japanese knotweed using herbicides in short spaces of time have now been proven to be false, based on our experiments.\u0026quotFurthermore, we have shown that applying the wrong herbicides at the wrong time of the year leads to greater herbicide use and environmental impacts.\u0026quotDr Jones said the best chemical to control the knotweed was glyphosate - but the herbicide is feared to pose a risk to other wildlife too.Japanese knotweed – everything you need to knowDr Jones said: \u0026quotThere\u0027s a range of issues in terms of risk and hazard.

Latest data from WHO shows that in Europe there were 21,000 cases of measles in 2017, compared to 5,000 the previous year.And this was partly due to a decline in the number of people vaccinated as well as a shortage in the supply of vaccines and poor disease surveillance, said WHO.The largest outbreaks of the disease were in Romania, where there were 5,562 cases and Italy, where there were 5,006 cases. In Germany there were 927 cases and the disease and in the UK there were 282. WHO launched the Global Vaccine Action Plan in 2011 with a goal to preventing millions of deaths but some key targets are off track.Vaccines | Global coverage by the end of 2016For example, 40 priority countries should have eliminated maternal and neonatal tetanus by 2015 but only 18 countries have met this goal.

They were ill but they didn’t look on death’s door. It just seemed a high proportion of deaths out of a 32-bedded ward.“I think I was too young and too naïve, I didn’t have the knowledge and experience to maybe turn round and see senior management and say, ‘I am not happy about this.’”Sandra Whitehead worked with Shipman in the early 1970s and was suspicious about his at the timeFollowing his conviction in 2000 for 15 murders, Ms Whitehead provided information to a public inquiry which helped uncovered further victims from his time at Pontefract General Hospital.It is estimated that Shipman may have secretly poisoned more than 250 of his patients across three decades before his eventual arrest in 1998.Harold Shipman is thought to have killed more than 250 patientsA former detective who investigated Shipman in 1975 for drug offences, has described his amazement that he was not struck off the General Medical Register at the time.George McKeating said he had been about to give evidence to the GMC hearing when he was told it had already finished and the panel had decided he was not a danger to the public.He said: \u0026quotI was a bit flabbergasted to say the least.

Worse still, patients and visitors to Alder Hey have also reported abuse.”Alfie has been in Alder Hey with a rare undiagnosed degenerative neurological condition since December 2016.Doctors have said the toddler’s brain has been destroyed by his illness and it is in his best interests to withdraw life support.In a statement the hospital said its \u0026quottop priority remains in ensuring Alfie receives the care he deserves to ensure his comfort, dignity and privacy are maintained throughout.\u0026quotThis includes working closely with Kate and Tom as they spend this precious time together with him.\u0026quotTSB banking problems: what to do if you\u0026#39re affectedReviewed: Boeing\u0026#39s new 737MAX - the \u0026#39game-changing\u0026#39 aircraft joining Ryanair\u0026#39s fleet13 children dead after train hits school bus in IndiaPrince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s royal wedding 2018: date, details and latest newsGP who vanished after NHS money went missing \u0026#39shoots girlfriend dead before turning gun on himself\u0026#39Alfie Evans\u0026#39s father threatened private murder prosecution against doctors treating the toddlerDUP threatens to bring down Theresa May\u0026#39s Government if it crosses Customs Union red lineSmall demonstration in Seoul in support of Inter-Korean summitSouth Korea swept by wave of optimism ahead of historic Moon-Kim summitRoyal baby latest news: New prince meets family as world awaits name announcementRoyal baby boy: When will the name be announced and what was his weight?Kim Yo-jong to attend inter-Korean summit: What we know about the North Korean ‘princess\u0026#39\u0026#39You did it, Michelle\u0026#39: Patton Oswalt credits late wife after breakthrough in Golden State Killer caseBritain in £300m drive to become AI sector \u0026#39hotspot\u0026#39Emmanuel Macron thinks Donald Trump will withdraw from Iran dealThe Handmaid\u0026#39s Tale season 2 review: Moss grows only more virtuosic as the rancid layers of this terrifying new society are revealedNurse who had suspicions about Harold Shipman in 1970s says she was too naive to raise concernsSupermarkets agree to ban unnecessary single-use plastic packaging by 2025Donald Trump\u0026#39s lawyer Michael Cohen says he will take Fifth Amendment in Stormy Daniels caseWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"ipso finds against telegraph publication childs image","story":"Eloise Dixon complained to the Independent Press Standards Organisation that the Daily  breached Clause 6 (Children) of the Editors’ Code of Practice in an article headlined “British tourist shot in favela in Rio ‘too scared’ to speak to police”, published on 9 August 2017.The complainant said that the newspaper had published a photograph of her child without her face blurred and without consent, in breach of Clause 6. She said that her child had been disturbed by the publication of the photograph, which she considered to be private.The newspaper did not accept a breach of the Code. The photograph had been taken ten years ago, so it did not consider that the child, who was not named in the article, would be easily recognisable from the image. It also noted that the image was publicly available on the complainant’s public Facebook page. The newspaper said that in any case, there was also a public interest in publishing the photograph as it helped to bring home to readers the gravity of the situation in which children had been involved.The article clearly reported on a subject which involved the child’s welfare: she had been involved in a shooting and had witnessed her mother being shot and seriously injured. The un-pixilated photograph of the child showed her full face. The image of the child had been taken 10 years ago however, this did not justify the newspaper’s decision to publish it un-pixilated in the context of this article as the child was still under 16 at the time of publication.Publishing the unedited image in the context of this story, without the consent of a parent or a similarly responsible adult, represented a breach of Clause 6. There was no specific public interest in publishing this image, particularly as an exceptional public interest justification was required in the case of a child. The complaint under Clause 6 was upheld.TSB banking problems: what to do if you\u0026#39re affectedReviewed: Boeing\u0026#39s new 737MAX - the \u0026#39game-changing\u0026#39 aircraft joining Ryanair\u0026#39s fleet13 children dead after train hits school bus in IndiaPrince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s royal wedding 2018: date, details and latest newsAlfie Evans: Father says family now want \u0026#39struggling\u0026#39 baby to be allowed homeGP who vanished after NHS money went missing \u0026#39shoots girlfriend dead before turning gun on himself\u0026#39Alfie Evans\u0026#39s father threatened private murder prosecution against doctors treating the toddlerDUP threatens to bring down Theresa May\u0026#39s Government if it crosses Customs Union red lineSmall demonstration in Seoul in support of Inter-Korean summitSouth Korea swept by wave of optimism ahead of historic Moon-Kim summitRoyal baby latest news: New prince meets family as world awaits name announcementRoyal baby boy: When will the name be announced and what was his weight?Kim Yo-jong to attend inter-Korean summit: What we know about the North Korean ‘princess\u0026#39\u0026#39You did it, Michelle\u0026#39: Patton Oswalt credits late wife after breakthrough in Golden State Killer caseBritain in £300m drive to become AI sector \u0026#39hotspot\u0026#39Emmanuel Macron thinks Donald Trump will withdraw from Iran dealThe Handmaid\u0026#39s Tale season 2 review: Moss grows only more virtuosic as the rancid layers of this terrifying new society are revealedNurse who had suspicions about Harold Shipman in 1970s says she was too naive to raise concernsSupermarkets agree to ban unnecessary single-use plastic packaging by 2025We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 26 april 2018","story":"A £5,000 dog kennel, Meghan Markle during Anzac Day commemorations and a Black Hawk helicopter are some of Thursday\u0027s pictures of the dayTSB banking problems: what to do if you\u0026#39re affectedReviewed: Boeing\u0026#39s new 737MAX - the \u0026#39game-changing\u0026#39 aircraft joining Ryanair\u0026#39s fleet13 children dead after train hits school bus in IndiaPrince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s royal wedding 2018: date, details and latest newsAlfie Evans: Father says family now want \u0026#39struggling\u0026#39 baby to be allowed homeGP who vanished after NHS money went missing \u0026#39shoots girlfriend dead before turning gun on himself\u0026#39Alfie Evans\u0026#39s father threatened private murder prosecution against doctors treating the toddlerDUP threatens to bring down Theresa May\u0026#39s Government if it crosses Customs Union red lineSmall demonstration in Seoul in support of Inter-Korean summitSouth Korea swept by wave of optimism ahead of historic Moon-Kim summitRoyal baby latest news: New prince meets family as world awaits name announcementRoyal baby boy: When will the name be announced and what was his weight?Kim Yo-jong to attend inter-Korean summit: What we know about the North Korean ‘princess\u0026#39\u0026#39You did it, Michelle\u0026#39: Patton Oswalt credits late wife after breakthrough in Golden State Killer caseBritain in £300m drive to become AI sector \u0026#39hotspot\u0026#39Emmanuel Macron thinks Donald Trump will withdraw from Iran dealThe Handmaid\u0026#39s Tale season 2 review: Moss grows only more virtuosic as the rancid layers of this terrifying new society are revealedNurse who had suspicions about Harold Shipman in 1970s says she was too naive to raise concernsSupermarkets agree to ban unnecessary single-use plastic packaging by 2025We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"royal baby boy names runners riders prince cambridge kate middleton","story":"As the Royal baby name wait goes on, observers will no doubt look into the history books in search for the couple\u0027s motivation.When the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge pick a name for their newborn son, it is likely to be one that carries the weight of history with it something meaningful something with precedent.So while Ethan, Logan and Jaxon were all popular last year, they are unlikely to be bestowed upon the younger brother of Prince George and Princess Charlotte. So what, then, are the runners and riders for the name of the latest Prince of Cambridge?Arthur has been the bookmakers\u0027 favourite for a boy, followed by Albert.

On Friday\u0027s programme there will be a debate about pet vaccinations in relation to recent figures showing a decline in the number of animals being vaccinated.

Rohan Deb Roy says we must rethink research and practice to escape this dark pastSir Ronald Ross had just returned from an expedition to Sierra Leone. The British doctor had been leading efforts to tackle the malaria that so often killed English colonists in the country, and in December 1899 he gave a lecture to the Liverpool Chamber of Commerce about his experience. In the words of a contemporary report, he argued that “in the coming century, the success of imperialism will depend largely upon success with the microscope”.Teenage vandals sentenced by judge to read history booksRoss, who won the Nobel Prize for Medicine for his malaria research, would later deny he was talking specifically about his own work. But his point neatly summarised how the efforts of British scientists was intertwined with their country’s attempt to conquer a quarter of the world.Ross was very much a child of empire, born in India and later working there as a surgeon in the imperial army. So when he used a microscope to identify how a dreaded tropical disease was transmitted, he would have realised that his discovery promised to safeguard the health of British troops and officials in the tropics. In turn, this would enable Britain to expand and consolidate its colonial rule.Ronald Ross at his lab in 1898 Calcutta (Welcome Collection)Ross’s words also suggest how science was used to argue imperialism was morally justified because it reflected British goodwill towards colonised people. It implied that scientific insights could be redeployed to promote superior health, hygiene and sanitation among colonial subjects. Empire was seen as a benevolent, selfless project. As Ross’s fellow Nobel laureate Rudyard Kipling described it, it was the “white man’s burden” to introduce modernity and civilised governance in the colonies.But science at this time was more than just a practical or ideological tool when it came to empire. Since its birth around the same time as Europeans began conquering other parts of the world, modern Western science was inextricably entangled with colonialism, especially British imperialism. And the legacy of that colonialism still pervades science today.As a result, recent years have seen an increasing number of calls to “decolonise science”, even going so far as to advocate scrapping the practice and findings of modern science altogether. Tackling the lingering influence of colonialism in science is much needed. But there are also dangers that the more extreme attempts to do so could play into the hands of religious fundamentalists and ultra-nationalists. We must find a way to remove the inequalities promoted by modern science while making sure its huge potential benefits work for everyone, instead of letting it become a tool for oppression.When a slave in an early 18th-century Jamaican plantation was found with a supposedly poisonous plant, his European overlords showed him no mercy. Suspected of conspiring to cause disorder on the plantation, he was treated with typical harshness and hanged to death. The historical records don’t even mention his name. His execution might also have been forgotten forever if it weren\u0027t for the scientific enquiry that followed. Europeans on the plantation became curious about the plant and, building on the slave’s “accidental finding”, they eventually concluded it wasn’t poisonous at all.Instead it became known as a cure for worms, warts, ringworm, freckles and cold swellings, with the name Apocynum erectum. As the historian Pratik Chakrabarti argues in a recent book, this incident serves as a neat example of how, under European political and commercial domination, gathering knowledge about nature could take place simultaneously with exploitation.For imperialists and their modern apologists, science and medicine were among the gracious gifts from the European empires to the colonial world. What’s more, the 19th-century imperial ideologues saw the scientific successes of the West as a way to allege that non-Europeans were intellectually inferior and so deserved and needed to be colonised.A racist caricature of European scientists visiting Africa. The severed head on the right is that of Ronald Ross (Welcome Collection)In the incredibly influential 1835 memo Minute on Indian Education, British politician Thomas Macaulay denounced Indian languages partially because they lacked scientific words. He suggested that languages such as Sanskrit and Arabic were “barren of useful knowledge”, “fruitful of monstrous superstitions” and contained “false history, false astronomy, false medicine”.Such opinions weren’t confined to colonial officials and imperial ideologues and were often shared by various representatives of the scientific profession. The prominent Victorian scientist Sir Francis Galton argued that the “the average intellectual standard of the negro race is some two grades below our own (the Anglo Saxon)”. Even Charles Darwin implied that “savage races” such as “the negro or the Australian” were closer to gorillas than were white Caucasians.Yet 19th-century British science was itself built upon a global repertoire of wisdom, information, and living and material specimens collected from various corners of the colonial world. Extracting raw materials from colonial mines and plantations went hand in hand with extracting scientific information and specimens from colonised people.Leading public scientific institutions in imperial Britain, such as the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew and the British Museum, as well as ethnographic displays of “exotic” humans, relied on a global network of colonial collectors and go-betweens. By 1857, the East India Company’s London zoological museum boasted insect specimens from across the colonial world, including from Ceylon, India, Java and Nepal.The scientists who used this evidence were rarely sedentary geniuses working in laboratories insulated from imperial politics and economics. The likes of Charles Darwin on the Beagle and botanist Sir Joseph Banks on the Endeavour literally rode on the voyages of British exploration and conquest that enabled imperialism.Sir Hans Sloane’s imperial collection started the British Museum (Paul HudsonWikipedia)Other scientific careers were directly driven by imperial achievements and needs. Early anthropological work in British India, such as Sir Herbert Hope Risley’s Tribes and Castes of Bengal, published in 1891, drew upon massive administrative classifications of the colonised population.Map-making operations including the work of the Great Trigonometrical Survey in South Asia came from the need to cross colonial landscapes for trade and military campaigns. The geological surveys commissioned around the world by Sir Roderick Murchison were linked with intelligence gathering on minerals and local politics.Efforts to curb epidemic diseases such as plague, smallpox and cholera led to attempts to discipline the routines, diets and movements of colonial subjects. This opened up a political process that the historian David Arnold has termed the “colonisation of the body”. By controlling people as well as countries, the authorities turned medicine into a weapon with which to secure imperial rule.New technologies were also put to use expanding and consolidating the empire. Photographs were used for creating physical and racial stereotypes of different groups of colonised people. Steamboats were crucial in the colonial exploration of Africa in the mid-19th century. Aircraft enabled the British to surveil and then bomb rebellions in 20th-century Iraq. The innovation of wireless radio in the 1890s was shaped by Britain’s need for discreet, long-distance communication during the South African war.In these ways and more, Europe’s leaps in science and technology during this period both drove and were driven by its political and economic domination of the rest of the world. Modern science was effectively built on a system that exploited millions of people. At the same time it helped justify and sustain that exploitation, in ways that hugely influenced how Europeans saw other races and countries. What’s more, colonial legacies continue to shape trends in science today.Imperialist Cecil Rhodes planned a railway and telegraph line to connect Africa (Alamy)Since the formal end of colonialism, we have become better at recognising how scientific expertise has come from many different countries and ethnicities. Yet former imperial nations still appear almost self-evidently superior to most of the once-colonised countries when it comes to scientific study. The empires may have virtually disappeared, but the cultural biases and disadvantages they imposed have not.How to fix all of your sleep problems with scienceYou just have to look at the statistics on the way research is carried out globally to see how the scientific hierarchy created by colonialism continues. The annual rankings of universities are published mostly by the Western world and tend to favour its own institutions. Academic journals across the different branches of science are mostly dominated by the US and Western Europe.It is unlikely that anyone who wishes to be taken seriously today would explain this data in terms of innate intellectual superiority determined by race. The blatant scientific racism of the 19th century has now given way to the notion that excellence in science and technology are a euphemism for significant funding, infrastructure and economic development.Because of this, most of Asia, Africa and the Caribbean is seen either as playing catch-up with the developed world or as dependent on its scientific expertise and financial aid. Some academics have identified these trends as evidence of the persisting “intellectual domination of the West” and labelled them a form of “neo-colonialism”.Not all international collaborations are equal (US Army AfricaFlickr)Various well-meaning efforts to bridge this gap have struggled to go beyond the legacies of colonialism. For example, scientific collaboration between countries can be a fruitful way of sharing skills and knowledge, and learning from the intellectual insights of one another. But when an economically weaker part of the world collaborates almost exclusively with very strong scientific partners, it can take the form of dependence, if not subordination.A 2009 study showed that about 80 per cent of Central Africa’s research papers were produced with collaborators based outside the region. With the exception of Rwanda, each of the African countries principally collaborated with its former coloniser. As a result, these dominant collaborators shaped scientific work in the region. They prioritised research on immediate local health-related issues, particularly infectious and tropical diseases, rather than encouraging local scientists to also pursue the fuller range of topics pursued in the West.In the same study, 60 per cent to 70 per cent of the scientists based in developed countries did not acknowledge their collaborators in poorer countries as co-authors in their papers. This is despite the fact they later claimed in the survey that the papers were the result of close collaborations.International health charities, which are dominated by Western countries, have faced similar issues. After the formal end of colonial rule, global health workers long appeared to represent a superior scientific culture in an alien environment. Unsurprisingly, interactions between these skilled and dedicated foreign personnel and the local population have often been characterised by mistrust.For example, during the smallpox eradication campaigns of the 1970s and the polio campaign of past two decades, the World Health Organization’s representatives found it quite challenging to mobilise willing participants and volunteers in the interiors of South Asia. On occasions they even saw resistance on religious grounds from local people. But their stringent responses, which included the close surveillance of villages, cash incentives for identifying concealed cases and house-to-house searches, added to this climate of mutual suspicion. These experiences of mistrust are reminiscent of those created by strict colonial policies of plague control.Polio eradication needs willing volunteers (Department for International DevelopmentFlickr)Western pharmaceutical firms also play a role by carrying out questionable clinical trials in the developing world where, as journalist Sonia Shah puts it, “ethical oversight is minimal and desperate patients abound”. This raises moral questions about whether multinational corporations misuse the economic weaknesses of once-colonised countries in the interests of scientific and medical research.The colonial image of science as a domain of the white man even continues to shape contemporary scientific practice in developed countries. People from ethnic minorities are underrepresented in science and engineering jobs and more likely to face discrimination and other barriers to career progress.To finally leave behind the baggage of colonialism, scientific collaborations need to become more symmetrical and founded on greater degrees of mutual respect. We need to decolonise science by recognising the true achievements and potential of scientists from outside the Western world. Yet while this structural change is necessary, the path to decolonisation has dangers of its own.In October 2016, a YouTube video of students discussing the decolonisation of science went surprisingly viral. The clip, which has been watched more than 1m times, shows a student from the University of Cape Town arguing that science as a whole should be scrapped and started again in a way that accommodates non-Western perspectives and experiences. The student’s point that science cannot explain so-called black magic earned the argument much derision and mockery. But you only have to look at the racist and ignorant comments left beneath the video to see why the topic is so in need of discussion.Inspired by the recent “Rhodes Must Fall” campaign against the university legacy of the imperialist Cecil Rhodes, the Cape Town students became associated with the phrase “science must fall”. While it may be interestingly provocative, this slogan isn’t helpful at a time when government policies in a range of countries including the US, UK and India are already threatening to impose major limits on science research funding.More alarmingly, the phrase also runs the risk of being used by religious fundamentalists and cynical politicians in their arguments against established scientific theories such as climate change. This is a time when the integrity of experts is under fire and science is the target of political manoeuvring. So polemically rejecting the subject altogether only plays into the hands of those who have no interest in decolonisation.Alongside its imperial history, science has also inspired many people in the former colonial world to demonstrate remarkable courage, critical thinking and dissent in the face of established beliefs and conservative traditions. These include the Indian anti-caste activist Rohith Vemula and the murdered atheist authors Narendra Dabholkar and Avijit Roy. Demanding that “science must fall” fails to do justice to this legacy.The call to decolonise science, as in the case of other disciplines such as literature, can encourage us to rethink the dominant image that scientific knowledge is the work of white men. But this much-needed critique of the scientific canon carries the other danger of inspiring alternative national narratives in post-colonial countries.A campaigner during a March for Science protest in Melbourne (Wikipedia Commons )For example, some Indian nationalists, including the country’s current prime minister, Narendra Modi, have emphasised the scientific glories of an ancient Hindu civilisation. They argue that plastic surgery, genetic science, aeroplanes and stem cell technology were in vogue in India thousands of years ago. These claims are not just a problem because they are factually inaccurate. Misusing science to stoke a sense of nationalist pride can easily feed into jingoism.Meanwhile, various forms of modern science and their potential benefits have been rejected as unpatriotic. In 2016, a senior Indian government official even went so far as to claim that “doctors prescribing non-Ayurvedic medicines are anti-national”.Attempts to decolonise science need to contest jingoistic claims of cultural superiority, whether they come from European imperial ideologues or the current representatives of post-colonial governments. This is where new trends in the history of science can be helpful.For example, instead of the parochial understanding of science as the work of lone geniuses, we could insist on a more cosmopolitan model. This would recognise how different networks of people have often worked together in scientific projects and the cultural exchanges that helped them – even if those exchanges were unequal and exploitative.But if scientists and historians are serious about “decolonising science” in this way, they need to do much more to present the culturally erse and global origins of science to a wider, non-specialist audience. For example, we need to make sure this decolonised story of the development of science makes its way into schools.Students should also be taught how empires affected the development of science and how scientific knowledge was reinforced, used and sometimes resisted by colonised people. We should encourage budding scientists to question whether science has done enough to dispel modern prejudices based on concepts of race, gender, class and nationality.Schools need to teach the non-Western history of science (Wikipedia Commons)Decolonising science will also involve encouraging Western institutions that hold imperial scientific collections to reflect more on the violent political contexts of war and colonisation in which these items were acquired. An obvious step forward would be to discuss repatriating scientific specimens to former colonies, as botanists working on plants originally from Angola but held primarily in Europe have done. If repatriation isn’t possible, then co-ownership or priority access for academics from post-colonial countries should at least be considered.This is also an opportunity for the broader scientific community to critically reflect on its own profession. Doing so will inspire scientists to think more about the political contexts that have kept their work going and about how changing them could benefit the scientific profession around the world. It should spark conversations between the sciences and other disciplines about their shared colonial past and how to address the issues it creates.Rohan Deb Roy is a lecturer in South Asian history at the University of Reading. theconversationor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The UK is also a top destination for wealthy Russians to spend their money on art collections, expensive cars and private schools for their children. In return, the UK often grants them visas and, in some cases, citizenship“We are going after the money,” Boris Johnson promised after being questioned on the absence of specific measures to impose sanctions and financial penalties on the UK assets of Russian oligarchs closely aligned to President Putin. But when pressed by MPs on why decisive action was not being taken, the foreign secretary replied: “This is not a country where we in the government can say ‘Oi! We think this so-and-so deserves to have his or her collar felt’. This is not how it works.” While Theresa May may yet impose sanctions against Putin-supporting billionaires in response to the attempted murder of the Russian spy Sergei Skripal, her government’s track record has been marred by procrastination and prevarication.   Privately, the prime minister regards the exploitation of London as a haven for dirty Russian money as a serious problem. She once listened in stunned silence as a senior MI6 officer briefed her on the activities of Russian organised crime and certain oligarchs in the UK. And in 2016 she authorised the National Security Council to review why and how wealthy Russians buy property in London. But she has been nervous about taking action. For the past three years she has dithered on implementing a legally-enforceable register that will force all foreign companies that own UK property to disclose the identity of their owners.Russia claims Skripals poisoned using toxin possessed by UK and USRussia has been spying on the Skripals for at least five years- UKRussia stock market crashes after US imposes sanctions on oligarchsFreezing property assets is the key to inflicting pain on the Russian state and its compliant plutocrats. Since 2004, £190m of UK property has been subject to criminal investigation as suspected proceeds of corruption. The London property market has been skewed by laundered money, as The Independent revealed exclusively in 2014. Prices are being artificially driven up by wealthy, influential, foreign men who want to hide their assets in the UK.Multi-million pound payments are accepted without their origin being questioned. Oligarchs hide ownership behind anonymous shell companies registered in secretive jurisdictions while a London address offers a veneer of legitimacy and prestige that helps launder reputations as well as cash. Transparency International estimates that Russians account for £729m of the £4.4bn acquired in UK property via what it regards as “suspicious wealth”.There is no suggestion that all London property bought by Russian oligarchs is derived from illegal or criminal sources. For some Russian plutocrats buying luxury property in London is a symbol that they have been accepted by the British establishment. This is illustrated by the eleven bedroom Regency house on Belgrave Square that Oleg Deripaska, regarded as one of Putin’s favourite oligarchs, snapped up for £17m through an offshore company registered in the British Virgin Islands in 2003 and now worth £45m.Oleg Deripaska’s 11-bedroom Regency house on Belgrave Square is seen as a symbol of acceptance by the British establishment (Alamy)Built in the 1820s, it was formerly the home of Sir Henry “Chips” Channon, society host, Conservative MP and notoriously indiscreet diarist. It was designed for entertaining royalty and diplomats with its grand staircase, Madame Récamier sofas and flamboyant decor. When Harold Nicolson arrived at the house for dinner, he exclaimed: “Oh my God, how rich and powerful Lord Channon has become.” The equally grand and historic mansion Beechwood House, set in 11 acres of land in Highgate, north London, was bought by the powerful oligarch Alisher Usmanov in 2008 for £48m from the Emir of Qatar. Usmanov is a major shareholder in Arsenal football club and has amassed a £14bn fortune from metals and commodities and has long been regarded as a pro-Putin figure. And his fellow football-loving oligarch Roman Abramovich owns houses on Kensington Palace Gardens and Chester Square, Belgravia, and apartments on Eaton Square and Manresa Road, Chelsea.  One Hyde Park, one of the wealthiest residencies in the world, was famously bought up by Russian oligarchs (Alamy)It is not just prestigious houses that attract Russian billionaires. The UK is also a top destination for wealthy Russians to spend their money on art collections, expensive cars and private schools for their children. In return for their cash, the UK often grants them visas and, in some cases, citizenship.  Since 2008 iniduals have been able to obtain “golden visas” if they invest as little as £2m in a UK business. And for £5m, they gain the right to become a UK resident on a temporary basis and then, after five years, a British citizen. By 2014, almost 700 rich Russians had paid for entry using this method, with Roman Rotenberg, son of Putin’s former judo partner Boris Rotenberg, being the most prominent example. He owns a mews house on Cadogan Lane in Belgravia.The government is taking some action to stop London becoming what David Cameron described as a haven to hide “dodgy foreign cash”. The National Crime Agency (NCA) is investigating a list of wealthy iniduals, not just oligarchs, to assess if they have used the UK to launder their fortunes.An estimated 149 iniduals are restricted on their travel and ability to conduct business in the UK. And the Unexplained Wealth Orders is now law, whereby the NCA can demand that the oligarch explain the origin of his wealth. But the problem with this order, according to a Russian businessman, is that the inidual in question could too easily lie about his source of wealth and instead produce a document that shows his fortune was based on, for example, share idends. Roman Rotenberg gained entry to the UK using the ‘golden visas’ method (Getty)Boris Johnson protests that the government cannot act directly against the pro-Putin brigade because it cannot interfere in criminal investigations. But it could make specific changes to the law, notably an amendment to the Sanctions and Money Laundering Bill, which would give Magnitsky-type powers to freeze the UK assets of relevant iniduals, including intelligence agents or other officials who have abused human rights.  The government could also implement the register of inidual owners of foreign and offshore companies that own UK property. But that bill has been delayed until 2021 and campaigners smell a cover-up after the government announced that one reason for the delay is that the Business Department has commissioned research on the impact of the register on investment decisions. “This is a crucial moment for the UK’s future trading relationship with the rest of the world, and we must proceed with as good an understanding as possible of the potential impacts on legitimate inward investment,” said foreign office minister Lord Ahmad. Skripal attack aftermath – in picturesSkripal attack aftermath – in picturesInvestigators in protective clothing remove a van from an address in Winterslow near Salisbury in Wiltshire, as police and members of the armed forces continue to investigate the suspected nerve agent attack on Russian double agent Sergei SkripaA police officer on duty near the protective tent which covers the bench where a man and woman were apparently poisoned with what was later identified as a nerve agent, in SalisburyMilitary in protective clothing prior to removing vehicles from a car park in SalisburyPersonnel in protective coveralls and breathing equipment cover an ambulance with a tarpaulin at the Salisbury District HospitalHome Secretary Amber Rudd visits the scene of the nerve agent attack in SalibsuryMembers of the emergency services in hazard suits fix the tent over the bench where Sergei and Yulia Skripal were foundOfficials in protective suits check their equipment before repositioning a forensics tent A poice officer stands guard outside a branch of the Italian chain restaurant ZizziDetective Sergeant Nick Bailey, who assisted the Russian ex-spy targeted with a nerve agent, was also hospitalisedSergei Skripal days before he was exposed to a mystery substance that has left him fighting for lifeSergei Skripal speaks to his lawyer from behind bars seen on a screen of a monitor outside a courtroom in Moscow.Yulia Skripal, who is thought to have been poisoned along with her father, Sergei SkripalProgress to legislation has thus been painfully slow. An insight into why political rhetoric has not resulted in legislative action can be gleaned by the recent flotation on the London stock exchange of the Russian energy company En+, then owned by Deripaska and chaired by former Conservative energy minister Lord Barker. For it revealed a fundamental dispute between MI6 and the financial regulators on how to make oligarchs who park their assets in London more accountable and transparent.MI6 and the prime minister’s national security advisor, Sir Mark Sedwill, were furious with the Stock Exchange and Financial Conduct Authority for failing to consult them and conduct the required due diligence of En+. Their main concern was about whether Rusal, a subsidiary of En+, had been manufacturing aluminium powder used by Russian arms firms for military purposes. Rusal adamantly denied it – yet its own website previously indicated that the defence industry was among the users of the type of aluminium powder it manufactured.Sir Mark Sedwill was furious when the required due diligence of En+ was not carried out ahead of its flotation on the London stock exchange (Getty)The En+ group could be a candidate for new sanctions as the Russian state-owned VTB Bank is a major shareholder with a 4.35 per cent holding, while Deripaska is known for being close to the Russian President. Leaked US diplomatic cables described Deripaska as “among the two to three oligarchs Putin turns to on a regular basis” and is “a more-or-less permanent fixture on Putin’s trips abroad”.Indeed, when the US imposed sanctions on seven oligarchs and the 12 companies they own or control last week, shares tumbled. Deripaska was among those affected, as was Rotenberg.  Still, Britiain cannot follow suit. And the anger of National Security officials and MI6 En+\u0027s flotation last year stemmed precisely from their belief that it typified the complacent approach to Russian money in London, which the infamous oligarch Boris Berezovsky once told me was “70 per cent dirty”. The inability to impose sanctions is similarly emblematic.The London Stock Exchange has long been a vehicle for Russian companies and oligarchs to raise money in shares and bonds – an estimated $200bn (£140bn) since 2004. Last summer, Russia’s largest gold producer Polyus, controlled by Suleyman Kerimov, a Russian senator awarded the Order of Merit by Putin, raised $879m. There are now 57 predominantly-Russian companies listed on the London Stock Exchange, more than anywhere else outside Moscow.   The wealthiest Russian oligarchs who call London homeA little-noticed loophole to avoid sanctions is that Russian sovereign debt is permitted to be sold in London. “We are allowing Russian sovereign debt to be sold in the UK and that debt is being used to reimburse Russians to bring back their money onshore in Moscow terms,” said the Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee. “As that gold is moving towards Moscow, we are quite extraordinarily enabling those bond and debt auctions...This is one of those areas where sanctions on businesses are being compensated by the Russian state.”Just hours after Theresa May’s retaliation against the poisoning of Sergei Skripal, Gazprom issued a $750m eurobond in London and the following day the Russian government joined in by issuing a $4bn bond in the capital. Within hours, the Russian Embassy issued a revealing tweet: “Business as usual?”Could the nerve-agent attack in Salisbury be the unwitting catalyst for finally cleaning up dirty Russian money in London? (Getty)But the irony is that it is the attempted assassination of a Russian spy and double agent living in Salisbury and the murder of Russian businessman Nikolai Glushkov in Surrey that could be the unwitting catalysts for finally cleaning up dirty Russian money in London.Mark Hollingsworth is the author of “Londongrad – From Russia with Cash’’ or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Colin Drury delves into the inside story of the battle to save 17,500 trees being felled in a single cityJenny Hockey still shivers when she remembers the moment, almost 18 months ago, she was woken by police hammering at her door. It was 5am. When she looked outside, she momentarily wondered if a terror incident was unfolding.“It was that kind of scene,” the 71-year-old says. “Multiple cars, officers swarming everywhere, flashing lights. We had no idea what was happening.”It was 17 November 2016 and, under the cover of darkness, officers from South Yorkshire Police had descended on Sheffield’s Rustlings Road, one of the city’s most sought-after addresses. Cordoning off the street and banging on doors, they ordered residents to get dressed and move their vehicles or have them towed away. Within the hour, Hockey, a retired sociology professor, would become one of three neighbours arrested and locked up for eight hours.227-year-old tree planted by George Washington pulled down by windBut this dramatic pre-dawn raid – described by Nick Clegg, then the local MP, as like something “you’d expect in Putin’s Russia” – was not carried out in search of terrorists or criminals.Rather, it was in support of council contractors hired to chop down eight street trees, which residents had spent more than a year petitioning to save.Amid the confusion, Hockey and two others – including another woman in her seventies – attempted to stand under one of these century-old limes, only to be detained. All charges were later dropped.“We wanted to protect something we loved,” she says. “And our right to do that – our democratic right – was taken away, really, by state force. It was so horrible and disempowering.”Indeed, by the time the trio were freed, the trees which had always overlooked their homes were no more.Contractors cut down the final tree in Rustlings Road (PA)Yet a bigger battle was just beginning: one which has since spread across the city, seen mass protests and riot police on suburban streets, and ultimately revealed an astonishing secret plan – hidden within a £2.2bn PFI contract – to cut down almost 20,000 street trees…Sheffield has long boasted of being Europe’s greenest city – in part because a third of it sits in the Peak District. But it is also due to the sheer number of trees that line the roads. Some 36,000 of them arch over highways and footpaths.But around 2015, talk of what the Woodland Trust called a “tree massacre” started to emerge.Sheffield’s Labour council had agreed for 17,500 street trees to be axed as part of a highways improvement scheme  (PA)The eight limes in Rustlings Road were not the only ones marked for the chainsaw. Under then-redacted clauses in a £2.2bn contract, Sheffield’s Labour council had agreed for 17,500 street trees to be axed as part of a vast highways improvement scheme being undertaken by the infrastructure giant Amey.Company and council both said – and still say – such felling was necessary. Targeted trees, they argued, were either dying, dangerous or had roots causing irreparable damage to roads and footpaths. Every one taken down, they added, was being substituted with a younger sapling: “We assess every single tree and only replace them as a last resort,” says Darren Butt, account director with Amey, today.Targeted trees, the council argued, were either dying, dangerous or had roots causing damage to roads and footpaths (Sheffield Tree Action Group)Yet, as this felling increased, questions started to be asked. There was shock when two cherries commemorating Second World War heroes disappeared one day. At Christmas, a row decorated with charity festive lights were hacked back – with fellers cutting through wires and all.A feeling spread that perfectly healthy and safe trees were being chopped unnecessarily. A suspicion grew that the policy was actually about increasing Amey’s profit margins. Over the length of the company’s 25-year highway maintenance obligations, so ran the theory, a newly planted sapling is far cheaper to look after than older, larger arboreta.“People were going to work in the morning and coming home to entirely different-looking streets,” says Paul Selby, a city resident and leading member of Sheffield Tree Action Groups, known as Stag. “It was ecological destruction carried out, in secret, by a multinational company with the explicit support of the local authority and the police.“And people were angry. These trees were part of their lives and they didn’t want them taking. These weren’t anarchists or hardline activists from other towns. They’re Sheffielders furious they hadn’t been given a voice in what was happening in their streets. So they came out and fought to be heard.”Almost 6,000 trees have been chopped down. But in the face of overwhelming and increasingly nationalised pressure, a pause on felling was announced last week.Sheffield City Council has put this down to the “dangerous tactics” of protestors. Yet the support in favour of Stag – both within the city and from names including Jeremy Corbyn, Michael Gove, Ken Loach and Jarvis Cocker – probably had something to do with it too.Hopes are now high the whole policy can be reconsidered. “We don’t take anything for granted,” says Selby, a civil servant with the Department for Work and Pensions. “But, after so long fighting, surely dialogue is now the sensible way forward.”Tensions rose, with fellers and protestors accusing each other of intimidation (Sheffield Tree Action Group)Certainly, it has been a troubled road to here: the irony perhaps being that this all started with a real city victory.In 2012 the government handed Sheffield £1.2bn to improve its roads, an economic godsend for a place locals had taken to calling Pothole City. Amey – a subsidiary of the Spanish company Ferrovial – won the work contract, promising to upgrade and maintain every highway, pavement, bridge, subway and street light for 25 years.“This is work that is good for everyone living here,” says Paul Billington, director of culture and environment with the city council. “It is already bringing investment and opportunities back into the city because it is making our infrastructure world-class.”Replacing damaging or dying trees, he argues, is key to that success continuing. Doing it now, he adds, is important because, as a 2007 survey showed, a large majority of trees are so old that to delay action would store problems for future generations.“No one disagrees that dying or damaging trees should be looked at – if they really do fall into those categories,” says Alison Teal, a Green Party councillor in the city. “But this went beyond that. We still didn’t know how many were due to come down but everywhere you looked, these magnificent trees were disappearing.”Demonstrations were civil enough to start with. People at home would spot Amey vans and go out to stand under targeted trees so they couldn’t be axed. Others started taking the bus to work, leaving their cars blocking access to endangered arboreta.Cups of tea were offered while people stood about. They debated the merits of the trees: their beauty, the environmental benefits, the wildlife. Occasionally, they talked about their favourite. An endangered elm in the Nether Edge area ended up being shortlisted for the 2016 England Tree Of The Year Award.Yet things hardened after the Rustlings Road raid (“In hindsight, it was poorly handled,” says Darren Butt). While many still supported the replacement scheme, opinion started to harden in favour of the so-called tree-huggers.

Stumps of trees already cut were painted blood red as a mark of anger. Stag supporters – now numbering in their thousands – took to organising daily spotter patrols and flying pickets.“When someone saw an Amey van near an endangered tree, they put a message in a WhatsApp group or online, and whoever was available would go and protect that tree,” says Teal.In this way dozens of limes, cherries, oaks and birches across several neighbourhoods were saved.But as tensions rose – with both fellers and protestors accusing each other of intimidation – police started to appear.Jenny Hockey (left), Freda Brayshaw and a third neighbour were arrested and locked up for eight hours (PA)At one demonstration in leafy Chippinghouse Road in January 2017, nine people were arrested, some while stood in their own gardens. None were ever charged. At another picket last month, a specialist police protest removal unit turned up. It was the first time it had ever been deployed on South Yorkshire’s streets.Arrest numbers grew – yet there were vaguely comedic elements to many. A 57-year-old woman was detained after blowing a pink trumpet, while a retired couple – Dr John and Sue Unwin – found themselves being questioned by CID officers (and later cleared) about the suspected poisoning of a cup of tea they gave a feller.“It sounds like the plot from an Agatha Christie novel,” Dr Unwin told the Daily Mail.One 73-year-old was detained for intimidation. Alan Simpson, a retired firefighter and great-grandfather, says: “I’ve never been in trouble in my life and was there with my wife. I don’t think I could have cut a less intimidating figure if I tried.” His charge, too, has been dropped.“If it wasn’t so serious,” says James Whitworth, cartoonist on local newspaper The Star, “it would be farcical, and I mean that literally: there is enough material here to make an actual farce.“As a cartoonist, it’s a dream because the whole thing is so ridiculous. You think you can’t possibly say anymore on the issue – and then they arrest a woman for blowing a plastic trumpet. But as a city resident: I’m pretty neutral but, really, maybe leave our trees alone?”Local newspaper cartoonist James Whitworth’s take on the Sheffield tree massacre (James Whitworth)As news of the ongoing demonstrations spread, meanwhile, concern grew it was damaging the city’s reputation. When Sheffield was left off The Sunday Times Best Places to Live list this year, authorities blamed the campaigners: “it is regrettable the increasingly extreme actions of a small number of protestors is having this impact,” a council spokesperson declared.Demonstrators themselves were not above ridiculous assertions either: at a packed council meeting, one compared Amey’s workers to Nazi guards, just doing their jobs.Lavender and tea tree oils could be giving boys breasts, study warnsChina reassigns 60,000 troops to plant trees in bid to fight pollutionHow the Japanese fought suicide in the ‘Sea of Trees’For now, however, the potential turning point arguably came in March when a freedom of information request, asked by Paul Selby, forced the council to reveal it had indeed asked for 17,500 trees to be chopped down. The figure was so astonishing all three city MPs – all Labour – called for a rethink.In a disastrous interview on local radio, council cabinet member for environment Bryan Lodge – who declined to be interviewed for this piece – denied the figure was a target but could not explain what it actually was. Days later the suspension of felling was announced.What happens next is the question the city is asking itself.“We’ve already lost 6,000 trees,” says Selby. “Of course, there are some that should come down if they really are dying or doing irreversible damage to footpaths. But all other solutions should be sought first. Trees are a sign of a civilised city. We should be doing everything we can to save them.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

If you ask me, \u0027are there numbers of people we expect to be removed?\u0027, that\u0027s not how we operate.I do think it is right... where there are people here illegally that we do try to remove them.The Home Secretary faced fresh pressure after the emergence of a 2015 report by the Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigration that appeared to confirm Ms Moreton’s claims.Windrush generation: threat of deportation from UKWindrush generation: threat of deportation from UKThe ex-troopship \u0027Empire Windrush\u0027 arriving at Tilbury Docks from Jamaica, with 482 Jamaicans on board, emigrating to Britain.Jamaican immigrants being welcomed by RAF officials from the Colonial Office after the ex-troopship \u0027Empire Windrush\u0027 landed them at Tilbury.

But the decision set off a nightmare that saw him lose his job, detained twice and almost deported to Jamaica. Jamaica-born Anthony Bryan poses outside his home in Edmonton, north London. Now 60 and a grandfather, Bryan thought the issue could be resolved swiftly, as he legally moved to Britain with his family as part of the Windrush generation of Caribbean migrants after World War II. In 1948, the ship Windrush brought the first group of migrants from the West Indies to help rebuild post-war Britain, and many others followed from around the Commonwealth. A 1971 law gave them indefinite leave to remain, but many never formalised their status, often because they were children who came over on their parents\u0027 passports and then never applied for their own.

A spokesperson for the European Commission’s Brexit negotiating team said the scheme’s application to the UK would be part of discussions on the future relationship, where chief negotiator Michel Barnier has so far been unwilling to cut special deals for Britain.“Today’s agreement is another important step in protecting the EU’s external borders,” said Valentin Radev, the interior minister for Bulgaria, which is currently chairing the European Council. “By knowing who is coming to the EU before they even arrive at the border, we will be better able to stop those who may pose a threat to our citizens.”On Wednesday, ambassadors from the EU countries confirmed an agreement reached on the ETIAS scheme between the presidency of the European Council and the representatives of the European Parliament, who must agree any new EU laws. The European Parliament will now have to vote on the plan, which will also have to be signed off by the European Council.One year to Brexit: What is still needed to complete a deal with the EU?The EU says the new scheme will “improve internal security, prevent illegal immigration, protect public health and reduce delays at the borders by identifying persons who may pose a risk in one of these areas before they arrive at the external borders”. Because it applies to the whole Schengen passportless area and not just the EU, travellers to countries outside the EU such as Norway, Iceland, and Switzerland would also be hit.Data submitted in the online application would be processed against EU police and Interpol databases, with further checks made against anyone who raises flags. Countries that already need visas to travel to Europe will not be covered by the scheme, given that tighter restrictions are already in place on them. Airlines and ferry lines will also have a new responsibility to check whether travellers who need documents have them, with coach operators scheduled to pick up the same rules three years after the scheme’s introduction.Brexit so far: in picturesBrexit so far: in picturesBoris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

They were later praised by Theresa May.Antisemitism demonstration in Parliament SquareAntisemitism demonstration in Parliament SquareHundreds of people gathered in Parliament Square to protest against antisemitism in the Labour Party.Protesters clashed during the demonstrationProtesters hold placards and flags during a demonstration, organised by the British Board of Jewish Deputies for those who oppose anti-Semitism, in Parliament SquareLabour MP Luciana Berger speaks during the protest.A protester blows through a shofar during the demonstration.Members of London\u0027s Jewish community protest in support of Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn outside parliament.People protest against anti-Semitism in the Labour party as Jewish community leaders have launched a scathing attack on Jeremy Corbyn, claiming he has sided with anti-Semites again and again.

He said in an initial statement that the meeting was about Russia halting adoptions of its children by US citizens. Then, he said it was regarding the Magnitsky Act, a US law blacklisting Russian human rights abusers. In a final statement, Mr Trump Jr released a chain of emails that revealed he took the meeting in hopes of getting information Ms Veselnitskaya had about Hillary Clinton\u0027s alleged financial ties to Russia. He and the President called it standard opposition research in the course of campaigning and that no information came from the meeting. The meeting was set up by an intermediary, Rob Goldstone. Jared Kushner and Paul Manafort were also at the same meeting. Mr Kushner is President Donald Trump\u0027s son-in-law and a key adviser to the White House. He met with a Russian banker appointed by Russian President Vladimir Putin in December. Mr Kushner has said he did so in his role as an adviser to Mr Trump while the bank says he did so as a private developer.\u0026#13Former tabloid journalist and now music publicist Rob Goldstone is a contact of the Trump family through the previously Trump-owned 2013 Miss Universe pageant, which took place in Moscow. In June 2016, he wrote to Donald Trump Jr offering a meeting with a Russian lawyer, Natalya Veselnitskaya, who had information about Hillary Clinton. Mr Goldstone was the intermediary for Russian pop star Emin Agalaraov and his father, real estate magnate Aras, who played a role in putting on the 2013 pageant. In an email chain released by Mr Trump Jr, Mr Goldstone seemed to indicate Russian government\u0027s support of Donald Trump\u0027s campaign. Aras Agalarov (R) is a wealthy Moscow-based real estate magnate and son Emin (L) is a pop star. Both played a role in putting on the previously Trump-owned 2013 Miss Universe pageant in Moscow. They allegedly had information about Hillary Clinton and offered that information to the Trump campaign through a lawyer with whom they had worked with, Natalia Veselnitskaya, and music publicist Rob Goldstone. Natalia Veselnitskaya is a Russian lawyer with ties to the Kremlin. She has worked on real estate issues and reportedly counted the FSB as a client in the past. She has ties to a Trump family connection, real estate magnate Aras Agalarov, who had helped set up the Trump-owned 2013 Miss Universe pageant which took place in Moscow. Ms Veselnitskaya met with Donald Trump Jr, Jared Kushner, and Paul Manafort in Trump Tower on 9 June 2016 but denies the allegation that she went there promising information on Hillary Clinton\u0027s alleged financial ties to Russia. She contends that the meeting was about the US adoptions of Russian children being stopped by Moscow as a reaction to the Magnitsky Act, a US law blacklisting Russian human rights abusers. Mr Flynn was named as Trump\u0027s national security adviser but was forced to resign from his post for inappropriate communication with Russian Ambassador to the US Sergey Kislyak.
