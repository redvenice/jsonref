(Picture: Liberty Antonia Sadler for )Next time you’re on a late-night, long haul flight, keep your eyes and ears open.Especially if it’s a Boeing 747.And it doesn’t have to be with someone you know, either. Nearly a third of those who had already enjoyed sex on a plane hooked up with a complete stranger.By coincidence, I myself am getting on a plane today — with no plans for a toilet quickie, I might add — and ahead of my trip, asked members of the mile high club to tell me about their experiences.Prepare yourself — this is raunchy stuff.One of the stewardesses and I had been eyeing each other since the moment I stepped onto the plane.While the majority of the passengers were asleep, she snuck me into the kitchen area and we had sex while her co-worker kept watch.I overheard a woman a few seats behind me, as she was talking to someone on the phone. She mentioned the mile high club and how she’d be so nervous to do it.I turned and smiled at her, and she blushed.A few minutes went by and I decided to go to the bathroom. On the way, I gave her a nod.I waited inside for a few minutes, but figured she wasn’t coming. But, when I opened the door, she was standing there looking down at the floor.I pulled her towards me and slid the door shut.I caught her playing with herself, while everyone was asleep.So, we got down and it was really hot, and fun.My girlfriend and I had sex in the toilets.Just as we were ready to get out, after about five minutes of anal sex, a flight attendant knocked and told us to return to our seats.She didn’t say anything else at the time, but at the gate, she pulled me aside and said never to do it again.We were caught by the stewardess. She was about 60 and just sort of smirked at us.It was amazing. This stranger f**ked me rough.Although it was only for 30 minutes, we did pretty much everything.We had loads of fun but were caught by a passenger who heard me cum.I was next to this hot guy on a plane headed to Dubai.As I sat down, I immediately noticed his big penis. I guess he was quite erect.I couldn’t help but stare, got a bit horny and started rubbing my legs together. After a few minutes, the guy asked if there was something wrong and if he could help me with anything.I just stared at him and glanced at his bulky cock.We did it on the seats.I was a steward, and the pilot was so hot, I got an erection.The girl sitting next to me was very nervous. During take-off, she just grabbed my hand.Then, every time we hit turbulence, she got closer, gripping me tighter.Eventually, I just pulled her in for a kiss, and things got hot and heavy fast.I was coming home from the army.We started making out, and went into the bathroom. We almost ripped each other’s clothes off, and went at it like wild animals but stayed as quiet as possible.When we landed in New York, we decided we wanted more. So, we checked into a motel for three days.After that, she caught her flight to L.A., I caught mine to Chicago, and we never saw each other again.I thought about her for years, but I guess it’s just the way it goes sometimes.Good Sex Bad Sex podcast: Queerness \u0026amp comedy with comedian Sian DockseyElena, 27, MadridThe stewardess invited me up to first class, and seduced me.I’d seen this guy ogling me.We had sex standing up in the toilet.

Kate gazes adoringly at her newborn little...Kate Middleton royal baby LIVE: Latest news on new prince\u0027s...Share this articleAccording to a source, Kate and William are ‘very keen’ to make sure George and Charlotte are as involved as possible with their new brother, ‘hence the dash back to KP’ before bedtime last night.The couple are also determined to keep things as normal as possible for George, as he has just gone back to school for the summer term and they do not want his routine disrupted.For his part, William is good with the children in the nursery — one quality of his father Prince Charles that Diana acknowledged.    Prince George talks to his great-grandmother Queen Elizabeth ahead of the Christening of his sister Princess Charlotte  Prince Charles with Prince William and Harry pictured inside Kensington Palace (left) and the family with Princess Diana (right)          The grounds of Kensington Palace where the new prince has been taken this evening following his arrival today           An official pictured released for Prince George\u0027s birthday           Prince George, wearing a white dressing gown, greets Barack and Michelle Obama          Prince George plays with the Cambridge\u0027s family dog Lupo in the grounds of Kensington Palace‘It’s the home of a modern couple, lots of photographs of the children and the bits of artwork they bring home from school,’ says a friend.‘It’s a welcoming home, but William does guard their privacy and he limits the number of outsiders who are let in to the family circle.’ Evenings are often spent in front of the television with a take-away curry from Malabar in Notting Hill — collected by one of the orderlies, not delivered.          George and Charlotte wait in the window of Kensington PalaceWilliam has succeeded in creating something of the warm family atmosphere he found with the Middletons when he first knew Kate. But, as working royals, he long ago accepted that his and Kate’s home could never be quite like theirs. He’s matched them in one area, however — like them, he now has three children.By last night everything had been made ready in the Peter Rabbit-themed nursery to welcome home George and Charlotte’s new baby brother. I gather there are some new additions to the nursery, but no fresh licks of paint.There are, however, lots of new soft toys already — some from George and Charlotte — and many baby presents have also been delivered to the Palace.Officially, the couple say they won’t be hiring a maternity nurse to help with the early days of the new arrival. Insiders say Kate plans to breastfeed her new baby, but no one would think less of her if she did decide to call in specialist help, particularly during the night (a maternity nurse will normally sleep with the newborn and take the baby to its mother to be fed).After the birth of Prince George in 2013, Kate was on her knees with exhaustion because he hardly slept, and wanted his mother’s constant attention.When George was born, William and Kate had the builders in at Kensington Palace and were still living in cosy two-bedroom Nottingham Cottage.They almost immediately headed off to the Berkshire home of the Duchess’s parents.          The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge pose for photographs in the garden of Kensington Palace with their son George and dogsBy the time Charlotte arrived two years later, the £4.5 million refurbishment of Apartment 1A had been completed. With five reception rooms, three master bedrooms with adjoining dressing rooms and bathrooms, there is certainly plenty of space.The imaginative transformation includes a night nursery where Charlotte and George sleep, and a day nursery for playtime.On the first floor are the master bedrooms with en-suite bathrooms, and his-and-hers dressing rooms.          Prince Harry and Meghan Markle appeared in the grounds of Kensington Palace, where they live in Nottingham Cottage, after they announced their engagement.On the top floor, reached by a lift, are nine further bedrooms for staff, while a basement area where the photographer Earl of Snowdon once had his darkroom is now a well-appointed gym with laundry and luggage rooms nearby.The kitchen, on which the couple spent £170,000 of their own money, is the heart of this royal home, and where they like to entertain close friends and family.For more formal occasions guests, who arrive through a bright and airy entrance hall with intricate cornicing and black and white flagstones, are shown to one of the two drawing rooms — in one there is a grand piano and cream sofas with floral scatter cushions.Soon enough, the latest addition to the House of Windsor will no doubt be crawling all over them with mischief in mind."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/22/13/4B6C251F00000578-0-image-m-14_1524400230755.jpg","title":"Kate Middleton baby Prince Charles Middletons expected visit new royal baby","story":"Dress like a Duke in William’s blazer by Polo Ralph LaurenShop it here at MATCHESFASHION.COMThe whole Cambridge family were pictured at the Lindo wing at various points of the day that the newest addition arrived.

The lack of supply is pushing up prices, leaving young families struggling to get on the ladder.The Government believes that building 300,000 homes a year in England by 2025 is the answer and has ordered local authorities to outline suitable locations.Last month Prime Minister Theresa May warned that if councils don\u0027t build enough houses they will lose their right to determine where they are placed. Sajid Javid, Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government, told them he\u0027d be \u0027breathing down their neck\u0027.But Britain\u0027s latest housebuilding drive has led to fierce debates within communities about where these properties should go. At one extreme are the Nimbys (Not In My Back Yard) who don\u0027t want any housebuilding in their neighbourhood for fear the construction would ruin their views and be too noisy.At the other you have a new breed of campaigners nicknamed \u0027Yimbys\u0027 (Yes In My Back Yard) who want housing to help their children and grandchildren raise families.The majority sit somewhere between, pushed and pulled by these factions.          Against: Anna Martin, pictured with daughters Iona (centre) and Annabel, walks and jogs in the woods most days of the weekEastleigh, which must build 14,580 new homes by 2036, is a prime example of the new dynamic. It was one of 15 councils shamed last year for being too slow to put a plan in place. Now the council has revealed a proposal to build nearly 2,000 more homes than required.It has sparked uproar among the residents guiding me around the area. They\u0027re concerned that one in three houses is earmarked for greenfield land around Stoke Park Wood, and the idea of a road through the middle appals them.They tell me one Yimby is pushing this development more than anyone else — Keith House. The Liberal Democrat leader of Eastleigh Borough Council, who has held that role for more than 20 years, claims the development will create jobs and bring in extra council taxes.\u0027It has been known and accepted for years that we need to build more homes in the right places,\u0027 he says. \u0027While this shift from buying to renting is fine in London and other big cities, there isn\u0027t the stock in the suburbs and on the South coast.\u0027There is a change of tone in the housing debate as people realise that it\u0027s their sons and daughters who can\u0027t afford homes.\u0027It\u0027s clear why families would want to live in a location such as this. You\u0027d have rural Hampshire on your doorstep while being a 30-minute drive from Southampton and within commuting distance of London.And Mr House is adamant he can deliver the schools, roads and other facilities that will be needed here.\u0027All too often councils put the houses up first and then fail to deliver on the infrastructure,\u0027 he says. \u0027We\u0027re committed to putting that in — it\u0027s in the plans.\u0027          Lib Dem councillor Keith House claims the development will create jobs and bring in extra council taxesBut resident Bruce Mitchell, 55, a civil servant, accuses Mr House of ignoring overwhelming opposition. More than 30 people, including environmental experts and charities, spoke against the proposals at a meeting in December that ran on until after 1am, he says.The mayor, deputy mayor and three councillors have quit the Lib Dems over the plans, to run as independents. Even Eastleigh\u0027s Tory MP, Mims Davies, says the move was \u0027panicked and rushed\u0027.Helen Kerris Shaw, 39, who runs an animal charity where the development will be, says: \u0027I\u0027ve volunteered at the charity since I was nine and it\u0027s quite shocking to think it might all be bulldozed over.\u0027Anne Martin, 46, who walks and jogs in the woods most days of the week, says Mr House isn\u0027t thinking about the quality of life in the area.\u0027There are very few places you can go and have such quietness,\u0027 she says. \u0027It is just so short-sighted.\u0027Anne\u0027s daughter Iona, 11, who was highly commended in the British Wildlife Photography Awards, says the road will be like a \u0027Berlin Wall\u0027 for animals which live in the woods.According to the Woodland Trust, just 2 per cent of the UK is ancient woodland which has existed since records began in 1600 in England and Wales, and 1750 in Scotland.Jack Taylor, of the Woodland Trust, says light and road pollution are major threats to wildlife that rarely get mentioned. \u0027These woodlands could be saved with thoughtful design, and people in Eastleigh are right to be alarmed,\u0027 he says.Environmentalists are also concerned that the new road will damage the nearby Itchen river, which has European Special Area of Conservation status. TV naturalist Chris Packham, who grew up in nearby Southampton, has described the plan as \u0027eco-vandalism\u0027.Kate Beal-Blyth, 40, is a member of local action group Action Against Destructive Development.She\u0027s lived in Eastleigh most of her life, running a television production company, and says the group recognises the need to build but says that, with a new railway station and motorway junction, these could be nearer the centre of the borough.          Green belt: One in three houses in the Eastleigh development is earmarked for greenfield land around Stoke Park Wood\u0027We desperately need new homes — they are just being built in the wrong place,\u0027 she says. According to the Campaign to Protect Rural England, there is space on brownfield land — which has previously been developed — to build one million homes around the country. Many sites already have planning permission so homes can go up straight away, the group says.But PricedOut, which aims to help young people get on the housing ladder, says that won\u0027t be enough. It claims much of the green belt isn\u0027t as beautiful as people think — and banning new-builds prevents people from living near work.Mr House agrees. \u0027Every time we have had major development there is inevitable local opposition,\u0027 he says. \u0027But in this case, there is no alternative solution closer to the town centre with the right infrastructure.\u0027Mr House insists he wants to protect the woodland and says the council is not building more homes than Eastleigh needs, as the plan takes into account long-term trends. He says 35 per cent will be affordable housing, with a mix of different property types.          Kate Beal-Blyth is a member of Action Against Destructive DevelopmentSome communities may be able to avoid the sort of disputes that are splitting opinion in Eastleigh.One idea gaining popularity is to fill empty homes before building new ones. More than 11,000 homes across the UK have been empty for at least ten years, according to the Liberal Democrats. About 216,000 have been empty for six months. The Government announced last November that it would allow councils to charge double tax on properties that have been unoccupied and unfurnished for two years or more.The Intergenerational Foundation think tank says the Government should focus on filling empty rooms in homes. There are 25 million spare bedrooms in England, it says, adding that many houses are owned by empty-nest pensioners in family-sized houses.For many the costs of downsizing — estimated by Money Mail last year at £29,000 on average — are too off-putting. Experts such as John Godfrey, Theresa May\u0027s former head of policy, say a stamp duty tax break for downsizers could free up these properties for growing families.Mrs May has also suggested former shops could be turned into homes as more people buy online. She says Britain should look to build up as well as out — which could mean using spaces above shops, too.The Prime Minister plans to relax planning rules so people can add two more floors to many properties.Some experts have even suggested building above car parks. Property agency JLL says it has identified 868 car parks within a mile of a station in London that could support an average of 90 homes each. Another concept gaining popularity is the prefab home. These houses are fabricated in factories in as little as 20 days.           Picturesque: The River Itchen which borders the proposed development is one of the world\u0027s most exclusive fishing areasThey are then transported to the necessary location where they take just a few hours to erect. The benefit would be building more homes more quickly, limiting the disruption and noise that cause concern to many Nimbys.The Government hopes that garden towns — whole towns and villages built in commuter belt territory — will also provide room for thousands more homes. Some 14 developments were approved last year from Cornwall to Cumbria. Five in the corridor between Oxford and Cambridge are in the pipeline.Mrs May says she\u0027s working to speed up the planning process to boost housebuilding. Plus there will be a crackdown on developers who sit on land and wait for its value to rise to maximise profits.Yet for residents in areas such as Eastleigh, where councils are under pressure to build thousands of homes right now, these alternatives are emerging too late.Unless enough people back an affordable, sustainable alternative — and win over councillors whose reputations are on the line — campaigners may be fighting a losing battle.It could mean some of Britain\u0027s most beautiful rural areas, whether the locals like it or not, change irrevocably. And as Eastleigh\u0027s 11-year-old photography star Iona Martin is at pains to tell me, that\u0027s causing a great deal of heartache.v.bischoff@dailymail.co.ukOne year fixed rateNo fees to use abroad £150 Expedia voucher to sign up"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/24/07/4B7BAB0B00000578-0-image-m-34_1524549935724.jpg","title":"Petition calling Queen help save Alfie Evans reaches 110 000 signatures two days","story":"    Supporters shared this photo of mother Kate James cradling her son at Alder Hey Hospital in Liverpool, where doctors have withdrawn life supportJudge REJECTS Alfie Evans parents\u0027 bid to fly their...We have air ambulances waiting to take him to Italy, says...Share this articleBut this was refused by the judge and doctors turned off Alfie\u0027s systems 24-hours agoThis evening Alfie\u0027s father told reporters outside the hospital that his mother \u0027was giving him mouth-to-mouth resuscitation to keep him alive\u0027 after his lips began to turn blue.The petition, started by Kayleigh Price on Change.org, begins: \u0027We the undersigned humbly petition Your Majesty for protection of life and liberty of your 23-month-old subject Alfie Evans.\u0027          The petition had gathered an astonishing 112,000 names at the time of writing          An intervention by the Queen would mark an extraordinary turn in the tale - but would likely trigger a constitutional crisisIt continues, making a number of claims about the treatment of the child.\u0027The judges in Your Majesty\u0027s Court have given orders: to kill Alfie on an appointed hour at Alder Hey Hospital in Liverpool by withdrawing his life support.\u0027For the day and hour of that killing to be kept secret from the public to avoid any protest or hindrance For Alfie to be detained in Alder Hey until his death – any attempt to release him to be resisted by force, and punished by imprisonment.\u0027The petition also attacks the judges who have ruled on Alfie\u0027s case including from the Supreme Court, the Court of Appeal and the European Court of Human Rights.

And police believe car thefts have soared — up 30 per cent in three years.Almost as shocking is another story that emerged this week of how Martin Lewis — founder of the advice website MoneySavingExpert and one of the country’s top finance advisers — claims Facebook published fake adverts seeking to cash in on his good name.          Facebook handed over private data of 87 million of its users to UK-based Cambridge AnalyticaIn his case the social media company may have made an enemy it could do without. The pugnacious entrepreneur has helped consumers in Britain and across the world save millions of pounds in excessive charges on financial products and household utilities.He is now suing Facebook for publishing dozens of adverts using his image to promote scams designed, he says, to ‘rip off vulnerable people’.He discovered iniduals were targeted with commercials for bogus get-rich-quick schemes which he supposedly endorsed. Lewis says he knows of one woman who lost £100,000 in a scam which temporarily had attached his name to the product to give it credibility.Facebook’s failure to banish such adverts highlights its ‘unending greed’, he says.He repeatedly asked Facebook to remove the adverts, he claims, but they were left online for days or weeks. And when they were taken down, another one, almost identical, would appear in its place.And this, surely is the point. Time and again, iniduals, politicians, business leaders and the police have asked the web giants to mend their ways. But they are ignored.          Martin Lewis, pictured, is suing Facebook for defamation after it published adverts which used his image on commercials for bogus get-rich-quick schemeDavid Jamieson, police and crime commissioner of the West Midlands, where car theft has soared by 80 per cent, wrote to eBay and Amazon asking them to remove the sale of car-hacking devices from their websites. Nothing happened.‘The fact that they have yet to respond or take them down means they’re helping criminals,’ he surmised.The trouble is that, at every turn, the web giants seem to prefer to help criminals rather than inconvenience themselves by limiting untrammelled access on the web.It required years of enormous media and political pressure to persuade the digital giants and computer manufacturers to make even the slightest concessions towards blocking access to the most vile forms of online child pornography.Despite incessant demands from the police and politicians to prevent terrorist recruitment online, Islamic State and other militant groups around the world are still connecting with each other, accessing bomb-making advice or buying detonators and other equipment to commit acts of violence.And, of course, the abuse is not confined to crime.Many of us have suspected it for years, but the Cambridge Analytica scandal exposed how cynically and blatantly our personal data is harvested for commercial purposes without permission.Facebook and other social media sites such as WhatsApp (bought by Facebook for £11 billion in 2014) ruthlessly pillage our communications with friends and family to understand our likes and dislikes and pass data to advertisers.What is so amoral about the behaviour of the web giants is that, despite their endless protestations that they cannot control activity on the web, the reverse is the case.The same technological brainpower the FANGs use to take personal data and make us fodder for their greed could be directed towards curbing the criminal and intrusive behaviour they facilitate. The trouble is that these Silicon Valley giants are now so unimaginably wealthy, have such clout and so much job-creating capacity, that they can ignore the demands of politicians and policy-makers all over the world.Twenty North American cities — from Toronto in Canada to Austin, Texas — are currently engaged, for example, in a tawdry battle to be home to a second vast technological headquarters for Amazon.With the promise of $5 billion of investment to create 50,000 jobs, local politicians are falling over themselves to woo the web giant — and in such circumstances, who would dare raise the issues of tighter regulation or stricter taxation rules? Likewise, in Britain an open-door policy for Google at No 10 when David Cameron was Prime Minister almost certainly helped persuade the company to build magnificent European offices at King’s Cross in London which will eventually employ up to 9,000 people.Is it any wonder, therefore, that it has taken HMRC so long to get its teeth into alleged tax avoidance by the company and others like it?The extraordinary economic firepower which makes each of the digital giants unassailable has just been quantified by the International Monetary Fund. In 2017, sales of smartphones, the device of choice for online access, reached 1.5 billion units or one for every fifth person on Earth. Indeed, smartphones accounted for one-sixth of total world trade last year.Amazingly in Ireland, where Apple houses its intellectual property (the patents and know-how behind the iPhone), exports related to the phone accounted for one-quarter of the country’s economic expansion last year.That is why the Irish government objected when the European Commission — one of the few institutions trying to take on the web giants — gave Apple a £11.2 billion tax bill.So far, American politicians, like our own, have failed to show steel in the face of companies which, in their search for profits, have gone rogue, abandoning any pretence at ethical business practices.But there is a precedent for doing so.In the late 19th century, there was a giant company which the whole world thought was unassailable, so big and powerful was its size, scope and virtual monopoly. At the time, J. D. Rockefeller’s Standard Oil controlled 90 per cent of the U.S. oil market.Critics accused Rockefeller of engaging in unethical practices, such as predatory pricing and colluding with railroads to eliminate his competitors.But the U.S. President Teddy Roosevelt had the resolve to take it on. He used legislation to break it up into 34 separate companies and reduce its monopoly power.If only today’s policy-makers had the same gumption. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/23/21/4B7873C500000578-0-image-m-52_1524514421607.jpg","title":"Todays Mac Cartoon","story":"    ‘Really?

We won Wales In Bloom last year, but I don’t think we’ll be winning it again this year.’ An additional problem is that the shaggy goats carry parasites. ‘Last year we had twenty instances of children with ticks,’ he said.‘This summer we’re going to have many more because the goats have been on the school field – sunbathing and lounging among the plants.’In February, the Royal Welch Fusiliers tried to capture a kid from the herd to use as a mascot.

He said there were no legal grounds for blocking the deal.But a string of MPs urged him to change the law to prevent further ‘predators’ snapping up key British firms.Hedge funds bought up 25 per cent of GKN’s shares in a few weeks to help force through the takeover, helping seal a deal that was approved by a margin of 52 to 48.Tory MP Lucy Allan said the future of GKN was ‘determined by speculators who came on to the share register in the final weeks of the bid process to make a quick profit’.She said this was ‘no way to determine the future of a great British manufacturing company’ and called for a review of takeover rules.Labour MP Rachel Reeves, chairman of the Commons business committee, asked the Government to ‘look again at the takeover code, particularly for businesses so integral to our industrial strategy and for businesses that have received a lot of taxpayer funding’.Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable said the role of hedge funds had been ‘highly destabilising’. He suggested shareholders should be forced to wait a certain period before qualifying for a vote.Mr Clark said he was open to looking at takeover rules again, but suggested he thought they were working well. He also suggested hedge funds would have been unable to snap up shares if long-term investors had had more confidence in GKN’s management.Melrose has previously said it was willing to make a ‘legally-binding’ commitment not to sell GKN’s aerospace ision before April 2023.For a period of five years, Melrose will keep its headquarters in the UK and its shares listed on the stock market in London.

The session was arranged by the environmental audit select committee. This nannyish group is chaired by Labour’s Mary Creagh, who first made her name at Westminster by worrying about the temperature of bath water.Pleasant but fretful Ms Creagh has a brow default-set to frowns. She thinks ill-fate can be neutered by a risk-assessing, intervening political class.Little fun on a skiing trip, I suspect. Before her committee yesterday sat a chap from the Met Office, Peter Stott, and a duo from the state-paid, non-governmental Committee on Climate Change. They were Kathryn Brown and Michael Davies, though he should have been called Michael Mrphhh, he was such a mumbler. Sister Brown began almost every reply with ‘so’. You know the type.The Met Office’s Stott was asked for the official definition of a heatwave. He didn’t really have one. Instead he gave a very British answer: a heatwave was when it was hot for two consecutive nights. South of Suez, they would snort at such wimpishness. Two nights? Two years, surely. But here in Blighty if the mercury rises above 30 degrees celsius (86F) for a couple of nights, a hosepipe ban cannot be long delayed.Ms Creagh: ‘Was it a heatwave last weekend?’ Mr Stott: ‘We’re calling that a hot spell.’ Sometimes science can sound awfully like a hairdresser’s smalltalk. Ms Creagh was in anguish.          Zac Goldsmith, pictured,  asked if hotter weather would bring benefits from tourismShe feared that ‘the lack of a formal definition of a heatwave could be an obstacle to public understanding. There’s no narrative about when to look after your old people.’At the word ‘narrative’, my bluster-antennae always tingle.Ms Creagh said a 2003 heatwave killed 15,000 in France. She pressed her witnesses for ‘gender analysis’ of heatwave deaths. They seemed to know of little, though Prof Mrphhh did utter a few indistinct words still being deciphered by my analysts. Mr Stott, filling the gap with statements of the obvious, disclosed that the South-East of England tended to be hotter than northern parts of Britain.The Good Ship Rudd juddered... but did not sink: QUENTIN LETTS sees the humbling of the Home SecretaryQUENTIN LETTS: Take it from a father of three, William – you’re about to learn the plate-spinning horror of being OUTNUMBERED The star who’s SIMPLY THE BEST as Tina Turner…QUENTIN LETTS reviews the Tina musical Radiating grandeur, Lord Patten of Barnes milked his adoring audience as the unelected House threw what it intends to be a ner in the Brexit works… QUENTIN LETTS on yesterday in ParliamentPowerful tale of Tina that’s simply the best…QUENTIN LETTS reviews the Tina Turner musicalAs Labour MPs round on their leader QUENTIN LETTS watches as Corbyn muttered like a bulldog chomping on nettlesQUENTIN LETTS watches the PM defend sending in the RAF in Parliament as Labour MPs shook their heads in disagreement with Jeremy CorbynLusty revival has two waggy stars: QUENTIN LETTS reviews The Fantastic Follies Of Mrs Rich QUENTIN LETTS: Its timing may bounce around like a pinball over two months, but I pray Easter never becomes a fixed date No! Was human activity to blame for heatwaves? ‘Even without human activity there would still have been heatwaves,’ he said, but ‘the likelihood of heatwaves was at least doubled by humans.’Ms Creagh nodded with glum satisfaction. ‘Have you got any more granular breakdown on that?’ she asked. ‘Granular’ is another word that sets off hooters in my ear.Zac Goldsmith (Con, Richmond Park) broke through the pessimism to ask if hotter weather might bring benefits (eg, from tourism). Ms Brown cautiously agreed that we could do ‘comparatively favourably’ from ‘thermal comfort’ modelling.Translation: hotter weather would be good. The mumbling professor indicated that 40,000 oldies currently die from cold weather but deaths from heat are only 2,000. Ms Creagh glowered. Good news wasn’t what she was after at all.Caroline Lucas (Brighton Pavilion) sloped off after just 41 minutes. She may be Parliament’s only Green but that was enough environmental auditing for her, thank ye. What an important person she is.Headline-seeker Geraint Davies (Lab, Swansea W) asked if roads would have to be closed in heatwaves and marathon runners told to stop.Should doctors be told to take their holidays in summertime. The witnesses did not supply him with a usable soundbite. Maddening for him.The usual grindings of politics were on display: MPs seeking publicity and craving alarmism, a public-sector bureaucracy roboting management-speak. Endless baloney about ‘sophisticated modelling’, which always makes me think of Brigitte Bardot in her prime.Prof Mumbler said it was ‘very challenging to set thresholds for comfort in the built environment’ – ie you can’t generalise about how warm a building should be. Ms Brown spoke of ‘the mortality burden’ (ie deaths) and ‘complicated decision trees’ (dithering hospital bosses). Amid all this bureaucratic and Parliamentary hand-wringing, no one mentioned inidual gumption. Every problem was approached from the position of ‘how do we set an all-embracing rule to prevent the unforeseen?’It will now rain all summer. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/25/09/4B883E8C00000578-5654377-image-m-135_1524644056092.jpg","title":"Meghan looks sombre Anzac Day service remembrance fianc Harry","story":"    A smiling Prince Harry seems happy to be joined by his fiancee Meghan Markle, who was attending her first official memorial service this morning          The American passed a cultural milestone when she, and Harry, were welcomed by Te Ataraiti Waretini from Ngati Ranana with a traditional hongi          Prince Harry was also given a hongi to Te Ataraiti Waretini from Ngati Ranana, which involves the soft pressing of noses and the sharing of each other\u0027s breath          Prince Harry and his  fiancee Meghan Markle walk with New Zealand\u0027s High Commissioner to the United Kingdom, Jerry Mateparae, after commemorations at Hyde Park Corner          Prince Harry lays a wreath at the Australian War Memorial during an Anzac Day dawn service at Hyde Park Corner in London  Kensington Palace said the Duke of Cambridge hoped to join Harry and Meghan at the afternoon Anzac Day service  Meghan impressed delegates with her first official appearance at a memorial service, as she prepares to be formally welcomed into the royal family next month          Meghan Markle took part in her first official service of remembrance as she joined her fiancé, Prince Harry , at an Anzac Day Dawn Service          Prince Harry and his fiance Meghan Markle exchange a glance during the service, which represents the American\u0027s first ever remembrance event  The pair, who are set to marry next month, both wore long coats this morning for the moving dawn service at Wellington ArchA handwritten note from the prince, attached to a wreath of red roses, read: \u0027For all those who have made the ultimate sacrifice in pursuit of our freedom.

Villers-Bretonneux is now home to the main Australian Memorial of the Western Front.At Villers-Bretonneux, Turnbull and Philippe on Tuesday unveiled a memorial plaque at the new Sir John Monash Centre museum which is named after the Australian general responsible for taking the town.Turnbull and his wife, Lucy, also visited the grave of her great uncle Roger Hughes who was killed by a German shell in 1916 five days after arriving on the Western Front as a young military doctor.Turnbull said in an Anzac Day message that Australians remember veterans of every generation who risked their lives for their country.

Turkish casualties were estimated at 250,000.At the Australian War Memorial in the capital Canberra, an estimated crowd of 38,000 - 10 percent of the city\u0027s population - gathered in the cool autumn darkness for the dawn service which began with a lone soldier playing a didgeridoo.\u0027The attendance at this year\u0027s dawn service shows the enduring connection so many people have to Anzac Day,\u0027 Memorial Director Brendan Nelson said in a statement.

Well look at him now. He\u0027s not even on a ventilator and he\u0027s not suffering.\u0027Asked what intervention doctors had made, he replied: \u0027They left him for six hours without food, water and oxygen.\u0027I felt blessed when they confirmed they were going to give him his water and his oxygen.\u0027He\u0027s now on oxygen. It\u0027s not changing his breathing but it\u0027s oxygenating his body.\u0027He is still working, he\u0027s doing as good as he can.\u0027But we do need him to be supported ... in the next hour it\u0027s going to be hard but we will need him to be supported in the next hour or two.\u0027Because he\u0027s been doing it for nine hours totally unexpected, the doctors are gobsmacked and I do believe he will need some form of life support in the next couple of hours and I think he ought to be respected and given that.\u0027            Protesters outside Alder Hey Hospital in Liverpool where Alfie is being treated          A large number of police are outside the hospital to prevent demonstrators trying to get in          Some supporters have held an overnight vigil for Alfie after it was announced his life support had been withdrawn          Alder Hey has urged parents only to bring children to A\u0026ampE if there is an emergency and also asked Alfie\u0027s supporters to stop calling its switchboard    Alfie Evans\u0027 father Tom speaks to media and a large crowd outside Alder Hey hospital on Tuesday morning after announcing his son was breathing unassisted             The removal of life support comes after the family lost a \u0027last-ditch\u0027 appeal last night to delay the withdrawal of treatment and mount a further legal challenge             Police attempt to keep protesters, one pushing a pram, out of the hospital\u0027s revolving door            The Pope, who previously met Alfie\u0027s father, intervened again in the case to say he hoped the boy\u0027s parents would be able to seek new treatment      His parents Tom Evans and Kate James have battled through the courts to save their sonMay 2016: Alfie Evans is born apparently perfectly healthy, but misses numerous developmental milestones in his first seven monthsDecember 2016: Alfie catches a chest infection causing seizures, and is taken to Alder Hey Children\u0027s Hospital in Liverpool where he is put on life support.

The European Court of Human Rights refused to intervene in the case.Speaking outside the hospital on Monday night, Mr Evans: \u0027I\u0027m stood here now and Alfie is still here. Why? Because I\u0027m still fighting for him, I\u0027m still fighting and so is Alfie. I have been in touch with the Ambassador of Italy. My son belongs to Italy. I love Alfie and I love Kate, I will not give up.\u0027 Around 100 people remained outside Alder Hey Children\u0027s Hospital awaiting news on Alfie Evans while a line of police officers guard the main entrance, with more police stationed at other entrances. Pope Francis said on Twitter: \u0027Moved by the prayers and immense solidarity shown little Alfie Evans, I renew my appeal that the suffering of his parents may be heard and that their desire to seek new forms of treatment may be granted.\u0027 A source close to the Evans family said a UK judge would hold an urgent telephone conference with Italian legal representatives to discuss Alfie\u0027s plight.Alfie\u0027s father met the Pope last week to ask for asylum, kissing the pontiff\u0027s hand and begging him to \u0027save our son\u0027.The head of the Bambino Gesu Pediatric Hospital, which is administered by the Vatican, also travelled to Liverpool in a bid to have the boy transferred, saying Pope Francis asked her to do everything \u0027possible and impossible\u0027 to save him.The hospital previously offered to help in the case of Charlie Gard, who died from a rare form of mitochondrial disease that causes progressive muscle weakness, including in his organs.            Alfie Evans is in a \u0027semi-vegetative state\u0027 and has a degenerative neurological condition            Tom Evans pictured with the Pope, who has thrown renewed support behind the family    Bambino Gesu, a children\u0027s hospital owned by the Vatican and known as the Pope\u0027s Hospital (pictured), has secured a plane ready to jet Alfie Evans to Rome today.The hospital has contacted Aldey Hey Children\u0027s Hospital  about Alfie\u0027s transfer and has also sent doctors to his bedside.Bambino Gesù is the largest paediatric hospital and research centre in Europe.The hospital has a staff of almost 2,600 including physicians, researchers, nurses, clinical technicians and office staff.Its slogan is: \u0027You think about your child, we\u0027ll think about everything else\u0027.It was also heavily involved in the tragic case of Charlie Gard and had also offered to care for him before he died last year. Bambino Gesu was criticised last year after the publication of a damning investigation in the Italian Press, which accused Bambino Gesu of putting profits before the welfare of children.The scandal occurred before boss Mariella Enoc joined the hospital.                                                     Their case went before the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) after it was rejected by the UK\u0027s Supreme Court, but judges in Strasbourg also refused to intervene, saying the application was \u0027inadmissible\u0027.Following the decision, around 200 people gathered outside Liverpool\u0027s Alder Hey hospital, as supporters blocked the road outside the hospital, linking arms and chanting, \u0027Save Alfie Evans!\u0027 Dozens had ran towards the main doors before police officers stationed inside and out strung across the entrance blocking the way, and after after a short stand off the crowd retreated to gather around 100 yards away on the road outside. One woman described the crowd as \u0027terrifying\u0027, saying: \u0027Everyone just ran and were going for the doors, pushing police out of the way - but they weren\u0027t going to get in past the police. \u0027I understand people want to support Alfie and I\u0027ve got a lot of respect for people who want to support him but I\u0027ve got respect for the hospital as well because they\u0027ve saved my little girl\u0027s life.\u0027 Another woman whose child is being treated at the hospital after being in a car accident and whose son had a separate appointment at the hospital said: \u0027We support Tom and Kate but we don\u0027t support them storming.\u0027We were walking out and I had my baby in a wheelchair. I was getting tossed and turned by coppers trying to get out and my baby was terrified,\u0027 she said. Some Twitter users compared the case negatively to the national euphoria following the birth of the royal baby on the same day. One said: \u0027A royal birth means nothing to me I\u0027d rather focus my attention to things closer to home and show my support for Alfie Evans. All the best little man.Another said: \u0027My thoughts are with Alfie Evans today, not the royal baby.\u0027          Some of the protesters attempted to get into the hospital as police guarded the entrance            Some of the group surge towards are door after protesters tried to block a road to the hospital      A large crowd of around 200 demonstrators gathered outside the hospital on Monday It comes after a British judge said flying Alfie to a foreign hospital would be wrong and pointless, in a decision since backed by Britain\u0027s Appeal Court and the Supreme Court.An ECHR spokesman said on Monday: \u0027The European Court of Human Rights has today rejected the application submitted by the family of Alfie Evans as inadmissible.\u0027The couple have argued that Alfie is being wrongly \u0027detained\u0027 at Alder Hey and have made a habeas corpus application.A writ of habeas corpus - Latin for \u0027you may have the body\u0027 - is a legal manoeuvre which requires a court to examine the legality of a detention.It is a piece of common law which probably dates back to Anglo-Saxon times.A spokesman for Alder Hey said: \u0027Alder Hey Children\u0027s Hospital remains open as usual for all visitors and appointments, however visitors may notice an increase in visible police presence in and around the hospital site - this is part of our ongoing security arrangements.\u0027 The case has echoes of that of Charlie Gard, who was born in August 2016 with a rare form of mitochondrial disease that causes progressive muscle weakness, including in his organs.The British boy died on July 29, one week short of his first birthday, after doctors withdrew life support treatment.Gard\u0027s parents fought a five-month legal battle for him to be taken to the United States for experimental treatment.They lost a series of appeals in British courts and the ECHR.        Supporters shared this photo of mother Kate James cradling her son at Alder Hey Hospital in Liverpool, where doctors have withdrawn life supportBut this was refused by the judge and doctors turned off Alfie\u0027s systems 24-hours agoThis evening Alfie\u0027s father told reporters outside the hospital that his mother \u0027was giving him mouth-to-mouth resuscitation to keep him alive\u0027 after his lips began to turn blue.The petition, started by Kayleigh Price on Change.org, begins: \u0027We the undersigned humbly petition Your Majesty for protection of life and liberty of your 23-month-old subject Alfie Evans.\u0027            The petition had gathered an astonishing 112,000 names at the time of writing            An intervention by the Queen would mark an extraordinary turn in the tale - but would likely trigger a constitutional crisisIt continues, making a number of claims about the treatment of the child.\u0027The judges in Your Majesty\u0027s Court have given orders: to kill Alfie on an appointed hour at Alder Hey Hospital in Liverpool by withdrawing his life support.\u0027For the day and hour of that killing to be kept secret from the public to avoid any protest or hindrance For Alfie to be detained in Alder Hey until his death – any attempt to release him to be resisted by force, and punished by imprisonment.\u0027The petition also attacks the judges who have ruled on Alfie\u0027s case including from the Supreme Court, the Court of Appeal and the European Court of Human Rights.                         Alfie Evans updates: Police hold back angry protesters as they make stand outside Alder Hey Children\u0027s Hospital - Mirror Online"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/25/08/4B880EAA00000578-5654787-image-a-4_1524642103741.jpg","title":"Mother 37 embezzled 92 000 IVF","story":"Debbie Stevenson, 37, pictured with her husband Michael, stole the cash from the firm where she worked in Glenrothes, FifeA mother who was desperate for another child embezzled more than £92,000 for IVF, a court heard.Debbie Stevenson, 37, of Boldon Colliery, Tyne and Wear, started stealing the cash from the firm where she worked as a bookkeeper in 2014.She used the money to pay for costly fertility treatment, involving trips to Greece, and gave birth to twins in 2015.But she continued siphoning off money from packaging firm The Pitreavie Group in Glenrothes, Fife, until January 2017,Stevenson, who also has an 18-year-old son, feared she would be sent to prison and parted from her children, Kirkcaldy Sheriff Court was told.A judge deferred sentence to allow assessment of suitability for a restriction of liberty order.

The session was arranged by the environmental audit select committee. This nannyish group is chaired by Labour’s Mary Creagh, who first made her name at Westminster by worrying about the temperature of bath water.Pleasant but fretful Ms Creagh has a brow default-set to frowns. She thinks ill-fate can be neutered by a risk-assessing, intervening political class.Little fun on a skiing trip, I suspect. Before her committee yesterday sat a chap from the Met Office, Peter Stott, and a duo from the state-paid, non-governmental Committee on Climate Change. They were Kathryn Brown and Michael Davies, though he should have been called Michael Mrphhh, he was such a mumbler. Sister Brown began almost every reply with ‘so’. You know the type.The Met Office’s Stott was asked for the official definition of a heatwave. He didn’t really have one. Instead he gave a very British answer: a heatwave was when it was hot for two consecutive nights. South of Suez, they would snort at such wimpishness. Two nights? Two years, surely. But here in Blighty if the mercury rises above 30 degrees celsius (86F) for a couple of nights, a hosepipe ban cannot be long delayed.Ms Creagh: ‘Was it a heatwave last weekend?’ Mr Stott: ‘We’re calling that a hot spell.’ Sometimes science can sound awfully like a hairdresser’s smalltalk. Ms Creagh was in anguish.          Zac Goldsmith, pictured,  asked if hotter weather would bring benefits from tourismShe feared that ‘the lack of a formal definition of a heatwave could be an obstacle to public understanding. There’s no narrative about when to look after your old people.’At the word ‘narrative’, my bluster-antennae always tingle.Ms Creagh said a 2003 heatwave killed 15,000 in France. She pressed her witnesses for ‘gender analysis’ of heatwave deaths. They seemed to know of little, though Prof Mrphhh did utter a few indistinct words still being deciphered by my analysts. Mr Stott, filling the gap with statements of the obvious, disclosed that the South-East of England tended to be hotter than northern parts of Britain.The Good Ship Rudd juddered... but did not sink: QUENTIN LETTS sees the humbling of the Home SecretaryQUENTIN LETTS: Take it from a father of three, William – you’re about to learn the plate-spinning horror of being OUTNUMBERED The star who’s SIMPLY THE BEST as Tina Turner…QUENTIN LETTS reviews the Tina musical Radiating grandeur, Lord Patten of Barnes milked his adoring audience as the unelected House threw what it intends to be a ner in the Brexit works… QUENTIN LETTS on yesterday in ParliamentPowerful tale of Tina that’s simply the best…QUENTIN LETTS reviews the Tina Turner musicalAs Labour MPs round on their leader QUENTIN LETTS watches as Corbyn muttered like a bulldog chomping on nettlesQUENTIN LETTS watches the PM defend sending in the RAF in Parliament as Labour MPs shook their heads in disagreement with Jeremy CorbynLusty revival has two waggy stars: QUENTIN LETTS reviews The Fantastic Follies Of Mrs Rich QUENTIN LETTS: Its timing may bounce around like a pinball over two months, but I pray Easter never becomes a fixed date No! Was human activity to blame for heatwaves? ‘Even without human activity there would still have been heatwaves,’ he said, but ‘the likelihood of heatwaves was at least doubled by humans.’Ms Creagh nodded with glum satisfaction. ‘Have you got any more granular breakdown on that?’ she asked. ‘Granular’ is another word that sets off hooters in my ear.Zac Goldsmith (Con, Richmond Park) broke through the pessimism to ask if hotter weather might bring benefits (eg, from tourism). Ms Brown cautiously agreed that we could do ‘comparatively favourably’ from ‘thermal comfort’ modelling.Translation: hotter weather would be good. The mumbling professor indicated that 40,000 oldies currently die from cold weather but deaths from heat are only 2,000. Ms Creagh glowered. Good news wasn’t what she was after at all.Caroline Lucas (Brighton Pavilion) sloped off after just 41 minutes. She may be Parliament’s only Green but that was enough environmental auditing for her, thank ye. What an important person she is.Headline-seeker Geraint Davies (Lab, Swansea W) asked if roads would have to be closed in heatwaves and marathon runners told to stop.Should doctors be told to take their holidays in summertime. The witnesses did not supply him with a usable soundbite. Maddening for him.The usual grindings of politics were on display: MPs seeking publicity and craving alarmism, a public-sector bureaucracy roboting management-speak. Endless baloney about ‘sophisticated modelling’, which always makes me think of Brigitte Bardot in her prime.Prof Mumbler said it was ‘very challenging to set thresholds for comfort in the built environment’ – ie you can’t generalise about how warm a building should be. Ms Brown spoke of ‘the mortality burden’ (ie deaths) and ‘complicated decision trees’ (dithering hospital bosses). Amid all this bureaucratic and Parliamentary hand-wringing, no one mentioned inidual gumption. Every problem was approached from the position of ‘how do we set an all-embracing rule to prevent the unforeseen?’It will now rain all summer. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/24/13/4B7F395900000578-5650177-image-a-40_1524573869675.jpg","title":"Toddler Alfie Evans survives night without life support","story":"    Alfie\u0027s father Tom Evans say doctors are not talking to them and called their treatment of the boy \u0027disgusting\u0027Alfie Evans\u0027 parents claim his doctors are no longer talking to them and they have not tested or observed their son since his life supported was withdrawn 36 hours ago.Tom Evans and Kate James\u0027s lawyers will go to the Court of Appeal in London at 2pm to overturn a High Court ruling stopping them flying him to the Pope\u0027s children\u0027s hospital in Rome.Mr Evans says his son has been \u0027left to die\u0027 inside Alder Hey and said: \u0027Alfie is still fighting. He\u0027s not suffering. He\u0027s not had any pain.\u0027I believe I am getting closer to bringing him home. We would be happy with that. But we would be happier to get him to Italy for his treatment.\u0027He added: \u0027We were told he wouldn’t last five minutes and here we are 36 hours later\u0027.Alder Hey\u0027s doctors, nurses and staff say they have faced vitriol from some of the toddler\u0027s supporters, making it \u0027impossible\u0027 for the little boy to go home, the High Court heard yesterday.Mr Evans told ITV\u0027s This Morning: \u0027I have tried my best with Alder Hey.

That was it\u0027. Alfie has survived a second night without life support and is breathing unaided.           Supporters shared this photo of mother Kate James cradling her son at Alder Hey Hospital in Liverpool, where doctors have withdrawn life support.

Well look at him now. He\u0027s not even on a ventilator and he\u0027s not suffering.\u0027Asked what intervention doctors had made, he replied: \u0027They left him for six hours without food, water and oxygen.\u0027I felt blessed when they confirmed they were going to give him his water and his oxygen.\u0027He\u0027s now on oxygen. It\u0027s not changing his breathing but it\u0027s oxygenating his body.\u0027He is still working, he\u0027s doing as good as he can.\u0027But we do need him to be supported ... in the next hour it\u0027s going to be hard but we will need him to be supported in the next hour or two.\u0027Because he\u0027s been doing it for nine hours totally unexpected, the doctors are gobsmacked and I do believe he will need some form of life support in the next couple of hours and I think he ought to be respected and given that.\u0027            Protesters outside Alder Hey Hospital in Liverpool where Alfie is being treated          A large number of police are outside the hospital to prevent demonstrators trying to get in          Some supporters have held an overnight vigil for Alfie after it was announced his life support had been withdrawn          Alder Hey has urged parents only to bring children to A\u0026ampE if there is an emergency and also asked Alfie\u0027s supporters to stop calling its switchboard    Alfie Evans\u0027 father Tom speaks to media and a large crowd outside Alder Hey hospital on Tuesday morning after announcing his son was breathing unassisted             The removal of life support comes after the family lost a \u0027last-ditch\u0027 appeal last night to delay the withdrawal of treatment and mount a further legal challenge             Police attempt to keep protesters, one pushing a pram, out of the hospital\u0027s revolving door            The Pope, who previously met Alfie\u0027s father, intervened again in the case to say he hoped the boy\u0027s parents would be able to seek new treatment      His parents Tom Evans and Kate James have battled through the courts to save their sonMay 2016: Alfie Evans is born apparently perfectly healthy, but misses numerous developmental milestones in his first seven monthsDecember 2016: Alfie catches a chest infection causing seizures, and is taken to Alder Hey Children\u0027s Hospital in Liverpool where he is put on life support.

The European Court of Human Rights refused to intervene in the case.Speaking outside the hospital on Monday night, Mr Evans: \u0027I\u0027m stood here now and Alfie is still here. Why? Because I\u0027m still fighting for him, I\u0027m still fighting and so is Alfie. I have been in touch with the Ambassador of Italy. My son belongs to Italy. I love Alfie and I love Kate, I will not give up.\u0027 Around 100 people remained outside Alder Hey Children\u0027s Hospital awaiting news on Alfie Evans while a line of police officers guard the main entrance, with more police stationed at other entrances. Pope Francis said on Twitter: \u0027Moved by the prayers and immense solidarity shown little Alfie Evans, I renew my appeal that the suffering of his parents may be heard and that their desire to seek new forms of treatment may be granted.\u0027 A source close to the Evans family said a UK judge would hold an urgent telephone conference with Italian legal representatives to discuss Alfie\u0027s plight.Alfie\u0027s father met the Pope last week to ask for asylum, kissing the pontiff\u0027s hand and begging him to \u0027save our son\u0027.The head of the Bambino Gesu Pediatric Hospital, which is administered by the Vatican, also travelled to Liverpool in a bid to have the boy transferred, saying Pope Francis asked her to do everything \u0027possible and impossible\u0027 to save him.The hospital previously offered to help in the case of Charlie Gard, who died from a rare form of mitochondrial disease that causes progressive muscle weakness, including in his organs.            Alfie Evans is in a \u0027semi-vegetative state\u0027 and has a degenerative neurological condition            Tom Evans pictured with the Pope, who has thrown renewed support behind the family    Bambino Gesu, a children\u0027s hospital owned by the Vatican and known as the Pope\u0027s Hospital (pictured), has secured a plane ready to jet Alfie Evans to Rome today.The hospital has contacted Aldey Hey Children\u0027s Hospital  about Alfie\u0027s transfer and has also sent doctors to his bedside.Bambino Gesù is the largest paediatric hospital and research centre in Europe.The hospital has a staff of almost 2,600 including physicians, researchers, nurses, clinical technicians and office staff.Its slogan is: \u0027You think about your child, we\u0027ll think about everything else\u0027.It was also heavily involved in the tragic case of Charlie Gard and had also offered to care for him before he died last year. Bambino Gesu was criticised last year after the publication of a damning investigation in the Italian Press, which accused Bambino Gesu of putting profits before the welfare of children.The scandal occurred before boss Mariella Enoc joined the hospital.                                                     Their case went before the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) after it was rejected by the UK\u0027s Supreme Court, but judges in Strasbourg also refused to intervene, saying the application was \u0027inadmissible\u0027.Following the decision, around 200 people gathered outside Liverpool\u0027s Alder Hey hospital, as supporters blocked the road outside the hospital, linking arms and chanting, \u0027Save Alfie Evans!\u0027 Dozens had ran towards the main doors before police officers stationed inside and out strung across the entrance blocking the way, and after after a short stand off the crowd retreated to gather around 100 yards away on the road outside. One woman described the crowd as \u0027terrifying\u0027, saying: \u0027Everyone just ran and were going for the doors, pushing police out of the way - but they weren\u0027t going to get in past the police. \u0027I understand people want to support Alfie and I\u0027ve got a lot of respect for people who want to support him but I\u0027ve got respect for the hospital as well because they\u0027ve saved my little girl\u0027s life.\u0027 Another woman whose child is being treated at the hospital after being in a car accident and whose son had a separate appointment at the hospital said: \u0027We support Tom and Kate but we don\u0027t support them storming.\u0027We were walking out and I had my baby in a wheelchair. I was getting tossed and turned by coppers trying to get out and my baby was terrified,\u0027 she said. Some Twitter users compared the case negatively to the national euphoria following the birth of the royal baby on the same day. One said: \u0027A royal birth means nothing to me I\u0027d rather focus my attention to things closer to home and show my support for Alfie Evans. All the best little man.Another said: \u0027My thoughts are with Alfie Evans today, not the royal baby.\u0027          Some of the protesters attempted to get into the hospital as police guarded the entrance            Some of the group surge towards are door after protesters tried to block a road to the hospital      A large crowd of around 200 demonstrators gathered outside the hospital on Monday It comes after a British judge said flying Alfie to a foreign hospital would be wrong and pointless, in a decision since backed by Britain\u0027s Appeal Court and the Supreme Court.An ECHR spokesman said on Monday: \u0027The European Court of Human Rights has today rejected the application submitted by the family of Alfie Evans as inadmissible.\u0027The couple have argued that Alfie is being wrongly \u0027detained\u0027 at Alder Hey and have made a habeas corpus application.A writ of habeas corpus - Latin for \u0027you may have the body\u0027 - is a legal manoeuvre which requires a court to examine the legality of a detention.It is a piece of common law which probably dates back to Anglo-Saxon times.A spokesman for Alder Hey said: \u0027Alder Hey Children\u0027s Hospital remains open as usual for all visitors and appointments, however visitors may notice an increase in visible police presence in and around the hospital site - this is part of our ongoing security arrangements.\u0027 The case has echoes of that of Charlie Gard, who was born in August 2016 with a rare form of mitochondrial disease that causes progressive muscle weakness, including in his organs.The British boy died on July 29, one week short of his first birthday, after doctors withdrew life support treatment.Gard\u0027s parents fought a five-month legal battle for him to be taken to the United States for experimental treatment.They lost a series of appeals in British courts and the ECHR.        Supporters shared this photo of mother Kate James cradling her son at Alder Hey Hospital in Liverpool, where doctors have withdrawn life supportBut this was refused by the judge and doctors turned off Alfie\u0027s systems 24-hours agoThis evening Alfie\u0027s father told reporters outside the hospital that his mother \u0027was giving him mouth-to-mouth resuscitation to keep him alive\u0027 after his lips began to turn blue.The petition, started by Kayleigh Price on Change.org, begins: \u0027We the undersigned humbly petition Your Majesty for protection of life and liberty of your 23-month-old subject Alfie Evans.\u0027            The petition had gathered an astonishing 112,000 names at the time of writing            An intervention by the Queen would mark an extraordinary turn in the tale - but would likely trigger a constitutional crisisIt continues, making a number of claims about the treatment of the child.\u0027The judges in Your Majesty\u0027s Court have given orders: to kill Alfie on an appointed hour at Alder Hey Hospital in Liverpool by withdrawing his life support.\u0027For the day and hour of that killing to be kept secret from the public to avoid any protest or hindrance For Alfie to be detained in Alder Hey until his death – any attempt to release him to be resisted by force, and punished by imprisonment.\u0027The petition also attacks the judges who have ruled on Alfie\u0027s case including from the Supreme Court, the Court of Appeal and the European Court of Human Rights.                         Alfie Evans updates: Police hold back angry protesters as they make stand outside Alder Hey Children\u0027s Hospital - Mirror Online"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/25/07/4B7EDC1100000578-0-image-a-3_1524638727041.jpg","title":"Two officers caught camera messing childrens playground duty","story":"    A police officer is seen using what appears to be a mobile phone to record their colleague playing on the children\u0027s slide near the Andover estate in Holloway, north London          The footage of the two officers larking about in the playground - which was filmed at the weekend - was taken in Holloway, north London, which is an area plagued by knife crimeEXCLUSIVE: Fury as police officers pose for \u0027insensitive\u0027...Panicked mother only found out her daughter had flipped her...Share this articleThe mum the officers appeared to briefly look round the play area - and then to her amazement began to take their turns on the play equipment meant for toddlers. She claimed the officers were filming each other larking around. \u0027The police were in the park for 10-15 mins,\u0027 she said. \u0027My daughter called me at first and said, mummy there\u0027s police outside.

It will include paintings and installation pieces, and classically inspired sculptures such as a version of the Venus de Milo, challenging the antique marbles filling many of the state rooms.“His attitude to life was that everything was possible as long as you set your mind to it – a very positive outlook on the world which is perhaps something we need more than ever now,” said the curator Michael Frahm. “He died too young, but he was hugely hard working, and his work remains highly influential, one of the most original and influential artists of the 20th century.”Frahm is the director of the Blenheim Art Foundation, founded in 2014 by Lord Edward Spencer-Churchill to bring annual exhibitions of contemporary art into the bewilderingly grand formal rooms of his family home. The series has formerly featured living artists and launched with a major exhibition from Ai Weiwei. The Chinese artist was then under house arrest in Beijing but toured the the space to plan the installation through a specially created 3D computer model. The exhibition proved so popular its run had to be extended twice.The 18th-century Oxfordshire palace, designed by Sir John Vanbrugh and set in a landscape designed by the famed gardener Capability Brown, has been a Unesco World Heritage site since 1987. Blenheim was conceived as a gift from the grateful nation to the first Duke of Marlborough for his victories in war, but as the costs escalated dizzyingly funds stopped with £220,000 spent and the 28,330-sq-metre (seven-acre) house only half completed. It was finished years later when his widow, the formidable Sarah Churchill, sacked the architect and insisted on lower wages and cheaper materials."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e8cedc3353c7fb0586b8019b03efdb92bae9e861/224_446_2553_1532/master/2553.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1524243d33551ffb052361f61667007f","title":"kyotographie in japan photo essay","story":"The Kyotographie photography festival, now in its sixth year, uses unique spaces to showcase the work of 15 leading international photographers, including Alberto García-Alix, Gideon Mendel and Masahisa Fukaseby  Fiona Shields, Head of photographyThe Kyotographie photography festival, now in its sixth year, uses unique spaces to showcase the work of 15 leading international photographers, including Alberto García-Alix, Gideon Mendel and Masahisa Fukaseby  Fiona Shields, Head of photographyAs the cherry blossom fades in Kyoto, attention turns to a visual spectacle of a different kind: the annual Kyotographie photo festival. Showing the work of 15 leading international photographers in unique locations, this year’s theme, Up, centres on a subtle call to action. The festival’s directors, Lucille Reyboz and Yusuke Nakanishi, say participants were asked to illustrate how social change can be encouraged through self-awareness, action and creation.The use of unusual architectural spaces, from a disused printing works to the sanctuary of a temple, gives the festival a distinct flavour and adds another atmospheric dimension to each photographer’s work.The South African-born photographer’s installation, presented in a former ice factory and anchored by a series of portraits and video exploration of devastated living spaces, seeks to connect people affected by flooding and the catastrophic impact of industrial and environmental change. The Tidelines series is a collection of water-damaged photographs that provide a moving testament to the memories of family life before the floods.Exhibited in the depths of the disused ice factory is the astonishingly personal work by Alberto Garcia-Alix. Renowned for his raw, hedonistic portraiture, the maverick Spanish photographer’s early images focus on some of the people in his life. The photos set the scene for a dreamlike, retrospective film that is woven together with video, still images and his poetic narration, detailing a life led against the grain of convention and the lost aspirations of youth.Regarded as one of the most radical and influential photographers of his generation, the Fukase retrospective is a festival highlight. The extensive exhibition features the acclaimed series Ravens, which explores the artist’s battle with depression, as well as his vivid photographs showing the wild side of his beloved cat, Sasuke. The jewel in the crown is his early colour work, which was previously published but never exhibited. Viewed in its entirety, the Fukase display gives a deeper understanding of the variety and complexity of the photographer’s work.Izumi Miyazaki, one of the rising stars of the festival, is also the star of her work. Reminiscent of Magritte, at first glance her vivid use of colour and character seems whimsical, but her intent is a serious exploration of surrealism that leaves the viewer charmed and unsettled in equal measure. Miyazaki draws inspiration from her daily life, including what she has eaten.The Kyoto central wholesale market is the inspired venue for K-Narf’s tribute to the proud work ethic that is respected in Japanese culture. On the opening day of the festival, the photographer’s almost lifesize portraits of market traders caused a stir of excitement as members of the local community recognised their friends and colleagues. The project is centred on the local people and preserving their respect for the next generation, K-Narf says."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18d8dd52a1cd9645393b0eb695e6609f2604b9e0/0_0_2000_1578/master/2000.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0caf4d90d372098be7a9797793b2b482 700w","title":"dictator literature daniel kalder review","story":"Mein Kampf is drivel, but what about Stalin’s poetry and Mussolini’s bodice-ripper? And does an autocrat lurk within every dreadful writer?I enjoyed this book a great deal – not least because for a long text that is itself a series of summaries of many other still lengthier texts, it’s actually a rather snappy read. And all the snappier when you come to consider its subject matter. Daniel Kalder was living in Moscow in the early 2000s, when he saw on television an item about the Rukhnama, or The Book of the Soul. This was the principal (but by no means the only) contribution to the genre of dictator literature, written by Turkmenbashi, the then führer of Turkmenistan. Struck by the lurid – not to say supernatural – way in which this bizarre tome was being depicted, Kalder set himself the task of reading it as he says: “I had known about Mein Kampf and Mao’s Little Red Book since I was a child and I had visited many Russian apartments where dusty volumes of Lenin cluttered up bookcases. This, however, was the first time I had witnessed the phenomenon of the living dictator book.”Some might argue this was a good thing – and that furthermore, these vanitytyranny-published novels, volumes of poetry, memoirs and many reams of pseudo-ideological claptrap should also be consigned to the dustbin of history, along with their originators. But as Kalder points out: during the long years he was writing the book the world has lurched into a new and fissiparous era – one that might well be as productive of dictators as the middle years of the last century. Meanwhile, the medium through which dictatorial – or wannabe dictatorial – “thought” is conveyed has changed from millions of weighty words to a mere handful of twittering characters, arguably making it that much easier for the (let’s face it, reading-averse) masses to be simultaneously aroused and hoodwinked.Kalder begins with the dusty volumes he saw cluttering Russian bookshelves. He argues, semi-persuasively, that Lenin should be viewed as the father of dictatorial literature. (And it’s worth noting here that although Kalder is adept at phrasemaking, he manages to resist the coinage, dic-lit. Would that I were so restrained.) A bookish lad, Lenin did indeed model his persona on the two-dimensional characters he found in Nikolay Chernyshevsky’s revolutionary pot-boiler What Is to Be Done? (1863). What’s more, when it came time, after the 1905 revolution, to seize control of tumultuous events, Lenin used this title for his own strategy chapbook. He also wrote a great deal of rather stodgy quasi-Marxist semi-theory, whereby he attempted to shoehorn the sprawling Russian agrarian economy (and its equally sprawling history) into the weird rubric of dialectical materialism.Kalder is surely right to finger Lenin as the literary justifier of the so-called “dictatorship of the proletariat” but while it’s also true that given the opportunity, he acted with exemplary – and dictatorial – cruelty, surely what characterises his oeuvre overall is that it’s directed at seizing and consolidating power, rather than building some sort of monolithic mythos. As Kalder riffs, apropos Lenin’s vapid The State and Revolution: he “reached up from the page to hand you the crack pipe of revolution for another hit of the good shit”.Kalder likes these anachronistic tropes – but while funny, I’m not sure they serve him well. They made me insistently aware that the minds who produced these works – whether incendiary or enervating – were in fact radically different from my own and that their authors were responding to radically different circumstances. Which is by no means to justify the papery solecisms of Lenin et al – or the horrors they justified or covered up. But ultimately cracking wise doesn’t quite cut it when it comes to either preventing tyranny, or providing nuance. Kalder’s on firmer ground with Stalin, who, having seized power despite Lenin accusing him from beyond the grave of “rudeness”, went on to have an exemplary dic-lit career of churning out mind-numbing verbiage – whether by himself, or by committee. Building on Lenin’s example, Stalin crystallised the notion of the dictatorial canon: by making his works (and by implication, himself) the very synecdoche of truth itself.Yet Kalder has some difficulties with Stalin as well, when it comes to his basic contention that within every dreadful writer there lurks a savage autocrat, waiting to get out. For while it’s true that he was a dictator sans pareil, and his mature prose was correspondingly crushingly awful, as a young man Stalin penned some not insignificant poetry in his native Georgian – evidence, perhaps, of the literary and ethical road less taken. Mussolini also gives Kalder pause for thought: Il Duce was, after all, a professional journalist, and highly successful newspaper editor, who knew how to analyse grammar. He was also refreshingly theory-lite – and free from the obligation to marmorealise any ideological predecessors. Kalder even has good words to say about Mussolini’s attempt at a weird bodice-ripper, The Cardinal’s Mistress, which has the distinction of being the only remotely “proper” novel written by a dictator. (Saddam Hussein had a late career burst of novelising, but the results make an average Mills \u0026amp Boon look like Madame Bovary.)Kalder gets round the Mussolini problem by pointing out that, as despots go, he was by no means the worst – more of a big bully than an out-and-out tyrant, at least until he entered the Nazis’ endgame. As for the Führer himself, Kalder quotes a copy editor: “At age thirty-five, Hitler had mastered neither basic spelling nor common grammar. His raw texts are riddled with lexical and syntactical errors. His punctuation, like his capitalisation, is as faulty as it is inconsistent.” Anyone who has to mark assignments by preliterate students will have suffered such profligate errancy – and while not every duff essay is a Mein Kampf, it can be difficult not to feel you’re at the mercy of “a posturing autodidact who seems to have no difficulty believing the utmost drivel”.The afterlife of Hitler’s dreadful, poisonous, ill-written book is possibly the most disturbing: it still sells in shed-loads throughout the world. Not so Chairman Mao’s Little Red Book, the mass production of which once threatened to overwhelm China’s printing presses – it, together with the humongous amount of drivel attributed to the Great Helmsman (mostly written by dependable henchmen), ended up in landfill. Perhaps the critical verdict on the dictators described in these pages – variously lynched, shot and otherwise extemporised to death – should make us a little more sanguine about their literary efforts. After all, it’s one thing for your books to be remaindered – quite another to have your body pulped.Kalder borrows the central conceit of Kafka’s story In the Penal Colony to characterise the full horror of dic-lit: like the ghastly machine that executes transgressors by inscribing their crimes on their living flesh, the books of demagogues as various as Enver Hoxha and Ayatollah Khomeini have been enactments of torment, rather than literature in any normal sense. Which rather counts against Kalder’s urge to finger literature itself for the mass murdering of the last century. True, all writers do indeed have dictatorial inclinations – how else can we rule effectively over our papery realms? But as he points out, all good writing depends on accepting the inherently chancy nature of the world – whereas all despotic governance, like all bad writing, is predicated on the exact opposite: a near-psychotic need to enforce hard-backed conformity.• Will Self’s latest novel, Phone, is published by Penguin.

Are they fun and environmentally friendly – or a dangerous nuisance?Electric share scooters have taken over Santa Monica, an affluent beachside city on the edge of Los Angeles, but as they swiftly spread across other cities in California and the US a backlash is already gathering force.Download an app, scan a scooter’s barcode and away you go, zipping at up to 15mph to your destination. You leave the scooter on the pavement for the next rider.Bird, a startup run by former Uber executives, launched the scooters in Santa Monica last September. Hundreds were deposited around the city overnight, the devices so ubiquitous people literally tripped over them.They have thrilled, bemused and aggravated – feelings San Francisco, San Jose, Austin and Washington DC are now experiencing as scooters from Bird and two other startups, LimeBike and Spin, hit their streets, with dozens more cities due to receive them this year.A full-scale backlash is under way in San Francisco, where some scooters have been tossed into trash cans and lakes. The city attorney has threatened to impound scooters, calling them dangerous, unlawful and examples of tech arrogance. City hall is exploring ways to regulate the devices. With a global market in their sights, the scooter startups are pushing backBird comes armed with $115m (£80.3m) in investment funding and seems to take the Uber-esque, hard-charging stance on regulation that it is better to seek forgiveness than permission. A tangle with Santa Monica officials earned a criminal complaint and hefty fine.“The demand is huge. We’re looking to reach more than 50 markets this year and eventually have Birds all over the world,” says Stephen Schnell, the company’s vice president of operations, noting that Britain is on the company’s radar. “We try to pick cities that have bicycle lane infrastructure.”Schnell, like Bird’s CEO Travis VanderZanden, previously worked at Lyft and Uber.Ride sharing companies are shaking up urban transport but many commuters still have the “last mile” problem: a distance too far to walk and too short to drive, says Schnell. “This is a way to get people out of their vehicles.”Marlon Boarnet, an urban planning and spatial analysis professor at the University of Southern California, says dockless scooters can facilitate short trips while being light on the environment and using minimal space.“Traditionally we view this as walking or bicycling, but the concept can and should be extended to light and small powered vehicles like electric scooters. One could also include in this set small neighborhood electric vehicles or electric motor assisted bicycles. We should expand our idea of what an acceptable ‘short trip’ vehicle is.”Boarnet hopes the companies and city authorities can resolve issues such as where the scooters are left. When clumped in the middle of a pavement scooters can seem more nuisance clutter than transport revolution.The boom and bust of dockless bicycles in several markets – exemplified by a picture of a bicycle graveyard in China – act as a cautionary tale.  scooted around Santa Monica for a week to try them out. The longest journey was from the city’s downtown to Bird’s headquarters in Venice, three miles away. It took 17 minutes and cost $3.55 – a $1 base fee plus 15 cents per minute. The experience was positive. Scooters were easy to find with the app’s map pinpointing devices left by trees, parking meters, benches and doorways.Once you’ve scanned and unlocked the barcode with your phone there’s a childlike glee in kicking off with your foot, pushing the handlebar’s throttle button and gliding down the street.Not encased in a shell of metal and glass, you feel connected to your surroundings – both hands are needed to steer so it is difficult to text or fiddle with your phone.Tootling down Main Street, the most striking impression was the response of pedestrians, cyclists, skateboarders and motorists: in most cases there wasn’t one. In September the scooters were a novelty and drew stares. Now they’re part of the streetscape and barely remarked upon – except by some tourists who gawk and take pictures.Bird reports quick adoption there are more than 50,000 regular riders in and around Santa Monica, and riders in San Francisco notched up more than 60,000 miles in just 17 days. “It’s kind of amazing,” says Schnell. What’s amazing, say critics, is the irresponsibility of the scooter companies and many of their riders. Few wear helmets in Santa Monica. It is common to see children riding scooters, two people on one scooter, parked scooters cluttering sidewalks and moving scooters scattering pedestrians on sidewalks. San Francisco residents have joined Santa Monicans in venting on social media.Riders are supposed to be licensed drivers, helmeted and are meant to ride on streets, preferably in bicycle lanes. Users need a driver’s licence to download the app and upon request Bird sends free helmets. Still, improper use abounds. According to a city spokesperson, so far Santa Monica has recorded 11 accidents, some serious, 328 citations and 694 traffic stops.Irked that Bird launched with little or no warning, city authorities filed a criminal complaint over lack of business licences and vendor permits. Both sides settled in February, with Bird promising to seek the licences and to pay more than $300,000 in fines.“Even though they got off to a rocky start we didn’t move to kick them out because based on our values we’re really committed to this new model of mobility,” says Anuj Gupta, Santa Monica’s deputy city manager. There has been no detectable impact on car congestion but scooters are now part of the transport mix, he says. “We honestly understand and share in the excitement about these devices.”But there’s another concern. If Bird and rival startups plant scooters on every block won’t people have even less incentive to walk and exercise? “You mean WALL-E world,” says Schnell, referencing the Pixar film in which future humans become obese gluttons ensconced in padded floating arm chairs. “Let’s hope not. With the scooters at least you have to stand.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a03d486a11092510177b8eafbe9eeb6750bf6899/0_0_5120_3074/master/5120.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b2b398d21ee89d4046fd440f5c199b51","title":"can you be socialist and rich google","story":"In the mid-20th century, a socialist movement began to develop in many parts of colonial Africa and the Arab world. In Arab countries, the goal of the socialist movement was, broadly, liberation through fighting imperialism, opposing the ruling classes and fighting for social justice. The social-economic component, although important, was seen as directly related to the wider issue of nationalism and freedom from colonial masters and their associated domestic elites.The movement, although successful in galvanising disparate members of society, was often scorned by socialist ideologues for not adhering strictly to the tenets of socialist thoughts, as these were countries that still had not reached such a level of industrialisation and capitalist exploitation that dialectical materialism required. Socialists were also smeared by conservative elements as elite saboteurs. The more radical aspect of Arab communism was its commitment to secularism, and that became the most effective way to delegitimise socialist parties: “communist” became synonymous with “atheist”, and in turn “unbeliever”. This was such a successful smear that someone simply could not be a socialist without having their religion questioned.The suggestion that you cannot have socialist values without dressing in hessian and self-flagellating whenever you buy a latte (the latte socialist is the new champagne socialist) is not only absurd: it has a clear intent, which is to undermine socialist values by making the impossible demand that one’s actions adhere to one’s political convictions at all times.It would be like attacking capitalists for giving money to charity. Imagine not just scrutinising the property prices and private-school expenses of left-leaning politicians, but sending photographers with long-lens cameras to snap grainy photos of Conservative MPs surreptitiously throwing some coins in a street beggar’s bowl. Imagine a headline: “SNAPPED – the Conservative politicians giving YOUR money to charity”. It just doesn’t happen, does it?Sure, latte socialists are annoying. We all know one. Those who prefer to tweet about homeless people rather than actually set up a direct debit to a homeless shelter or do some volunteering. People to whom socialism is a personality trait, along with a tattoo and a gap year teaching brown kids to use as a Facebook profile photo. But that’s not because their wealth makes it impossible to enact socialist values in even the most nominal sense, it’s because they’re narcissists.But socialism isn’t about making you give up your money or pursue affluence. It is, at its core, about making life fairer and accounting for structural scaffolding that rigs the system in favour of the few. It doesn’t mean the erosion of the inidual, an endangered species according to conservatives.So abhorred is the collective to those on the right that even the Windrush scandal, in an impressive feat of contortion on the part of Jacob Rees-Mogg, can be attributed to socialism. “The Windrush issue came about because the state put the interests of the collective ahead of those iniduals who had come here perfectly legally prior to 1973, and … it was more convenient for the Home Office to make them prove who they were and show their papers. This is socialism.” According to this definition, standing in a queue is socialism.When you cut through the worthiness of it, if that’s not your thing, looking out for the collective good is ultimately rooted in inidual self-interest. A society where inequality is extreme cannot be policed effectively. Think of post-apartheid South Africa. White families had to build entire fortresses and compounds to protect themselves against what they viewed as a now feral black population unleashed from the necessary apartheid shackles. It does not occur to those rich people that apartheid is what created the hazard, effectively creating two separate societies so unequal that conflict and a forceful redistribution of wealth was inevitable.When large parts of society do not have the access to employment, and no safety net that guarantees them basic healthcare, shelter and nutrition, things start to break down. This is not to suggest that theft is justifiable, but that to hoard resources and expect the poor to starve in submissive dignity is just a little bit unrealistic.And yet it is socialists who are always accused of being unrealistic, of not making enough allowance for human nature. For not understanding that the money must come from somewhere – and I don’t see you, O virtue signaller, who I spot is carrying quite an expensive smartphone, giving yours up. Call yourself a socialist?Well, yes. In a way, asking if one can be a socialist and rich is like asking whether a women can be a feminist and a stay-at-home mum. Believing in a political or social value does not mean living your life like a monk, dedicating every minute to the cause. But it does mean that there must be some way in which the ultimate purpose of feminism or socialism, which is to further the cause of equality, is advanced. It doesn’t matter how small, inconsistent or dissonant with your lifestyle to the naked eyes this effort is, as long as it means there is a gentle pressure on the scales to tip in the right direction.The historian Bernard Lewis (typically scornfully) stated: “Nobody seems to have a good word to say for Arab socialism. Commercial, professional, and middle-class elements bring against it the usual complaints which are brought against socialism in western countries. Leftwingers dismiss Arab socialism with contempt as a half-hearted and inefficient compromise which has the merits neither of socialism nor of capitalism.”But the movement presented a strong cadre of anti-colonial activists and post-independence politicians who, even if ideologically inconsistent and hailing from an elite, contributed incrementally to the liberation movement. They also drank a lot of coffee in street cafes, which was spun by their political establishment enemies as the pastime of indulgent, pontificating armchair critics. So go ahead and buy that latte: you are part of a noble tradition."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b2c1b013a04df74a5992b5e7a005ba688459817/0_133_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=772253530f62a5d215879e67b08e23b8","title":"incels violent misogyny toronto facebook","story":"A Facebook post supposedly from the killer claimed support for ‘incels’. We ignore this online poison at our perilOn 6 December 1989, a misogynist who claimed he was “fighting feminism” shot dead 14 women, mostly engineering students, at Montréal’s École Polytechnique. I won’t use the murderer’s name. These men want us to use their names.The women were Geneviève Bergeron,\u0026nbspHélène Colgan, Nathalie Croteau, Barbara Daigneault, Anne-Marie Edward, Maud Haviernick, Maryse Laganière, Maryse Leclair, Anne-Marie Lemay, Sonia Pelletier, Michèle Richard, Annie St-Arneault, Annie Turcotte and Barbara Klucznik-Widajewicz. They were pioneers – paving a path for themselves and other women in male-dominated fields, facing sexism every day, proving anyone who thinks that women can’t do maths wrong with each successful semester. That is why they were murdered.Reporter Shelley Page, then just 24, was sent to the scene. In a soul-searching piece written on the 25th anniversary of the massacre, Page reflected: “Looking back, I fear I sanitised the event of its feminist anger then infantilised and diminished the victims.” She remembers respected Canadian journalists refusing to admit that the massacre was an act of violence against women. She describes her editors’ worry that, as a woman, she wouldn’t be objective in her reporting. She recalls racing around trying to find details to humanise the murderer she critiques the media’s drive to find any reason besides misogyny for the tragedy.On Monday night, a man who apparently claims to be part of the “incel rebellion” allegedly rented a van and drove along a 2km stretch of pavement on Toronto’s Yonge Street. Incels are an online community of “involuntarily celibate” men who hate women. The attack killed 10 people, predominantly women, and injured at least 13 more.Moments before the violence, the killer appears to have posted to Facebook about overthrowing “Chads” (good-looking, promiscuous men) and “Stacys” (women who sleep with Chads). He also praised the Isla Vista murderer: a misogynist who, in 2014, released a 137-page manifesto before going on a stabbing and shooting spree in California.I use the phrase “appears to have posted”, because, although both Facebook and the lead homicide investigator on the case have confirmed that the post appeared on the killer’s Facebook page, it is possible that in the immediate aftermath of the massacre a troll hacked his account, posted the text, then backdated it.I know this is possible, because, though it seems unlikely, this explanation has been widely proffered as a caution not to start banging feminist drums. While unfounded rumours that the attacker was a jihadist mushroomed across social media, the significance of his apparent affiliation with an online misogynist group has been shushed and spun out of focus. Almost 30 years after the École Polytechnique massacre, we must continue to find any reason for violent misogyny besides violent misogyny.It’s vital that we keep feminist analysis central to the conversation surrounding the Yonge Street massacre. Why, when men tell us that hatred for women is the root of their violence, don’t we believe them? The École Polytechnique murderer, the Isla Vista murderer, the Yonge Street killer: these were misogynists by their own evidence. If we refuse to look for the common denominator, if these events are always going to be framed in terms of the perpetrator’s mental health or childhood trauma (which, yes, I know, are also often factors), then we can’t confront the radicalisation at the root of it all.Talking about the violent misogyny that is likely behind the Yonge Street massacre means delving into an online world that is so stupid and facile that it’s difficult to take seriously.Here goes: incels are men who can’t get laid. They semi-ironically beatify the Isla Vista murderer. They believe that women are only interested in men who are rich and good-looking. They call women “roasties” because all that sex with Chads has made their labia look like roast beef. Roasties let Chads slap them around the bedroom while they act unattainable and pure to poor, short, weak-chinned incels. (The fact that this ideology is easily disproven by, you know, looking out a window and seeing men of all sizes, shapes and levels of attractiveness hand-in-hand with their partners does not seem to intrude on the incels’ fervour.)There’s a jokey, ironic-or-is-it tone to incel boards, a tone that Angela Nagle analyses productively in her book Kill All Normies. Sometimes, the posters themselves don’t seem to know whether they’re being serious or not.Incel boards have reacted to the Yonge Street massacre in different ways, but incels.me has users declaring the date of the attack “an absolutely glorious day”, celebrating the death of D’Amico, and hoping that there’s more violence to come. These spaces are puerile, yet they normalise violent misogyny and have the potential to radicalise socially isolated or vulnerable men. Some of the users are in it for the lulz some of them are not joking. The latter become the Umpqua Community College murderer, the Isla Vista murderer, the Yonge Street killer. There’s a pattern here, and we can’t keep ignoring it.In the weeks to come we’ll learn more about the killer’s mental health, about his childhood, his education, his work, his social relationships. These are important windows on to the tragedy. But if involvement in misogynistic online communities is indeed part of the picture here, we need to resist any narrative that would push this into the background. Hatred of women is not a mental illness it is a widespread and dangerous social problem. It is a problem we need to address before more people die.• Emer O’Toole is assistant professor of Irish performance studies at Concordia University, in Canada"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6dc290766f67856cd7aa8654551630d223b172be/299_0_4841_2904/master/4841.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a7aaa32f693bd287f13bd1018874478d","title":"muslim ban makes americans especially this one less safe","story":"The ban is detrimental to a large subset of Americans with no real benefit for the rest of the countryIt took nearly dying from cancer for Maziar Hashemi to see the brother who may be his best hope of survival.For Hashemi, an American citizen suffering from blood cancer, a bone marrow transplant from his brother, Kamiar Hashemi, an Iranian citizen and perfect match, may save his life. However, after months of waiting and applying in person at the US embassy in Armenia, Kamiar’s application was initially denied on the state department website. Even Kamiar’s bone marrow cells couldn’t cross the border, thwarted by US sanctions on Iranian exports when Be the Match, a US-based nonprofit organization, hoped to facilitate delivery of the cells to the US.Maziar faced the real likelihood that his only chance of recovery would fail to overcome the hurdles imposed by the Trump administration’s third and latest travel ban.The Muslim ban harms American families and puts lives at risk Maziar’s is just one case. Thousands were torn away from their families and await the results of a supreme court hearing on the administration’s ban scheduled for Wednesday. Americans separated from their spouses, siblings, parents, and children face little hope of being reunited. As executive director of Iranian Alliances Across Borders (IAAB), an organization that empowers young Iranian Americans, and as a citizen whose family sought refuge in this country, I will be speaking out on the issue, including outside the supreme court hearing.Thanks in large part to the efforts of Maziar’s immigration attorney, Mahsa Khanbabai, and after garnering media coverage and the support of his congressman, Kamiar was finally granted a US visa on 29 March.But the Hashemi family’s story of success is rare. While the state department reports that 375 waivers have been approved since the ban on entry for iniduals from eight countries, including Iran, an exclusive report by Reuters suggests that the number of waivers granted was actually two, as of 15 February.Waivers are eligible to anyone who would face “undue hardship” from being denied entry, whose entry “would not pose a threat to the national security or public safety”, and who “would be in the national interest”. Unfortunately, the process by which waivers are reviewed and granted is vague.Jonathan Smith, legal director of Muslim Advocates, explains: “While this data is staggering, it unfortunately affirms what we’ve known: the waivers process is a farce that does not provide anyone with a meaningful path to entering the United States … It’s clear that these waivers, purported to be the only way for anyone from the banned countries to enter the United States, are just a sham meant to trick the American people.”Hundreds of families in the US face the same struggle of separation as our plaintiffs. The ban has already cost many to lose their right to an education, jobs, homes and ruined planned reunions for holidays and milestones.The Hashemi family’s rare success story highlights what many of us already know: we are fighting for our humanity in America long after we overcame the hurdles to earn citizenship. It should not require one of us nearly dying for our rights to be protected as Americans.Certainly, proponents of the travel ban argue that it protects Americans and is critical to our national security. However, more than 130 former defense and foreign policy experts declare the opposite in a signed letter, saying the ban does “weaken US national security and undermine US global leadership”. Signatories, including veterans from multiple former administrations, say that “America’s much admired compassion and openness are sources not of weakness but strength. These qualities accord with the ideals on which our nation was founded, and on which our greatness rests”.In reality, the ban is detrimental to a large subset of Americans with no real benefit for the rest of the country. Instead, many of us find ourselves at odds with an administration as it attempts to deny our rights as Americans and refuses any responsibility for us as citizens. And in our current climate, the ban stands as a legal justification for the hatred and violence threatening us. It is important that all Americans pay attention to the April supreme court arguments and subsequent ruling that could, as in Maziar’s case, mean life or death."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ff056944b3ca2e4c133ad297fbbe191b0f65da5/0_412_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=401b68feb97750902f20700d8c19e639","title":"school good food not just posh kids poorest town oldham","story":"Should you ever need cheering up, I can recommend 11am at Stanley Road primary in Oldham. That’s when lunch starts for the youngest children and it is pure excitement the kind you used to have when horizons were short, days were long and nothing else needed bothering about. First comes the babble of voices, far bigger than the little bodies that follow, swaddled in plump anoraks despite the sun outside. They take crockery, these four- and five-year-olds who, back in September, didn’t know how to hold a knife and fork – and get down to the serious business of\u0026nbspchoosing.Behind the counter stands Sheena Fineran: black hat, big specs, magenta polo and, after 30 years as a dinner lady, in complete mastery of her domain. “When I started, it was lumpy mash. It was liver. It was cheap, fried, nasty food.“Today we’re the best.” Oldham’s school meals are high quality, wholesome and prize-winning. “What I see now – that’s what I’d give my family.”Almost everything in these serving trays has been cooked from scratch this morning in the school’s own kitchen. That roast chicken comes from one of 14 birds that Fineran came in at 6am to roast and strip, singeing her own fingers as she did so. The fish cake is baked with catch certified by the Marine Stewardship Council. More options are laid out here than in most office canteens I’ve visited and, from the carrots up, as much of the food as possible is organic and locally sourced. Then a boy far\u0026nbspshorter and shyer than the rest reaches the front of the queue.A whisper comes back: “Pineapple.” “I bet there’s some hiding,” laughs a colleague, and Fineran bustles off to root it out.Any council would be proud of serving meals that prompt children to present teachers their cleaned-out plates as if they were sports day trophies – but to see what makes this daily ballet such a vast achievement you need to contrast it with those carrying lunchboxes.From one, a boy of seven pulls out some kebab and processed cheese. A few tables down sits a girl chewing stiff chicken nuggets. Others turn up with cold toast or last night’s chips.Some children come to school on an empty stomach and go home to no supper. Headteacher Rebecca Howarth runs a breakfast club and makes sure they get double lunches, even though it comes out of her shrinking budget. “We’ll find some way to do it. You can’t have children going hungry. I can’t.”In 2016 the Office for National Statistics found Oldham to be the poorest town in England . In some of its neighbourhoods, a boy born today can expect to die soon after he hits 70. His counterpart raised just off London’s swanky Brompton Road would be forecast to live until he is 96. In one of the richest societies in human history, something as simple as being born into the wrong class in the wrong town can knock more than 25 years off your life.As mementoes of its industrial, radical past, Oldham has some beautiful redbrick buildings. What it lacks is cash. While Fineran and I are chatting, one of her colleagues comes over to ask whether it’s true that Theresa May is going to scrap free school meals for the under-sevens. When she hears not, her relief is like the sun breaking through clouds: her own boy starts reception this September.What are poor children worth? What do they deserve? The official answer is everything, just like every other child. The reality is that hundreds of thousands of children across Britain go hungry now. Headteachers report grey-skinned pupils “filling their pockets” at the school canteen, while London GPs treat youngsters with that Victorian disease caused by poor diet, rickets.Yet in Oldham the school dinner service runs on the principle that those who have the least also deserve the best possible. It delivers that within very tight budgets, spending a rock-bottom 65p on food for every meal and charging a mere £2.10.Even Jamie Oliver, who almost single-handedly killed the Turkey Twizzler, has sighed: “Feeding your kid right is all considered very posh and middle class.” Yet here it is, happening in the poorest nook of England – and not in some bijou cafe serving 20 foodies and their Instagram accounts, but a municipal office with 86 school kitchens dishing out 17,000 meals a day. Without a council subsidy, the service has to pay its way and it competes with the likes of Compass, also tendering for local school\u0026nbspcontracts.Has you or your community come up with answers to doing things differently? If so we\u0027d like to hear from you.\u0026nbsp Share your stories\u0026nbspvia this form\u0026nbspand we\u0027ll be in touch.\u0026nbspYou can share your experiences anonymously. We’ll include some of your stories in our reporting.So what’s the magic formula? Whoever you ask, it comes down to two words: Anne Burns. Head of Oldham’s school dinner department, she’s also “a force of nature”, says public food academic Kevin Morgan. Visitors from Manchester mayor Andy Burnham’s office, who want the rest of the area to learn from Oldham’s example on school meals, tell her: “If only we could cut you up into pieces and spread you around.”Anyone slicing into Burns would immediately find two things: an expertise on food and a love of animals. Having done school dinners for 40 years, since training as a cook aged 16, she abhors “ping meals” and “plastic food”. When “Jamie started shaking the tree” and campaigning for better school meals in the middle of the last decade, he found a ready audience in the recently-promoted Burns.On the office noticeboard is a page from Chat magazine headlined “Saved by my dog!” It tells the story of how, early one morning three years ago, Burns began spewing blood and mucus before passing out. Only her sleek brown weimaraner, Alice (one of her six dogs and seven cats at the time) brought her round by licking her face and smacking her with her paws. Rushing her into hospital theatre, the surgeon declared: “I should be signing your death certificate.”She needs that toughness, arguing for better food in a council that can always find uses for spare money and is staffed largely by men in suits. As if to exemplify their outsider status, she and her team of women, with 125 years’ catering experience between them, work out of a bungalow plonked next to the town hall. It’s a Cinderella\u0026nbspservice, as school catering is across the country, but as she tells her team: “Tonight, girls, Cinderella’s off to the ball!”More profoundly, Burns is a public servant who looks, sounds and understands the public she serves. Born just down the road in Rochdale, she still lives there – and in over four decades she’s only ever worked for two local authorities. Mum a housewife, dad a painter-decorator who, at 80, still does the odd job. The family home had no phone, but when she remembers her “normal working-class” childhood, it’s of camping all summer long and cricket matches that lasted weeks. She wasn’t raised to be second best, nor does she expect it of the children she feeds.“Those kiddies are our future,” she says. “They’re the most important people. Without them, where do we go?” Contrast that plaintiveness with the high-flier who hops from council to consultancy and whose main job is to tell the residents who pay his salary how terrible their lifestyles are and how their homes need to be replaced with luxury flats.When Burns began altering her menu, by far and away her department’s main supplier was Brakes. Yet the giant multinational was far too big to accommodate the diet fads of some new manager at a town council. Organic wholemeal flour? Brakes was never going to keep a pallet exclusively for Oldham’s use.Which left a gap in the market for small independents, such as TC Meats. Walk into its offices and you’re in no doubt about the chief topic of conversation. Above the factory is a shrine to Manchester United’s Wayne Rooney that presumably doubles as a workplace: a giant poster hails ‘The Maradona of Manchester’, a signed shirt is on the wall, and his neon-yellow boots sit in a glass box on the boss’s coffee table. Some faceless conglomerate this is not.TC Meats sorted out Burns with organic beef and milk and, after a bit of phoning around, it also found a farm selling organic eggs. And why wouldn’t they make the effort? Unlike at Brakes, TC Meats needs Oldham for a big chunk of business. Together with a fruit and veg distributor in Preston, these two relatively local firms have taken a far bigger share of Burns’ budget – while she knows exactly where her produce is coming from. The depth of those partnerships means that Burns can sometimes lean on her suppliers to keep her costs within budget.This is localism with a small “l”. It keeps public money close to home and uses it to grow the local economy and it’s why Morgan describes Burns as “a heroine of public-sector innovation”.For Burns, it’s a choice made not out of ideology but pragmatism. “When the horsemeat scandal came, I slept soundly in my bed,” she says. “We don’t serve stuff from the other side of the world. We know exactly where it comes from.”At Stanley Road primary, Fineran and her team are dishing out for the 10-year-olds. Do the students really care whether their potatoes are organic or their fish is sustainably sourced? “For me, it’s an expense for them it’s an education. We’re giving these kids a good start here,” says Fineran.“I see them come in aged four and go at 11, and it’s an absolute joy to see them doing brilliantly in maths and\u0026nbspEnglish and socialising. It’s like watching my children. It’s an achievement to which I’ve contributed a small part.“We’re deprived – but we’re not.”• Aditya Chakrabortty is senior economics commentator for the Join Aditya below the line at noon (BST) today (Wednesday 25 April) for a special discussion of this piece and the Alternatives series."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0394e7c40126085879289e828deed1196e0630a6/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2126e6a9e2013db0d760ada484b63e6c","title":"biggest style secret designer meghan markle royal wedding dress","story":"With less than a month to go until the royal wedding, speculation is mounting, with Stella McCartney, Erdem and Christopher Bailey among the runners and ridersThe London-based label designed by thirtysomething Australian couple Tamara Ralph and Michael Russo is the odds-on favourite. Britain’s only haute couture house would be a patriotic choice with a full-service couture atelier handily situated close to Markle’s Kensington home. What’s more, the aesthetic – think superyacht glamour – has the requisite scale for the cathedral proportions of St George’s Chapel. January’s haute couture show closed with a wedding dress in double-faced duchess satin with a draped sweetheart bodice embroidered with Swarovski jewelled leaves, grand flounced skirt with pearlescent micro beads and scalloped lace veil. A semi-sheer black gown by Ralph \u0026amp Russo was the most eyecatching look in the couple’s portfolio of engagement photos. A “well-placed source” has apparently been briefing the press from the atelier that there is “talk of lace”, possibly the least revealing revelation in bridal fashion history. The duo have “declined to comment”.The woke choice. The strongest statement Markle could make would be to emphasise ethics with a sustainable, ethically sourced and made gown by Stella McCartney. When I interviewed her last week, McCartney definitely did not deny being The One. (On the other hand, having your name on lists like this one is good PR, so why deny it, even if the phone never rang?) Markle has worn Stella McCartney several times, including the caped gown she chose for the Queen’s birthday party at the weekend. Plus, the McCartneys are, in a way, British royalty. But while McCartney has made wedding dresses, including a corsetted gown with a long train for Madonna’s Scottish castle wedding in 2000, she is not really known for frills or romance. Her sleek, streamlined aesthetic is a more natural fit for Markle’s everyday wardrobe than for a wedding day. Very possibly a contender for a slinky gown for the evening reception.A persistent outlying rumour links Christopher Bailey, the outgoing Burberry designer, with the wedding dress. Bailey has a longstanding relationship with Markle, having dressed her character on Suits. “I wear a lot of Burberry on the show because Rachel’s whole aesthetic is someone who comes from money and has a real classic design sensibility,” Markle has said. Points in favour: Burberry is a marquee name of British fashion the fashion industry would be utterly charmed by a royal swansong for the universally liked Bailey he is a discreet, mature character who could handle the palace and be trusted to keep a secret. Burberry is known for trenchcoats, not fairytale glamour gowns, but Lily James’s inky red-carpet showstopper at February’s Baftas was by Burberry. So you never know. Backstage after Erdem’s most recent London fashion week show, he explained that his inspiration this season was Adele Astaire, Fred Astaire’s sister, who married into the British aristocracy. Later that day, at a fashion week reception at Buckingham Palace, his long-term client the Duchess of Cambridge made a beeline across the room for a chat. So I did ask, obviously, but he just giggled and raised his eyebrows. Make of that what you will. Erdem has Canadian connections in common with Markle, who lived in Toronto for six years. She has also worn Erdem’s clothes for years, choosing a printed maxi-dress for a wedding she attended with Harry in Jamaica last year. The recent expansion of Erdem’s small London team has added fuel to this fire. Aesthetically, this would be the most fashion-forward choice. Last year, he took the young Queen Elizabeth’s meeting with Duke Ellington at a jazz club as a starting point for a catwalk collection of rewired, quirky royal glamour. A charteuse silk gown with a tulip shaped skirt featured dense black embroidery and three outsize red silk bows at the breastbone, worn with flat mules and a quiff. Two words: Norman Hartnell. The logic against Sarah Burton creating a spectacular Alexander McQueen gown for the royal wedding is that Burton created a spectacular Alexander McQueen gown for the last royal wedding seven years ago. But history shows that this does not rule Burton out. Norman Hartnell designed the Queen’s wedding dress in 1947, and her sister Margaret’s in 1960. A second dress commission would strengthen the ties between the royal family and Alexander McQueen, perhaps the most iconic British fashion label of modern times. The royal family set a lot of store by trust, and Burton did an exemplary job both of designing the dress and of not breathing so much as a word about it. The “Fab Four” of William and Kate plus Harry and Meghan is a compelling new framing of the royals, and this would give it an elegant symmetry."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf2efb32b8b3a8d33b7738b308f467303a524006/162_51_2595_1557/master/2595.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c96b3fcace4b7a0f613703f76ba9ac9f","title":"football alex oxlade chamberlain injury world cup russia liverpool roma champions league","story":"• Liverpool midfielder taken off during 5-2 win over Roma• Jürgen Klopp: ‘All the medical department are concerned’Jürgen Klopp fears Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain’s fine debut season for Liverpool is over after the midfielder suffered a knee injury against Roma that threatens his involvement at the World Cup.Oxlade-Chamberlain was taken off on a stretcher in distress during the Champions League semi-final first leg victory following a 15th-minute challenge on Aleksandar Kolarov, his right knee appearing to give way as he tackled the former Manchester City defender.The extent of the England international’s injury will not be known until later in the week but the Liverpool manager said the club’s medical team did not expect him to play again this season.

The tournament was a huge success thanks to the efforts of the players promoting the women’s game on and off the pitch. The authorities watched in amazement at the continent’s overwhelmingly positive reaction.Brazil won all their games en route to a seventh title. The chemistry between the experienced Marta and Cristiane, who have played together since they were teenagers, was the catalyst, while Formiga, in her 23rd year wearing the yellow jersey, commanded the midfield, with veterans aided by the younger players such as Bia and Monica.In seven matches, 13 Brazilians scored, a sign of their squad depth. The success of Brazil surprised no one all of their squad play professionally in leagues across the world, whereas their opponents, for the most part, do not make a living from football.Brazil’s dominance stems from an immense pool of talent, often developed abroad, and decades of work at grassroots level, something the other nations are having to play catch-up with. Officials banned women’s football from 1941 to 1981, to protect them from the ‘dangers’ of the sport. Despite that, women continued to play in secret.They have since faced a battle to create stable leagues and garner resources from their federation. Their dominance in the Copa América is not down to national investment in the women’s game nor the federation’s support. Cristiane’s public retirement last year arrived with a letter from players to the federation, painting a damning portrait of mistreatment.This Copa América was the most exciting, a tremendous achievement considering most of the 10 teams were “inactive” less than two years ago. The momentum of collective protests and new initiatives laid the foundations for the game’s revival.Chile defeated Argentina 4-0 on Sunday to secure a remarkable second-place finish in the final stage’s four-team group. Chile’s players were buoyed by hosting the tournament and it sends the country to the Women’s World Cup for the first time. After years of disarray, Chilean players formed a union in 2016. The first of its kind in the region, Anjuff (The National Association of Women’s Football Players) created alliances with the male players’ union, NGOs and clubs.Chile bid for the Copa América in the hope of creating a new fanbase for women’s football there. Although initially upset that the tournament would not be held in the national stadium in Santiago, the women recognised the opportunity to connect with the provinces, playing at two grounds in the north-west of the country. For the first time the entire tournament was televised, the team prepared thoroughly and attendances were impressive. Camila García, a FIFPro board member and founding member of Anjuff, believes there is a great appetite for the sport on the continent.The final match between Chile and Argentina pitted two teams against one another who have suffered similar problems. For most of the players, Sunday’s game was the most important of their lives. Chile’s defensive line was stoic, led by the goalkeeper and captain, Cristiane Endler, and the centre-back Carla Guerrero. Argentina face a play-off game against a team from Concacaf to qualify for the World Cup in France next year. While disappointed, they have no reason to be ashamed.Brought together a few weeks before the tournament, Argentina were unable to count on much support. Six months ago the team held a strike because their training fee – less than £9 – went unpaid. Yet from the start they showed determination, with convincing wins over Bolivia and Ecuador. In their first match, Soledad Jaimes adapted a gesture from the men’s game during her goal celebration. Jaimes cupped her ear, to say: “I can’t hear you paying attention.” The team took the symbol for their group photo.Colombia, who have appeared in the previous two World Cups, went home disheartened with a fourth-place finish. They started well and Catalina Usme was the tournament’s leading scorer. In the final phase they lost steam and missed the leadership of their injured captain, Natalia Gaitán.Colombia had reasons for optimism. This year marked the inaugural season of the country’s professional women’s league. Following a defeat by Brazil on Sunday, journalists were quick to criticise the squad, with El Tiempo’s sports editor describing their performance as “inexcusable”. It seems hardly fair given that the team went nearly a year without a coach and faced superior competition.Even those who exited early expressed their enthusiasm for the tournament. Ecuador’s Suany Fajardo registered surprise at the level of play and the organisation, saying: “Whichever team will go on to the World Cup, I think they’ll make a good run at it.” The Uruguay forward Sindy Ramírez agreed: “This tournament was quite competitive, it shows women’s football is on the rise and getting the attention it deserves.” Ramírez’s team-mate Yamila Badell expressed delight at full stadiums and saw it as a testament to previously unfulfilled potential.It is easy to bemoan the state of women’s football in South America, but it is an image the players want to move away from, with or without the help of the governing bodies. They are willing to sacrifice their financial well-being and their bodies to represent their countries. Despite innumerable frustrations, most describe the experience as a dream come true. Hopefully their national associations and Conmebol, the regional federation, are listening. The message is clear: get on board, or get out of the way."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/100af4f4a9dcbd8f6a589ad2285337a534a36533/518_116_4954_2972/master/4954.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6c48e144d9f30d5c75368e6e73d6b183","title":"majestic mohamed salah liverpool roma champions league semi final","story":"Reds’ talisman broke the back of his former club before Roma hit back with two goals as he caught his breath on the benchTen minutes before half-time on a wild night of Champions League football Mohamed Salah did perhaps the best thing so far of the many wonderful things contained in his dreamy first Liverpool season.By that stage Anfield was in one of those periods of constant uproar, jiggled and tickled and dragged into a state of intoxication as Liverpool battered away at Roma without drawing breath. It is no secret this Liverpool team play in surges, moments when the day seems to turn a shade of deep red and when the front three become a whirl of malevolent action.But this was something new. Liverpool and Salah did not just accelerate away from Roma, they eviscerated them, almost but not quite killing a semi-final that remains, somehow, in the balance.Liverpool were relentless in those periods, shaking and ragging Roma in their jaws like a terrier with an old leather slipper. Of five Liverpool goals in the space of 35 minutes Salah scored two and provided assists for Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mané.Roma pulled back two late goals with Salah off the pitch to make it 5-2 and raise memories of the way they came back at home to knock out Barcelona. Another 3-0 win would do the job this time too. But then, Roma will also have to face Salah again, with bruises still fresh from a beating that came in high-speed waves.Salah was that rare thing, an athlete at the top of his profession finding new heights, new levels. There may be a more breathtakingly brilliant attacking performance in Europe this season but, given the game and the stage, there has not been one yet.For the PFA Premier League’s player of the year this is elite territory, the kind of performance that ends up on stage in Zurich draped in a terrible tuxedo holding a golden bauble and beaming with that rare glaze of sporting ultimacy.It began with the most vital of all his many beautiful goals this season, one of those moments when the game seems to stop. Salah took the ball inside the penalty area found himself with a tiny pocket of space. With a shift of feet he looked up and produced with no real backlift a shot that did something extraordinary, the ball seeming to hang under the lights, generating a strange moment of hush as it arced under the bar before crashing down over the line.It was the first cut in a sublime 15-minute spell for Salah. Best of all it came after a bitty, angsty start. For the opening quarter this had been a different kind of match as Roma’s calmness on the ball, their physical power and the loss of momentum caused by a serious injury to Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain took the crackle out of the air.Liverpool found their ignition in the 26th minute, sparked by a hacking foul on Mané. At which point: welcome to the Red Zone. It was Salah who provided the assassin’s eye but this was a team surge, a spell of pure, fast murder ball. First Mané missed a glorious chance after some lovely deft work by Firmino. And steadily Salah began to skate in from the left-hand side, playing now in his own clear pool of light, isolating Juan Jesus as Roma left their centre-half to face an unwinnable one on one.The goals were coming, hammering at the walls, moaning through the keyhole. If that thumping shot to make it 1-0 brought Anfield to its feet, the finish for Salah’s second before half-time was something different. Again it was Firmino with the sweet approach play, on a night that left Salah up there with Cristiano Ronaldo as the top scorer in the Champions League this season. But this time Salah’s finish was a caress, a dink over Alisson that drew coos and gurgles in among the roars.What to say about him now, in a season that just keeps on soaring up through the clouds? It is easy to forget this was a pointed occasion for Salah personally, newly crowned as the player of the year and now facing the biggest club game of his career against his former employers: unarguably the star, against an opponent forewarned and prepared.In the event the Salah Spring just keeps rolling, with 22 goals and nine assists in his past 19 starts since Boxing Day. More significant than the numbers is the spectacle, the basic joy in Salah’s free-running interpretation of the inside-forward role, a combination of preternatural quick feet, a computer of a creative brain and the rare ability in modern football simply to make the game up in front of him.Salah was too much for Roma as he has been for so many others this season. Defensive jitters may have let Roma back in towards the end but Liverpool will travel to Rome with confidence. Jürgen Klopp has spoken about the need for everyone to join “the train”, for the whole team to push it along together. The Olympic Stadium will be a moment to yank the throttle hard once again, to keep that machine driving on right to the end."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4cb37829b41d7c2b7351eec83b618c48161dcecb/178_565_3977_2387/master/3977.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=435164010ea70cb56898654ad0f8b056","title":"leeds united myanmar tour dallas tornado","story":"By the time you read this column, ideally, it will have been overtaken by fast-moving events involving Leeds United and the Myanmar regime accused of ethnic cleansing and multiple human rights abuses. However, at the time of going to so-called press, Leeds had delightedly announced they had booked a two-match tour of Myanmar, with planned friendlies in Yangon and Mandalay. The games were due to take place shortly after the domestic campaign ends, with the players apparently “very excited for the chance”. As rewards for a season go it tends toward the idiosyncratic, though some Leeds fans may have judged it much deserved.As the club’s managing director, Angus Kinnear, put it: “Myanmar is one of the fastest-growing nations in south-east Asia and is passionate about English football.” Yes. It’s not everyone’s top line about Myanmar these days – but I guess Angus isn’t playing Family Fortunes. Instead his survey said: “They have ambitious goals for grassroots and elite football development that we are delighted to be able to support. This tour gives us an opportunity to meet new fans of football who will hopefully support our journey back to the Premier League in the coming years.”Quite a leap, there. Still, you have to admire how the Premier League makes everything about itself, one way or another. Absolutely nothing can resist its tractor beam. Meanwhile if you’re wondering “why Myanmar?” it turns out the Leeds owner, Andrea Radrizzani, owns a telly rights package in the region.Even so, students of the news cycle may predict this tour will soon be abruptly cancelled – an eventuality which no one without the internet could have foreseen. It will serve as a reminder that modern football is essentially a never-ending game of four-dimensional chess, with clubs expected not simply to navigate the Championship or wherever they play, but to have a vague idea of which countries in the world are being accused of ethnic cleansing or even genocide. Clearly some are struggling to adapt to these new and complex expectations.And yet, were there hints Leeds missed? Almost immediately after announcing the news, the club sent a second communication, reading: “More information on travelling to Myanmar will be released shortly and we advise supporters to wait for further advice.”Arguably advice was already out there, what with the Foreign Office website offering comprehensive warnings on travel to Myanmar. Among other pointers, this advises avoiding “all large gatherings”, describes terrorism as likely, and mentions something called Zika Virus, which turns out not to be a potential midfield signing. The headline issue, however, is the ethnic cleansing of the Rohingya, which a tour might be viewed as legitimising.Then again this is an age where people are constantly required to decide on which source of information to trust. Clearly there are some who are always going to cling to legacy information sources such as the Foreign Office or the UN. But others will increasingly prefer a fearless alt-source. Faced with the choice between the FCO and Leeds for a verdict on the situation in Myanmar, they’d go with Leeds every time. As would Aung San Suu Kyi, I imagine.Speaking of whom, Leeds’ apparent failure to have a clue about the local situation is arguably the most eyebrow-raising Myanmar muddle since Suu Kyi claimed listening to Dave Lee Travis had been her lifeline in years of house arrest – only for it later to have transpired she’d confused DLT with Bob Holness. (Still, what goes around comes around – it turned out the rest of the world had confused Suu Kyi with a decent person.)Anyway it is a tribute to the malarial atmosphere of modern football that such a tour could be suggested and get as far as being booked before questions intervened. It may yet be one of the most eye-catching cultural tours of Burma since Rambo pitched up in the eponymous 2008 movie, with the aim of rescuing some Christian missionaries.Much has changed since then of course – but if only Sylvester Stallone could be persuaded to undertake one final tour of Myanmar. I’ve heard he can be quite handy as a goalkeeper, which may be of interest to Leeds, having had some bad luck in this department of late.Ultimately though, it would still not be the most completely boggling football odyssey. The big one is surely a pre-season tour by the US soccerball side the Dallas Tornado in 1967, where they managed two draws in Vietnam (far from the worst US results in the country at that time). Indeed the Vietnam stops were only part of a 49-match, 27-country, seven-month world tour which also saw the Tornado being stoned in Singapore – with actual stones, not cannabis – and missing a plane from Athens which was later blown up by Greek Cypriot terrorists.There’s a wonderful account of the tour on what is now the FC Dallas website. We’ll play out with the bit where half the side end up marooned overnight in a “jungle hut” between the Pakistan-India border without food, water or visas. They eventually barter footballs and shin guards for some and are finally led to safety when their guide cuts a hole through the border fence in the dead of night.“We truly expected to get shot, or even worse, get attacked by a tiger or some other wild dangerous animal,” reflected one of their number 50 years on. “What a sight it must have been. Eleven young, scared to death soccer players wearing their Texas cowboy hats and carrying their suitcases, entering India through a fence hole.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2690fddec0a3929c31f24d2cab62a2be9bdbeca2/0_0_2200_1320/master/2200.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a5c3bf4811da74e1d62f40d206d8d446","title":"un united nations staff pension fund firms rights abuses","story":" investigation reveals $64bn fund includes investments in companies involved in bribery and major environmental damageThe United Nations is facing calls for a full review of its staff pension fund after the  uncovered that it has around a billion dollars invested in companies whose activities are or have been incompatible with core UN principles and programmes.Established in 1948 by the UN general assembly, the fund provides retirement, death and disability benefits to employees. At present it has 203,050 beneficiaries and a market value of $64bn (£45bn), of which nearly $1.5bn is invested in 24 publicly traded companies. Many of those companies have been or are being prosecuted for corrupt practices, implicated in human rights abuses or in environmental catastrophes.“These investments clearly undermine the credibility of a well-respected organisation,” said Thomas Küchenmeister, managing director of Facing Finance. “How can I promote sustainable development and the protection of human rights and simultaneously benefit from violations of these?”Three years on from the study, Amnesty and other groups said little had been done to clean up the pollution, while further claims are ongoing over the continuing contamination caused by the spills. Shell insists it is following international best practice in its operations in Nigeria.Barnaby Pace, from Global Witness’s oil, gas and mining team, told the  that “as a global leader”, the UN must invest responsibly and “leverage its investment positions to demand that all companies it invests in … embed robust anti-corruption measures in practice”.“This will help ensure UN investments are not wasted in companies that compete on bribery instead of quality and allow public money to line the pockets of kleptocratic elites,” said Pace.HSBC was fined a record $1.9bn in 2012 for what US prosecutors described as wilfully flouting sanctions, allowing at least $881m in drug money to pass through its Mexican branches. Also in 2012, the US Justice Department extracted $3bn from GlaxoSmithKline, in which the fund holds $78m of shares, after the pharmaceutical giant pleaded guilty to failing to report drug safety data, misbranding drugs, and marketing anti-depressants not approved for use by minors to children. The firm was fined $490m in China, where it was found guilty of bribing doctors and hospitals to push products.Küchenmeister said there was some irony as the UN was a driving force behind the authoring of the “six principles for responsible investment” (PRI). The PRI have at their heart environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG). Last year the UN staff pension fund was awarded an A+ PRI rating. However, an analysis of the fund’s top 10 biggest shareholdings by leading ESG ratings agency Sustainalytics categorised them as either of “significant controversy”, or “high controversy”. The ratings reflect “impact on the environment and society”, as well as the degree to which they suffer from ESG issues.Ian Richards is one of 11 staff representatives on the UN pension fund’s board. He told the  that when the board met with the secretary general’s representative in charge of the fund’s investments in March, it voiced concerns about lack of oversight. “Everything with the UN is quite complicated but that doesn’t prevent us having a closer look at this,” he said. “We don’t want to find that our pensions are being paid from companies that go against the values that we’ve been working for all our careers.”A spokesperson for the UN secretary general, António Guterres, said that while the fund does not comment on specific investments, it “does not believe there is a conflict between its fiduciary obligation to its beneficiaries and core UN objectives”.They added that the fund “addresses ESG concerns by explicitly prohibiting investments in the tobacco and armaments sectors”, and its policy is built around the belief that: “By deploying an active voting and engagement policy which supports NGO initiatives and communities, the fund can more effectively impact positive and sustainable change consistent with our mission.”But Peter Frankental, director of Amnesty’s UK’s business and human rights programme, said there should be a full review.“These revelations are troubling, because the UN cannot distance itself morally from the activities of its staff pension scheme to which it contributes financially, even if this is an independent body run at arm’s length,” he said, “The secretary general should install a council on ethics that decides on the exclusion of companies from investment which violate human rights and environmental norms and standards.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/64d3f626f051c012c8abec247c6de924eaa74bd9/0_1511_3316_1989/master/3316.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2d5b47b7061e90c42e07df2dda196f1e","title":"complaint upheld over times story about london girl fostered with muslim family","story":"Council wins ruling from press watchdog over claims in story also picked up by Daily MailThe Independent Press Standards Organisation has upheld a complaint against the Times over its coverage of the fostering placement of a young girl in east London.Notice of the ruling by Ipso was published on the front page of Wednesday’s print edition.In August last year, the Times reported that a “white Christian child” had been left distressed after being placed with two Muslim households in Tower Hamlets over a period of six months. However, the initial claims soon proved to be a one-sided account, as further details emerged, including that the girl’s grandmother – with whom she was ultimately to be placed – was a Muslim and did not speak English.Tower Hamlets council complained about an article on the front page of the newspaper’s 30 August edition – the third front page dedicated to the story that week – in which the newspaper implied that a judge had ruled against the council by ordering that the then five-year-old girl be removed from the Muslim household and placed with her grandmother. In fact, the council had requested that the girl be placed with her grandmother.Under the headline “Ipso upholds complaint against Times”, the paper said the press regulator had ruled that the article breached rule one of the editors’ code of practice, which concerns accuracy.The Muslim Council for Britain (MCB) said the Times should be forced to apologise for its coverage, which it said had pushed an “inaccurate, misleading and bigoted narrative about Muslims”. It said the ruling was “too little, too late”.The Ipso ruling, which was published in full on page two of the newspaper, called the article a “distortion” of the issue. “Ipso’s complaints committee found that the article gave the impression that the judge had found that the placement was a ‘failure’ by the council and that this was why she was ‘removing’ the child from her current foster carers, and placing the child with the grandmother. The committee ruled that this was a distortion,” the ruling said.“The impression given by the article was that the judge’s decision represented a finding against the complainant’s assessment of the child’s needs in organising the foster placements. This was not what the court had decided, or an implication of what the court had decided.”However, the press watchdog did not find that the Times’s omission in the article that the child’s grandmother also had a Muslim background amounted to a failure to take care over accuracy.The furore surrounding child AB, as she was known in court documents, was prompted by a front-page article in the Times headlined “Christian child forced into Muslim foster care” on 28 August. According to confidential local authority reports, a social services supervisor had described the child crying, asking not to be returned to one foster carer because “they don’t speak English”.The report included a pixellated photograph of the girl in the company of a woman, said to be her foster carer, wearing Islamic dress.The Daily Mail picked up the story on its front page the following day under the headline: “MPs’ anger as Christian girl forced into Muslim foster care.” The former Mail Online columnist and commentator Katie Hopkins tweeted an image of the front page, asking: “Which inidual at Tower Hamlets was responsible for the abuse of this little girl?”The Daily Mail and Mail Online did not have a photograph of the girl at the heart of the case. Instead, they used a stock picture of a Muslim family to illustrate the story in print and online. But they altered the image to cover the woman’s face with a veil.Khatun Sapnara, a family court judge, took the rare step of publishing a court order that contained details contradicting the original reporting of the case.The child’s maternal grandmother was revealed to be a “non-practising Muslim”. It emerged that the grandmother did not speak English, with the order saying she required a translation of the document. The grandmother also expressed a desire to “return to her country of origin and care for the child there”.Miqdaad Versi, who leads the MCB’s work on media reporting on Islam and Muslims, said: “While Ipso’s ruling on this shameful incidence of anti-Muslim reporting is welcome, their response thus far has been too little, too late. The note on the front page is welcome but cannot be considered even due prominence given this story was on four front pages.”It is understood that the foster carers at the heart of the case were left distraught and upset by the reports, and Tower Hamlets council received abusive phone calls.Will Tuckley, the chief executive of Tower Hamlets council, said: “We felt it was important to make the complaint to defend our foster carers and protect children in foster care, along with standing up for our erse communities.“From the start, we had significant concerns about the validity of the allegations about the foster carers. For example, one allegation was that they did not speak English, even though that is a prerequisite for any foster carers.“An investigation into all the allegations in the Times article later found them to be unsubstantiated.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a0048af1bc0dadc548bacac8ae85be277ad46eae/0_296_5114_3069/master/5114.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=59c080ddc155c6729ba139932aa1e706","title":"comcast launches rival 22bn sky takeover bid","story":"US broadcasting and cable TV giant enters bidding war with Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century FoxComcast has gatecrashed Rupert Murdoch’s takeover of Sky with a rival £22bn offer, sparking a bidding war for Britain’s biggest pay-TV broadcaster.Comcast has made its move on Sky after having an offer for 21st Century Fox’s entertainment assets, which include Sky and the Deadpool to the X-Men Hollywood studio 20th Century Fox, spurned by Murdoch last year.Murdoch agreed a $66bn (£47bn) sale to US rival Disney but this has been held up, as Fox’s own deal for Sky continues to be scrutinised by the UK competition regulator over issues including media plurality concerns. Comcast, which has 1,300 employees in the UK, including the production company behind Downton Abbey, made a number of pledges including to keep Sky’s HQ in Osterley, south-west London, and guarantee the editorial independence and funding of Sky News for at least 10 years.“We are determined to be responsible and trusted owners of Sky,” Brian Roberts, the chairman and chief executive of Comcast, said. “We understand and appreciate the value of news and are committed to protecting the important role that Sky News plays in providing a high-quality impartial news service.”The company also said it would not look to acquire a majority interest in any UK newspaper for at least five years, a shot at the Sun and the Times owner Murdoch whose takeover bid is being scrutinised over concerns that taking over Sky News would give him too much control of UK news media.Earlier this month, Disney “expressed an interest” in buying Sky News – regardless of whether its takeover of Fox and Sky is successful – in an attempt to help solve the plurality issue that is slowing up Murdoch’s bid and see off Comcast.While 21st Century Fox said it “remains committed” to its offer for Sky and is “considering its options”, analysts believe Murdoch is essentially out of the picture.“Murdoch is out of this now, there is another kingmaker in Disney, he will pick up the phone and solicit a higher bid as Fox is now worth a lot more in total,” Alex DeGroote, an analyst at Cenkos Securities, said.“The Independent Committee is mindful of its fiduciary duties and has consistently sought to maximise value for all shareholders,” Sky said in a statement.“It’s derisory, far too low, bids for Sky must start at a minimum of £15-plus, putting its value at over £27bn,” he says. “Sky’s independent directors can’t accept Comcast’s offer, I don’t know any Sky shareholders that would now entertain a £12.50 offer, it is not plausible.”Comcast said taking over Sky will result in savings of $500m annually “with only limited impact on headcount expected”.In February, Comcast, which said that it can complete a deal for Sky by the end of this year, announced its intention to mount a rival bid. “We have long believed Sky is an outstanding company and a great fit with Comcast,” Roberts said. “Sky will be our platform for growth across Europe. With its 23 million retail customers, leading positions in the UK, Italy and Germany, and its history of strong financial performance, we see significant opportunities for growth by combining our businesses.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/165594c0a018e5bc8fd44af1d6f1e0afe783a7f1/0_259_4368_2621/master/4368.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=89b37447697d392ce493954db0ee14b2","title":"help to buy agency writes down loan on flat over grenfell style cladding","story":"Woman whose London flat has slumped in value is told she can pay back £10,000 of £95,000 loanThe government has agreed to virtually wipe out a help-to-buy loan on an apartment in a London block with cladding similar to that used at Grenfell Tower, it has emerged.It will make the write-down on the grounds that the value of the flat in Greenwich has been reduced from £500,000 to £50,000 because the developer has no plans to remove the cladding. The concession raises the prospect of multimillion-pound losses for the government scheme on any flat that goes into negative equity. This is because, unlike high street mortgages, help-to-buy loans can be redeemed on the sale value of the property rather than the value of the original loan.Homes England, the agency responsible for the loan, wrote to Cecile Langevin last week to say it had agreed she could pay back her loan at the knock-down valuation. She recently got her flat revalued in light of the cladding issue and discovered that it had collapsed in value. The developer and freeholder Galliard is locked in a legal dispute over the cladding and has no immediate plans to remove it. Langevin wrote to Homes England in March to ask if she could now pay back the loan at the current value and, after some delay, it has now responded to say that under the rules this is possible. “Homes England has now determined that you may proceed with the redemption of your help-to-buy equity loan based on the valuation provided … ie at a market value of £50,000,” it said in a letter.Homes England declined to comment on Langevin’s case but said: “Every case received by the Homes England mortgage administration team is considered on its own merits and will take in to account the local circumstances of each building. We will allow redemption of a loan if it is within the rules of the scheme.”A charity that is campaigning for leasehold reform in the UK to liberate home owners from onerous contracts with freeholders said it was time the government took action forcing the removal of such cladding. Martin Boyd, a trustee at Leasehold Knowledge Partnership, said: “The leaseholders in cladding flats have faced a huge amount of stress and worry over the last 10 months and have now seen their homes massively devalued. If the government is also going to suffer by having to write down these help-to-buy loans, it might finally encourage the sector to help develop a more workable solution. It’s not just the private and shared owners impacted by this problem.”He said social housing landlords would also be experiencing significant devaluation on their properties, which could put them in breach of their loan covenants.

The hearing comes 22 months after the first complaint was made against Wadsworth, who challenged Smeeth at a the launch of Shami Chakrabati’s inquiry into antisemitism, accusing her of working “hand in hand” with the media.Labour Against the Witch-Hunt, a campaign group set up to protest against expulsions, turned out to support Wadsworth at the hearing in Westminster. Several people shouted: “Free Palestine,” as the MPs walked past.Berger said the MPs who had joined Smeeth were “looking for action” against antisemitism. “Warm words are nice, but in and of themselves they are not enough, and that’s why we’re here with our colleague Ruth Smeeth. She has an incredible amount of support,” she said.MPs said they had decided to support Smeeth because she had initially been told by the party she would be responsible for her own security walking to the hearing. Labour MP Wes Streeting, who organised the delegation to accompany Smeeth, said: “I was proud to see so many Labour MPs and peers from across the party – including shadow ministers – accompanying Ruth this morning in a show of friendship and solidarity. But no victim of abuse should ever have to walk through a protest against them to give evidence to a hearing. It is an appalling state of affairs.”Other MPs accompanying Smeeth included prominent backbenchers Stella Creasy, Jess Phillips, and Margaret Hodge, alongside Smeeth’s fellow Stoke-on-Trent MP Gareth Snell. Also there were fthe ormer child refugee Lord Dubs and the chief executive of the Holocaust Memorial Trust, Karen Pollock. Creasy said other MPs were likely to need similar support at future hearings. “No one should go through something like this in the movement they dedicate their lives to fighting for – sadly more MPs may be likely to need support in many more hearings like this in the coming months,” she said. Labour MP Chris Williamson, a former shadow cabinet minister, also attended the hearing as a witness supporting Wadsworth.Speaking outside the hearing, Wadsworth said he was not antisemitic and that he had endured “almost two years of trial by media”. He added that much of the reporting around his case had been incorrect. Asked whether he thought he would get a fair hearing, he said: “I reserve my view on that.”Smeeth will be cross-examined by Wadsworth’s legal counsel, which he has crowdfunded. The charges against him, which he denies, are that he brought the party into disrepute, rather than charges of antisemitism, which was not a specific charge in the Labour rulebook at the time of the alleged offence. Before the hearing, Labour attempted to respond to continued criticism from Jewish leaders – who expressed disappointment at the outcome of a meeting with Jeremy Corbyn on Tuesday – by setting a July deadline to deal with the majority of complaints over antisemitism.The meeting resulted in renewed criticism of his leadership on the issue. The party has now pledged to complete most outstanding investigations, including the high-profile cases of Ken Livingstone and Jackie Walker, by July. A team of lawyers is already working on a backlog of 80 other cases.There was more controversy on Wednesday morning over reports that Williamson, a Corbyn ally, was planning to share a platform with Walker, who was suspended over allegedly antisemitic comments in 2016.The shadow secretary of state for international trade, Barry Gardiner, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that people were “innocent against proven guilty”, but added: “My own view, my personal view, is that Chris is wrong to share a platform with somebody who has expressed the views that she has.” The chair of the Jewish Leadership Council, Jonathan Goldstein, and the president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, Jonathan Arkush, said Tuesday night’s two-hour meeting with Corbyn and others from the Labour party, including the general secretary, Jennie Formby, had failed to address longstanding issues, even though they had been set out well in advance.Goldstein, in an interview on the Today programme, accused Corbyn of a personal lack of leadership, and a refusal to take on a small part of the Jewish community that claims that many of the allegations are fabricated. Gardiner acknowledged that the party had been slow to act, but said action was now under way."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e671900cb96e7d38124f0da231d870eade2a80e9/0_0_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a087a7ac5a40cd0875b8e7f9fc3ff0a4","title":"pmqs may corbyn david davis amber rudd windrush questioned by commons brexit committee politics live","story":"Rolling coverage of the day’s political developments as they happen, including Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn at PMQs, Amber Rudd giving evidence to MPs on Windrush and David Davis giving evidence to MPs on BrexitPMQs - Snap verdict: For many listeners that may have been a confusing PMQs to follow, because for much of it Corbyn and May appeared to be talking at complete cross purposes, but there was no escaping the fact that May was dodging legitimate and awkward questions about the impact of her policies as home secretary and Corbyn successfully had her wriggling. He repeatedly asked why she ignored warnings about the impact her “hostile environment” strategy would have on Windrush generation migrants, and she couldn’t answer. Instead she more or less ignored the points he was making and kept trying to bring the exchanges back to the issue of illegal immigration, not legal, Windrush-era immigration. It may well be the case that there is more public support for May than Labour MPs (or  readers) would care to admit when she says the public do want to see government crack down on illegal immigration. And Corbyn’s firm questioning took a slightly odd turn right at the end, when he threw in a surprise call for Amber Rudd’s resignation at the end of an exchange that had focused on May’s own culpability. But, overall, May was very much on the defensive and her efforts to defend herself against Corbyn by quoting Liam Byrne and Yvette Cooper against him was a strategy doomed to failure. You won’t find “controls on immigration” mugs on sale at Labour HQ anymore, and there is a very good reason why Cooper is no longer shadow home secretary. Corbyn can’t be held to responsible for Labour immigration policy pre-2015 he opposed it as strongly as anyone.Corbyn says May in 2013 said she wanted to create a really hostile environment for migrants. He says there would be no compensation if it were not for campaigning by Labour MPs. He says the withdrawal of legal aid made it harder for migrants to challenge government policy. Can May tell us the hostile environment is over and the immigration targets will be scrapped?May says the Windrush generation are British. Dealing with those people who are here illegally is different, she suggests. She says in 2013 the then shadow home secretary, Yvette Cooper, said much stronger action was needed by government to bring illegal immigration down. She repeats the point about the Windrush generation being legally. She says the public want government to deal with illegal immigration.Corbyn says we are talking about the climate created by May when she was home secretary. She knew full well the problems she was creating. Amber Rudd said last week the Home Office sometimes loses sight of the inidual. But we know know she wanted tighter rules. The current home secretary has taken a policy and made it worse. Isn’t it time she took responsibility and resigned?May says up and down this country people want the government to take action against people here illegally. The government wants to help those here legally. We welcomed the Windrush generation. We need to ensure they remain here. But the government also needs to take action against people here illegally. If Corbyn wants to talk about fairness, let’s look at what Labour would do. It would tax people and destroy jobs. It is not a Labour government that would be kind to anybody.Corbyn says May ignored warning from Labour MPs about the impact her policies would have on Windrush generation migrants.May says these people have a right to be here. But they were not documented, she says. She says Corbyn is talking about policies aimed at people here illegally. The Windrush case relates to people here legally. She quotes various measures taken by Labour to crack down on illegal immigration.Corbyn says May want to get away from the Windrush migrants issue. She says the Equality and Human Rights Commission warned about the dangers of the Immigration Act. Will May review the legislation?May says this is a generation that came here prior to 1973. She accuses Labour of ignoring the facts. The government is not ignoring the problems facing the Windrush generation. The Home Office has set up a taskforce to help them. The government will give them citizenship recognising their citizenship. The problem is that prior to 1973 these migrants were not given documents.Jeremy Corbyn also congratulates the Royals and comments on Stephen Lawrence. Institutional racism must be driven out wherever it occurs, he says.Turning to the Windrush generation, he says there is a lack of trust. Can he confirm those denied work and benefits will be fully compensated?May agrees with what Corbyn said about stamping out racism “in every form”.On Windrush, she repeats the offer made by Amber Rudd on Monday, summarising the proposals announced. There will be a compensation scheme, she says. Everyone can see - the Labour benches are shaking their heads, she says - people know the Windrush generation are British.Corbyn says it is not an act of generosity to give people rights that are theirs.He says an internal Home Office memo from when Theresa May was home secretary talked about creating a hostile environment and the possible dangers. Why did May ignore them?May quotes someone talking about the need to create a hostile environment for illegal immigrants. It was Liam Byrne when he was a shadow immigration minister. He is now on the Labour front bench, she says.May says she is pleased to have reached an agreement with the Welsh government on the allocation of devolved powers after Brexit. It is disappointing the Scottish government does not agree, she says.Gavin Robinson, the DUP MP, asks about economic aid for Northern Ireland.May says this is an important issue. The government has made several commitments to city deals in Northern Ireland, she says. She says she looks forward to seeing new proposals. But, without a Northern Ireland executive, there are issues to resolve.Theresa May starts by congratulating the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge on their baby.And she says MPs will want to make the anniversary of Stephen Lawrence’s death.Here are the main points from David Davis’s evidence to the Commons Brexit committee.The referendum was not primarily decided on economic matters. It was decided on control of our own destiny. That was what it was really about. We do not see full alignment as harmonisation, we see it in outcome terms. What we are looking for is a recognitionstrokeoutcome alignment.The biggest area is almost certainly agriculture. We may well see changes over time, slowly in agricultural regulation but at no point are we aiming to see a reduction in our animal health standards for example … So we expect to have alignment to “as good as” and “recognisable as good as” ...Commenting on this, my colleague Lisa O’Carroll says:The phrase amounts to a linguistic rebranding of Britain’s disagreement with the EU over how to avoid a hard border requiring checks on live animals and food stuffs in particular. British agricultural regulations are widely expected to change if the government succumbs to pressure from the US to do a deal that includes agriculture, raising the prospect of chlorinated chicken and hormone-injected beef to be sold in Northern Ireland. The EU has already told the UK it will not agree to future regulatory ergence model in Ireland. It has also said as it cannot police farms and food processing and pharmaceutical plants in third countries, ergence is not a viable solution. In negotiations, people try to set up deadlines - sometimes artificial deadlines - to put pressure on an element of the negotiation which they think is in their favour.He said he agreed with the Irish taioseach, Leo Varadkar, who said that a good agreement in October was better than any agreement in March.If you can tell me how to write an unamendable motion, I will take a tutorial.When asked if the government would respect the decision if MPs voted for an amended motion, he implied it would. He said:The government is unlikely to put a vote to the House which it doesn’t intend to take properly seriously.But, when asked what would happen if the Commons voted for an amendment saying the government should go back to Brussels to try to negotiate an alternative deal, he played down the prospect of this succeeding. He said:I’m not going to give advice on how to create circumstances which may undermine the government’s negotiating position. I’m not entirely sure how much force a government sent back with its tail between its legs by parliament would have in such a negotiation.I do not expect the solution to that to be extension of membership of the customs union. I would view that on my part as a failure.A delegation of around 40 Labour MPs and peers marched Jewish MP Ruth Smeeth to give evidence at an expulsion hearing against an activist accused of berating her at the launch of Labour’s anti-semitism inquiry.MPs including shadow environment secretary Sue Hayman, the former shadow Northern Ireland secretary Owen Smith, and Jewish Labour movement chair Luciana Berger, formed a protective ring around Smeeth as she entered the hearing on Wednesday morning.Labour activist Marc Wadsworth will have his case heard by Labour’s national constitutional committee, a quasi-judicial body that has the power to expel members from the party. The hearing comes 22 months after the first complaint was made against Wadsworth, after he challenged Smeeth at a the launch of Shami Chakrabati’s inquiry into anti-semitism, accusing her of working “hand in hand” with the media.Labour Against the Witch-Hunt, a campaign group set up to protest against expulsions, turned out to support Wadsworth on Wednesday morning at the hearing in Westminster, shouting”Free Palestine” as the MPs walked past. They had invited supporters of Wadsworth to come dressed as witches.MPs said that they had decided to support Smeeth because she had initially been told by the party she would be responsible for her own security walking to the hearing.Berger said the MPs who had joined Smeeth were “looking for action” and Smeeth had “an incredible amount of support.”Labour MP Wes Streeting, who organised the delegation to accompany Smeeth, said the range of MPs supporting Smeeth, including shadow ministers, would send a message. “No victim of abuse should ever have to walk through a protest against them to give evidence to a hearing. It is an appalling state of affairs.”Other MPs accompanying Smeeth including prominent backbenchers Stella Creasy, Jess Phillips, and Margaret Hodge, alongside Smeeth’s fellow Stoke-on-Trent MP Gareth Snell, as well as the former child refugee Lord Alf Dubs and the chief executive of the Holocaust Memorial Trust Karen Pollack. Speaking outside the hearing, Wadsworth said that he was not anti-semitic and said he had endured “almost two years of trial by media” and said much of the reporting around his case had been in correct. Asked if he thought he would get a fair hearing, he said: “I reserve my view on that.”Smeeth is expected to give evidence for around two hours and will be cross-examined by Wadsworth legal counsel, which he has crowdfunded. Q: Will the process for EU nationals be an application process or a registration process?Davis says it will be an application process. But there will be an appeal process for people turned down.Hobhouse says a registration process would be better.Davis says he will write to the committee about this.Hilary Benn asks for an assurance that EU nationals will not get the same treatement as Windrush migrants.Davis says he has given speeches saying the treatment of EU nationals is a moral issue.Q: Earlier you spoke about number plate recognition in relation to Ireland. You are not proposing cameras on the border, are you?No, says Davis. He says he was just referring to what is already there.Benn ends by saying having Davis allocate just 90 an hour and a half for the session was not satisfactory.And that’s it. I will post a summary soon.Q: A lot of the Brexit legislation seems to be stalled. Are you “winging it”?Davis says the government is not “winging it”, but the situation is changing as the process goes along.He says, in the EU withdrawal bill, the government has just agreed to a “sifting committee” that will ensure important secondary legislation gets more scrutiny.Q: You said earlier that there may be some disagreement between the UK and the EU over the “option C” for Northern Ireland (“regulatory alignment”). You talked about outcome alignment. What do you mean?Davis says the UK is focused on outcomes. Agriculture is the biggest area. Agriculture regulation may well change. But the UK does not want to see a reduction in animal health standards or animal welfare standards.Q: And are the EU pushing for the UK to keep the same regulations?Davis says, in effect, the first proposal from the EU wanted to keep the UK in the single market. He says this is an issue to be thrashed out during the negotiations.Hilary Benn asks when Davis actually has to leave.Davis says he has to be at a meeting at 11. He can stay until 10.50, he says.Jeremy Lefroy, a Conservative, goes next. He says in the City people are particularly worried about contracts and data.Davis says a lot of work is going on in relation to contracts. And data is an even bigger issue, he says.Q: What will the government do if the Scottish government withholds legislative consent from the EU withdrawal bill?Davis says the government is still trying to resolve this dispute. He describes himeself as “almost a fifth columnist in this government in terms of promoting devolution”. He says he hopes there will be an agreement. Talks are still going today. He says 5pm is the deadline for amendments in the Lords.Q: What will the government do if legisalative consent is withheld?Davis says he will not speculate on that.Q: That is encouraging. Theresa May is quoted in the government as saying the Scottish government can take it or leave it, in regard to what has been offered. You are saying talks would continue.Davis says he is not party to what is going on. He is just saying he hopes there will be an agreement.Q: What was the best result from the negotiation on the transition?Davis says it was the concession on signing trade deals he mentioned earlier.

In one house an old man was smashed on the skull so that he fell into the fire in the open hearth, where his body was charred to the bone. In another a teenage boy, possibly trying to flee, tripped over a body lying on the floor, and died where he fell.Such an aura of horror clung to the site that when archaeologists went in to uncover the gruesome facts, local people warned them they should keep well away from the green mound within the low stone wall.After three seasons of excavation, with less than a tenth of the site excavated, the team which publishes its findings today in the journal Antiquity, believes they have uncovered evidence of a catastrophic end to the life of the village – “a single event that made time stop – like a shipwreck but on land”.In the mid 5th century Sandby Borg had been a prosperous village built within the walls of a ring fort. After the attack nobody ever came back either to bury the dead, to loot their precious possessions or to take their valuable livestock. The dead – nine in just one house – rotted where they fell, lying in their houses until the roofs decayed and collapsed in on them, or sprawled in the village street, and their animals starved to death in their pens.Scattered among treasures including Roman gold coins, silver gilt jewellery, silver hair ornaments, intricate glass beads and cowrie shells from the Mediterranean, the archaeologists even found scraps of the last meals, including half a herring still lying by a hearth, and cooking pots where they were last set down until crushed by the collapsing roof.Ludwig Papmehl-Dufay, an archaeologist from the team at the local museum, which began excavations after warnings that the site was being targeted by treasure hunters, said that while no written or oral history of the massacre survived, there were persistent stories that it was regarded locally as a dangerous place. “I do find it most likely that the event was remembered and that it triggered strong taboos connected to the site, possibly brought on through oral history for centuries.”The archaeologists hope to return to the site this summer, but after three seasons of excavation have uncovered enough mysteries to keep them busy through several winters.  Stuffed into the skull of one man they found four sheep’s teeth.  Papmehl-Dufay suggests that they may represent a final insult, the opposite to ancient beliefs of placing a coin or other small valuable with the dead to pay for passage to the afterworld, instead a contemptuous curse to prevent it. Nearby they found one bone from a tiny arm, the first evidence that children were not spared.Among all the covetable possessions found among the three houses excavated and the 26 bodies discovered, they found no weapons – they speculate that they may have been taken as trophies, and could still lie dumped as a ritual offering into a nearby bog.Öland is a low island off the Swedish coast in the Baltic Sea, and in the Roman period it was wealthy. The Roman gold coins, and the luxury imports found among the scattered corpses, may represent wages earned fighting as mercenaries. The island has rich archaeology including foundations of more than 1000 stone houses, thousands of cemeteries and graves, and at least 15 ringforts – of which only Sandby Borg seems to have come to such a gruesome end in the turbulent decades when the Western Roman Empire collapsed and local tribes vied for power. The Kalmar county museum has a small exhibition about the site, and hopes to create a larger permanent display on a story which even the archaeologists working on it found uniquely disturbing. Only three of the 53 houses have been fully excavated, but test pits show that many more human remains still lie waiting for their story to be told at last."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3825c7a60c3a20d0082ce87c42bd6fca455b9f8c/948_729_1652_992/master/1652.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5f369d9f6e6ef1316b376bbfbfb3931a","title":"sleeping rough comfortable army exercises tory mp adam holloway","story":"Former soldier Adam Holloway also says street homelessness is being driven by eastern European immigration A Conservative MP and former army officer has said that sleeping rough is “a lot more comfortable” than military exercises, in a debate he led on tackling street homelessness.Adam Holloway, the MP for Gravesham in Kent, told parliamentary colleagues in the Westminster Hall debate on Tuesday that if a person is “able-bodied and sound of mind” there are resources that make it possible to sleep rough.He said begging was also part of the problem, allowing homeless people to make “quite a lot of money”. Holloway, a supporter of the pro-Brexit campaign group Leave Means Leave, also said that a rise in street homelessness was driven by eastern European immigration, claiming that many migrants from that region preferred to sleep rough than pay for accommodation.He said mental illness and drug addiction were “real ingrained problems” behind homelessness that needed to be tackled to solve the crisis.Holloway, who told MPs he had spent a number of nights during the parliamentary recess in February sleeping on the streets as part of a television programme on street homelessness, said: “One observation I do have, if you are able-bodied and of sound mind there are all sorts of services – not quite 24 hours a day – that make it possible to sleep out. “I’m 52, I was in the army to be honest for me sleeping rough in central London is a lot more comfortable than going on exercise in the army.“But if you’re mentally ill or you are old or you are personality disordered then it is a very different thing. Or if you’re drug addicted it is very difficult. We have to accept that some people are able to sleep rough because there are resources to do so.”Holloway’s comments come after research revealed at least 78 homeless people died on the streets and in temporary accommodation this winter, bringing the number of recorded homeless deaths to more than 300 since 2013.Challenged by the Labour MP Laura Smith, Holloway acknowledged that he was not saying “even a large minority of the homeless are there because there are resources for them” but added “we’re going to get absolutely nowhere on this, in solving the problem in getting to the people who are most needy if we just continue to just talk about the homeless and feel sorry for everybody”.He later said there was a link between the scaling back of mental health services and the rise of homelessness. He said in February he took some cardboard to Covent Garden and “bedded down” for the night under the awning of St Paul’s church. The MP said he had first attempted this nearly 27 years ago as a television reporter for ITN’s World In Action. He said that compared with the early 90s, the majority of rough sleepers were “foreign nationals”.Holloway, who faced criticism in 2015 for claiming asylum seekers often holidayed in the country from which they had supposedly fled, said: “As I wandered round as shawls and brand new trainers who were handed out I honestly didn’t hear English being spoken by anybody. I heard east European languages. I heard Arabic. And I heard Italian.”He later said: “If we’re to be honest about the correlation between immigration and rising numbers of street homeless, it’s no surprise to me that 1,950 rough sleepers in 2016-2017 were migrants from Romania, Poland and Lithuania. When people are far from home and familial support structures, homelessness is a much greater risk.“Some migrants do indeed sleep on the streets by choice, preferring to sleep rough than to pay for accommodation.”On the same topic, he said: “On the subject of people from eastern Europe, perhaps it’s time to ask ourselves whether it’s exploitative to build an economy on cheap labour provided by those who can barely afford to accommodate themselves in our country. “Of course you could argue these people are not strictly homeless because they might have a home back home but that’s their reality when they’re here.”Holloway’s claim that the majority of homeless were foreign nationals was challenged by the shadow housing minister Melanie Onn, who said UK-wide this was not the case.Holloway said during his experience on the streets in February he was taken to a hostel in Hither Green, which he said was less comfortable than sleeping rough. “When I left there I was quite relieved, the thought of potentially sleeping days and weeks on the floor in a cramped room between a refrigerator and french windows did not appeal to me,” he said. “I can completely see how if you’re able-bodied and of sound mind it would be much more appealing to sleep under the awning of St Paul’s in Covent Garden because there you have freedom.”Holloway said “people’s generosity can sometimes be as much part of the problem as part of the solution”.“Begging is part of the problem,” he said. “You can make – if you’re able-bodied – quite a lot of money from begging on the streets of London. So generosity of members of the public is a factor in this. Generosity can be enabling.”Holloway did not immediately respond to a request for comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/049608569b2e71db85e48ad0b6ce859044121630/89_10_2818_1691/master/2818.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=72ad6b0f7f9a4dfd9cd89be59bf89e32","title":"brexit blamed record number eu nurses give up britain","story":"UK said farewell to 4,000 nurses and midwives from European Economic Area in past year, with only 800 arrivingRecord numbers of nurses and midwives from EU27 countries quit Britain last year, fuelling fears that a Brexit brain drain will deepen the NHS’s already chronic staffing crisis.A total of 3,962 such staff from the European Economic Area (EEA) left the Nursing and Midwifery Council register between 2017 and 2018. The register tracks who is eligible to work in those areas of healthcare in the UK.“It feels that efforts to boost the number of nurses are being dragged down by a botched Brexit,” said Janet Davies, the chief executive of the Royal College of Nursing.The government’s refusal to detail the rights that the 3 million EU citizens living in Britain will have once the UK leaves the EU in March next year is a key cause of the loss of EU staff, she added. “Nurses returning home, or giving Britain a miss entirely, are doing so because their rights are not clear enough.” Brexit emerged as a key reason why EU-trained staff are stopping working in the UK in interviews the NMC conducted with 3,496 people who left the register between June and November 2017. The NMC figures bear out the much greater difficulty hospital trusts are having recruiting nurses from Europe, particularly from countries where many have come from in recent years – notably Italy, Portugal and Spain.Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, said: “These figures are yet more worrying evidence of the huge impact that the government’s shambolic approach to Brexit is having for our NHS.

A crisis which is putting immense pressure on the NHS as it approaches its 70th birthday,” they write.Saying a raft of measures needed to be introduced en masse to tackle the problem, they say they would support the prime minister if she banned multi-buy offers on junk food, stopped adverts for it before 9pm and online, and prohibited the use of popular cartoon characters and celebrities in ads.Among other proposals, they call for the tax system to be “used to make healthy food cheaper and discourage unhealthy choices both at home and on our high streets”.The leaders also say the levels of sugar, calories, salt and fat in junk food should be lowered overall, while more training should be given to medical staff to help people with nutrition.A government source told the Times many of the opposition proposals were already in the pipeline as part of its anti-obesity drive."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/afdac30bf73cdae6ed00f971ed66f55da780e201/335_565_4688_2813/master/4688.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4ef40e63b6fb401c16096215da0d3bca","title":"london stadium set to miss out on hosting cricket world cup matches","story":"The Olympic Stadium in London looks set to miss out on hosting matches in next summer’s ICC Cricket World Cup.Fixtures for the 10-team, 50-over showpiece, which like the 1992 tournament will feature an all-plays-all group stage leading into semi-finals and the final, are yet to be announced and still need sign-off by the International Cricket Council board.But certain matches have begun to seep out of the ICC’s ongoing meetings in Kolkata this week, with the highly anticipated India versus Pakistan group game reportedly due to meet at Old Trafford in Manchester on 16 July.Both this match and England’s clash with rivals Australia had been tentatively pencilled in to take place at the London Stadium in the hope of filling its 60,000 capacity and setting a record crowd for a cricket match in the United Kingdom.While the proposed outfield at the venue met the minimum boundary sizes for a one-day international, to host cricket would have involved a costly transformation and required a successful test event this summer.But now one official has told the  that at this stage, hosting cricket at the Olympic Stadium during the World Cup looks to be “a thing of the past”.

The goal wasn’t to cut down on the catering bill. It was, like almost everything Amazon does, focused on two aims: efficiency and scalability. The former is obvious. A smaller team spends less time managing timetables and keeping people up to date, and more time doing what needs to be done. But it’s the latter that really matters for Amazon.The thing about having lots of small teams is that they all need to be able to work together, and to be able to access the common resources of the company, in order to achieve their larger goals.“You can add new product lines without adding new internal structure or direct reports, and you can add them without meetings and projects and process in the logistics and e-commerce platforms,” Evans notes. “You don’t need to fly to Seattle and schedule a bunch of meetings to get people to implement support for launching makeup in Italy, or persuade anyone to add things to their roadmap.”Amazon is good at being an e-commerce company that sells things, but what it’s great at is making new e-commerce companies that sell new things. The company calls this approach its “flywheel”: it takes the scale that can smother a typical multinational, and uses it to provide an ever-increasing momentum backing up its entire business. The faster the flywheel spins, and the heavier it is, the harder it is for anyone else to stop it.Perhaps the best example of that approach in action is the birth and growth of AWS (previously called Amazon Web Services). That’s the ision of Amazon that provides cloud computing services, both internally and for other companies – including those that are competitors to Amazon in other areas (both Netflix and Tesco use the platform, for instance, despite Amazon also selling streaming video and groceries).It started, like so many things at Amazon, with an edict from the top. Every team, Bezos ordered, should begin to work with each other only in a structured, systematic way. If an advertising team needed some data on shoe sales to decide how best to spend their resources, they could not email analytics and ask for it they needed to go to the analytics dashboard themselves and get it. If that dashboard didn’t exist, it needed to be created. And that approach needed to cover everything.From there, it was almost an afterthought to take the obvious next step, and let others use the same technology that Amazon made available internally.AWS is large enough that it is dealt with on the same tier as the entire rest of the world. AWS is large enough that Netflix, a company that accounts for around a third of all internet traffic in North America, is just another customer. AWS is large enough that in 2016 the company released the “Snowmobile”, a literal truck for moving data. The companies that work with AWS move so much information around that sometimes the internet simply cannot cope. So now, if you want to upload a lot of data to Amazon’s cloud, the company will drive a truck to your office, fill it with data, then drive it back. If you need to upload 100 petabytes – that’s roughly 5m movies in 4k with surround sound – it turns out there’s no quicker way to do it than driving it down the freeway at 75mph.While AWS saw Amazon open up its internal technology to external customers, another part of the company does the same trick with Amazon’s actual website. Amazon Marketplace launched in 2000, allowing third-party sellers to put up their own wares on the site. The feature has expanded over the years to become a major plank in the company’s quest to be the “everything store” – the one destination on the internet you need to go to to buy anything in existence.Marketplace goes one better than the pizza rule, allowing Amazon to expand into new sectors without needing to employ a single extra employee. The variety of things sold on Amazon is now so huge that its internal computer scientists faced a problem. “E-commerce companies such as Amazon … process billions of orders every year,” a team of Amazon researchers wrote. “However, these orders represent only a small fraction of all plausible orders.” The solution? Train an artificial intelligence purely to generate plausible fake orders, to better guess how to market brand-new products.Increasingly, then, Amazon resembles less a big-box retailer such as Tesco or Walmart, hovering at the edge of town sucking up commerce and killing the local high street, and more a shopping mall: independent retailers can exist, and even make a tidy living, but only if they get a slot in the mall itself – and if they always remember that the real moneymaker is the landlord.Since 2014, Amazon has added a third flywheel to its business: artificial intelligence. The company has always been near the leading edge of the industry, most obviously in its neural-network-powered recommendation algorithms. But, until recently, that approach was scattershot, segmented, and hardly world-class (think of the last time you bought something on Amazon only to have it recommended to you for weeks afterwards. “You like duvets? Why not buy 10 more?”). That changed when the company decided to build the hardware that would become the Echo. In classic Amazon fashion, it started at the end and worked backwards from there, writing a “press release” for the notional future product and then trying to figure out what expertise needed to be developed – or bought – to make it. Need a personal assistant? Buy Cambridge-based True Knowledge, once working on a Siri competitor, and you get Alexa. Require far-field voice recognition, letting you hear people on the other side of the room? Start working on that now, because no one’s really cracked the problem.Institutionally, the bulk of the Alexa AI team still sits under AWS, using its infrastructure and offering another tranche of digital services to third parties who want to build speech control into their devices. But the economies of scale that come to AI are unique. There’s the value to the data, of course: the more people use an Echo, the more speech samples it has to train with, and so the better the Echo becomes. And beyond that, machine learning technologies are so fundamental, and so general purpose, that every advancement Amazon makes ricochets throughout its business, increasing efficiency, opening up new fields, and suggesting further avenues of research.But nothing lasts forever, and even Amazon has its weak points. The two-pizza rule, for instance, may be a good strategy for building an infinitely expandable company, but it doesn’t lend itself to a pleasant, stress-free working environment. Amazon has long faced criticism over its treatment of warehouse workers: as with many companies in its sector, huge valuations and high-tech aspirations sit uneasily alongside the low-paid, low-skilled work that makes the company tick over. Where Amazon differs from companies such as Deliveroo, Apple and Facebook is that the highly skilled employees sitting in the headquarters have almost as many complaints. A New York Times exposé from 2015 described employees crying at their desks and suffering near-breakdowns from the pressure they were put under. The company’s rapid employee turnover is legendary, with insiders describing a sort of Forth Bridge of technical debt: someone leaves, and someone else has to rewrite all their code to make it understandable to the people still there – but by the time the rewrite is finished, the person doing the rewriting has also left, requiring someone else to start the whole process again.But the one thing that’s been true from day one is that Jeff Bezos sits at the top of the food chain, with direct control of a $740bn (£530bn) business matched by few other bosses. It would take a bold gambler to bet against the company right now."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/71316fe786e10dce40aaa2a492f087f4adc390f1/95_35_809_485/master/809.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a18ef68170fe79cd32ff34b3eae49164","title":"google gmail new ai confidential mode features smart replies greater offline access expiring emails improved safety features headline redesign","story":"Smart replies, greater offline access, expiring emails and improved safety features headline Google’s biggest email redesign in five yearsGoogle is implementing the biggest overhaul of its popular Gmail webmail service in five years, bringing a new look, advanced AI-powered features and improved privacy.Two years in the making, the redesign is intended to help Google better compete with Microsoft’s Outlook on the business side and modernise consumer email by bringing features from its Inbox email client into the main Gmail experience.“This is an entire rewrite of our flagship, most-used product,” said Jacob Bank, product manager lead for Gmail, which 1.4 billion people use each month.For consumers, headline features include the ability to snooze emails, as you would with an alarm clock, until a specified time or date, and what Google calls “nudge”, which displays messages with quick reminders that you haven’t responded to certain messages so that “nothing slips through the cracks”.The smart reply feature, found within Google’s Gmail app on smartphones that suggests quick reply phrases based on the content of the email, will also be rolled out to the web. Google said its new AI-powered features required Gmail to be underpinned by its self-developed Tensor processing chips, and that it had also restructured email storage databases, unifying three duelling systems for syncing messages across devices as part of the overhaul.Cosmetic changes also bring Gmail in line with Office, placing Google’s calendar, tasks and note-taking services within the same page as emails and alongside existing instant messaging options.Google has also improved Gmail’s phishing protection, with new, more dominant warnings about suspicious emails, and a new “confidential mode” that allows users to send emails with expiration dates, prevent the forwarding, copying, downloading or printing of emails and revoke previously sent emails. Emailers can also dictate that recipients have to input a one-time password to read certain messages, in an attempt to ensure that only the intended recipient receives the information.How this will work between Gmail and other email systems such as Microsoft’s Outlook or similar remains to be seen, but recent high-profile corporate data breaches have increased the company’s desire to lock down email.While many of the new features will be rolled out to the consumer version of Gmail first, it’s clear that Google’s approach for its email service has changed from consumer-centric to business-centric as it pushes its commercial G Suite products to business. Google is accelerating its efforts to poach business from Microsoft’s dominant Office system of email and apps, using Google Docs, Gmail, calendar and Hangouts instant messaging systems. Analysts estimate G Suite generated about $2bn in revenue last year, 10 times behind Office.One of the things holding G Suite back for businesses has been limited offline capabilities. Gmail now offers up to 90 days of emails offline, allowing users to search, write and manage messages without internet access in the browser.The changes to Gmail will roll out over the next few weeks with consumers able to opt into the new look by selecting the “Try the new Gmail” option under settings once it is available. Changes to the G Suite system will require system administrators to turn on options before they are available to workers using the Google tools."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c5a70fae6ce0e29b41a9b871d3b4a4d4dd25b890/0_106_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=49695f7e61d5dcf9ec8c6612ed902e61","title":"whatsapp raises minimum age 16 europeans facebook gdpr eu","story":"Facebook-owned messaging service will demand users confirm they are old enough to use app after raising age limit from 13 WhatsApp is raising the minimum user age from 13 to 16, potentially locking out large numbers of teenagers as the messaging app looks to comply with the EU’s new data protection rules.The Facebook-owned messaging service that has more than 1.5 billion users will ask people in the 28 EU states to confirm they are 16 or older as part of a prompt to accept a new terms of service and an updated privacy policy in the next few weeks.The European Union\u0027s new stronger, unified data protection laws, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), will come into force on 25 May 2018, after more than six years in the making.GDPR will replace the current patchwork of national data protection laws, give data regulators greater powers to fine, make it easier for companies with a one-stop-shop for operating across the whole of the EU, and create a new pan-European data regulator called the European Data Protection Board.The new laws govern the processing and storage of EU citizens\u0027 data, both that given to and observed by companies about people, whether or not the company has operations in the EU. They state that data protection should be both by design and default in any operation.GDPR will refine and enshrine the right to be forgotten laws as the right to erasure, and give EU citizens the right to data portability, meaning they can take data from one organisation and give it to another. It will also bolster the requirement for explicit and informed consent before data is processed, and ensure that it can be withdrawn at any time.How WhatsApp will confirm age and enforce the new limit is unclear. The service does not currently verify identity beyond requirements for a working mobile phone number.WhatsApp said it is not asking for any new rights to collect personal information in the agreement it has created for the European Union. It said: “Our goal is simply to explain how we use and protect the limited information we have about you.”WhatsApp’s minimum age will remain 13 years outside of Europe, in line with its parent company. In order to comply with the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which comes into force on 25 May, Facebook has taken a different approach for its primary social network. As part of its separate data policy, the company requires those aged between 13 and 15 years old to nominate a parent or  to give permission for them to share information with the social network, or otherwise limit the personalisation of the site.WhatsApp also announced on Tuesday that it would begin allowing users to download a report detailing the data it holds on them, such as the make and model of the device they used, their contacts and groups and any blocked numbers.WhatsApp, founded in 2009 and bought by Facebook for $19bn in 2014, has come under pressure from some European governments in recent years because of its use of end-to-end encryption and its plan to share user data with its parent company.In 2017 European regulators disrupted a move by WhatsApp to change its policies to allow it to share users’ phone numbers and other information with Facebook for ad targeting and other uses. WhatsApp suspended the change in Europe after widespread regulatory scrutiny, and signed an undertaking in March with the UK Information Commissioner’s Office to not share any EU citizen’s data with Facebook until GDPR comes into force.But on Tuesday the messaging firm said it wanted to continue sharing data with Facebook at some point. It said: “As we have said in the past, we want to work closer with other Facebook companies in the future and we will keep you updated as we develop our plans.”"},{"url":null,"title":"bezoss empire how amazon became the worlds biggest retailer","story":"Amazon has shipped more than 400 items per second at its peak.

Pashinyan led nearly two weeks of protests against Serzh Sargsyan – Armenia’s most powerful politician for more than a decade – prompted by accusations that he had manipulated the constitution to cling to power.The latest protests will be a crucial test of whether the opposition can maintain its momentum after Sargsyan’s resignation. Karen Karapetyan, the acting prime minister and an ally of Sargsyan, suggested on Wednesday morning that a parliamentary election could be held to end the political crisis. “If Pashinyan is the people’s choice, the people can elect him,” he said.In a video appeal posted on Facebook after he led thousands of people on a march, Pashinyan said: “The Republican party is thinking about taking advantage of Serzh Sarksyan’s resignation and wants to keep power.“We can’t agree on the appointment of this party’s representative as prime minister and we can’t allow this corrupted system to continue to exist.”He urged supporters to “come to the square and finish the velvet revolution”.Pashinyan played a key role in ousting Sargsyan, organising many of the protests and calling for the prime minister to go in a televised exchange, before being imprisoned and then released. He had been due to start talks with the ruling party on Wednesday, but they were cancelled late on Tuesday.Sargsyan was a close ally of Vladimir Putin and Russia is closely watching events in the former Soviet republic, where it has two military bases. On Tuesday, the Kremlin said it was pleased the situation appeared stable for now.The Armenian president, Armen Sarkissian, another ally of the former prime minister, was sworn in as president earlier this month after being elected by parliament.Under a revised constitution approved in a 2015 referendum, most state powers shifted to the prime minister, while the presidency became a largely ceremonial post. In another move likely to prolong the political crisis that has rocked one of Russia’s closest allies from the former Soviet Union, Pashinyan said he was ready to be the country’s next prime minister “if people put this responsibility on me”, and would keep up pressure on the ruling elite until it agreed to real change.In Los Angeles, thousands of demonstrators attended a rally on Tuesday to mark the 103rd anniversary of the Armenian genocide.Reuters contributed to this report"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc1d37f0b205ec3682f8d0c6a3f28b9b705bd64b/0_228_2990_1794/master/2990.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1ab332e0ac7f7a33691799b00fc3ae29","title":"emmanuel macron goes to washington in pictures","story":"The French president and his wife Brigitte opened their pomp-filled three-day state visit with a double date with Donald and Melania Trump at George Washington’s house"},{"url":null,"title":"cctv shows collision on wellington quay in dublin","story":"  April 24, 2018Garda\u0026iacute pin driver to ground after car hits several vehicles in multiple incidents "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3473676.1524648280!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"house on one of d4 s most sought after streets unoccupied for more than a decade","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t13 St Mary’s Road in Ballsbridge has been unoccupied for a decade. Photograph: Google Street Concerns are growing over the condition of a protected structure on one of Dublin 4’s most sought-after residential streets, which has been left unoccupied for more than a decade.The Victorian house at 13 St Mary’s Road in Ballsbridge has been in the possession of Permanent TSB since 2015, but despite growing property values has remained vacant.The house appears in poor repair and had been entered on Dublin City Council’s register of derelict sites until late last year, when the bank removed large amounts of rubble, litter and wooden hoardings from the front garden.However, the council said its conservation section will in the coming week carry out a more in-depth in inspection of the interior to determine if the house, which is on the city’s Record of Protected Structures, should be entered on its Buildings at Risk register, which aims to prevent the loss of heritage properties.Local resident Killian Mallin said he was shocked to discover the house had been removed from the Derelict Sites Register last year.“It has been empty and in a worsening condition for at least 10 years. But all it seemed to take was a clear-out of the front garden for it to be taken off the Derelict Sites register to me that is illogical when it is clearly so neglected.”While the house is unsightly, with a broken lintel above the front door and sections missing from the wooden side entrance door, the waste of a family home was the most frustrating aspect of the situation, said Mr Mallin.“This property would be a fantastic home for someone. Dublin is facing a housing crisis, with desperation even at the upper end of the market, yet it seems that unless a building is showing signs of imminent collapse the council won’t take action.”Local Fine Gael Cllr Paddy McCartan wrote to Permanent TSB last month asking its intentions in relation to the house, but said he has received no reply.“The bank has had control of this house for a few years now and it has a responsibility to address this situation. It is not good enough to clear the garden and leave it at that. In the current climate, any vacant premises which has the potential to be brought back into use should be a priority.”A spokesman for the bank declined to comment. However, it is understood that there are title issues with the property which have yet to be resolved.The house has been valued at €1.4 million in its current condition. A refurbished house two doors up went on the market last May at €1.9 million. Another house on the road was advertised for rent earlier this year asking €5,500 per month."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3468658.1524242996!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"le big mac emmanuel macron s rise and rise","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tWinning ways: Emmanuel Macron at his victory rally in Paris after being elected president, in May 2017. Photograph: Patrick KovarikAFPGettyPresident Emmanuel Macron likes to convince people. In manner and method, he is unlike his predecessors. Nicolas Sarkozy cajoled and bullied. François Hollande just gave up. Macron fixes interlocutors with his intense blue stare and builds a Cartesian argument. If that doesn’t work, he starts over, patiently, but with determination.The past week has tested the young president’s powers of persuasion. Early in the hours of April 14th, Macron used his constitutional power as commander in chief for the first time, joining the US and Britain in launching cruise missiles against three chemical weapons installations in Syria. The goal, Macron said later, was to convince Bashar al Assad and Vladimir Putin that the international community was more than a “nice” and “weak” body they could push around.In a further exercise in persuasion, Macron volunteered for a combative, 2½ hour live television interview on Sunday night, during which he made the surprising claim that, “Ten days ago, President Trump said the US would pull out of Syria. We convinced him it was necessary to stay for the duration.”The White House later issued a statement saying Trump’s view had not changed, and the French president made an embarrassing climbdown on Monday, claiming he “never said” the US or France would remain militarily engaged in Syria for the long term.Perhaps Macron, whose nickname is “Jupiter”, is threatened by hubris, the sin of pride that afflicted Greek gods.The rest of the week was one long attempt to convince Europeans and the French of the rightness of his positions. Macron – who has become the de facto leader of Europe – received the heads of the three Baltic states who have teamed up with five other northern EU countries, including the Netherlands and Ireland, to thwart his efforts to further integrate the euro zone.Then, before a more sympathetic audience at the EU parliament in Strasbourg, Macron pleaded with proponents of liberal democracy to wake up and oppose the populist authoritarians who deny European values. Macron then travelled to Berlin in yet another effort to enlist German chancellor Angela Merkel’s support for his European reform agenda.On Monday, Macron will go to Washington for a three-day state visit, the first of Trump’s presidential term. Although the two men have clashed on climate change, the Iran nuclear accord, trade protectionism and the rise of Eurosceptical populism, Trump appears to have been charmed by the young president, who says Franco-American co-operation is crucial in the fight against terrorism.As the first anniversary of Macron’s election approaches on May 7th, and a half century after the May 1968 revolution, a different kind of spring is flowering in France. For the first time in decades, the country is reversing its post second World War decline, and the persuasive Macron is turning France into the world’s greatest soft power.There is, of course, discontent. It wouldn’t be France if there wasn’t. This week Macron also confronted striking railway workers in the Vosges, telling them to “stop taking people hostage.” The country is struggling through a rolling strike over the reform of the SNCF railway company.And despite Macron’s best efforts to reassure them, many in France suspect their young president is out to destroy the familiar but dysfunctional “French social model”. In their eyes, Macron is pushing France into the chasm of savage, race-to-the bottom capitalism.So what do they make of him in his home town? The  travelled there to find out.Macron was born in Amiens, the capital of Picardy, 40 years ago and lived here until just before his 17th birthday. From age 11 to 16, he studied at the Jesuit school La Providence.Built in the graceless concrete style of the 1950s, “La Pro” is an elementary, secondary and technical school for 2,000 pupils, spread over several acres. Aside from occasional crucifixes, calendars of Pope Francis and portraits of St Ignatius of Loyola, the religious footprint is light. The teachers are lay people. The priest visits only once a week now.Not a single plaque or photograph records that the president and first lady of France passed through these corridors. Yet this is where Macron asked to be baptised at the age of 12, and where, at 15, he fell in love with his future wife, a French and drama teacher called Brigitte Trogneux Auzière.Macron has always been drawn to older people. His maternal grandmother, Germaine “Manette” Nogues, died in his arms five years ago, at the age of 97. The Protestant humanist philosopher Paul Ricoeur was a spiritual father to him the progressive socialist millionaire Henry Hermand his political mentor. “He’s attracted by knowledge, by people who have experience,” his neurologist father, Jean-Michel (67), says over lunch in Amiens.At La Pro and subsequently at Henri IV, France’s leading lycée and prep school in Paris, Macron often stayed after class to talk to teachers.Marc Defernand (78) taught Macron history and geography here, and was principal of Macron’s section. “He was more mature than other students,” says Defernand. “He always asked a lot of questions. Sometimes he would pick up a conversation we’d started eight days earlier, exactly where we’d left off.”In the autumn of 2016, Defernand queued in a local bookshop to ask Macron to sign his autobiographical manifesto, Révolution. The retired educator is moved, recalling what happened. “He grabbed me by the hand and said, ‘Monsieur Defernand! It’s so good to see you!’” Macron inscribed the book: “To Marc, this ‘Revolution’, which owes more to him than he knows. In friendship, Emmanuel.”We visit the 700-seat theatre where Emmanuel Macron and Brigitte Trogneux Auzière adapted a play by Eduardo De Filippo together.“He was dynamite,” Defernand says. “I told him that if he continued, he would be the Gérard Philippe of the 21st century. It was difficult for others to act in the same play with him. In the same way, it’s difficult for his cabinet ministers now.”Defernand wasn’t aware of the relationship at the time, though he knew Macron went often to Auzière’s house. “I assumed there was a flirt between him and her daughter Laurence,” he says.The scandal of a married teacher with three children having an affair with a student nearly 25 years her junior has been transformed into romantic legend. Everyone would rather forget the trauma.“Jesuits never pried into people’s private lives. There was no morality investigation,” Defernand says. “There were unmarried teachers living together at the time. I was more worried about students taking drugs.”The fact that Brigitte continued to teach at La Pro for years after her lover’s departure, and then transferred to Lycée St Louis de Gonzague when they began to live together later in Paris, is further evidence of tolerance, Defernand says.A tragic love story, known to most French people, occurred a quarter-century earlier and helped pave the way for Macron and Auzière.Schoolteacher Gabrielle Russier (32) had an affair with a lycée student half her age, Christian Rossi, in Marseille. The youth’s parents filed a complaint against the teacher and had their son placed in a mental hospital. Russier was given a suspended prison sentence and took her own life. The story became the subject of books, films and songs. Asked about it at a press conference, former president Georges Pompidou famously quoted a poem by Paul Eluard that was sympathetic to women accused of having slept with German soldiers during the war.The historian Jean-François Sirinelli\u0026nbspcompares the Russier and Macron stories in his book Les Révolutions françaises, to show how much France evolved in a single generation. “Gabrielle Russier takes her own life in 1969. Emmanuel Macron and his teacher start an affair in the 1990s, and in May 2017, Brigitte Macron becomes first lady of France.”Macron’s parents learned of the affair by chance. “My wife was much more upset than I was,” Prof Macron says. “It may sound macho, but I thought he’d get over it. He didn’t . . . I thought it was a little early. It wasn’t the way I envisioned life, but it wasn’t my life. I raised my children to be free and independent.”The Macrons didn’t consider filing charges against Brigitte Auzière, but they asked to meet her. “I was requisitioned to impose authority,” Prof Macron laughs. “I told her, ‘He’s a minor. I want him to complete his studies. After that, he’s free to do what he wants.’”The president’s parents have been hurt by press reports that they sent their son to Paris to get him away from Auzière. “He was going to go to Henri IV anyway. It was planned,” Prof Macron says, nonetheless admitting that perhaps Emmanuel “went a little early”.At La Pro, I ask a class of 14-15 year-olds, Macron’s age when he met Brigitte, if they could fall in love with a teacher. The teenagers laugh and say yes. “If it happened to someone our age, it would shock me,” says a student called Grégoire. “But now that he’s an adult, it doesn’t bother me.”The students say it’s “cool” that Macron is president. “He was elected because there was Marine Le Pen,” pipes in Ayoub, of north African origin. Perhaps parroting their parents’ opinions, the youths object to rising taxes and praise the appointment of cabinet ministers who are not professional politicians. For the future, they predict flying cars and tell me France will never know full employment.On a scale of one to 10, they give the young president an approval rating of seven. “He has to prove himself,” one explains. Like France, Macron’s successors at La Pro are waiting to see.The Amienois may seem blasé about their president, but his father attributes this attitude to the “taciturn, reserved” character of Picard people. The region particularly suffered in both world wars, has a miserable climate and has been decimated by de-industralisation.His son is an atypical Picard, “an extrovert” infused with the sun of the southwest on the side of his mother, Françoise Nogues-Macron.History and bloodlines led me to Macron père, to find out more about the family’s English ancestry. In February, Macron spent an evening with the Presidential Press Association. As the representative for foreign journalists, I was part of the welcoming party. I gave him a sepia postcard of English soldiers in Amiens in 1918. \u0026nbspMacron studied the photograph closely. “You know, they found me an English great grandfather,” he said with a laugh, staring at the postcard. “He was called George Robertson.” The president scrutinised the English faces for a long moment. He was looking for a face that resembled his own.Towards the end of last year’s presidential campaign, Brigitte Macron mentioned to British journalists that her husband had a great grandfather called “Mr Robertson from Bristol”. The London Times, Mirror and Daily Mail researched the story and told the Macrons more than they had ever known about “Mr Robertson”.George William Robertson was born in Bristol in December 1887, and is believed to have fought in the Battle of the Somme. Distant relatives in England have preserved his war medals.Robertson married Macron’s great grandmother, Suzanne Leblond, in the town of Abbeville, 40km from Amiens, in 1919. They had three daughters. The middle daughter, Jacqueline, born in 1922, was Emmanuel Macron’s paternal grandmother.“He disappeared from one day to the next,” Prof Macron told me. “No one in the family ever heard from him. Suzanne raised three daughters alone. She kept a very modest grocery shop in Abbeville. My parents sent me to live with her and my aunts for two years as a child.”The failed marriage to an Englishman “was never, never talked about. The family kept no trace of him. I never saw a picture,” Prof Macron continues. George Robertson married again, settled in east London and kept a grocery shop, like his ex-wife, Suzanne. A step-daughter told the Mirror that he liked to sing Roses of Picardy, which he had learned in the trenches.Had a butcher from Bristol not fought in the Somme, married a Frenchwoman and fathered her children, Emmanuel Macron would not exist, would not be president of France today.Macron’s intellectual precociousness and his relationship with Brigitte meant he “skipped his adolescence”, his father says. In the autumn of 1993, three months short of his 17th birthday, the future president moved to a garret near the Lycée Henri IV in Paris. \u0026nbspHe continued his relationship with Brigitte. “When I went to see him in his chambre de bonne, sometimes he called through the door for me to come back later,” Prof Macron laughs. “I knew she was there with him.”Christian Monjou taught Macron American and British civilisation for three years at Henri IV. Though he did not know about the romance, Monjou noticed that Macron raced off to Amiens the moment classes ended on Saturday. “It was a case of\u0026nbsp ‘the ided self’,” Monjou says in an interview in his book-lined study.Macron obtained his baccalauréat with honours, but twice failed the entrance exam for the École Normale Supérieure, which trains French academics. It was the only failure of his life. Had it not been for the distraction of romance with Brigitte, Monjou says, Macron would have succeeded in the exam and become an academic.Against all odds, Brigitte Macron eventually orced and moved to Paris to live with Emmanuel. They married in 2007. “Without her, I would not be me,” Macron said during the campaign.Macron went on to earn a doctorate in philosophy, then reoriented his life towards politics with degrees from Sciences Po and the École Nationale d’Administration (ENA). “He used failure as a launching pad,” says Monjou. “That is typical of a leader.”“Have you brought your helmet and bulletproof vest?” the taxi driver who takes me to the Whirlpool clothes dryer factory in north Amiens asks. It’s a joke, of course, but the “Whirlpools” are notoriously hostile. A year ago, Marine Le Pen promised their factory would not close if she became president. Macron ignored advice and plunged into the crowd of angry strikers, saying, “If you listen to the security guys, you’re dead.”The factory will move to Poland at the end of May. Most of the 290 workers have been promised retraining or jobs building “intelligent” refrigerators by the factory’s new owner. But they’re still angry. On the day I visit, management proposed a clothes dryer in lieu of a severance bonus.“Macron, Macron. He’s not a god. We’re losing jobs. We don’t give a damn about Macron,” François Gorlia, the in-house union leader, tells me on the phone when he refuses to come to the gate to talk to me.“He’s a right-wing guy. Everything for the rich. Nothing for the poor,” Sibylle (39), an assembly line worker says as she arrives for the 1pm shift. She’ll benefit from Macron’s investment in training for the jobless, but she isn’t convinced. “Training is fine and dandy, but there are no jobs.”After lunch in a simple bistro, Macron’s father Jean-Michel guides me through a maze of streets under construction, to the music conservatory where his son studied piano for nine years. When he failed the conservatory exam after his first year, Macron’s mother told his biographer Anne Fulda, the boy insisted on having the same examiner the second year, an early sign of his determination to convince. He played well, Prof Macron recalls, mastering Bach’s devilishly difficult Goldberg Variations.Prof Macron gives me the address of the modest, two-storey brick bungalow where Emmanuel and his two siblings grew up, and where the neurologist still lives with his second wife. “It’s not Neuilly,” Macron père says laughing, referring to the Beverly Hills-like Paris suburb where Nicolas Sarkozy came from. Though they are both doctors, Macron’s parents earned low, public sector salaries. “They weren’t neurosurgeons with private jets,” comments a presidential adviser.The Trogneux chocolate shop, near the cathedral in central Amiens, is where Brigitte Macron’s family have made chocolates and macaroons for five generations. They also own the local Renault dealership.Black-and-white photographs of successive generations of the Trogneux chocolate dynasty hang inside the shop. There is no photograph or mention of Brigitte Trogneux Auzière Macron. Jean-Alexandre Trogneux (57), the first lady’s nephew and godson, agrees to be photographed, but refuses to talk about the presidential couple. “We’ve made it a golden rule,” he says. “We don’t talk about them and they don’t talk about us.”Fabien Dorémus (32) heads the political book section of a shop in central Amiens. Macron’s Révolution sold more than 400 copies there, an “enormous” number, Dorémus says. He had no desire to read it, and dismisses the book – and Macron – as “all slogans and clichés”. A former journalist whose local online newspaper failed for lack of funding, Dorémus is close to the far left party France Unbowed.\u0026nbspSince Macron’s election, Dorémus says, “I’m not optimistic for workers, pensioners and people who need public services. I am very optimistic for the rich.”The bookseller mentions various left-wing grievances against Macron, arising from a handful of disparaging remarks since 2014: Macron referred to slaughterhouse workers who were losing their jobs as “illiterate” Macron told a heckler wearing an anti-Macron T-shirt, “The best way to buy a suit is to get a job” Macron called protesters against his labour reforms “slackers” and accused strikers of wanting to foutre le bordel, or wreak havoc.It’s hardly “let them eat cake”. But the president has been hanged and burned in effigy by protesters. “You have to put yourself in the place of the people who get told they are slackers and freeloaders,” Dorémus says. “He’s contemptuous of the lower classes. People started hating him because they feel disrespected.”Another criticism, made by Macron’s former teachers, is that his speeches are often so long and intellectual that they can be difficult to follow.And attempts to control the president’s image can be counterproductive. The novelist Emmanuel Carrère was given exclusive access to the president and first lady. In two interviews with Macron, there was “one really strong, beautiful sentence”, Carrère wrote in the . “And this really strong, really beautiful sentence was off the record. In its place I was given permission to use a perfectly dull, perfectly formatted variant.”In the course of a day in President Macron’s home town, there is not a single photograph of him to be seen.Brigitte Fouré, the city’s mayor, tells me the poverty rate is two percentage points higher than the national average, and 80 per cent of inhabitants qualify for social housing. Amiens is ided between disadvantaged north and middle-class south. It was ruled by a communist mayor for 18 years in the 1970s and 1980s.Macron spent less than 17 years in Amiens, Fouré notes. He “went up” to Paris nearly a quarter of a century ago. “People here don’t know him. A lot of people are proud that the president is from Amiens, but that’s it. There has never been a real relationship between him and the city. There is no emotional tie.”On a beautiful spring day, the Élysée Palace feels light years away from dreary Picardy. The top-floor office of a close presidential adviser has a view over the gardens and the Eiffel Tower in the distance.Macron’s entourage is comprised mostly of fervently devoted young men with backgrounds similar to his own. No one at the Élysée, other than the president, can be quoted by name. “Our rule is that no one gets inidual credit for anything,” the adviser explains.The adviser reportedly thought up the slogan used by Macron when Trump pulled out of the Paris accord on climate change, “Make our planet great again!” But he refuses to confirm this. “We work collectively. Everything we do belongs to the president.”The adviser counts a resurgence of French pride as Macron’s greatest achievement so far. “It’s been a long time since the French have been proud to be French, in the eyes of the world,” he says. Though it contradicts my experience in Amiens, the statement rings true. Most people in the professional milieus of Paris adore Macron and are proud of his presidency.A few doors from the president’s office, the adviser lists Macron’s “important victories”: the revision of the labour code and the taxation of capital investments the overhaul of the country’s education system changes to the EU’s posted workers directive ending the giant squat at Notre-Dames-des-Landes and dismantling the nuclear reactor at Fessenheim. The last two issues had festered for decades. “They seemed impossible for any preceding majority,” the adviser says.Macron is doing as much for the disadvantaged as for the rich, the adviser insists. “We have increased basic payments to the poor, the disabled and the elderly. We’re decreasing social charges on lower salaries. The pendulum has swung much more towards the least advantaged than the most privileged.”So why isn’t that message getting through? Why do polls indicate that a majority consider Macron the “president of the rich”?For one reason, the adviser says. “He was an investment banker. What’s more, at Rothschild the most symbolic bank in the world. For many people, that proves his competence. The thing that makes him hated by some is the reason why he is respected by others.”Because Macron worked for four years as an investment banker, “everything he does that is perceived as right-wing or for the rich is blown out of proportion”, the adviser says.“And everything he does for the underprivileged, that would be seen as left-wing, is discounted. It’s a problem of perception.”Opinion polls can be read two ways. An Ifop-Fiducial poll published on April 10th gave Macron a 55 per cent approval rating, high for France, 11 months into a presidency. But a BFM poll published four days later showed that 44 per cent of voters are “disappointed”.Nine years of piano and the rigour of France’s best schools have honed Macron’s powers of concentration. On April 17th, he took questions from MEPs in Strasbourg for three hours, without notes, without so much as jotting down a question – a regular performance for Macron.“He is someone with a great capacity of attention and concentration,” says Monjou. “People who’ve met him often tell me they were struck by the intensity with which he looks at them, as if, for the time they are with him, they are all that matters.”“When you talk to him, it is as if he is downloading your brain,” says a former cabinet minister who sometimes advises Macron.Geraldine Byrne-Nason, now Ireland’s Ambassador to the United Nations, is doubtless the Irish official who knows Macron best. She became friends with the future president when both were “sherpas”, responsible for briefing and accompanying Irish and French leaders to EU summits, between 2012 until 2014. Byrne-Nason represented the taoiseach’s office, Macron the Élysée Palace.“We spent hours and hours in corridors through the night while the heads of state and government were locked in meetings,” Byrne-Nason recalls. “Emmanuel would be one of my first points of repair. If you’re going to be there for seven hours, you want someone interesting to talk to.”Byrne-Nason calls Macron “an insider-outsider” who has mastered the system but is able to regard it with detachment. “He has a healthy disrespect for bureaucracy, and Brussels is the home of process and procedure,” she says. “In that regard, we were kindred spirits. There was a slight impatience with the weight of slow-turning wheels.”Macron was particularly understanding of Irish difficulties during the bailout, Byrne-Nason says. She believes he was responsible for support offered by then president François Hollande.Byrne-Nason sent glowing reports about Macron’s potential to Dublin, long before he became a presidential candidate. Last September, she listened to what she calls his “extraordinary speech in favour of international co-operation and law” at the UN General Assembly. “It was poetic. It was powerful. It lit up the place.” Ireland could have signed off on every word, Byrne-Nason says, calling Macron “a superstar president who generates both respect and influence here amongst the 193 countries of the UN”.If Macron were Irish, he might be a hybrid of President Michael D Higgins and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar: part poetic intellectual, rooted in left-wing Christianity and fascinated by ideas part dynamic young liberal, determined to make the economy flourish.When Christian Monjou was Macron’s teacher at Henri IV, he says Macron talked a lot about the Fabians, the centre-left British intellectuals who founded the London School of Economics. The Fabians believed in “the inevitability of gradualness, the idea that everything that is gradual you won’t be able to go back on,” Monjou says. “It is totally anti-French, with our tradition of revolution, not evolution.“French political life is saturated in ideology,” Monjou continues. “With Macron, there is something you might call empirical or pragmatic. It’s familiar to an Anglo-Saxon, but it stands out in France. I suspect this slightly Anglo-Saxon approach may come from listening to me for three years.”Macron’s adviser stresses he is more than a mere pragmatist who would be content to solve one problem after another. “The two legs of Emmanuel Macron are action and reflection,” he says. “He always does both.”Macron’s en même temps mantra seeks to reconcile irreconcilabables, such as liberalism and social protection. The challenge is most obvious in his self-described “humane but realistic” immigration policy. Measures such as the Collomb circular, which authorises police to search emergency shelters for illegal migrants, have alienated some of Macron’s closest allies.In 1997, Macron’s spiritual father Paul Ricoeur delivered a lecture titled Foreigner Myself. Ricoeur cited Leviticus, about “the stranger that dwelleth with you”, and the Gospel of Matthew, which says: “I was a stranger and you took me in.” Opponents of Macron’s tough immigration policy say he has betrayed Ricoeur’s ideals. The criticism must sting, but Macron believes that unless he calms fears of unlimited migration, extreme right-wing populists will continue to gain ground, in France and across Europe.The necessity of ending the “society of status” in which family background, education and profession determine all aspects of one’s life, “gives coherence to everything we are doing”, says the presidential adviser.Philippe Aghion, who teaches economics at Harvard, the London School of Economics and the Collège de France, has greatly influenced the president’s economic thinking.Contrary to Thomas Piketty, the French author of the best-selling Capital in the 21st Century, Aghion and Macron believe that increasing social mobility, not high taxation, is the most effective way of reducing income inequality.Aghion wants to wean France off its post-second World War reliance on the Keynesian welfare state, in which government spending stimulates demand. He is inspired by John Maynard Keynes’s exact contemporary, the Austrian-born economist and Harvard professor Joseph Schumpeter, who believed that innovation and technical progress are the basis of a prosperous economy.Aghion’s theories underlie Macron’s reform of the French labour code last year, and the ongoing reform of professional training. It is, Aghion admitted in an interview, a liberal economic policy. But, he insists, it is also a social policy.Schumpeter believed in creative destruction, “which means you constantly have new jobs replacing old jobs, new firms replacing old firms”, Aghion says. It’s a hard sell to a French public that craves security and is adverse to change.Aghion advocates Danish-style “flexicurity” that combines labour market flexibility with unemployment benefits and retraining for laid-off workers. “In a nutshell: innovation, social protection and social mobility. That’s the triangle you want to achieve,” he says. Listening to him is like hearing Macron speak.Macron’s parents were left-leaning agnostics who did not baptise their children. At the age of 12, probably under the influence of his surroundings at La Pro, Macron asked to make his First Communion. A black-and-white photograph provided by one of his teachers, Gérard Banc, shows the future president making his profession of faith.Macron’s intellectual affiliation has been with the Christian left, with Ricoeur and Esprit magazine, for which he wrote a half-dozen articles, and whose board he sat on. French media interpreted gestures at Macron’s campaign rallies as signs of mysticism, for example when he asked his followers to “show benevolence”, or ended rallies Christ-like, with outstretched arms. On the night of his election, he concluded his speech in front of IM Pei’s glass pyramid at the Louvre with the words, “I will serve you with love”.During his evening with the Presidential Press Association, I asked Macron if, 28 years after his baptism, he still has faith. Personal belief is a taboo subject in secular France. Embarrassed laughter rippled across the room, but he addressed my question.“I believe in something we don’t see, yes,” Macron said. “I have faith in the generic sense of the term. If one doesn’t believe in one’s lucky star, in good fortune, in one’s country, one doesn’t do what I’m doing. I believe in a form of transcendency.”Following Macron’s April 9th speech to French bishops, leftists and Freemasons accused him of attacking la laicité, which has been France’s official policy of state-enforced secularism since 1905.“We share the confused feeling that the link between church and state has been damaged, and that it is as important to you as it is to me to repair it,” Macron said.\u0026nbsp The purpose of laicité was “certainly not to deny spirituality” he argued. \u0026nbsp“For biographical, personal and intellectual reasons, I have the highest opinion of Catholics.”There is something Jesuitical, indeed monklike, about Macron. Unlike his predecessors, he shows no need to eat, sleep or chase women. Asked what has been the “greatest trial” of being in office, the French president said he has “measured the weight and the solitude and the end of innocence” that come with power.“I do not think it is a trial,” Macron continued. “The French have authorised me to do what I committed to do. One thing is certain. There is no respite, which may explain why I sometimes look pale. I do not feel authorised to enjoy any form of leisure. I take time to reflect. I read and write. But in the times we live in, there is no room for respite. That may be the trial of power, though I don’t live it as such. There is undeniably a form of asceticism.”Macron sees his rise to power as the result of a troubled epoch. “I don’t forget where I come from and why I am here today,” he said. “I am the fruit of a form of brutality in history, of a break-in, because France was unhappy and uneasy. If I forget that for one moment, it will be the beginning of the trial.”"},{"url":null,"title":"stormy daniels michael cohen acts like he is above the law","story":"  April 17, 2018Michael Cohen forced to disclose Fox News presenter\u0026rsquos name during court hearing "},{"url":null,"title":"telegraph launches next phase words chosen brand campaign","story":"The  has launched the second phase of the Words Chosen Well brand campaign which aims to showcase its award-winning quality journalism and raise brand awareness.The campaign started with a new television advert debuted during the commercial break of Channel 4’s Gogglebox on Friday 20th April. Created by adam\u0026ampeveDDB  in collaboration with The ’s in-house marketing and creative teams, it builds on the success of last year’s campaign with a bigger and bolder creative that utilises important cultural references and leans on some of the most emotive and impactful events of our times, highlighting iconic moments when words have been considered and chosen well.The ’s new campaign seeks to demonstrate the influence and importance of the spoken and written word, and the role that quality journalism plays in providing news, insight and analysis.

Children in developing countries who cannot access care are particularly vulnerable, Dr Zaidi added..html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:0}.html-embedponent .quoteponent ponent-content{margin-right:16px}.quote__source,.quote__author{white-space:normal}@media only screen and (min-width:730px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-60.83px}.html-embedponent .quoteponent .quote__content:before{margin-left:-12pxpadding-right:1px}}@media only screen and (min-width:1008px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-82.33px}}People don’t think of vaccines as a poverty reduction tool but they areDr Anita Zaidi“Rotavirus is a disease that can kill within hours. Children can become severely dehydrated and die on the way to a clinic or hospital. But it’s not just about deaths. I’m a paediatrician and it’s important we do whatever we can to keep kids out of hospital,” she said.The Gates Foundation is highlighting the importance of vaccines with the launch of a video by Aardman Animations, creators of Wallace and Gromit. According to data from the World Health Organization there has been an 84 per cent fall in the number of measles deaths since the introduction of a vaccine against the disease. And so far this year there have been just eight cases of polio thanks to the global vaccination campaign.Heather Wright, executive producer at Aardman, said the campaign had a simple message: to urge parents and carers to get their child vaccinated.\u0026quotYou would throw yourself in front of a bus to protect your child so why wouldn\u0027t you get your child immunised?\u0026quot she said. According to the latest data 95 countries have introduced a vaccine against rotavirus, and 22 have plans to do so. These include many high-income countries such as the UK and the US, and low-income countries which receive financial help from Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance.However, around 75 countries have not introduced the vaccine: these include middle income countries such as China, Russia, Egypt and Chile which do not qualify for support from Gavi. Dr Zaidi said that countries had many competing priorities but stressed that the vaccine was not only good for a nation’s health, but also economic prospects. In many countries, where there is no system of health coverage, people face financial ruin when they or members of their family are hospitalised.Vaccines | Global coverage by the end of 2016A recent study looked at the impact of the introduction of various vaccines, including rotavirus, on 41 low and middle-income countries between 2016 and 2030. It predicted that as well as averting 819 deaths for every one million people vaccinated the rotavirus vaccine would also prevent 242,000 people from facing catastrophic health costs.Dr Zaidi said: “People don’t think of vaccines as a poverty reduction tool but they are. People in low income countries need to recognise what powerful tools vaccines are for reducing the health and financial burden of the poor.”Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Calling blind people \u0026#39blind\u0026#39 is off-putting and misleading, charity says as it searches for new name Royal wedding guest list: Who did Meghan Markle and Prince Harry invite?India braced for riots after \u0026#39Godman\u0026#39 guru Asaram Bapu jailed for raping 16-year-oldDanish submarine owner Peter Madsen sentenced to life for murdering Swedish journalist EuroMillions draw: Lucky Brit\u0026#39s numbers come in to scoop third highest UK jackpot everToronto van attack victims: An \u0026#39incredible\u0026#39 charity worker and a sports-loving grandmotherDonald Trump and Emmanuel Macron toast friendship at state dinner organised by MelaniaNeutral ground or dramatic backdrop?

So when he used a microscope to identify how a dreaded tropical disease was transmitted, he would have realised that his discovery promised to safeguard the health of British troops and officials in the tropics. In turn, this would enable Britain to expand and consolidate its colonial rule.Ronald Ross at his lab in 1898 Calcutta (Welcome Collection)Ross’s words also suggest how science was used to argue imperialism was morally justified because it reflected British goodwill towards colonised people. It implied that scientific insights could be redeployed to promote superior health, hygiene and sanitation among colonial subjects. Empire was seen as a benevolent, selfless project. As Ross’s fellow Nobel laureate Rudyard Kipling described it, it was the “white man’s burden” to introduce modernity and civilised governance in the colonies.But science at this time was more than just a practical or ideological tool when it came to empire. Since its birth around the same time as Europeans began conquering other parts of the world, modern Western science was inextricably entangled with colonialism, especially British imperialism. And the legacy of that colonialism still pervades science today.As a result, recent years have seen an increasing number of calls to “decolonise science”, even going so far as to advocate scrapping the practice and findings of modern science altogether. Tackling the lingering influence of colonialism in science is much needed. But there are also dangers that the more extreme attempts to do so could play into the hands of religious fundamentalists and ultra-nationalists. We must find a way to remove the inequalities promoted by modern science while making sure its huge potential benefits work for everyone, instead of letting it become a tool for oppression.When a slave in an early 18th-century Jamaican plantation was found with a supposedly poisonous plant, his European overlords showed him no mercy. Suspected of conspiring to cause disorder on the plantation, he was treated with typical harshness and hanged to death. The historical records don’t even mention his name. His execution might also have been forgotten forever if it weren\u0027t for the scientific enquiry that followed. Europeans on the plantation became curious about the plant and, building on the slave’s “accidental finding”, they eventually concluded it wasn’t poisonous at all.Instead it became known as a cure for worms, warts, ringworm, freckles and cold swellings, with the name Apocynum erectum. As the historian Pratik Chakrabarti argues in a recent book, this incident serves as a neat example of how, under European political and commercial domination, gathering knowledge about nature could take place simultaneously with exploitation.For imperialists and their modern apologists, science and medicine were among the gracious gifts from the European empires to the colonial world. What’s more, the 19th-century imperial ideologues saw the scientific successes of the West as a way to allege that non-Europeans were intellectually inferior and so deserved and needed to be colonised.A racist caricature of European scientists visiting Africa. The severed head on the right is that of Ronald Ross (Welcome Collection)In the incredibly influential 1835 memo Minute on Indian Education, British politician Thomas Macaulay denounced Indian languages partially because they lacked scientific words. He suggested that languages such as Sanskrit and Arabic were “barren of useful knowledge”, “fruitful of monstrous superstitions” and contained “false history, false astronomy, false medicine”.Such opinions weren’t confined to colonial officials and imperial ideologues and were often shared by various representatives of the scientific profession. The prominent Victorian scientist Sir Francis Galton argued that the “the average intellectual standard of the negro race is some two grades below our own (the Anglo Saxon)”. Even Charles Darwin implied that “savage races” such as “the negro or the Australian” were closer to gorillas than were white Caucasians.Yet 19th-century British science was itself built upon a global repertoire of wisdom, information, and living and material specimens collected from various corners of the colonial world. Extracting raw materials from colonial mines and plantations went hand in hand with extracting scientific information and specimens from colonised people.Leading public scientific institutions in imperial Britain, such as the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew and the British Museum, as well as ethnographic displays of “exotic” humans, relied on a global network of colonial collectors and go-betweens. By 1857, the East India Company’s London zoological museum boasted insect specimens from across the colonial world, including from Ceylon, India, Java and Nepal.The scientists who used this evidence were rarely sedentary geniuses working in laboratories insulated from imperial politics and economics. The likes of Charles Darwin on the Beagle and botanist Sir Joseph Banks on the Endeavour literally rode on the voyages of British exploration and conquest that enabled imperialism.Sir Hans Sloane’s imperial collection started the British Museum (Paul HudsonWikipedia)Other scientific careers were directly driven by imperial achievements and needs. Early anthropological work in British India, such as Sir Herbert Hope Risley’s Tribes and Castes of Bengal, published in 1891, drew upon massive administrative classifications of the colonised population.Map-making operations including the work of the Great Trigonometrical Survey in South Asia came from the need to cross colonial landscapes for trade and military campaigns. The geological surveys commissioned around the world by Sir Roderick Murchison were linked with intelligence gathering on minerals and local politics.Efforts to curb epidemic diseases such as plague, smallpox and cholera led to attempts to discipline the routines, diets and movements of colonial subjects. This opened up a political process that the historian David Arnold has termed the “colonisation of the body”. By controlling people as well as countries, the authorities turned medicine into a weapon with which to secure imperial rule.New technologies were also put to use expanding and consolidating the empire. Photographs were used for creating physical and racial stereotypes of different groups of colonised people. Steamboats were crucial in the colonial exploration of Africa in the mid-19th century. Aircraft enabled the British to surveil and then bomb rebellions in 20th-century Iraq. The innovation of wireless radio in the 1890s was shaped by Britain’s need for discreet, long-distance communication during the South African war.In these ways and more, Europe’s leaps in science and technology during this period both drove and were driven by its political and economic domination of the rest of the world. Modern science was effectively built on a system that exploited millions of people. At the same time it helped justify and sustain that exploitation, in ways that hugely influenced how Europeans saw other races and countries. What’s more, colonial legacies continue to shape trends in science today.Imperialist Cecil Rhodes planned a railway and telegraph line to connect Africa (Alamy)Since the formal end of colonialism, we have become better at recognising how scientific expertise has come from many different countries and ethnicities. Yet former imperial nations still appear almost self-evidently superior to most of the once-colonised countries when it comes to scientific study. The empires may have virtually disappeared, but the cultural biases and disadvantages they imposed have not.How to fix all of your sleep problems with scienceYou just have to look at the statistics on the way research is carried out globally to see how the scientific hierarchy created by colonialism continues. The annual rankings of universities are published mostly by the Western world and tend to favour its own institutions. Academic journals across the different branches of science are mostly dominated by the US and Western Europe.It is unlikely that anyone who wishes to be taken seriously today would explain this data in terms of innate intellectual superiority determined by race. The blatant scientific racism of the 19th century has now given way to the notion that excellence in science and technology are a euphemism for significant funding, infrastructure and economic development.Because of this, most of Asia, Africa and the Caribbean is seen either as playing catch-up with the developed world or as dependent on its scientific expertise and financial aid. Some academics have identified these trends as evidence of the persisting “intellectual domination of the West” and labelled them a form of “neo-colonialism”.Not all international collaborations are equal (US Army AfricaFlickr)Various well-meaning efforts to bridge this gap have struggled to go beyond the legacies of colonialism. For example, scientific collaboration between countries can be a fruitful way of sharing skills and knowledge, and learning from the intellectual insights of one another. But when an economically weaker part of the world collaborates almost exclusively with very strong scientific partners, it can take the form of dependence, if not subordination.A 2009 study showed that about 80 per cent of Central Africa’s research papers were produced with collaborators based outside the region. With the exception of Rwanda, each of the African countries principally collaborated with its former coloniser. As a result, these dominant collaborators shaped scientific work in the region. They prioritised research on immediate local health-related issues, particularly infectious and tropical diseases, rather than encouraging local scientists to also pursue the fuller range of topics pursued in the West.In the same study, 60 per cent to 70 per cent of the scientists based in developed countries did not acknowledge their collaborators in poorer countries as co-authors in their papers. This is despite the fact they later claimed in the survey that the papers were the result of close collaborations.International health charities, which are dominated by Western countries, have faced similar issues. After the formal end of colonial rule, global health workers long appeared to represent a superior scientific culture in an alien environment. Unsurprisingly, interactions between these skilled and dedicated foreign personnel and the local population have often been characterised by mistrust.For example, during the smallpox eradication campaigns of the 1970s and the polio campaign of past two decades, the World Health Organization’s representatives found it quite challenging to mobilise willing participants and volunteers in the interiors of South Asia. On occasions they even saw resistance on religious grounds from local people. But their stringent responses, which included the close surveillance of villages, cash incentives for identifying concealed cases and house-to-house searches, added to this climate of mutual suspicion. These experiences of mistrust are reminiscent of those created by strict colonial policies of plague control.Polio eradication needs willing volunteers (Department for International DevelopmentFlickr)Western pharmaceutical firms also play a role by carrying out questionable clinical trials in the developing world where, as journalist Sonia Shah puts it, “ethical oversight is minimal and desperate patients abound”. This raises moral questions about whether multinational corporations misuse the economic weaknesses of once-colonised countries in the interests of scientific and medical research.The colonial image of science as a domain of the white man even continues to shape contemporary scientific practice in developed countries. People from ethnic minorities are underrepresented in science and engineering jobs and more likely to face discrimination and other barriers to career progress.To finally leave behind the baggage of colonialism, scientific collaborations need to become more symmetrical and founded on greater degrees of mutual respect. We need to decolonise science by recognising the true achievements and potential of scientists from outside the Western world. Yet while this structural change is necessary, the path to decolonisation has dangers of its own.In October 2016, a YouTube video of students discussing the decolonisation of science went surprisingly viral. The clip, which has been watched more than 1m times, shows a student from the University of Cape Town arguing that science as a whole should be scrapped and started again in a way that accommodates non-Western perspectives and experiences. The student’s point that science cannot explain so-called black magic earned the argument much derision and mockery. But you only have to look at the racist and ignorant comments left beneath the video to see why the topic is so in need of discussion.Inspired by the recent “Rhodes Must Fall” campaign against the university legacy of the imperialist Cecil Rhodes, the Cape Town students became associated with the phrase “science must fall”. While it may be interestingly provocative, this slogan isn’t helpful at a time when government policies in a range of countries including the US, UK and India are already threatening to impose major limits on science research funding.More alarmingly, the phrase also runs the risk of being used by religious fundamentalists and cynical politicians in their arguments against established scientific theories such as climate change. This is a time when the integrity of experts is under fire and science is the target of political manoeuvring. So polemically rejecting the subject altogether only plays into the hands of those who have no interest in decolonisation.Alongside its imperial history, science has also inspired many people in the former colonial world to demonstrate remarkable courage, critical thinking and dissent in the face of established beliefs and conservative traditions. These include the Indian anti-caste activist Rohith Vemula and the murdered atheist authors Narendra Dabholkar and Avijit Roy. Demanding that “science must fall” fails to do justice to this legacy.The call to decolonise science, as in the case of other disciplines such as literature, can encourage us to rethink the dominant image that scientific knowledge is the work of white men. But this much-needed critique of the scientific canon carries the other danger of inspiring alternative national narratives in post-colonial countries.A campaigner during a March for Science protest in Melbourne (Wikipedia Commons )For example, some Indian nationalists, including the country’s current prime minister, Narendra Modi, have emphasised the scientific glories of an ancient Hindu civilisation. They argue that plastic surgery, genetic science, aeroplanes and stem cell technology were in vogue in India thousands of years ago. These claims are not just a problem because they are factually inaccurate. Misusing science to stoke a sense of nationalist pride can easily feed into jingoism.Meanwhile, various forms of modern science and their potential benefits have been rejected as unpatriotic. In 2016, a senior Indian government official even went so far as to claim that “doctors prescribing non-Ayurvedic medicines are anti-national”.Attempts to decolonise science need to contest jingoistic claims of cultural superiority, whether they come from European imperial ideologues or the current representatives of post-colonial governments. This is where new trends in the history of science can be helpful.For example, instead of the parochial understanding of science as the work of lone geniuses, we could insist on a more cosmopolitan model. This would recognise how different networks of people have often worked together in scientific projects and the cultural exchanges that helped them – even if those exchanges were unequal and exploitative.But if scientists and historians are serious about “decolonising science” in this way, they need to do much more to present the culturally erse and global origins of science to a wider, non-specialist audience. For example, we need to make sure this decolonised story of the development of science makes its way into schools.Students should also be taught how empires affected the development of science and how scientific knowledge was reinforced, used and sometimes resisted by colonised people. We should encourage budding scientists to question whether science has done enough to dispel modern prejudices based on concepts of race, gender, class and nationality.Schools need to teach the non-Western history of science (Wikipedia Commons)Decolonising science will also involve encouraging Western institutions that hold imperial scientific collections to reflect more on the violent political contexts of war and colonisation in which these items were acquired. An obvious step forward would be to discuss repatriating scientific specimens to former colonies, as botanists working on plants originally from Angola but held primarily in Europe have done. If repatriation isn’t possible, then co-ownership or priority access for academics from post-colonial countries should at least be considered.This is also an opportunity for the broader scientific community to critically reflect on its own profession. Doing so will inspire scientists to think more about the political contexts that have kept their work going and about how changing them could benefit the scientific profession around the world. It should spark conversations between the sciences and other disciplines about their shared colonial past and how to address the issues it creates.Rohan Deb Roy is a lecturer in South Asian history at the University of Reading. theconversationor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Colin Drury delves into the inside story of the battle to save 17,500 trees being felled in a single cityJenny Hockey still shivers when she remembers the moment, almost 18 months ago, she was woken by police hammering at her door. It was 5am. When she looked outside, she momentarily wondered if a terror incident was unfolding.“It was that kind of scene,” the 71-year-old says. “Multiple cars, officers swarming everywhere, flashing lights. We had no idea what was happening.”It was 17 November 2016 and, under the cover of darkness, officers from South Yorkshire Police had descended on Sheffield’s Rustlings Road, one of the city’s most sought-after addresses. Cordoning off the street and banging on doors, they ordered residents to get dressed and move their vehicles or have them towed away. Within the hour, Hockey, a retired sociology professor, would become one of three neighbours arrested and locked up for eight hours.227-year-old tree planted by George Washington pulled down by windBut this dramatic pre-dawn raid – described by Nick Clegg, then the local MP, as like something “you’d expect in Putin’s Russia” – was not carried out in search of terrorists or criminals.Rather, it was in support of council contractors hired to chop down eight street trees, which residents had spent more than a year petitioning to save.Amid the confusion, Hockey and two others – including another woman in her seventies – attempted to stand under one of these century-old limes, only to be detained. All charges were later dropped.“We wanted to protect something we loved,” she says. “And our right to do that – our democratic right – was taken away, really, by state force. It was so horrible and disempowering.”Indeed, by the time the trio were freed, the trees which had always overlooked their homes were no more.Contractors cut down the final tree in Rustlings Road (PA)Yet a bigger battle was just beginning: one which has since spread across the city, seen mass protests and riot police on suburban streets, and ultimately revealed an astonishing secret plan – hidden within a £2.2bn PFI contract – to cut down almost 20,000 street trees…Sheffield has long boasted of being Europe’s greenest city – in part because a third of it sits in the Peak District. But it is also due to the sheer number of trees that line the roads. Some 36,000 of them arch over highways and footpaths.But around 2015, talk of what the Woodland Trust called a “tree massacre” started to emerge.Sheffield’s Labour council had agreed for 17,500 street trees to be axed as part of a highways improvement scheme  (PA)The eight limes in Rustlings Road were not the only ones marked for the chainsaw. Under then-redacted clauses in a £2.2bn contract, Sheffield’s Labour council had agreed for 17,500 street trees to be axed as part of a vast highways improvement scheme being undertaken by the infrastructure giant Amey.Company and council both said – and still say – such felling was necessary. Targeted trees, they argued, were either dying, dangerous or had roots causing irreparable damage to roads and footpaths. Every one taken down, they added, was being substituted with a younger sapling: “We assess every single tree and only replace them as a last resort,” says Darren Butt, account director with Amey, today.Targeted trees, the council argued, were either dying, dangerous or had roots causing damage to roads and footpaths (Sheffield Tree Action Group)Yet, as this felling increased, questions started to be asked. There was shock when two cherries commemorating Second World War heroes disappeared one day. At Christmas, a row decorated with charity festive lights were hacked back – with fellers cutting through wires and all.A feeling spread that perfectly healthy and safe trees were being chopped unnecessarily. A suspicion grew that the policy was actually about increasing Amey’s profit margins. Over the length of the company’s 25-year highway maintenance obligations, so ran the theory, a newly planted sapling is far cheaper to look after than older, larger arboreta.“People were going to work in the morning and coming home to entirely different-looking streets,” says Paul Selby, a city resident and leading member of Sheffield Tree Action Groups, known as Stag. “It was ecological destruction carried out, in secret, by a multinational company with the explicit support of the local authority and the police.“And people were angry. These trees were part of their lives and they didn’t want them taking. These weren’t anarchists or hardline activists from other towns. They’re Sheffielders furious they hadn’t been given a voice in what was happening in their streets. So they came out and fought to be heard.”Almost 6,000 trees have been chopped down. But in the face of overwhelming and increasingly nationalised pressure, a pause on felling was announced last week.Sheffield City Council has put this down to the “dangerous tactics” of protestors. Yet the support in favour of Stag – both within the city and from names including Jeremy Corbyn, Michael Gove, Ken Loach and Jarvis Cocker – probably had something to do with it too.Hopes are now high the whole policy can be reconsidered. “We don’t take anything for granted,” says Selby, a civil servant with the Department for Work and Pensions. “But, after so long fighting, surely dialogue is now the sensible way forward.”Tensions rose, with fellers and protestors accusing each other of intimidation (Sheffield Tree Action Group)Certainly, it has been a troubled road to here: the irony perhaps being that this all started with a real city victory.In 2012 the government handed Sheffield £1.2bn to improve its roads, an economic godsend for a place locals had taken to calling Pothole City. Amey – a subsidiary of the Spanish company Ferrovial – won the work contract, promising to upgrade and maintain every highway, pavement, bridge, subway and street light for 25 years.“This is work that is good for everyone living here,” says Paul Billington, director of culture and environment with the city council. “It is already bringing investment and opportunities back into the city because it is making our infrastructure world-class.”Replacing damaging or dying trees, he argues, is key to that success continuing. Doing it now, he adds, is important because, as a 2007 survey showed, a large majority of trees are so old that to delay action would store problems for future generations.“No one disagrees that dying or damaging trees should be looked at – if they really do fall into those categories,” says Alison Teal, a Green Party councillor in the city. “But this went beyond that. We still didn’t know how many were due to come down but everywhere you looked, these magnificent trees were disappearing.”Demonstrations were civil enough to start with. People at home would spot Amey vans and go out to stand under targeted trees so they couldn’t be axed. Others started taking the bus to work, leaving their cars blocking access to endangered arboreta.Cups of tea were offered while people stood about. They debated the merits of the trees: their beauty, the environmental benefits, the wildlife. Occasionally, they talked about their favourite. An endangered elm in the Nether Edge area ended up being shortlisted for the 2016 England Tree Of The Year Award.Yet things hardened after the Rustlings Road raid (“In hindsight, it was poorly handled,” says Darren Butt). While many still supported the replacement scheme, opinion started to harden in favour of the so-called tree-huggers.

Stumps of trees already cut were painted blood red as a mark of anger. Stag supporters – now numbering in their thousands – took to organising daily spotter patrols and flying pickets.“When someone saw an Amey van near an endangered tree, they put a message in a WhatsApp group or online, and whoever was available would go and protect that tree,” says Teal.In this way dozens of limes, cherries, oaks and birches across several neighbourhoods were saved.But as tensions rose – with both fellers and protestors accusing each other of intimidation – police started to appear.Jenny Hockey (left), Freda Brayshaw and a third neighbour were arrested and locked up for eight hours (PA)At one demonstration in leafy Chippinghouse Road in January 2017, nine people were arrested, some while stood in their own gardens. None were ever charged. At another picket last month, a specialist police protest removal unit turned up. It was the first time it had ever been deployed on South Yorkshire’s streets.Arrest numbers grew – yet there were vaguely comedic elements to many. A 57-year-old woman was detained after blowing a pink trumpet, while a retired couple – Dr John and Sue Unwin – found themselves being questioned by CID officers (and later cleared) about the suspected poisoning of a cup of tea they gave a feller.“It sounds like the plot from an Agatha Christie novel,” Dr Unwin told the Daily Mail.One 73-year-old was detained for intimidation. Alan Simpson, a retired firefighter and great-grandfather, says: “I’ve never been in trouble in my life and was there with my wife. I don’t think I could have cut a less intimidating figure if I tried.” His charge, too, has been dropped.“If it wasn’t so serious,” says James Whitworth, cartoonist on local newspaper The Star, “it would be farcical, and I mean that literally: there is enough material here to make an actual farce.“As a cartoonist, it’s a dream because the whole thing is so ridiculous. You think you can’t possibly say anymore on the issue – and then they arrest a woman for blowing a plastic trumpet. But as a city resident: I’m pretty neutral but, really, maybe leave our trees alone?”Local newspaper cartoonist James Whitworth’s take on the Sheffield tree massacre (James Whitworth)As news of the ongoing demonstrations spread, meanwhile, concern grew it was damaging the city’s reputation. When Sheffield was left off The Sunday Times Best Places to Live list this year, authorities blamed the campaigners: “it is regrettable the increasingly extreme actions of a small number of protestors is having this impact,” a council spokesperson declared.Demonstrators themselves were not above ridiculous assertions either: at a packed council meeting, one compared Amey’s workers to Nazi guards, just doing their jobs.Lavender and tea tree oils could be giving boys breasts, study warnsChina reassigns 60,000 troops to plant trees in bid to fight pollutionHow the Japanese fought suicide in the ‘Sea of Trees’For now, however, the potential turning point arguably came in March when a freedom of information request, asked by Paul Selby, forced the council to reveal it had indeed asked for 17,500 trees to be chopped down. The figure was so astonishing all three city MPs – all Labour – called for a rethink.In a disastrous interview on local radio, council cabinet member for environment Bryan Lodge – who declined to be interviewed for this piece – denied the figure was a target but could not explain what it actually was. Days later the suspension of felling was announced.What happens next is the question the city is asking itself.“We’ve already lost 6,000 trees,” says Selby. “Of course, there are some that should come down if they really are dying or doing irreversible damage to footpaths. But all other solutions should be sought first. Trees are a sign of a civilised city. We should be doing everything we can to save them.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

This is what that signifiesInstead, the judge said the best Alfie\u0027s parents could hope for was to explore the options of removing him from intensive care either to a ward, a hospice or his home.But a doctor treating Alfie, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said that for Alfie to be allowed home would require a sea change in attitude from the child\u0027s family, and they feared that in the worst case they would try to take the boy abroad.Mr Justice Hayden ruled out his family\u0027s wishes to take the child to the Bambino Gesu hospital in Rome, following interventions from the Pope and the Italian authorities.Alfie has been at the centre of a life or death treatment battle, with his parents, Mr Evans and Kate James, trying to block doctors from withdrawing life support in a sometimes acrimonious six-month dispute which has seen a series of court battles.A last-ditch appeal in which the Italian Ambassador granted Alfie citizenship of Italy in order to take him to Rome for treatment failed on Monday.And a late night court hearing heard by telephone by Mr Justice Hayden and lawyers for both sides confirmed his earlier decision permitting life support, helping Alfie to breathe, to be withdrawn.UK news in picturesUK news in picturesA statue in honour of the first female Suffragette Millicent Fawcett is unveiled as Prime Minister Theresa May and Mayor of London Sadiq Khan look on during a ceremony in Parliament Square.

It\u0027s beyond belief,” Ms Bearder said.The app, Home Secretary Amber Rudd pledged would be easy to use, will not function on iPhones because they do not have the capability to read the chip in a biometric passport.The revelation is likely to further lower the opinion of British immigration authorities in the eyes of European politicians and citizens, hot on the heels of damage done by the Windrush immigration scandal and erroneous deportation letters being sent to EU nationals last year.One year to Brexit: What is still needed to complete a deal with the EU?Speaking after the Tuesday meeting Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament’s Brexit coordinator who requested the official visit to Brussels by the Home Office, said he would be writing to UK authorities to resolve various “question marks” about the registration process.The European Parliament says any system should be by way of “declaration” rather than application that the UK government would have to process. MEPs also want the system to be free for EU citizens living in the UK, on the basis that they had no part in the Brexit decision.Mr Verhofstadt also added that each family of EU nationals should only have to make one declaration instead of one for each person in it, and that there needed to be special provisions for vulnerable people or those not able to use a digital registration system.Brexit so far: in picturesBrexit so far: in picturesBoris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

Opinion polls show growing support for that,” Mr Corbett said at a sitting of the European Parliament’s constitutional affairs committee.The top Labour MEP said he had met with former supporters of Brexit who “regret it and are demanding the right of people to reconsider”, stating that “it is by no means certain … that the public would vote again for Brexit”.“Opinion has not done what one would have intuitively expected,” he told MEPs. ‘You would have expected public opinion to rally behind the result of the referendum we had two years ago – that’s clearly not happening.”He added that demand was growing for a vote “because the emerging Brexit is clearly very, very different from what was promised by the Leave campaign” and that leaving the EU was “turning out to be very costly exercise” that had “clearly has damaged the British economy”.“Who knows, there may well be a rejection of the deal by the House of Commons, in which case there will be a ratification crisis, in which case a referendum is one of the possible options that will no doubt be considered. We will see. The feeling that it is not entirely a done deal is a growing one.”One year to Brexit: What is still needed to complete a deal with the EU?Labour has so far shied away from backing a second plebiscite and has voted with the Government to begin the Brexit process. The party has however set a number of tests that it says must be met to secure its support for the final deal Ms May comes back from Brussels with.The Government’s narrow majority with the support of the DUP means only a small rebellion by pro-EU Conservatives would be needed to bring down the deal. The Government has previously been defeated in the Commons on Brexit issues with the combined support of Labour, the Lib Dems, SNP, and other parties. Brexit so far: in picturesBrexit so far: in picturesBoris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

If there wasn’t Brexit there shouldn’t be a special status for EU citizens in the future and there wouldn’t be a reason to apply for such a status.”He also added that each family of EU nationals should only have to make one declaration instead of one for each person in it, and that there needed to be special provisions for vulnerable people or those not able to use a digital registration system.The parliament also insisted that British citizens living abroad at the point of exit should be guaranteed full rights to freedom of movement across the EU rather than just for the country they’re currently resided in. One year to Brexit: What is still needed to complete a deal with the EU?European confidence in British immigration authorities reached a new low following the Windrush scandal, but it was already dealt a blow last year after the Home Office accidentally sent letters to some EU citizens telling them they had no right to remain in the country.Ms May described the false deportation notices as an “unfortunate error” on the part of the Home Office and later sent other letters to EU nationals pleading for them to remain in “open and erse” Britain.Brexit negotiators ‘gave EU power to freeze UK out of Galileo project’Theresa May dismisses EU claims that the UK is delaying Brexit talksUK holding up Brexit talks with lack of clarity, Michel Barnier says Lords defeats government plans to scrap EU rights charter after BrexitEU agrees new trade deal with Mexico as Brexit loomsPound sterling falls to five week low against US dollar The prime minister and home secretary, Amber Rudd, have come under significant pressure after it was revealed that Home Office has been threatening to deport British residents, and their descendants, who arrived from the Commonwealth before 1973.Often children who travelled on a parent’s passport did not have to go through the same administrative process as their mother or father, meaning they lacked some documentary evidence in later life to prove their arrival.Problems reached crisis point amid the “hostile environment” policy instigated by Ms May when she was home secretary, which saw officials across all wings of government and even private landlords required to demand proof of immigration status before providing services.A raft of cases are now emerging of people who have every right to live in the UK being denied jobs, homes, medical treatment and even being threatened with removal because they have not had the right documents.Brexit threatens life on the Irish border: in picturesBrexit threatens life on the Irish border: in picturesJohn Murphy flies the European flag outside his home near the border village of Forkhill, Co ArmaghAn abandoned shop is seen in Mullan, Co Monaghan.

She is carrying out the will of the British people but it’s hard to read what level of enthusiasm she has for it.“She is doing it, she has never indicated anything other than that, she said ‘Brexit means Brexit’, but she doesn’t – by her nature – express herself unduly emotionally.”He said it was a “good thing” that the leader can exercise “self control”, but his words come as Brexiteers seek to pressure Ms May into sticking to her commitment to leave the customs union.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The announcement, set for Wednesday, consists of £150 million of new money spread across the two years.Officials say the aid will be focused on keeping medical facilities in the region open, as well as training doctors and nurses – amid estimates that 478 health facilities have been attacked or destroyed and at around 830 health workers have been killed in Syria since the conflict began in 2011.Western countries plan to bypass Russia\u0027s UN veto over SyriaMinisters from dozens of countries across the world met with NGOs and donor countries on Tuesday in the EU capital on the first day of the so-called Brussels II summit.Opening the international meeting at a joint press conference UN special envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura insisted that a political solution had to be found to the civil war“We\u0027re seeing in last few weeks, days, that military gains, territorial gains and military escalation do not bring a political solution, has not brought any change. On the contrary,” he said.Speaking at the same joint press conference, Federica Mogherini, the EU’s foreign affairs chief, echoed Mr de Mistura’s comments, saying there was a need to “return to the political process under the UN auspices to start real, meaningful political negotiations that are clearly the only way forward for the country”.The first day of the summit mostly consisted of government liaising with NGOs and aid groups on priorities and strategies to help alleviate civilian suffering. Closing the Tuesday sessions, EU humanitarian and and crisis commissioner Christos Stylianides described the day’s sessions as “fruitful”.The British government’s message on the first day of the summit focused on Russia’s role in the conflict, with international development secretary Penny Mordaunt warning that “flagrant disregard for international norms” would cause more “misery and destruction”.Mordaunt said Britain wanted to defend a “global rules-based system that keeps all of us safe”.“Russia’s flagrant disregard for international norms and laws poses a grave threat to the global order we rely on for our collective security. In wielding its UN veto twelve times on Syria, it has given a green flag to Assad to perpetrate human rights atrocities against his own people,” she warned.“We’re here to address the urgent humanitarian needs in Syria and the wider region, but all of us here know that the only solution to end the suffering in Syria is a political settlement that brings peace. The longer they delay, the more people are going to die, and the more misery and destruction will be inflicted on Syria.”Syria bombings: US, UK and French military air strikes wreckageSyria bombings: US, UK and French military air strikes wreckageThe wreckage of the Scientific Studies and Research Centre in the Barzeh district, north of Damascus, which was targeted by the US, UK and France air strikes.A Syrian soldier films the damage of the Syrian Scientific Research Center surrounded by papers and rubble.Firefighrers extinguish smoke that rises from the damage.

Calling for an immediate ceasefire, she is expected to say that “Syria is now one of the most dangerous places on earth for aid workers and medical staff”. She will continue: “Medical facilities and schools have been deliberately targeted, aid has been blocked to starve communities into submission, and rape and sexual violence have been deployed as routine weapons of war.“Today’s pledge of UK aid support will help keep medical facilities open in the face of relentless attacks so doctors and nurses can save the lives of innocent Syrians, as well as helping the millions of Syrian refugees sheltering in neighbouring countries. But today can’t only be about pledges of money and we cannot allow anyone to turn their backs on the global rules and standards that keep us all safe.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

That\u0027s the end of their exchange, which was bad-tempered but not particularly effective for either of them.Jeremy Corbyn\u0026nbspsays that, had the Windrush generation not mounted the campaign they had, there would be no compensation, there would be no review, there would be no apology .\u0026nbspHe says there needs to be a review that covers more than just\u0026nbspimmigration law, and should also include cuts to legal aid, which he says made the government\u0027s tougher immigration laws harder to challenge.\u0026nbspTheresa May should confirm that the hostile environment is over, he says, adding:\u0026nbspThe Windrush generation served this country and deserve better than this.\u0026nbspMay draws a distinction\u0026nbspbetween legal and illegal immigrants, again quoting a Labour MP - this time Yvette Cooper - who she says said in 2013: We need much stronger action from government to bring illegal immigration down\u0026nbspJeremy Corbyn asks Theresa May whether Windrush immigrants affected by the government\u0027s immigration clampdown will be fully compensated.\u0026nbspIn a clear dig at Labour over its antisemitism row,\u0026nbspthe PM replies that there is a need for everyone to work to\u0026nbspstamp out racism in every form.\u0026nbspShe adds:Everybody will see the action the government has taken is because we know the Windrush generation are British, they are part of us and we will ensure that.\u0026nbspCorbyn says\u0026nbspfour years\u0026nbspago a Home Office memo suggested hostile environment polices\u0026nbspwould make things harder for the Windrush generation and asks why May, then the Home Secretary, ignored it.\u0026nbspMay says the government wants to\u0026nbspflush illegal migrants out and create a much more hostile environment if you are here illegally - words she attributes to\u0026nbspformer Labour immigration minister Liam Byrne.\u0026nbspTheresa May is on her feet, and PMQs is underway.\u0026nbspThe prime minister starts by paying tribute to the family of Stephen Lawrence, who she\u0026nbspsays have fought heroically to make sure that their son\u0027s life and death will never be forgotten.Don\u0027t go anywhere - PMQs is getting underway shortly...A demonstration, organised by the Labour Against the Witchhunt group and Brighton and Hove Momentum, is taking place outside the disciplinary hearing of Marc Wadworth, who was suspended by Labour after heckling Jewish MP Ruth Smeeth at the launch of a report on antisemitism.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspAround 50 MPs have accompanied Labour\u0027s Ruth Smeeth to Church House in Westminster, where she is due to give evidence to the party\u0027s disciplinary hearing into\u0026nbspa Labour member, Marc Wadsworth, who is suspended for alleged antisemitism.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspYou can watch Davis Davis\u0027 evidence to the Brexit committee live here:\u0026nbspDavid Davis says he\u0026nbspthinks the UK crashing out of the EU without a trade deal is unlikely. He responds to a question from Labour MP Seema Malhotra by saying:\u0026nbspThe complete absence of any outcome is unlikely - you might up with a bare bones deal or a whole series of bilateral deals...I do not think no deal is a significant probability at all. I think the massively higher probability is a deal.The Brexit Secretary has cast doubt over the government\u0027s own Brexit forecasts.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspAsked by Tory MP and Treasury Committee member Stephen Crabb about Treasury studies showing the UK will be worse off outside the single market and customs union, David Davis\u0026nbspsays:\u0026nbspI have not been particularly enamoured with mathematical modelling techniques because they all sit on assumptions of what will happen to trade. If you get that assumption wrong, the whole\u0026nbspmodel is wrong.\u0026nbspAsked if he is suggesting the government\u0027s own forecasts are incorrect, he says:\u0026nbspI would say the\u0026nbspbest modelling in the world is wrong.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Some consumers wondered whether the French meat industry was feeling threatened by the rise in popularity of vegan food others doubted that consumers would ever be confused.One said: This is ridiculous.

Male blue monkeys, she added, probably arrived later after being kicked out of their own groups on reaching sexual maturity.“I kept coming back to the idea that if they are only supposed to mate with their own kind, then why did these red-tailed monkeys mate with the blue monkeys, especially if they had males of their own species around,” Prof Detwiler said. “The female red-tailed monkeys present as willing partners and they are not coerced or forced into copulation with blue monkeys.“Apparently, some female red-tailed monkeys were attracted to novel males with different faces and welcomed the sexual advances.”The research involved analysing DNA from the faeces of the primates.Zhongzhong and HuahuaChinese Academy of SciencesQiang Sun and Mu-ming Poo, Chinese Academy of Sciences         Qiang Sun and Mu-ming Poo, Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of SciencesQiang Sun and Mu-ming Poo, Chinese Academy of SciencesQiang Sun and Mu-ming Poo, Chinese Academy of Sciences    Qiang Sun and Mu-ming Poo, Chinese Academy of Sciences              Now Prof Detwiler believes studying how the two species have co-existed and merged could help in understanding hybridisation in general.She said the society provides “an amazing laboratory in nature to help us answer many questions about how species boundaries are maintained.She added: This research is very timely because hybridization often occurs in response to environmental changes, as we are seeing with climate change and modified landscapes—it is nature\u0027s way to respond.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

But his dad Tom had to give mouth to mouth resuccitation to keep Alfie breathing.Today, supporters on the Alfie\u0027s Army Facebook page pleaded for ventilation equipment, and some were seen running in to Alder Hey hospital with what appeared to be medical equipment in a desperate attempt to keep the baby alive.In court yesterday Mr Justice Hayden described the tot as \u0026ldquocourageous and a \u0026ldquowarrior, but said the case had now reached its \u0026ldquofinal chapter.Mr Justice Hayden rejected claims from Alfie\u0026rsquos dad Tom Evans that his son was \u0026ldquosignificantly better that first thought because he had been breathing unaided for 20 hours after doctors first withdrew his life support on Monday night.Instead, the judge said the best the child\u0026rsquos parents could hope for was to \u0026ldquoexplore the options of removing him from intensive care either to a ward, a hospice or his home.But a doctor treating Alfie, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said that for Alfie to be allowed home it would require a \u0026ldquosea change in attitude from the child\u0026rsquos family, and they feared that in the \u0026ldquoworst case they would try to take the boy abroad.

We all know the military air force are ready to take him and a team of doctors are there.\u0026ldquoWe\u0027ve also got a German air ambulance team, who attempted to take him in the first place, ready... the reality is these people are eager to get him out of the country and I\u0027m not giving up because Alfie\u0027s breathing away, he\u0027s not suffering.Mr Evans revealed Alfie had at times needed to be helped with his breathing, adding: \u0026ldquoAt some point I had to give him mouth-to-mouth because his lips went blue and he was really fighting with his breathing so me and his mum were giving him mouth-to-mouth.Mariella Enoc, president of the Bambino Ges\u0026ugrave Children\u0027s Hospital, said the hospital had prepared a military plane to collect Alfie, should the courts give the go ahead.The judge rejected claims from Tom Evans that his son was \u0026ldquosignificantly better than first thought She said: We are ready, the plane is at Rome Ciampino Airport with the doctors on board.\u0026ldquoThe Italian Embassy in England is also looking for an ambulance to take the boy from the hospital to the airport.

The model is always for doctors to work closely with parents to agree on the best course of action for the child.In the vast majority of cases an equal decision is made to withdraw treatment and it is rare that there is disagreement. The cases where this is a significant difference in view are the ones that grab the media headlines.
