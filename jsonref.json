An amendment tabled by Labour\u0027s Yvette Cooper and Tory former minister Oliver Letwin - to be put to a vote on Wednesday - would force Mrs May to seek an extension if a deal has not been approved by MPs by March 13.Ms Cooper, a former Labour minister, said on Monday it would allow Parliament to tell the Prime Minister to seek an extension to the negotiation process but leave it in the Government\u0027s hands to decide how long it should be.Mrs May could seek to take matters into her own hands as early as tomorrow when she makes a Commons statement.This could theoretically see off a rebellion by Remain-supporting MPs and ministers who are threatening to back Cooper-Letwin.Defence minister Tobias Ellwood suggested there was a possibility of Mrs May herself announcing an extension of the two-year Article 50 negotiation process beyond March 29.Mr Ellwood told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today: \u0027The Prime Minister is listening and is recognising the fact that we have tried very, very hard in order to secure a deal.\u0027Go long The EU is said to favour a longer delay, possibly up to 21 months.Plans being considered in Brussels would see the transition period due to follow on if the UK leaves with a deal replaced by staying in the EU proper, the Guardian reported. This would allow for deeper talks on the future relationship between Britain and the EU, with the aim of making the Irish border backstop - the main sticking point in the drawn-out negotiations - redundant.The possibility of extending Article 50 was raised when May met with German chancellor Angela Merkel on Monday in Egypt. Nuclear optionBritain could unilaterally reverse Article 50 and stay in the EU until the deal is done. A European court ruled last year that this can be done by the UK without seeking consent from other EU states, whereas extending the Article 50 period would require agreement from the other 27 capitals. But it would also be likely to see Brexiteers in Mrs May\u0027s party explode with rage and could speed up her demise.                            Mrs May met European Union Council President Donald Tusk, right, on the sidelines of the summit yesterday          Prime Minister Theresa May is hugged by the Prime Minister of Bulgaria Boyko BorissovBut she refused to criticise the rebel trio and ducked questions about whether the fragile state of her Government made the ministers \u0027unsackable\u0027.Mrs May said: \u0027Collective responsibility has not broken down. What we\u0027ve seen around the Cabinet table, in the party, in the country at large is strong views on the issue of Europe. That\u0027s not a surprise to anybody.\u0027We have around the Cabinet table a collective, not just responsibility, but desire to actually ensure we leave the EU with a deal. That\u0027s what we\u0027re working for, that\u0027s what I\u0027m working for.\u0027We\u0027ve been having positive talks with the EU. As you know we were in Brussels last week, my team will be back in Brussels again this coming week. They will be returning to Brussels this Tuesday.    If the backbench motion is passed, Mrs May would have until March 13 to get her plan through Parliament or be forced to seek a delay in the process          Mrs May is holding talks with Angela Merkel today in the hope the German chancellor can break the deadlock in Brussels\u0027As a result of that we won\u0027t bring a meaningful vote to Parliament this week, but we will ensure that happens by March 12. It is still within our grasp to leave the EU with a deal on March 29. And that\u0027s what we\u0027re working to do.\u0027Mrs May is holding talks with Angela Merkel today in the hope the German chancellor can break the deadlock in Brussels.Former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith last night said that by delaying the meaningful vote, Mrs May was effectively \u0027calling the bluff\u0027 of the Cabinet rebels.\u0027They are smashing the whole concept of government,\u0027 he said.          Margaret Hodge, pictured, said deputy leader Tom Watson\u0027s demand that Labour eradicate anti-Semitism was a \u0027final wake-up call\u0027Three more Labour MPs are threatening to quit the party over anti-Semitism and Brexit.The trio are considering joining the new Independent Group and one said last night: \u0027We\u0027ll see what happens this week.\u0027Margaret Hodge, pictured, said deputy leader Tom Watson\u0027s demand that Labour eradicate anti-Semitism was a \u0027final wake-up call\u0027. Another Labour MP, Louise Ellman, is on the brink of leaving after more than 50 years.A friend said: \u0027Louise will not be in the party for much longer.\u0027The third MP, Siobhain McDonagh, said on Friday she had decided not to resign \u0027this week\u0027 – meaning a decision to go could come soon.Dame Margaret, a former minister who has faced months of abuse from hard-Left activists, said: \u0027This is the final wake-up call for Jeremy Corbyn. The leadership has so lost trust but I don\u0027t believe any of the figures they come out with on the cases they\u0027ve dealt with. I\u0027ve had pretty horrific abuse on Twitter. It absolutely doesn\u0027t feel to me like there is zero tolerance on anti-Semitism.\u0027 Dame Louise said: \u0027I am still fighting with the party\u0027s failure to deal with anti-Semitism.\u0027An unpublished Labour Party report into Dame Louise\u0027s Liverpool Riverside constituency found she was physically threatened by one member and \u0027there have been CLP meetings during which anti-Semitic incidents are alleged to have taken place\u0027.The report said: \u0027These have arisen as a result of \u0027obsessive interrogations\u0027 of the MP over the Israel-Palestine conflict. Some members have felt that others are holding the MP – a Jewish woman – personally accountable for the actions of the Israeli government.\u0027The 11 members of the Independent Group will meet today to discuss organisation, including how to elect a leader. Yesterday Chuka Umunna called on voters to \u0027join us, and help us forge a new, different kind of politics\u0027.A poll for The Observer puts the group\u0027s support at 6 per cent, ahead of the Lib Dems. It has also emerged that Sir David Garrard, once one of Labour\u0027s biggest donors, is supporting the new group.                         Tom Watson said Mr Corbyn had to \u0027change very, very rapidly\u0027 to stop more MPs from following the nine who quit the party last week.He also revealed he had handed the party leader a dossier of 50 cases where no adequate action had been taken over racist comments on social media about Jewish iniduals.In a TV interview, he demanded Mr Corbyn take personal charge of rooting out anti-Semitism because the \u0027party machine\u0027 had failed. And he urged him to change tack on Brexit and push for a second referendum.\u0027The departure of our colleagues is a real blow, and we need to understand why they felt the need to go. Because if we\u0027re going to be in government we need to address those concerns.\u0027For us to hold this party together, things have to change. There\u0027s almost a crisis for the soul of the Labour Party now. I absolutely fear that we will lose more parliamentary colleagues. We may lose peers from the House of Lords, and we may lose members and councillors and I don\u0027t want that to happen.\u0027Mr Watson said Luciana Berger, the Liverpool Wavertree MP who left for the Independent Group last week, had been \u0027bullied out of the Labour Party by a small number of racist thugs\u0027 and he was \u0027very very sad to see her go\u0027.Hard-Left activists, he said, were causing irreparable harm by \u0027pouncing\u0027 on MPs, and bullying them on social media.

Some of the show was great – notably, Olivia Colman’s gloriously ebullient Best Actress speech, Rami Malek’s equally endearing response to winning Best Actor    I loved Spike Lee behaving in the same lunatic way he does at New York Knicks gamesBut what it didn’t do was make me laugh.Instead, it dripped with insufferable identity politics, Trump-bashing, and a series of box ticking awards that smacked of Hollywood trying to make itself look as worthy and virtuous as possible.‘I can’t believe a film about menstruation won an Oscar’ wept director Rayka Zehtabchi for her (powerful) film Period. End of Sentence.Really?I’ve have been more shocked if it hadn’t.After all, the main winners last night were a film about a gay immigrant rock star, a film about a black superhero with an almost entirely black cast, a film about racial injustice in segregated U.S. South in the 1960s, a film about a black detective who goes undercover with the Ku Klux Klan – and Roma, a beautifully made but almost unwatchably dull, depressing and painfully slow black-and-white film about a Mexican maid, in Spanish with subtitles.I’m not disputing the inidual merits of any of the winners, but it’s hard not to avoid the conclusion that Hollywood – whose Academy voters are predominantly old white guys – is now doing everything in its power to avoid more of the‘White Oscars’ backlashes of recent years.Even the red carpet morphed into a ‘woke’ farce as Pose star Billy Porter turned up in a tuxedo-skirt, presumably to make himself the new poster person for gender fluidity.‘OMG! He’s magnificent!’ screamed Twitter.          The red carpet morphed into a ‘woke’ farce as Pose star Billy Porter turned up in a tuxedo-skirt, presumably to make himself the new poster person for gender fluidity.‘OMG! He’s ridiculous!’ I screamed back.In the end, the only real amusement came from watching people I’d never heard of, and frankly was quite happy never to have heard of, making fools of themselves on stage during the seemingly endless tedious production categories.The hapless trio from Vice who won the make-up and hair award made collectively the worst speech in Oscars history - a bumbling, stumbling, jabbering, linguistic fiasco that became the perfect evidential argument for sliding these kind of awards into commercial breaks, as was intended this year until a massive furore from ‘the industry’ forced the producers to do a U-turn.But at least they were riveting, for all the wrong reasons.When Green Book won Best Screenplay, one of the writers (and the movie’s director) Peter Farrelly pulled out a sheet of paper and began dementedly reciting the names of what seemed like every single human being he’d ever met.I counted at least 40 people on his turgid list of mainly nonentities.          When Green Book won Best Screenplay, one of the writers (and the movie’s director) Peter Farrelly pulled out a sheet of paper and began dementedly reciting names Important to him, I’m sure – but utterly irrelevant to the billion people watching around the world.Oh for a trap door that could have sucked him down into the bowels of the Kodak Theatre and spared us this orgy of self-indulgence.And what about the ridiculous woman who made Free Solo, the extraordinary documentary about climber Alex Honnold? She barely mentioned the guy who actually risked his life for her bloody film, even as he stood three feet away from her on stage!          Documentary maker Chai Vasarhelyi (in gray) barely mentioned the guy who actually risked his life for her bloody film, even as he stood three feet away from her! ( second from right)But for me, the single most depressing moment came with presenting duo Awkwafina and John Mulaney, who were unfunny, boring and unctuously sycophantic.‘I want these people to like me to a degree that is embarrassing,’ gushed Mulaney, and you could see he really meant it.‘Wait, why are we still here?’ exclaimed Awkwafina, as they remained on stage to introduce a second award.  The single most depressing moment came with  Awkwafina and John Mulaney, who were unfunny, boring and unctuously sycophantic. Why wasn’t Ricky Gervais there to rip into people instead of these fawning clowns?I asked myself the exact same question, with this supplementary: Why wasn’t Ricky Gervais there to rip into people instead of these fawning clowns?Yet today, I’ve read many people raving about them and saying they were so ‘hilarious’ they should host the whole show next year.To which I say: Hayi! Hayi!

Allies of the Prime Minister revealed that the Cabinet will discuss proposals this morning that could see the UK request a short extension of Article 50 of around two months if the PM’s deal is voted down by MPs again, for a second time, on March 12.If ministers back the plan Mrs May could float the idea in a statement to Parliament as early as this afternoon.The idea is a desperate bid to stave off the mass rebellion by ministers and avert a looming Commons defeat tomorrow over the motion put forward by Labour’s Yvette Cooper and Tory Sir Oliver Letwin that would empower Parliament to force a Brexit delay on the Government. Up to 25 Tory backbenchers are also threatening to back tomorrow’s revolt (left: Mrs May at the  Arab-European Summit.

All are thought to have attended yesterday’s Commons meeting.Up to 25 Tory backbenchers are also threatening to back tomorrow’s revolt. It means around 40 Tory rebels could vote against the Government which, with Opposition support, is more than enough to defeat Mrs May.  Other Tories believed to be on the brink of resigning to stop No Deal include  Defence minister Tobias Ellwood, left. Energy minister Claire Perry, right, ‘implores’ Mrs May to say that if there is no deal agreed by Parliament by March 13 then she must seek a way to extend Article 50  As many as 15 ministers could resign and vote for the motion unless Mrs May provides assurances on No Deal, including anti-Brexit Cabinet ministers Amber Rudd, left, and Greg Clark, right    Minister of State for Energy and Clean Growth, Claire PerryNow that we know that there will be no parliamentary vote on a deal for Britain to exit the European Union until March 12 three things are clear.First, if an agreement is not reached and endorsed by then, Britain would crash out on the most basic and disruptive terms on March 29.Second, even if an agreement were to be reached by March 12, it would be too late to have it ratified by the European Council of Ministers, the UK Parliament and the European Parliament before Brexit day, just over a fortnight later.Third, British businesses have been plunged into depths of uncertainty and dismay that is ruinous for the interests of the millions of working men and women whose livelihoods depend on the confidence of their employers.The British Chambers of Commerce, representing small firms in every part of the UK said it is “unbelievable” that there is just “17 days’ notice for businesses, employees, investors and communities on what may be the biggest economic and trading change they face in a generation”.We can’t go on like this. All three facts point to the same conclusion: we must act immediately to ensure that we are not swept over the precipice on March 29.The way to do that is to seek a short extension to Article 50 to allow the negotiations to be completed, the legislation to pass and for the panic that businesses face to subside.It would not take No Deal off the table – only an agreed deal can do that. It would not affect the conduct of the negotiation – both sides are fully aware of the impossibility of ratifying a deal done after this week without an extension to Article 50.But what it would do is to help save the jobs of thousands of people whose employers risk taking flight rather than putting up any longer with the enforced ignorance they have of how to trade with their most important suppliers and customers.The best way to do this is for the Government to take a cool-headed, sensible step.It should say that if there is no deal agreed, it will seek a way to extend Article 50 to avoid leaving with No Deal on March 29. It is a commitment that would be greeted with relief by the vast majority of MPs, businesses and their employees.We implore the Government to take that step this week.But if the Prime Minister is not able to make this commitment, we will have no choice other than to join MPs of all parties in the House of Commons, including fellow ministers, in acting in the national interest to prevent a disaster in less than five weeks’ time that we may regret forever.                         "},{"url":null,"title":"The UAE send astronaut space eight day mission later year","story":"Emirati astronaut Sultan al-Neyadi, right, and astronaut Hazza al-Mansoori, second from right, are pictured at a press conference yesterday. A decision on which of the two astronauts will take off on a Russian Soyuz spacecraft for September’s eight-day mission to the international space station will be made in May "},{"url":null,"title":"Family black pianist inspired Green Book believe best picture win lip service","story":"    From left, Jim Burke, Charles B.

He was by no means isolated from anybody he cared anything about.\u0027 Pictured: Dr Donald Shirely in the hotel suite of his niece Karole Shirley at her debutante ball, November 1988           Patricia said: \u0027How demeaning and insulting can you be in portraying a man with such dignity, a man of such talent, a man with such presence on the stage or at his performances to the point of near perfection?\u0027. Pictured l-r: Patricia Shirley, daughter Karole Shirley and Maurice           Karole explained: \u0027I\u0027m honored that someone would want to tell his story. The difficulty is if you want to tell the story, tell the story - don\u0027t tell your story and then bring my uncle in to validated your perspective, to validate going from being incredibly overtly racist to just racist.\u0027 Pictured: Shirley in his apartment above New York\u0027s Carnegie Hall wearing a Shaman Coat 1997          But while Ali extended an apology, Karole revealed that Viggo Mortensen and director Paul Farrelly doubled-down on their insistence that their depiction of Shirley and of the friendship is accurate          Asked what he would like people to know about his brother Maurice said simply: \u0027My brother had a good life. I\u0027m proud of that\u0027She said: \u0027They have said very biting and very disrespectful things about my family. They said we were angry and resentful about not having a relationship with Donald.\u0027Peter Farrelly said he had reached out to the family but we weren\u0027t having it. You\u0027ve never reached out to us.\u0027I mean they can\u0027t undo what they\u0027ve done but I can honestly tell you my parents are incredibly gracious people and we would absolutely sit down with them.\u0027In life Shirley\u0027s story was rewritten to make him \u0027acceptable\u0027 to white audiences.He was told he could not be a classical pianist because white audiences wouldn\u0027t accept a black man in such a role. His name was shortened to Don - which he hated - and he was cast as part of a \u0027trio.\u0027His background was made more \u0027exotic\u0027 with the claims that he was from Jamaica, though he was born in Pensacola, and had trained in Europe as a child. He had been offered a scholarship in Russia as child prodigy but his mother would not let him go so far away.Today, the family says, there is a bitter irony that he should suffer the same injury after death with his life being rewritten once more this time as a foil for a racist white man.Karole explained: \u0027I\u0027m honored that someone would want to tell his story. The difficulty is if you want to tell the story, tell the story - don\u0027t tell your story and then bring my uncle in to validated your perspective, to validate going from being incredibly overtly racist to just racist.\u0027It\u0027s a huge step for the racist but from our perspective, from our uncle\u0027s perspective, that\u0027s a really small step.\u0027Asked what he would like people to know about his brother Maurice said simply: \u0027My brother had a good life. I\u0027m proud of that.\u0027For Karole\u0027s part, asked about her uncle\u0027s legacy she said: \u0027When my uncle played you could feel his spirit. You could feel the spirit of our ancestors, the promise of this country, all the different parts of world that he had been to.\u0027You could feel his triumph. You could feel his tragedy. You could feel his misery. You could feel his ministry. You could feel everything through his music. So I would tell people to watch the movie because it\u0027s entertaining. It is fiction but it is entertaining.\u0027But listen to my uncle\u0027s music and really learn because that\u0027s his biography.\u0027 "},{"url":null,"title":"Radio 2 listeners tell Zoe Ball tone shouty manner top","story":"    Zoe Ball, 48, has caused a backlash from listeners for being to shouty and over the top in the early hours of the morningRadio 2 presenter Reverend Ruth Scott dies of cancer aged 60...Share this articleListener Chris O\u0027Brian told Radio 4\u0027s Feedback programme: \u0027We\u0027ve tried to listen to the new breakfast time with Zoe Ball but can\u0027t stand the over-the-top, non-stop excitement any more. \u0027Who at the BBC thought that Zoe Ball was the best replacement for Chris Evans?\u0027Miss Ball took over from Evans last month on a £1.2million contract after he went to Virgin Radio. Defending her, one fan wrote on Facebook: \u0027It\u0027s interesting about the shouty mornings. I love a manic morning show.

Creating a positive atmosphere where students can share skills and help each other boosts their creativity and confidence – and helps them get great new ideas as well. So it’s no surprise that having seen their students thrive, teachers across the UK are following suit: they’re embracing social learning to develop their professional skills and networks.“I feel that there’s been a real shift in thinking in this area,” says Paul Morgan, business development manager at CER Education Recruitment. “We recently contributed to a #WomenEd event, for example, a network created to connect, inspire, develop, promote and give confidence to the next generation of women leaders in education.“When we’ve been out speaking to teachers and network leaders, we found that many people thought they were the only ones who had been in their particular situation before. They had never before had a sounding board – a network of people either online or in real life. Now, there’s always somewhere you can go to ask for advice.”So what exactly does this social learning involve? It’s a catch-all term for teachers learning from teachers in an informal but organised setting, rather than the traditional top-down classroom-style of continuing professional development (CPD). This learning might take place between teachers online – during a Twitter chat, for example – or it could be in real life at an event such as a TeachMeet, a Pedagoo conference or a WomenEd “unconference”.All these movements have something in common: they’re grassroots and volunteer-led. TeachMeets, for example, originated with a group of teachers in Scotland in 2006. The concept is simple: teachers meet up to share good practice, practical innovations and personal insights in teaching.Leadership consultant Harrison Owen’s idea “open space”, from the 1980s, inspired TeachMeets. When people get together to learn, he argued, they are more creative and productive if that meeting is fluid and organic, rather than operating within a rigid framework. So TeachMeets are free. There is no central organising body: anyone can volunteer to organise one, and anyone can present at one. Hundreds of TeachMeets now take place across the globe: just search on Twitter for the #TeachMeet hashtag and you’ll find teachers all over the world who share the movement’s ethos.Like that other great grassroots voluntary movement, Parkrun, there are a few rules. Presentations are either “nano” (two minutes long) or “micro” (seven minutes long). They must cover an aspect of good practice or a tool that enhances classroom practice. Order of presentations is chosen at random on the night. And for reasons lost in the mists of time, if you go over your allotted time, expect to have a toy camel chucked at you! TeachMeets are a fantastic way to not just gather ideas, but also to connect in real life with teachers in your area, helping you build your professional network.Pedagoo, another not-for-profit and voluntary movement, grew out of a collaborative blog created – again – by a group of teachers in Scotland. They organise teacher-led conferences every Saturday and run a lively Twitter hashtag, #PedagooFriday, where teachers post tips, experiences and triumphs. A typical #PedagooFriday takes in everything from the joy of conveying to a parent how well their child has done to the drama students’ highly creative examples of Halloween makeup. Again, the idea is simple: to provide a positive, teacher-led space for teachers to share what works.And aside from these movements, teachers have embraced simply using Twitter. The Twitter feeds of teachers such as @just-maths (23,900 followers) and @vicgoddard (21,600 followers) are great places to pitch a question or share a dilemma.Each subject has its own Twitter specialists, and that’s not even counting the potential to connect with big names to get amazing work out there. (Authors Michael Rosen and Neil Gaiman, to name just two, like to share Tweets from teachers using their books in the classroom to their thousands of followers.)Social learning is also having an impact on how CPD is delivered across the board. “It used to be very rigid – you must do this to get this particular impact,” says Morgan. “Now they’re incorporating different elements to get the best standard: collaborations with outstanding schools who will deliver CPD for us, for example, rather than doing everything online.”It’s an exciting time for teachers who love to share what works for them. The new Ofsted framework is due in 2019, putting less emphasis on exam results and data, and more on delivering a broad, rich and deep learning experience. “We’re hoping it will allow teachers to show their creative flair and deliver exciting and stimulating lessons,” says Morgan. And now those fabulous ideas are just a click or a TeachMeet away."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d305370075686a053b46f5c0e6384e32b3c00f97/0_9_5231_3138/master/5231.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3a483b1bb12e0e8c64db4e933c1458f8","title":"secondhand books the murky world of literary plagiarism","story":"Disputes involving AJ Finn, romance writers and even filmmaker Danny Boyle are in the news – but showing someone stole your idea is close to impossible“As if there was much of anything in any human utterance, oral or written, except plagiarism!” opined Mark Twain more than 100 years ago. “The kernel, the soul – let us go further and say the substance, the bulk, the actual and valuable material of all human utterances – is plagiarism.”“I have ever since been tortured by the fear that what I write is not my own.” she wrote. “It is certain that I cannot always distinguish my own thoughts from those I read, because what I read becomes the very substance and texture of my mind … My compositions are made up of crude notions of my own, inlaid with the brighter thoughts and riper opinions of the authors I have read.”Or, as Nicola Solomon at the Society of Authors puts it, “fiction writers are magpies”. This month alone, we have seen the New York Times note the “striking” similarities between AJ Finn’s bestselling mystery The Woman in the Window and a self-published novel released two years before, a romance writer who blamed her ghostwriter for copying passages from other writers’ books, and Australian author Nick Milligan pointing out the common features in his novel Enormity and Danny Boyle’s forthcoming film Yesterday.In 2006, Ian McEwan was forced to defend himself from claims he had plagiarised the work of Lucilla Andrews’ autobiography in his novel Atonement. In 2007, Michael Baigent and Richard Leigh failed to prove that Dan Brown’s novel The Da Vinci Code copied their earlier non-fiction work The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail. And last summer, a judge dismissed a lawsuit from Emma Cline’s ex-boyfriend, who alleged her debut novel The Girls infringed his copyright.Solomon says the Society is often contacted by authors complaining that another has pilfered an idea. “Some cases are absolutely straightforward, but legal action is very tricky in cases which don’t concern actual language copying but rely on copying of themes, plots or structure. They’re expensive to take, they depend on line-by-line checking of work and unfortunately many authors don’t have the funds to go against large publishing or film companies to take action with no guarantee of success.”It has long been claimed that there are somewhere between three and 36 basic plots in all forms of storytelling. Three years ago, academics fed nearly 2,000 stories into a computer analysis and concluded that there were six “core trajectories” for all stories. None of these common plots, however, include a character called Jack who passes off the Beatles’ music as his own on another planet (Milligan’s Enormity and Boyle’s new film), or an alcoholic, agoraphobic woman who watches a crime play out in the house opposite her own (Finn’s bestseller and British author Sarah A Denzil’s Saving April).Milligan told  Australia last week that he felt the similarities were “probably just a horrible coincidence and they mean me no disrespect”. As for Finn and Denzil, the similarities came to light this month after the New Yorker ran an exposé about Finn, a pseudonym for the publisher Dan Mallory, who has a history of lying about his professional history and health, including a brain cancer diagnosis.Finn’s thriller was published in January 2018 Denzil’s novel was self-published in March 2016. Reviews on Amazon and Goodreads have pointed out the similarities between the two books for months. “Almost the same thing” says one Goodreads reviewer on Saving April. “Seems so similar to Girl in the Window. Feels like I just read a different version of that,” runs an Amazon review of Denzil’s book.The New York Times recently noted the parallels between the two being “numerous, and detailed”. And they are (spoilers ahead): both centre on a woman who has lost a child and partner through a car accident for which she blames herself, a fact that isn’t at first revealed. Both feature a new family moving in opposite, whom the agoraphobe watches. She becomes convinced the husband is abusing the wife and befriends their adopted teenager who, after gaining her trust, turns out to be the villain.Denzil, real name Sarah Dalton, told the  she had noticed the similarities herself when she read The Woman in the Window. She said she started writing Saving April in October 2015, submitting it to Amazon’s Kindle Scout programme, which displayed a sample of text from the novel, the blurb and the cover on its website in December 2015. It went on to Amazon as a pre-order and was published on 29 March 2016.The New Yorker profile identified another work similar to The Woman in the Window: the 1995 film Copycat, starring Sigourney Weaver and Holly Hunter. The film and the novel both see a psychologist become trapped in her home by agoraphobia, drink too much, be mistrusted by the police and join a forum that turns out to be dangerous. The director of Copycat, Jon Amiel, told the New Yorker that the debt was “not actionable, but certainly worth noting, and one would have hoped that the author might have noted it himself”.Mallory himself has been open about being inspired by other works, including Gillian Flynn, Kate Atkinson and the Hitchcock film Rear Window, which he says he had just finished watching when the idea came to him. But both Mallory’s literary agent and his publisher have said that the outline of The Woman in the Window, including characters and main plot points, was fully formed by 20 September 2015, before Saving April was released. Mallory submitted a 7,500 word outline that day – a month before Denzil began writing her novel.When the New York Times published its story about Saving April, Mallory’s lawyer allowed a Times reporter to look at the outlines the author sent to his agent on 20 September and 4 October. “Some of the overlapping plot points, including the fact that both protagonists were fighting with their husbands about infidelity before the car crashes, and that the psychopathic teenager tortured animals, while not in the original outline, were contained in the October version … Mr Mallory’s attorney said Mr Mallory has never read Saving April,” said the paper, in an addition to its original story.Solomon said: “It’s bound to happen to an extent, but sometimes things go over the line.” She won’t comment on particular cases, but advises all writers to document every source and submission of their work from the earliest stage possible.“That can help if you want to take action but also protects authors when it is alleged that they have copied others. It also protects you from inadvertently copying an idea by forgetting that you picked it up elsewhere and thinking it was original to you,” she adds. “Much copying is unconscious – though that is no defence.”TS Eliot had it that “immature poets imitate mature poets steal” – a line once echoed by Mallory. “It is often said that ‘good writers borrow, great writers steal’,” he told the Observer in 2018. “If I had not read the work of Flynn or Atkinson I wouldn’t have written the book I did.”Or, as Twain put it in his letter to Keller: “substantially all ideas are second-hand”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2cbdcdf0eee4a2424824fbddcb0389b23baa76c2/356_344_2356_1413/master/2356.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f45977c7fb78ee712e32bbc8870a6904","title":"analysts urge caution over hopes for us china trade solution","story":"Trade tensions between the US and China could rapidly rekindle despite rising hopes of a deal, analysts have warned, after Donald Trump promised to pause the launch of higher import tariffs on Chinese goods.Analysts, however, struck a note of caution after Trump told a group of US governors on Monday that, while he hoped a trade deal could be swiftly reached, there was still a chance that it might not.Financial markets around the world jumped after Trump first signalled the easing of trade tensions on Twitter late on Sunday, saying that “substantial progress” had been made in talks between the US and China. He also said that should additional progress be made then meetings could take place between himself and the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, to conclude a deal.The Dow Jones industrial average was up by more than 150 points in early trading in New York, while markets across Europe also rallied.Economists sounded a note of caution over the chances of complete resolution of the US-China trade dispute, which has rattled the global economy over the past year, as a drag on world trade.

At times almost desperate for a trade deal.

She is widely referred to as the “first lady of football” for her quarter-of-a-century career running Birmingham City and then West Ham United. A supporter of David Cameron and George Osborne, the 49-year-old is one of just 206 women in the House of Lords (out of a total of 783 peers).She has also famously advised Lord Sugar on The Apprentice, as well as Simon Cowell and the former pornographer David Sullivan. It was Sullivan who gave Brady her first big break in 1993 when she convinced him to buy Birmingham City out of receivership. He installed her as chief executive when she was just 23, but told her she would have to be twice as good as a man to run the club, to which Brady replied: “Well that’s not difficult.”During her first press conference at Birmingham, she was asked for her vital statistics. And early on at the club, a player commented: “I can see your tits in that shirt.” Brady replied: “Well, don’t worry, when I sell you to Crewe you won’t be able to see them from there, will you?”. Three days later she sold him. “It was the best deal I ever did,” she told the  last year.She moved to West Ham, where she is vice-chair under the owners Sullivan and David Gold. Rumours have suggested she is actually an Arsenal supporter, but Brady’s website says she “is not an Arsenal fan, and her footballing loyalties have only ever lay with the two clubs she has represented”.Brady grew up in Edmonton, north London, near Tottenham Hotspur’s ground. Her Irish father, Terry, was a self-made Rolls-Royce-driving millionaire, having worked in property and printing. Her Italian mother, Rita, was a full-time mum. She was sent to an all-girls’ Catholic boarding school, which she hated. “You do what you’re told, you wear what you’re told, you eat what you’re told, you go to bed when you’re told,” she said last year. “I was sick of being told what to do. The one thing I wanted was independence. And I realised to have that independence, you needed financial independence.” After passing nine O-levels, she left to join the sixth form of a former all-boys’ school – one of only six girls.A lifelong Conservative supporter, Brady introduced the then chancellor George Osborne at the Tory party conference in 2013. She was subsequently appointed as the government’s small business ambassador. A year later she became a Conservative life peer. “I think it’s a bit like any industry that has never marketed itself to women,” she has said of politics. “A bit like football.”At the same time she built up a series of business interests, including in 2017 accepting Sir Philip Green’s offer to become chair of his family’s Taveta Investments company, which owns Arcadia Group including the Topshop and Miss Selfridge brands. Her brief was to “beef up corporate oversight” and “sort out” corporate governance issues.As a vocal campaigner for women in business, Brady has come under increasing pressure to speak out over allegations of racial and sexual harassment made against Green. He denies the allegations. Dragons Den’s Duncan Bannatyne has described her continued employment at Taveta as “disgusting”.Two weeks ago Brady said she would stay at the company out of duty to Arcadia’s employees, including her daughter Sophia Peschisolido, who is a model. “I hope you would agree that walking away is the easy thing to do staying in the role and ensuring the company is robust going forward is much harder,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/305c0a50d004fd4d607fdb820f11319492285864/0_332_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=56b8a775fbe93cc3993f8a0d80ba4cab","title":"karren brady faces questions about philip green allegations","story":"Outgoing chair called on to tell ‘what went on under her watch’ at tycoon’s retail empireKarren Brady has quit as chair of Sir Philip Green’s retail empire and faced immediate questions over what she knew of alleged sexual and racial harassment by the disgraced business tycoon.Brady walked away after two years in the job and a fortnight after she vowed to remain in her post out of a “sense of duty” to look out for the firm’s staff, including her daughter, who works on Topshop’s social media accounts.The Labour MP Jess Phillips called on Brady, 49, to “answer to what went on under her watch” following claims that Green’s company paid two staff about £1m each to settle sexual harassment and racial abuse claims.The allegations include that the billionaire groped a female employee and told a black executive that his “problem” was that he was still “throwing spears in the jungle”. Two other female employees received hundreds of thousands of pounds each after alleging that Green had grabbed one woman by the face and put another in a headlock.Brady, a Conservative peer, was chair of Taveta Investments, the company that ultimately owns the Green family empire of Topshop, Miss Selfridge and Dorothy Perkins outlets.A star of The Apprentice and campaigner for “strong female leadership”, Brady quit following mounting pressure to speak out against Green. She refused to explain why she had resigned. Taveta also announced the resignation of the non-executive director Sharon Brown, an experienced retail executive.Phillips, the MP for Birmingham Yardley, who sits on the women and equalities committee and backbench business committee, said: “Karren Brady will still have to answer to what went on under her watch and so she should, but it is Green who is ultimately responsible and, like always, it feels like powerful men can get away with anything.”Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat leader, said Brady “has decided she can’t defend the indefensible”.Green, 66, who was described by a committee of MPs as the “the unacceptable face of capitalism” for his role in the collapse of BHS, has said he “categorically” denies any “unlawful sexual or racist behaviour”.The Dragon’s Den star Duncan Bannatyne had described Brady as a “hypocrite” for continuing to work for Green despite using her high profile to attack “serial predators” such as the Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein, the actor Kevin Spacey and the former minister Michael Fallon.“I think it’s disgusting that she’s on the payroll of a billionaire who hasn’t got a great history with women,” Bannatyne said this month.Brady had refused to quit, saying two weeks ago: “I hope you would agree that walking away is the easy thing to do staying in the role and ensuring the company is robust going forward is much harder.”Brady, who has built a reputation as one of the UK’s most prominent and successful female business leaders, has a track record of publicly shaming powerful men accused of sexual harassment.She denounced Weinstein as “a serial predator with such colossal amounts of power that people think they have no choice but to put up with grotesque advances if they want a career in Hollywood”.“Lots of men are asking: ‘When is it appropriate to touch a colleague?’ If you are in doubt, how about … NEVER?”In another column, she wrote: “It’s not just film. There is a Harvey Weinstein in every industry – the man at the top who abuses their power, who has no respect for women, who thinks women owe him something and it is a perfectly reasonable trade-off to exchange sex for work.”Brady has not spoken about the allegations against Green. In her book Strong Woman, she said: “He is without doubt the most dynamic, the most energetic, the most relentless businessperson I have ever come across, a whirlwind of energy and ideas.”Bannatyne said on Monday that Brady “should be answering questions about what she knew of the alleged non-disclosure agreements”.Green appointed Brady as chair of Taveta in 2017 with a mandate to “beef up corporate oversight” and “sort out” corporate governance problems. She has been on the board of Taveta, which is controlled by Green’s wife, Tina, since 2010.The company said: “Taveta would like to announce that Karren Brady and Sharon Brown (in their respective capacities as non-executive chairman and non-executive director) have resigned from its board. Taveta thanks them for their contribution and wishes them well for the future.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1f69da012dfe6924635beb6d0ea69b799788c8ed/0_0_4752_2851/master/4752.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9d83bb52c76114bf0a0fb7066550a02f","title":"concrete the most destructive material on earth","story":"After water, concrete is the most widely used substance on the planet. But its benefits mask enormous dangers to the planet, to human health – and to culture itselfIn the time it takes you to read this sentence, the global building industry will have poured more than 19,000 bathtubs of concrete. By the time you are halfway through this article, the volume would fill the Albert Hall and spill out into Hyde Park. In a day it would be almost the size of China’s Three Gorges Dam. In a single year, there is enough to patio over every hill, dale, nook and cranny in England.After water, concrete is the most widely used substance on Earth. If the cement industry were a country, it would be the third largest carbon dioxide emitter in the world with up to 2.8bn tonnes, surpassed only by China and the US.The material is the foundation of modern development, putting roofs over the heads of billions, fortifying our defences against natural disaster and providing a structure for healthcare, education, transport, energy and industry.Concrete is how we try to tame nature. Our slabs protect us from the elements. They keep the rain from our heads, the cold from our bones and the mud from our feet. But they also entomb vast tracts of fertile soil, constipate rivers, choke habitats and – acting as a rock-hard second skin – desensitise us from what is happening outside our urban fortresses.Our species is addicted to concrete. We use more of it than anything else except water. Like that other manmade wonder material, plastic, concrete transformed construction and advanced human health. But, as with plastic, we are only now waking up to its dangers.Can we kick our addiction, when it\u0027s so hard to imagine modern life without it? This week  Cities celebrates the aesthetic and social achievements of concrete, while investigating its innumerable harms, to learn what we can\u0026nbsp do to bring about a less grey world.\u0026nbspOur blue and green world is becoming greyer by the second. By one calculation, we may have already passed the point where concrete outweighs the combined carbon mass of every tree, bush and shrub on the planet. Our built environment is, in these terms, outgrowing the natural one. Unlike the natural world, however, it does not actually grow. Instead, its chief quality is to harden and then degrade, extremely slowly.All the plastic produced over the past 60 years amounts to 8bn tonnes. The concrete industry pumps out more than that every two years. But though the problem is bigger than plastic, it is generally seen as less severe. Concrete is not derived from fossil fuels. It is not being found in the stomachs of whales and seagulls. Doctors aren’t discovering traces of it in our blood. Nor do we see it tangled in oak trees or contributing to subterranean fatbergs. We know where we are with concrete. Or to be more precise, we know where it is going: nowhere. Which is exactly why we have come to rely on it.This solidity, of course, is what humankind yearns for. Concrete is beloved for its weight and endurance. That is why it serves as the foundation of modern life, holding time, nature, the elements and entropy at bay. When combined with steel, it is the material that ensures our dams don’t burst, our tower blocks don’t fall, our roads don’t buckle and our electricity grid remains connected.Solidity is a particularly attractive quality at a time of disorientating change. But – like any good thing in excess – it can create more problems than it solves. At times an unyielding ally, at times a false friend, concrete can resist nature for decades and then suddenly amplify its impact. Take the floods in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina and Houston after Harvey, which were more severe because urban and suburban streets could not soak up the rain like a floodplain, and storm drains proved woefully inadequate for the new extremes of a disrupted climate. This touches on the most severe, but least understood, impact of concrete, which is that it destroys natural infrastructure without replacing the ecological functions that humanity depends on for fertilisation, pollination, flood control, oxygen production and water purification.Concrete can take our civilisation upwards, up to 163 storeys high in the case of the Burj Khalifa skyscraper in Dubai, creating living space out of the air. But it also pushes the human footprint outwards, sprawling across fertile topsoil and choking habitats. The bioersity crisis – which many scientists believe to be as much of a threat as climate chaos – is driven primarily by the conversion of wilderness to agriculture, industrial estates and residential blocks.For hundreds of years, humanity has been willing to accept this environmental downside in return for the undoubted benefits of concrete. But the balance may now be tilting in the other direction.The Pantheon and Colosseum in Rome are testament to the durability of concrete, which is a composite of sand, aggregate (usually gravel or stones) and water mixed with a lime-based, kiln-baked binder. The modern industrialised form of the binder – Portland cement – was patented as a form of “artificial stone” in 1824 by Joseph Aspdin in Leeds. This was later combined with steel rods or mesh to create reinforced concrete, the basis for art deco skyscrapers such as the Empire State Building.Rivers of it were poured after the second world war, when concrete offered an inexpensive and simple way to rebuild cities devastated by bombing. This was the period of brutalist architects such as Le Corbusier, followed by the futuristic, free-flowing curves of Oscar Niemeyer and the elegant lines of Tadao Ando – not to mention an ever-growing legion of dams, bridges, ports, city halls, university campuses, shopping centres and uniformly grim car parks. In 1950, cement production was equal to that of steel in the years since, it has increased 25-fold, more than three times as fast as its metallic construction partner.Debate about the aesthetics has tended to polarise between traditionalists like Prince Charles, who condemned Owen Luder’s brutalist Tricorn Centre as a “mildewed lump of elephant droppings”, and modernists who saw concrete as a means of making style, size and strength affordable for the masses.The politics of concrete are less isive, but more corrosive. The main problem here is inertia. Once this material binds politicians, bureaucrats and construction companies, the resulting nexus is almost impossible to budge. Party leaders need the donations and kickbacks from building firms to get elected, state planners need more projects to maintain economic growth, and construction bosses need more contracts to keep money rolling in, staff employed and political influence high. Hence the self-perpetuating political enthusiasm for environmentally and socially dubious infrastructure projects and cement-fests like the Olympics, the World Cup and international exhibitions.The classic example is Japan, which embraced concrete in the second half of the 20th century with such enthusiasm that the country’s governance structure was often described as the doken kokka (construction state).At first it was a cheap material to rebuild cities ravaged by fire bombs and nuclear warheads in the second world war. Then it provided the foundations for a new model of super-rapid economic development: new railway tracks for Shinkansen bullet trains, new bridges and tunnels for elevated expressways, new runways for airports, new stadiums for the 1964 Olympics and the Osaka Expo, and new city halls, schools and sports facilities.This kept the economy racing along at near double-digit growth rates until the late 1980s, ensuring employment remained high and giving the ruling Liberal Democratic party a stranglehold on power. The political heavyweights of the era – men such as Kakuei Tanaka, Yasuhiro Nakasone and Noboru Takeshita – were judged by their ability to bring hefty projects to their hometowns. Huge kickbacks were the norm. Yakuza gangsters, who served as go-betweens and enforcers, also got their cut. Bid-rigging and near monopolies by the big six building firms (Shimizu, Taisei, Kajima, Takenaka, Obayashi, Kumagai) ensured contracts were lucrative enough to provide hefty kickbacks to the politicians. The doken kokka was a racket on a national scale.In his book Dogs and Demons, the author and longtime Japanese resident Alex Kerr laments the cementing over of riverbanks and hillsides in the name of flood and mudslide prevention. Runaway government-subsidised construction projects, he told an interviewer, “have wreaked untold damage on mountains, rivers, streams, lakes, wetlands, everywhere — and it goes on at a heightened pace. That is the reality of modern Japan, and the numbers are staggering.”Traditionalists and environmentalists were horrified – and ignored. The cementation of Japan ran contrary to classic aesthetic ideals of harmony with nature and an appreciation of mujo (impermanence), but was understandable given the ever-present fear of earthquakes and tsunamis in one of the world’s most seismically active nations. Everyone knew the grey banked rivers and shorelines were ugly, but nobody cared as long as they could keep their homes from being flooded.Which made the devastating 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami all the more shocking. At coastal towns such as Ishinomaki, Kamaishi and Kitakami, huge sea walls that had been built over decades were swamped in minutes. Almost 16,000 people died, a million buildings were destroyed or damaged, town streets were blocked with beached ships and port waters were filled with floating cars. It was a still more alarming story at Fukushima, where the ocean surge engulfed the outer defences of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant and caused a level 7 meltdown.Construction firms were once again ordered to hold back the sea, this time with even taller, thicker barriers. Their value is contested. Engineers claim these 12-metre-high walls of concrete will stop or at least slow future tsunamis, but locals have heard such promises before. The area these defences protect is also of lower human worth now the land has been largely depopulated and filled with paddy fields and fish farms. Environmentalists say mangrove forests could provide a far cheaper buffer. Tellingly, even many tsunami-scarred locals hate the concrete between them and the ocean.“It feels like we’re in jail, even though we haven’t done anything bad,” an oyster fisherman, Atsushi Fujita, told Reuters. “We can no longer see the sea,” said the Tokyo-born photographer Tadashi Ono, who took some of the most powerful images of these massive new structures. He described them as an abandonment of Japanese history and culture. “Our richness as a civilisation is because of our contact with the ocean,” he said. “Japan has always lived with the sea, and we were protected by the sea. And now the Japanese government has decided to shut out the sea.”There was an inevitability about this. Across the world, concrete has become synonymous with development. In theory, the laudable goal of human progress is measured by a series of economic and social indicators, such as life-expectancy, infant mortality and education levels. But to political leaders, by far the most important metric is gross domestic product, a measure of economic activity that, more often than not, is treated as a calculation of economic size. GDP is how governments assess their weight in the world. And nothing bulks up a country like concrete.That is true of all countries at some stage. During their early stages of development, heavyweight construction projects are beneficial like a boxer putting on muscle. But for already mature economies, it is harmful like an aged athlete pumping ever stronger steroids to ever less effect. During the 1997-98 Asian financial crisis, Keynesian economic advisers told the Japanese government the best way to stimulate GDP growth was to dig a hole in the ground and fill it. Preferably with cement. The bigger the hole, the better. This meant profits and jobs. Of course, it is much easier to mobilise a nation to do something that improves people’s lives, but either way concrete is likely to be part of the arrangement. This was the thinking behind Roosevelt’s New Deal in the 1930s, which is celebrated in the US as a recession-busting national project but might also be described as the biggest ever concrete-pouring exercise up until that point. The Hoover Dam alone required 3.3m cubic metres, then a world record. Construction firms claimed it would outlast human civilisation. But that was lightweight compared to what is now happening in China, the concrete superpower of the 21st century and the greatest illustration of how the material transforms a culture (a civilisation intertwined with nature) into an economy (a production unit obsessed by GDP statistics). Beijing’s extraordinarily rapid rise from developing nation to superpower-in-waiting has required mountains of cement, beaches of sand and lakes of water. The speed at which these materials are being mixed is perhaps the most astonishing statistic of the modern age: since 2003, China has poured more cement every three years than the US managed in the entire 20th century.Today, China uses almost half the world’s concrete. The property sector – roads, bridges, railways, urban development and other cement-and-steel projects – accounted for a third of its economy’s expansion in 2017. Every major city has a floor-sized scale model of urban development plans that has to be constantly updated as small white plastic models are turned into mega-malls, housing complexes and concrete towers.But, like the US, Japan, South Korea and every other country that “developed” before it, China is reaching the point where simply pouring concrete does more harm than good. Ghost malls, half-empty towns and white elephant stadiums are a growing sign of wasteful spending. Take the huge new airport in Luliang, which opened with barely five flights a day, or the Olympic Bird’s Nest stadium, so underused that it is now more a monument than a venue. Although the adage “build and the people will come” has often proved correct in the past, the Chinese government is worried. After the National Bureau of Statistics found 450 sq km of unsold residential floor space, the country’s president, Xi Jinping, called for the “annihilation” of excess developments.Empty, crumbling structures are not just an eyesore, but a drain on the economy and a waste of productive land. Ever greater construction requires ever more cement and steel factories, discharging ever more pollution and carbon dioxide. As the Chinese landscape architect Yu Kongjian has pointed out, it also suffocates the ecosystems – fertile soil, self-cleansing streams, storm-resisting mangrove swamps, flood-preventing forests – on which human beings ultimately depend. It is a threat to what he calls “eco-security”.Yu has led the charge against concrete, ripping it up whenever possible to restore riverbanks and natural vegetation. In his influential book The Art of Survival, he warns that China has moved dangerously far from Taoist ideals of harmony with nature. “The urbanisation process we follow today is a path to death,” he has said.Yu has been consulted by government officials, who are increasingly aware of the brittleness of the current Chinese model of growth. But their scope for movement is limited. The initial momentum of a concrete economy is always followed by inertia in concrete politics. The president has promised a shift of economic focus away from belching heavy industries and towards high-tech production in order to create a “beautiful country” and an “ecological civilisation”, and the government is now trying to wind down from the biggest construction boom in human history, but Xi cannot let the construction sector simply fade away, because it employs more than 55 million workers – almost the entire population of the UK. Instead, China is doing what countless other nations have done, exporting its environmental stress and excess capacity overseas.Beijing’s much-vaunted Belt and Road Initiative – an overseas infrastructure investment project many times greater than the Marshall Plan – promises a splurge of roads in Kazakhstan, at least 15 dams in Africa, railways in Brazil and ports in Pakistan, Greece and Sri Lanka. To supply these and other projects, China National Building Material – the country’s biggest cement producer – has announced plans to construct 100 cement factories across 50 nations. This will almost certainly mean more criminal activity. As well as being the primary vehicle for super-charged national building, the construction industry is also the widest channel for bribes. In many countries, the correlation is so strong, people see it as an index: the more concrete, the more corruption.As elsewhere, the craze for concrete in South America’s biggest nation started benignly enough as a means of social development, then morphed into an economic necessity, and finally metastasised into a tool for political expediency and inidual greed. The progress between these stages was impressively rapid. The first huge national project in the late 1950s was the construction of a new capital, Brasília, on an almost uninhabited plateau in the interior. A million cubic metres of concrete were poured on the highlands site in just 41 months to encase the soil and erect new edifices for ministries and homes.This was followed by a new highway through the Amazon rainforest – the TransAmazonia – and then from 1970, South America’s biggest hydroelectric power plant, the Itaipu on the Paraná river border with Paraguay, which is almost four times bulkier than the Hoover Dam. The Brazilian operators boast the 12.3m cubic metres of concrete would be enough to fill 210 Maracaña stadiums. This was a world record until China’s Three Gorges Dam choked the Yangtze with 27.2m cubic metres.With the military in power, the press censored and no independent judiciary, there was no way of knowing how much of the budget was siphoned off by the generals and contractors. But the problem of corruption has become all too apparent since 1985 in the post-dictatorship era, with virtually no party or politician left untainted.For many years, the most notorious of them was Paulo Maluf, the governor of São Paulo, who had run the city during the construction of the giant elevated expressway known as Minhocão, which means Big Worm. As well as taking credit for this project, which opened in 1969, he also allegedly skimmed $1bn from public works in just four years, part of which has been traced to secret accounts in the British Virgin islands. Although wanted by Interpol, Maluf evaded justice for decades and was elected to a number of senior public offices. This was thanks to a high degree of public cynicism encapsulated by the phrase most commonly used about him: “He steals, but he gets things done” – which could describe much of the global concrete industry.But his reputation as the most corrupt man in Brazil has been overshadowed in the past five years by Operation Car Wash, an investigation into a vast network of bid-rigging and money laundering. Giant construction firms – notably Odebrecht, Andrade Gutierrez and Camargo Corrêa – were at the heart of this sprawling scheme, which saw politicians, bureaucrats and middle-men receive at least $2bn worth of kickbacks in return for hugely inflated contracts for oil refineries, the Belo Monte dam, the 2014 World Cup, the 2016 Olympics and dozens of other infrastructure projects throughout the region. Prosecutors said Odebrecht alone had paid bribes to 415 politicians and 26 political parties.As a result of these revelations, one government fell, a former president of Brazil and the vice president of Ecuador are in prison, the president of Peru was forced to resign, and dozens of other politicians and executives were put behind bars. The corruption scandal also reached Europe and Africa. The US Department of Justice called it “the largest foreign bribery case in history”. It was so huge that when Maluf was finally arrested in 2017, nobody batted an eyelid.Such corruption is not just a theft of tax revenue, it is a motivation for environmental crime: billions of tonnes of CO2 pumped into the atmosphere for projects of dubious social value and often pushed through – as in the case of Belo Monte – against the opposition of affected local residents and with deep concerns among environmental licensing authorities.Chatham House predicts urbanisation, population growth and economic development will push global cement production from 4 to 5bn tonnes a year. If developing countries expand their infrastructure to current average global levels, the construction sector will emit 470 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide by 2050, according to the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate.The dangers are recognised. A report last year by Chatham House calls for a rethink in the way cement is produced. To reduce emissions, it urges greater use of renewables in production, improved energy efficiency, more substitutes for clinker and, most important, the widespread adoption of carbon capture and storage technology – though this is expensive and has not yet been deployed in the industry on a commercial scale.Architects believe the answer is to make buildings leaner and, when possible, to use other materials, such as cross-laminated timber. It is time to move out of the “concrete age” and stop thinking primarily about how a building looks, said Anthony Thistleton.“Concrete is beautiful and versatile but, unfortunately, it ticks all the boxes in terms of environmental degradation,” he told the Architects Journal. “We have a responsibility to think about all the materials we are using and their wider impact.”But many engineers argue that there is no viable alternative. Steel, asphalt and plasterboard are more energy intensive than concrete. The world’s forests are already being depleted at an alarming rate even without a surge in extra demand for timber.Phil Purnell, a professor of materials and structures at Leeds University, said the world was unlikely to reach a “peak concrete” moment.“The raw materials are virtually limitless and it will be in demand for as long as we build roads, bridges and anything else that needs a foundation,” he said. “By almost any measure it’s the least energy-hungry of all materials.”Instead, he calls for existing structures to be better maintained and conserved, and, when that is not possible, to enhance recycling. Currently most concrete goes to landfill sites or is crushed and reused as aggregate. This could be done more efficiently, Purnell said, if slabs were embedded with identification tags that would allow the material to be matched with demand. His colleagues at Leeds University are also exploring alternatives to Portland cement. Different mixes can reduce the carbon footprint of a binder by up to two-thirds, they say.Arguably more important still is a change of mindset away from a developmental model that replaces living landscapes with built environments and nature-based cultures with data-driven economies. That requires tackling power structures that have been built on concrete, and recognising that fertility is a more reliable base for growth than solidity.

A lot has happened since: Moonlight memorably won the best picture Oscar two years ago Mahershala Ali and Viola Davis have won supporting actor prizes and Jordan Peele has a best original screenplay gong. Alongside them, several other black artists have been nominated.But the OscarsSoWhite campaign was not meant merely as a tick-box exercise in counting the number of nominations. It was meant to make Hollywood rethink how it tells black people’s stories, and to reward black artists in the best possible way – by giving them the chance to have their voices heard.So it feels like a major step backwards that this year Hollywood gave its most prestigious Oscar – best picture – to a nostalgic tale of a racist white driver somehow “saved” by his black passenger. Though the driver (Tony Vallelonga, played by Viggo Mortensen) is a former bouncer, and the passenger (Don Shirley, played by Ali) a concert pianist, it’s Mortensen who is centre-stage, and received a nomination for best actor. Though Ali did win an Oscar, it was in the supporting actor category. The movie is written by Vallelonga’s real-life son and the award was accepted on stage by its white-dominated producers.The movie, set in the early 1960s, much of it in the racially segregated southern states, fits almost perfectly into the Hollywood template. That is, black movies should be set a long time in the past, when things were really bad for black folk, so the audience can leave with a nice warm feeling: “Haven’t we come a long way? Aren’t we doing so well today?”Their enduring message is that racism is all about bigots who beat up black people and shout “nigger”. Everyone who doesn’t do that is some kind of woke hero. There’s never any lesson for modern audiences on how they may be perpetuating racism, or be blind to its subtleties. For Green Book read: Selma, Fences, Loving. Even the more enlightened movies (Moonlight, If Beale Street Could Talk) can leave the audience feeling, “Gee, it must be miserable being black!”That’s why it was so great to see Peele’s Get Out break the mould in 2017 (the white girlfriend’s creepy white friends all told the central black character, “You know, I voted for Obama”). Building on this, last year’s standout movie was Black Panther. Its celebration of black culture, and African-ness, has catapulted the spirit of Wakanda through the black diaspora.Above all, what makes Green Book such a bad choice is that it’s a full 30 years since its road trip predecessor, Driving Miss Daisy, scooped the best picture Oscar. That similarly saccharine take on racism – this time using a white passenger and black driver – at least had the excuse that the world was far more ignorant then. Does Hollywood really consider a crude re-run the best it can do? It sends a message that, three decades on, it has learned nothing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60efcaa55d6b1e2c5de4913a140031552bc59183/0_21_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ad22e6bc562ab60db396fa970312bac5","title":"labour brexit jeremy corbyn public vote remain","story":"Jeremy Corbyn has at last promised a public vote. He needs to campaign hard for the significant majority who want to remainSliding closer day by day, you can hear the swelling excitement of the catastrophists at the thrilling prospect of a no-deal smash-out. Into the unknown! Hurl all the old certainties into the air and see what new patterns the broken fragments make on the floor! Break all rules, start again, bring on the Brexit revolution!They take no heed when the Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, cautioned them on Monday: “We are sleep-walking into no-deal scenario. It’s unacceptable and your best friends have to warn you. Wake up. This is real.” European council president Donald Tusk and Irish prime minister Leo Varadkar added warnings of a “chaotic Brexit”, the grown-ups trying to restrain the out-of-control teenagers punching each other up inside what purports to be the British government. Since there can’t be a reopening of the withdrawal agreement or a breaking of the backstop in the Irish border settlement, Tusk says: “It’s absolutely clear that there is no majority in the House of Commons to approve a deal.” So Theresa May tiptoes closer to the edge, at serious risk of an accidental last-minute plunge.Sniff the air and you can sense among some a dangerous appetite for chaos, a ghoulish curiosity to see what no-deal would do. Naturally, Tory extremists and Ukippers eagerly anticipate the anarchy of their low-tax, roll-back-the-state, free-trading brave new world. But among some of the Labour leader’s allies, especially the Unite coterie, you could sometimes sniff it too – that old revolutionary taste for the sound of breaking glass: out of chaos, a new dawn. The worse the national disaster, the more certain that the Tories will be rendered unelectable for a generation. Mercifully, Jeremy Corbyn has swerved away from that with his promise of a “public vote”. Sometimes there’s a hint of longing for revenge among the angriest remainers. Let the right face the full horror of a no-deal Brexit: a crash-out would expose their referendum lies. Watch them squirm to explain empty-shelf food riots and deaths from medical shortages as a price worth paying for British nationalist fantasies. How else will Britain finally learn the value of European comradeship? You see the temptation – but national shame rarely leads to a better political climate.Mercifully, most MPs are not no-dealers and will try their damnedest to prevent crashing out. On Wednesday Yvette Cooper and Oliver Letwin are set to take on the battle to rule out no deal, with an amendment giving parliament a vote to delay withdrawal if Theresa May fails to win a deal by 13 March. With a Labour whip behind it, it should pass, with many fewer Labour rebels this time. Faced with a choice of an unprecedented rebellion inside her government, May looks ready to offer her own promise of a two-month delay if her deal fails. Will that buy off her rebels? It surely shouldn’t, only inching us two months away from a no-deal abyss.So, after an excruciatingly lengthy wait, here at last is backing for a new referendum from Corbyn. He will put up a Labour soft Brexit motion – likely to fail – but then he will need to back Peter Kyle and Phil Wilson’s amendment, which is the cleverest escape from this impasse. It would nod through May’s deal on 12 March – but only in exchange for letting voters confirm this is indeed their will. There is a better chance this one could win cross-party support if, on 12 March, it’s the last chance of saving the country from leaving with no deal.The defection of eight Labour MPs to the Independent Group seems to have had a big effect, breaking the obstinacy of the leadership team. Today the pressure mounted further, with deputy leader Tom Watson talking of setting up a social democratic grouping, and Momentum’s chair, Jon Lansman, openly criticising the leadership over antisemitism. It seems to have finally jolted Corbyn into action. A deepening ide between shadow chancellor John McDonnell and Corbyn over a range of issues has been brewing, but failure to back the KyleWilson plan would be the breaking point for many in Labour, with frontbenchers among those poised to resign. MPs have shown me an avalanche of emails from local party members resigning over Corbyn’s Brexit feebleness. Shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer has been the hero of this long march to a sane outcome, soldiering on, pushing, pulling, persuading his leader, as Labour supporters began to suspect Corbyn was himself a Brexiteer. From now on, Labour’s over-riding mission is to do all it can to prevent any kind of Brexit, and let voters decide.They want Brexit done and dusted now.But when it is explained that after leaving, still longer and more complex trade negotiations lie ahead, that, says Cooper, “brings focus groups to horrified silence”. Leavers and remainers say they had no idea how difficult leaving would be: none of us did. Where do voters stand now? Few switch sides, but the switchers all move towards remain. Those who didn’t vote but would do so next time break 3:1 for remain."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7077c0833ee3fb14a2cd12b8f99a1a7aa0ea1ae1/0_0_3035_1819/master/3035.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=82587ed3198c70c497b04f30b8569438 1400w","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of smooth","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘smooth’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘smooth’.Share your photos of what smooth means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 27 February at 10am.

Trucks ferry massive rocket props, machinery grinds as it would in any construction zone, the sky is a crystal blue. The scene is, in a word, vibrant – so startlingly alive that for the first few minutes, I wasn’t sure if I was watching footage from 1969 or a Nasa promo shot from last year.That present-ness is one of the film’s major feats, credit due to director Todd Douglas Miller, who has found a brilliant way to portray the first moon landing by doing nothing more than the gargantuan task of faithfully rejuvenating the historical record. The documentary is seamless curation of archival work Miller and his team, in partnership with Nasa and the National Archives, sifted through 11,000 hours of uncatalogued audio and restored reams of original film, including hyper-detail 70mm footage that languished in the archives, boxed up and forgotten, since 1969. The result is a stunning project of historical preservation – no narration, no cutaway interviews, no recreations, just original material synced with some music and the occasional diagram.Apollo 11 arrives early in the mission’s 50th anniversary year, which means the significance of the nation’s space program, from JFK’s promise to put a man on the moon to the famous television broadcast of Neil Armstrong’s first steps, will be under review. Already, the Apollo missions have proved fertile territory for filmmakers Damien Chazelle’s Armstrong biopic, First Man, offered a deeply studied take on the astronaut and his time in space, while documentaries such as Mission Control: The Unsung Heroes of Apollo combined archives with present-day interviews. Both set a steep goal of bringing an event so entrenched and replicated in the American cultural lexicon to life so it’s a bit ironic that the filmmakers of the all-archive Apollo 11, who step so far back in 1969 as to be nearly invisible, achieve it.The 93-minute film is anchored by four pivotal moments in the Apollo 11 mission: lift-off, landing the Eagle rover on the moon, reconnecting Eagle with the Columbia spacecraft to return home, and re-entry into Earth’s atmosphere. We already know the outcome of these risks, and yet the sequences are still mesmerizing. With a score that ranges from swelling orchestra to a single thump, thump, thump of a heartbeat, coupled with stitches of headset and Mission Control recordings, the movie’s technical spacecraft scenes are less suspense baits than genuinely moving, hypnotic odes to teamwork.The film’s emotional power, however, comes not in the documentation of astronauts in space (though that is, of course, undeniably arresting, even half a century on), but in the absolutely incredible footage of the crowds who watched the launch from Earth. Miller’s team meticulously restored wide-lens footage, taken by Nasa’s team on the morning of 16 July, of the nearly 1 million people who gathered on the shores of Florida to watch the take-off the result is a luminous portal into another, more bouffanted America, one far away, with its old cars and outdated Penney’s logo, but with familiar parking lot parties.The Apollo 11 mission looms so large in American lore – “one small step for man,” you can fill in the rest – that it seems like a tremendous act of respect on behalf of the film-makers to ground the nine-day mission in its quotidian, idiosyncratic, and sometimes (in the case of the astronauts’ press tour) hammy moments. Apollo 11 juxtaposes massive feats of scale – groundbreaking engineering, built with thousands of minds in cooperation – with mid-century modern ketchup packets and outdated bathing caps. That Miller’s film allows you, without commentary, to make meaning of these contrasts — the whole of Earth in one shot, a parking lot PB\u0026ampJ snack shack in another – feels like a radical act of trust.I keep waiting to find a fault with Apollo 11, as I usually have to do with things I love at first glance. And while there are legitimate criticisms of America’s space program, it’s hard to argue with a film that defers so humbly to the primary source material. There’s a deep pleasure, especially now, in immersive historical voyeurism, in the illusion that we can transcend the limitations of our own time and understand another collective experience. And there’s something deeply kind in letting the archives stand on their own, of giving the evidence we have of what happened in July 1969 the space to breathe. Perhaps it’s that space – a record of people and incredulity and intense focus, without talking heads or hyperbole – that’s the great humanizing force of Apollo 11."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18ca2bdd5d4b86e247cc88eca3ee9fcaa376c11c/0_111_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e6efd00121e96bc90c5b7ecf1957b773","title":"lets do the right thing how spike lee became hollywoods political conscience","story":"The BlacKkKlansman director missed out on the best picture Oscar, but with US politics more ided than ever he remains the fearless voice the industry needs‘What’s Spike Lee going to have to say about this?” That was the first question on many minds after the initial shock of Green Book winning the best picture Oscar. We were just waiting for a reaction shot of Lee, applauding resignedly at history repeating itself. It was nearly 30 years ago that Lee was in a similar situation, when the anodyne, feelgood civil rights film Driving Miss Daisy won best picture, while Lee’s exhilarating Do the Right Thing went home empty-handed. Green Book was this year’s Driving Miss Daisy. While Lee’s considerably more confrontational BlacKkKlansman – also nominated for best picture – didn’t go home empty-handed, it must have felt like insult added to injury. According to the reporter Andrew Dalton, Lee was “visibly angry” at the announcement, “waving his arms in disgust and appearing to try to storm out of the Dolby theatre before he was stopped at the doors”.Ironically, at first glance, Green Book and BlacKkKlansman have much in common. Both are set in the recent past and tackle US racism via a reluctant friendship between a black man and a white man. But where Green Book falls firmly into the category you could call “Isn’t it great how we’re not as racist as we used to be” movies, BlacKkKlansman concludes the opposite. Its sting-in-the-tail coda – footage from the 2017 white-nationalist march in Charlottesville, North Carolina, cheered on by the Ku Klux Klan – is a reminder that the US is every bit as racist as it used to be. Green Book finished with a wishful, small-scale racial truce BlacKkKlansman delivered a harder, less convenient truth.At the awards ceremony, Lee served a similar function to his movie. This time, at least, he received the Oscar for best adapted screenplay – and used his acceptance speech to inject a dose of bubble-bursting realism into a ceremony that seemed hell-bent on eradicating it. Lee invoked Black History Month, the genocide of Native Americans and the 400th anniversary of his ancestors arriving on American shores, “stolen from mother Africa and brought to Jamestown, Virginia”. He ended on an unambiguously current note: “The 2020 presidential election is around the corner. Let’s all mobilise, let’s all be on the right side of history. Make the moral choice between love versus hate. Let’s do the right thing!” Inevitably, Donald Trump tweeted back, complaining about Lee’s “racist hit on your president” and listing his own (self-identified) achievements for African Americans, as if there were any question over whose word African-American voters would trust more.Lee was not quite a lone voice in referencing politics at the Oscars, even if others did it more obliquely. Javier Bardem mentioned walls and borders (in Spanish) when presenting best foreign film to Alfonso Cuarón, for example, while Rami Malek spoke of his own and Freddie Mercury’s immigrant backgrounds. But the memo for this year’s Oscars seemed to read: “Political correctness: fine actual politics: no, thanks.” In an Academy more hesitant than ever about what it is supposed to do or be, politics is now seen as a ratings loser. This is especially true after 2018’s ceremony, in which the presenter, Jimmy Kimmel, and various award-winners spoke directly about racism, gun control, sexual abuse, women’s rights, immigration and, of course, Trump. The conservative media – Trump included – were quick to equate the 2018 ceremony’s all-time-high political slant with its all-time-low television ratings. Anyone sticking their head above the parapet nowadays risks being labelled a pampered Hollywood liberal or a posturing bandwagon-jumper – everyone except Lee. Now more than ever, he looks and sounds like Hollywood’s political conscience.Lee has always spoken out and never cared about the consequences. In the course of his career, on screen and off, he has denounced all manner of injustices, including police violence, gun control, Hollywood racism (witness his use of DW Griffith’s The Birth of a Nation in BlacKkKlansman), African-American self-caricature (he has a long-running spat with Tyler “Madea” Perry), and lack of representation within the industry.In 2015, while receiving an honorary Oscar at the Governors’ awards at the height of the #OscarSoWhite debacle, Lee told his audience of Hollywood heavyweights: “Everybody in here probably voted for Obama, but when I go to offices I don’t see no black folks except for the brother man at the security.” The industry needed to have a serious conversation about ersity, he warned. “You better get smart, because your workforce should reflect what this country looks like.”If the Academy thought they had brought Lee on side with the honorary gong, for his contributions to film-making, they were mistaken: Lee went on to boycott the Oscar ceremony proper a few months later, in protest at the lack of African-American nominees. In an open letter, Lee acknowledged his spokesman status, pointing out how his opinions were always sought when it came to Hollywood’s failings. “For too many years, when the Oscar nominations are revealed, my office phone rings off the hook with the media asking my opinion about the lack of African Americans,” he wrote. He advised people to ask the white nominees and studio heads instead.But in the absence of outspoken Hollywood figures, it has never mattered more what Lee has to say. After all this time, he has an authority and standing that few can match. His words matter – and he knows it. Yet you never feel as if Lee is auditioning for a political role or seeking publicity for its own sake (that said, respect for that purple, Prince-homaging outfit). It is more the opposite: Lee will speak his mind even when he knows he shouldn’t.He did exactly that at the post-ceremony press conference, taking questions while admitting he was on his sixth glass of champagne. When someone asked his feelings about Green Book, he took several more swigs from his glass before answering. “Every time somebody’s driving somebody, I lose,” he joked, referencing Driving Miss Daisy.But then, as always, Lee got real. He talked about Heather Heyer, the protester killed at Charlottesville, whose death is featured in the closing moments of BlacKkKlansman. “Her murder was an American terrorist act … and when the president of the United States did not refute, did not denounce the Klan, the alt-right and neo-Nazis … whether we won best picture or not, this film will stand the test of time, being on the right side of history.”It was the second time that evening he used the expression. Throughout his career, Lee has variously been ignored, condemned and ostracised as much as he has been supported, applauded and admired. There is little doubt he is on the right side of history – and that is more important than any award."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6840639df619ab2a540f03ddfe82499fb192e2b9/158_288_1102_661/master/1102.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7b38b449670a8d1cb2a0bb9290a076b0","title":"oscars diary black sheep hollywood glamour","story":"The star of the ’s Oscar-nominated documentary short Black Sheep recounts his whirlwind week in TinseltownWe landed yesterday, but today was the first proper day of Oscar activities, with a screening of Black Sheep for Academy voters at the Museum of Tolerance in Beverly Hills. The MoT is an LA institution dedicated to raising awareness of discrimination and attracts a liberal older audience who love to ask questions. They surrounded us afterwards, many wanting to check that I was OK now. The film is about a time in my life 15 years ago when I moved to an estate in Essex to escape racism and violence and found even more of it out there. I’m a film-maker myself but when I met the director, Ed Perkins, we decided it was better to make a documentary where I could tell my story straight to camera.When people come up to me after screenings, they seem to need that confirmation that, after the upset the last 27 minutes on screen has provoked in them, everything is alright now. People’s reactions to the film can be intense.The screenings are strange events – you’re campaigning for votes, but not really allowed to say you are: you have to stay coy and cool. Voting ends tomorrow, and then maybe we can relax a bit.Tomorrow’s highlight will be meeting up with the fashion designer Ozwald Boateng to get my Oscars suit. This is the kind of unexpected thing that being nominated gets you.Tonight our team attended the official Oscars documentary event where each team of documentary nominees across features and shorts gets five minutes to talk about their film and show a clip from it. Ed and producer Jonathan were first up.This is when the reality of being nominated really hits, with a sudden deluge of glamour and prompting thoughts of who you want to meet. I’m hoping I’ll meet Spike Lee. Apparently he knows about the film.Documentaries aren’t glamorous, they’re often hard grinds. Yet this very personal story is now the reason behind a whirlwind of attention for me. Cameras are being shoved in my face and I’m being asked questions like “What do you want to get out of this week?” The honest answer is to have a bit of a break, eat some good food, have some fun and meet some new people. That didn’t seem to be the answer the camera people wanted … they’d have preferred me to shout: “TO WIN!”We took a lot of photos with giant statues of the gold Oscar man, pulling a variety of silly (and occasionally serious) faces. There’s something strange about seeing the iconic figure up close. His kitschy pose is everywhere and the more you look at it, especially on gigantic replica statues, the weirder it seems. We tried to mimic his pose – you just can’t get it right.A quieter day that meant me my girlfriend, who’s here from Canada, could look for some of LA’s best Nigerian food. This is a hiatus period between the end of voting and all the bigger pre-ceremony glitz. You hear about the big gifting parties, where stars are offered absurd free things and vouchers for beauty services … but those companies aren’t so interested in the short documentary nominees. But we want to find a way to get some free Hollywood swag, it feels like it should be part of the Oscars experience.It was a grey day and felt like the glamour had gone away for a bit after the excitement of last night. But in the evening, we did a screening at Soho House on the Sunset Strip and got an amazing view of LA from up high. As usual, the Q\u0026ampA after felt emotionally intense. We were asked a lot of questions about what the film says about the state of Britain, which is a lot to ask about something that’s just my own personal story. Reliving this hard experience over and over again in such short succession is really hard.We talked about how the ceremony would work and realise we didn’t know who was sitting where. Then we went to the party for all the shorts nominees in a little bar. It was intimate, and a good way to speak to some non-documentary people.We know the big parties have started now because we keep reading about them – but how you get invited when you’re in one of the smallest categories is another question. Polite requests to party organisers are met with a firm rebuke: no, the lists closed weeks ago. Lady Gaga probably doesn’t have this trouble. But we’ve decided not to lose any sleep over it – it’s nice hanging out with each other. I’m just grateful for the experience of being here.Some of our group hiked up to see the Hollywood sign, although it being one of the coldest weeks for decades in LA, no one wants to linger too long. It’s jumpers and big coats for us – not what we signed up for. The evening was a relaxed one away from the Oscars buzz, although our publicist explained a few little details: who gets to go on which red carpet on the day. You imagine it’s one long route for everyone, but it’s not – those who get to set foot on the main drag in front of the paparazzi need to justify their presence and get out the way as quickly as possible before the big stars arrive. Apparently me and the director and producer will get to go on the main red carpet. They say you can’t take your own photo and video on the red carpet, but I bet you can.We had a first sense of what an Oscar nomination can get you – in a restaurant some of our group were visiting, we were told there were no free tables. When we mention the nomination, one mysteriously opened up.Today we got to hang out with the British consul, a man who lives in a big house straight out of the Fresh Prince and whose job is to promote British film in Hollywood. He was celebrating the British nominees, accompanied by strong gin cocktails, small sandwiches and scones. Richard E Grant popped in briefly, and some of the craft nominees from The Favourite, Bohemian Rhapsody and Mary Queen of Scots were there – and it was finally a bit warmer. I met one of the producers of The Favourite and the man who set up the documentary voting branch of the Oscars.Everyone seemed to have heard of Black Sheep and they seemed impressed that it wasn’t just the director and producer in our team who were present, but also the person whose story was being told. Apparently some documentary film-makers don’t even thank their subjects when they talk about their films, which seems weird to me.We got some good tips for the ceremony: take snacks, because you won’t get a proper meal, and prepare to be cold in the air-conditioned room designed to keep people awake. We were also touched that on our way to the event, ITV News released a story including an interview with Damilola Taylor’s Dad, Richard, saying how much he wanted us to win. We hope we’ll do right by him.The day started with one item of exciting if bizarre “swag” - a Ruth Bader Ginsburg action doll given away at brunch. She’s not the icon for us that she is for the Americans, but people keep talking about how the documentary about her, RBG, has the momentum behind it. That and Free Solo.Today was also the last Q\u0026ampA we’ll do for a while, at the International Documentary Association DocuDay event. I’m relieved we won’t have to do this again for a while – there’s only so many times in one week you can say the same things. We were on the panel with two other shorts in consideration and the Q\u0026ampA went by in a flash. We signed posters and had loads of photos taken and then realised this was the last event before tomorrow’s ceremony. It all feels so real.People keep telling us we have a good chance, but it’s almost impossible to predict with the shorts awards. Voters don’t talk very much about them, they don’t have the publicity campaigns of the longer films and they’re a lot less political. But you can get excited about the positive predictions. Whatever happens tomorrow, it’s just amazing to be here in this surreal bubble. I feel like I’ve been out here for ages and normal life has stopped. Maybe tomorrow we’ll actually get to go to hang out with some of the Hollywood legends. I never thought I’d be saying that.We didn’t win, but the experience of the Oscars isn’t something I’ll forget any time soon. It’s like nothing else I’ve ever done. After a long week of buildup when I didn’t always feel totally connected to the Oscar razzle-dazzle, suddenly comes this day of being totally part of the spectacle.My girlfriend helped me get ready in the morning, sorting the hair, sorting the jacket, making it all work. Then we met downstairs in the hotel and took a load of photos. It was a warm day and the photos we took by the pool were very Californian – we all looked transformed, like we really were part of the world of Hollywood stars. When you arrive at the Dolby Theater for the event, you feel even more like that. As soon as you get close, there’s streets closed, and when you get out the car, you’re thrown into a world of high-intensity organisation as everyone congratulates you, tells you to get moving, and pushes you towards the red carpet.The group was split straight away, with me, Ed and Jonathan going in the lane for the main red carpet and the rest of our team taken away from the press scrum. It’s a strange situation. Our publicist takes us from interview to interview in the tiered banks of hundreds of press representatives all squashed in, while crowds of members of the public sit in rows of bleachers watching us. We got there early so we were probably part of the initial disappointment before the real stars arrived.Finally, after about two hours, we were on our way into the theatre itself, and there the reality of where you are properly hits: loads of giant Oscar statues, loads of beautifully dressed people and a giant staircase taking you up to the bars and the seats. This feels like proper old-school Hollywood glamour and everyone is loving it. Celebrities are everywhere, and you’re constantly trying to figure out who these vaguely familiar faces belong to. I loved it, seeing so many of my idols around me. I spoke to Spike Lee and Barry Jenkins, who were really nice. There’s an incredible magical vibe in the room.For the ceremony itself, we were down on the ground floor, close to all the action. There’s constant ad breaks breaking up the show but it still feels like there’s a great flow to it. Our category was announced more than halfway through, so there was a lot of waiting around, but I wasn’t that nervous, it was too exciting for that. As our category approached, we were moved with the other short doc nominees to the front of the auditorium right by the stage and you really start to dream. But it wasn’t our name called pit, and we clapped for the team behind Period. End of Sentence, who made a pretty good speech.And then it’s over. But there’s no time to feel sad or disappointed because there’s the rest of the evening to enjoy - you’re whisked to the main ball and the parties full of people letting loose after the tension of the last weeks and months. Everyone scatters to different places: we had a bit of a dance, and then it’s over like a dream. It’s a shame not to win of course, but the cliche about being a winner just by being nominated is so true after this special day."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/031079c32ab0548656496a7cb65037c19723ab28/502_108_3158_1896/master/3158.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=349101966560281ca2411ef639af24d2","title":"black sheep guardian film nominated for best short documentary oscar","story":"Ed Perkins’ film about a young black boy’s response to a racist gang after he moves out of London is up for an Academy awardBlack Sheep, a film commissioned by the , has been nominated for best short documentary at the 2019 Oscars.Directed by Ed Perkins, Black Sheep tells the story of Cornelius Walker, a black 11-year-old from London who moves with his family to a housing estate in Essex after the murder of schoolboy Damilola Taylor in 2000. Walker, the same age as Taylor and of similar background, found himself confronting a gang of local racists and, after first fighting back, went to extraordinary lengths to fit in and gain their friendship.The film features interviews with Walker looking back 15 years on from the events he describes, which are re-enacted in the locations where they took place, with Kai Francis Lewis playing Walker.Responding to the nomination, Walker said that he was, “humbled and proud. I worked on this film to tell my story and hoped that it would resonate with people. To be nominated for this award is the highest recognition.”The film was produced by Simon Chinn and Jonathan Chinn of Lightbox (collaborator on the Whitney Houston documentary Whitney).

They would then be destroyed to make space.”Malcolm Hughes, then the club’s educational welfare officer, admits in a two-page statement that “some of Barry Bennell’s actions could have raised suspicions” and the chairman, John Bowler, acknowledges that Crewe did not fully appreciate the dangers of football being used as a means for a paedophile to prey on young boys.As an insight into how calculating and devious Bennell was, it transpires he was personally responsible for the appointment of Hughes – almost certainly a ploy by Bennell to make it look as though he and Crewe regarded the welfare of the children as a priority.Yet Hughes makes the candid admission that in his early years at Crewe he had only a limited understanding of safeguarding issues. “I certainly did not have the level of awareness that I currently have about the opportunities and potential for child sexual abuse and a need to monitor and check members of staff,” he writes.Bennell was branded “the devil incarnate” and “sheer evil” by a judge after being convicted last year of 50 specimen charges relating to 12 boys from the junior systems of Crewe and Manchester City from 1979 to 1991. It was his fourth prison sentence in the past 25 years and, as the  revealed in September, the man who was described in court as an “industrial-scale child molester” is also facing the possibility of another criminal trial involving nine more complainants alleging child rape. As of January last year, at least 97 people – though the number is now thought to be beyond 100 – had reported Bennell on the back of the interview Andy Woodward, the former Crewe footballer, gave to the  in November 2016, detailing the years of abuse he suffered in the club’s youth system.As well as Gradi, Bowler, Palin and Hughes, Crewe’s then assistant academy director, Terry McPhillips, now manager of Blackpool, and the then kit-man, John Fleet, state among hundreds of pages of evidence that they had never heard any rumour, innuendo or complaints relating to Bennell.As well as his usual salary, Bennell was paid an extra £5 a night per boy in expenses to accommodate them, with up to 12 youngsters sleeping at a house he had turned into a “children’s paradise”. Bennell would show them horror films and had arcade machines, a pool table, a juke box, a monkey, two Pyrenean dogs, an Alsatian named after Zico and even a puma he had bought from Poole zoo.“The simple fact that Bennell had boys staying with him was not out of ordinary for this club,” Gradi writes. “I had (and still have on occasions) boys staying with me and indeed all my coaches have boys staying with them from time to time. One has to appreciate the nature of this club. We do not have endless resources and our boys are often brought through the ranks and stay with the club out of personal loyalty.”As one example, Gradi referenced one youth-team player, who later played for Liverpool and England, who would stay at his own house at weekends and “stayed with Crewe for many years” despite other clubs trying to tempt him away. The player in question is understood to be Danny Murphy, who joined Crewe on schoolboy terms and eventually moved to Liverpool, aged 20, for £1.5m. Crewe no longer operate this practice, in line with modern safeguarding rules.Palin would not let her own son train with Bennell, according to evidence from one witness to the FA’s ongoing inquiry, and makes it clear in a statement from November 2003 that she was uncomfortable in his presence. “I have to say that at the time I did not like him. I cannot put my finger upon what it was that caused me to dislike him. He was just one of those people who, on occasions, one takes an instantaneous dislike to.”Gradi, however, was such an admirer of Bennell he supplied a character reference on behalf of his former colleague when the man he appointed in 1985 was arrested during a tour with the Stone Dominoes youth team to Florida nine years later. Gradi’s initial information was that the rape allegation was “sour grapes” from a disgruntled player.“The first time I believed the allegations was when I went to the local Spa and bumped into the mother of another boy who had been with us. His friend, who had come to us from Manchester City, had apparently told his parents about Bennell, but no complaint had ever been made to either me or this club.” He adds: “Until this case came along I was fairly confident that I knew everything that was going on around the club.”The only complaint about Bennell, according to Gradi, related to the coach’s “authoritarian streak” and one occasion when the youth team were made to “walk home from the countryside after a poor game”. Bowler refers to the same incident, believed to relate to a match at Manchester United when Bennell dropped off a minibus of teenagers at Beeston Castle, 15 miles from Crewe, pointed them in the wrong direction and told them to find their own way back. Several hitch-hiked.“I seem to recall there had been a complaint from a father of one of these boys,” Bowler writes. “I spoke to Dario Gradi about it and Barry Bennell was, to the best of my recollection, reprimanded.”“I do not believe there was the same amount of awareness of the dangers posed by sexual predators such as Barry Bennell. It is fair to say that we, as a club (like the rest of society), did not appreciate many of those dangers at that time, although the general care and safety of the young boys was very important to the club.”As for Bennell’s departure from the club, Gradi’s explanation that it was purely a football matter is followed by other passages appraising him as one of the best talent-spotters in the business. Bennell, he says, was “almost Brazilian” in terms of having “all the skills of tricks and flicks that would get the kids excited”. He had a talent for recruiting youngsters who seemed devoted and loyal to a man with a “lot of charm and a great hold over the boys he had recruited”. Gradi even admits being worried by the possibility that if Bennell ever joined another club the players at Crewe would follow him.“I accept I was responsible for appointing Barry Bennell to the club,” Gradi, who makes no reference to having coached Bennell in Chelsea’s youth system during the early-1970s, writes. “I made no detailed inquiries as to his background before taking him on. From the inquiries that I did make, I gleaned that Barry Bennell was a well-respected coach in the Manchester area and that was good enough for me. He did not have any specific coaching qualifications but none were required and at the time the FA did not publish any guidance on child protection.”Gradi’s ongoing suspension is from all football-related matters while the FA’s inquiry, led by Clive Sheldon QC, investigates what happened at Crewe as well as claims that in his coaching days at Chelsea he visited the house of a 15-year-old youth-team player to “smooth over” a complaint of sexual assault against Eddie Heath, the chief scout who has been identified as a repeat offender."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1b665f10a559f1fc96961fe6732ec45e7580250/47_124_3168_1901/master/3168.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=99e45c2fca8338b1d01f81109bfd9951","title":"david luiz maurizio sarri lift chelsea tottenham","story":"Kepa Arrizabalaga has apologised to the Chelsea head coach, Maurizio Sarri, his teammates and the club’s supporters for refusing to be substituted late in the Carabao Cup final, with the world’s most expensive goalkeeper fined one week’s wages – around £190,000 – for his act of petulance.Chelsea have sought to draw a line under the incident after Arrizabalaga’s show of dissent at Wembley, put down to a misunderstanding in the immediate aftermath of the defeat by Manchester City on penalties, publicly undermined Sarri’s authority. The Italian has found himself under mounting pressure of late with open revolt erupting in the stands over his tactics during the recent FA Cup elimination by Manchester United, and Arrizabalaga’s actions had fuelled the suspicion that a mutinous mood was now spreading on to the pitch.The goalkeeper had twice required treatment during extra time, apparently suffering from cramp – he subsequently suggested he had been buying time for his teammates to recover after a gruelling goalless final – before angrily waving away frantic attempts by Sarri and his assistant, Gianfranco Zola, to replace him with Willy Caballero in the last minute of extra time.His refusal to leave the field prompted a furious reaction from Sarri who, after the final whistle, attempted to confront the 24-year-old and had to be held back by Antonio Rüdiger as the players gathered to compose themselves for the shootout.That was duly lost 4-3, with Arrizabalaga saving from Leroy Sané but allowing Sergio Agüero’s penalty to slip under his body and in.The pair spoke post-match, insisting the incident had stemmed from a breakdown in communication with the £71.3m world-record signing insisting it had “never been my intention to go against the manager”. He subsequently went further on social media: “I have full respect for the coach and his authority.”While no senior players had attempted to usher him off with the fourth official holding up his number and his prospective replacement waiting awkwardly on the touchline, his refusal to leave the pitch is understood to have left teammates distinctly unimpressed.Sarri and Arrizabalaga had attempted to clear the air in the dressing room after media duties had been completed, with the issue addressed again at a team meeting at Cobham before the squad’s warm-down session on Monday.Regardless, the head coach and player still felt compelled to release statements through the club late on Monday night to resolve the issue well in advance of Wednesday’s Premier League game at home against Tottenham.“I was very happy to play in my first cup final for Chelsea and very proud of the team performance,” said Arrizabalaga. “I have thought a lot more about yesterday’s events. Although there was a misunderstanding, on reflection, I made a big mistake with how I handled the situation.“I wanted to take the time today to apologise fully and in person to the coach, to Willy, my teammates and to the club. I have done this and now I want to offer the same apology to the fans. I will learn from this episode and will accept any punishment or discipline the club decides is appropriate.”That amounts to a fine of one week’s wages, which has been donated to the Chelsea Foundation, with the club dropping their customary policy of keeping any internal sanctions private.Sarri had initially criticised the player’s conduct while toeing the party line over the misunderstanding, but has now received a personal apology.“Kepa and I have spoken about the incident,” he said. “It was a good conversation. There was a misunderstanding yesterday but he realises he made a big mistake in the way he reacted. He has apologised to me, his team-mates and the club.“It is up to the club if they want to discipline him according to the club rules, but for me this matter is now closed.“The team performance as a whole was extremely positive and it is a shame to see how this incident has overshadowed our efforts in what was a very competitive cup final. Everyone’s focus is now on the next game and we must all now put this behind us.”The Italian’s position at Stamford Bridge remains under serious risk, even after his team’s more encouraging showing at Wembley against a City side who had thrashed them 6-0 two weeks previously. Yet the goalless draw was achieved playing far more pragmatic, counterattacking football more akin to the approach of previous Chelsea managers than Sarri’s preferred style.Defeat against Spurs could leave his team six points adrift of the top four, putting his job prospects in doubt with the England assistant manager and former Chelsea coach, Steve Holland, the favourite to take over on an interim basis until the summer if Sarri is dismissed seven months into a three-year contract.David Luiz had led the public show of support in their beleaguered head coach in the aftermath of Sunday’s loss, insisting he retains the support and respect of the group. “The coach has the power over the group and he has our respect,” said the Brazil centre-half. “For me, there is not a problem here with that. We all believe in his philosophy. We all believe in the way he wants us to play.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/09cd105911f0d17e9476401f866e1c947efbf463/0_89_1182_709/master/1182.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=38316a4a6573afc40e878fbea2b7d39e","title":"emiliano sala plane fell thousands of feet in seconds investigators say","story":"AAIB queries whether pilot David Ibbotson was licensed to carry footballerThe plane that crashed in the Channel carrying the Cardiff City footballer Emiliano Sala fell thousands of feet in the space of 20 seconds after making a 180-degree turn, minutes after the pilot requested a descent, air accident investigators have found.The wreckage of the Piper Malibu light aircraft was found on the seabed 30 metres from where final radar readings located it at an altitude of 1,600ft (488 metres), suggesting it dropped almost vertically in its final moments, according to an interim report from the Air Accident Investigations Board.Investigators have not concluded what caused the plane to crash, but the pilot requested a descent four minutes earlier, apparently to avoid cloud and maintain vision. Unconfirmed radar readings indicate the plane may have climbed rapidly before its final descent.The AAIB said its ongoing investigation would focus on trying to understand the radar readings from the last moments of the flight, as well as analysing the possible contribution of bad weather.Investigators have also queried the legal status of the flight and the pilot’s licence to carry Sala. “We are also concerned to discover that the trip involved an aircraft which did not conform to either UK Civil Aviation Authority or US Federal Aviation Administration requirements for commercial activity and therefore may have been operating unlawfully. We welcome further investigation into the accident.” Sala, 28, died of head and trunk injuries, according to a postmortem examination, when the aircraft crashed at 8.16pm on 21 January on its way from Nantes to Cardiff.The missing pilot, David Ibbotson, 59, has yet to be located. The wreckage of the fuselage – in three pieces, with wings and tailfin missing – was found on the seabed, 68 metres below the surface, off Guernsey in the Channel Islands on 3 February. Sala’s body was recovered and identified three days later.Challenging weather conditions made it too difficult to recover the plane wreckage from the sea, and instead the AAIB obtained evidence from extensive video captured by a remotely operated underwater vehicle. The family of Ibbotson, from Crowle in Lincolnshire, hope that a fresh search for the pilot’s body will begin this week, after an online crowdfunding campaign raised more than £250,000."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dcde53687e5e0b6c37f8358ab36ce79eaa524122/0_94_5328_3196/master/5328.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8481b436d865420d3a15763aafefa487","title":"leicester brendan rodgers manager celtic neil lennon","story":"• Club believe they can hire Rodgers this season• Celtic would demand £5m in compensationLeicester City are stepping up attempts to hire Brendan Rodgers as their new manager immediately, with the club believing there is now the prospect of him being coaxed from Celtic before the end of the season.Rodgers is Leicester’s principal candidate to replace Claude Puel, who was sacked on Sunday. The former Liverpool manager has privately insisted he will finish this season in Glasgow, where Celtic remain on course to win a third domestic treble in succession. However, Leicester are keen to push for a quick appointment and thereby prepared to test the resolve both of Celtic and their manager.A compensation figure of £5m has not dissuaded those at the King Power Stadium from an approach. However, it remains to be seen where Rodgers would remain firmly of a mind to complete the season north of the border and, indeed, whether such a stance would be deemed acceptable by Leicester.Rodgers is due to meet with the media on Tuesday, in advance of the Premiership meeting with Heart of Midlothian on Wednesday evening. Any immediate exit from Celtic by the 46-year-old would cause the Scottish champions an unforeseen problem at a key season juncture.Neil Lennon, who departed Hibernian in curious circumstances at the end of January, would be viewed as the most obvious candidate to return to Celtic and replace Rodgers in the short term at least."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1bd8ec82272151d977561f28d907dd2c097c3d42/0_330_4020_2412/master/4020.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b036b8b316bc6d1472a9a1882fffd85f","title":"manchester city quadruple bid carabao cup","story":"It is probably fair to say Manchester City’s in-house team made the fawning soft-focus documentary All or Nothing a year too soon. “Guys we are so close!”. That was your catchphrase. Except, they weren’t really.City won the Premier League by a mile last year thanks to a run of sustained sublime form. But otherwise their season lost its dramatic tension on 4 April when City were eviscerated by Liverpool in the Champions League quarter-final first leg, shrinking the scope of their ambitions to that near-perfect league season. Fast forward 10 months and Sunday’s slow-burn victory in the Carabao Cup final has set up a fascinating point of contrast one of those moments where the background noise starts to fall away and it makes sense, for the first time, to contemplate the wildly improbable.All Or Not Quite Nothing would be a fair billing for the next three months, which are by comparison fretted with intrigue. City have a maximum of 20 matches left to play this season. In the course of which this team has a chance to add the three biggest trophies in English club football, a four-pronged feat that still looks an impossible stretch of luck, resources and the competing claims of every other club in the scrum for honours.Most things do not happen. This one will probably not either. But then very few have ever been this close or, indeed, so close with some key factors in their favour. It was notable when Pep Guardiola was asked about the prospect of a quadruple he did not roll his eyes and say “fuck” as he did two years ago, but instead dismissed the idea in more measured terms.Nobody manages the details like Guardiola. He knows exactly where City stand. The squad is strong. The fixtures are tough but not impossible. City have won 13 of their last 15 games. So, for now, let’s just take a moment to dream.Straight away City have an advantage on timing. The fixtures come thick but not that fast. If they can finish off Schalke in two weeks’ time and get past Swansea in the FA Cup there is one obvious logjam to come. Between 6 April and 24 April City would play six high-pressure games in 19 days, a run that goes: FA Cup semi Champions League quarter-final (first leg) Crystal Palace away Champions League quarter-final (second leg) Tottenham at home Manchester United away.Get through another flurry around the Champions League semi-finals and the season ends in fairly orderly fashion. Brighton away is the final Premier League fixture on 12 May. The FA Cup final is on 18 May. The distant prospect of a Champions League final would round things off on the first day of June.It is an unusually well spaced-out endgame, and a favourable turn for any club caught in the familiar English slog through the spring. By comparison Manchester United’s treble-winning season 20 years ago finished on 26 May, with United required to tie up three trophies in the final 10 days.That United team played seven games in 26 days from the start of May. Should City get as far, they would end with four games in 28 days. Where does the advantage lie? United carried all before them in a glorious adrenal rush, with no time to look down or feel any fear. Could there be another kind of difficulty in that “cold time” between fixtures?There are some more positive lessons to be learned along the way. United had seven different goalscorers in their last seven games, the burden shared as the line approached. And it is here that City also have deeper gears.The only really worrying note is the injury sustained on Sunday by Fernandinho. John Stones’s return from his hamstring twang will also be vital: Vincent Kompany is a great club servant but isolated against a player like Eden Hazard he wheels around like a passenger ferry with a wonky rear thruster these days.On the plus side Bernardo Silva is in excellent shape, all non-stop ferreting intelligence on and off the ball. Left-back has looked like a problem but Oleksandr Zinchenko was magnificent at Wembley. Sergio Agüero is in his absolute pomp right now. Raheem Sterling has five goals and four assists in 10 games, a man running hot at just the right time.Comparisons are of course odious – and indeed meaningless given the complete re-gearing of every part of football’s surfaces from year to year. But with 20 games to win them all, the question will naturally be asked as to where such an achievement would rank.Some will point to the thinning out at the very top, the fact fewer clubs are winning more trophies generally. But it would be incorrect to belittle this as a bought success, a triumph devalued by the extreme amounts of money involved.For a start nobody wins anything these days without spending. That much is a given. Secondly this is above all a City team marked out by the more human elements. To miss the fact Guardiola has improved almost every one of his players, that the team has a system and a way of playing that is thrillingly well-grooved, that City have resisted the urge simply to buy ready-made world stars, is to miss the basic beauty of sport altogether.The one area lacking is some sense of internal, organic growth. Every sporting triumph lacks a little something without an element of home-made talent. United’s treble winners had seven academy products playing regularly in the first team. The greatest British European triumph of all, Celtic in 1967, saw Jock Stein pick a team drawn entirely from the Glasgow districts. City remains a portable project, all outsourced parts, and one that has yet to spawn a regular home-grown City player since the Abu Dhabi takeover. Such is the way of modern football elsewhere too. For now Sunday’s cup final leaves this fine City team 20 games from a sporting feat that will most likely prove beyond them but which has never felt quite so close at hand."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/28d32f26ec236e06b456bf36db1a817e656d39d2/0_0_3121_1873/master/3121.jpg?width=740\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=220dbed4cfd9b43f1d9bea4b55b88b4a 740w","title":"sous vide juicers and toasters the best kitchen appliances to buy","story":"From space-saving cooking solutions to future-facing chefs’ toys, here’s a selection of gadgets to make your kitchen life easierCheck out our discount codes and vouchersA sous vide is one of those chef’s toys you might have always wanted but haven’t been able to justify either the cost or the counter-top space in the kitchen … until now.

Maybe we all need somebody who can be a cheerily oblivious outlet for our antagonismSix in 10 people say they have an archenemy at work, a survey of 7,000 workers has found. The remaining four, I can only assume, must be lying, lacking rich internal lives or between archenemies.No one takes work enemies more seriously than I do, and my perhaps controversial view is that they are not only inevitable, but, approached with the right mindset, a joy.Let me be clear: I am not talking about bullies, narks, saboteurs or anyone who actively strives to make your time at work unpleasant. (The most hated colleagues, according to the Totaljobs survey, were those who took credit for others’ ideas.) That is obviously unacceptable behaviour employers should be attuned to it and committed to flushing it out.I am talking about the colleague you cannot stand, who can be a cheerily oblivious outlet for your innate human pettiness.Of course, you’re a professional about it – you don’t let your private antipathy get in the way of your job, only your closest colleagues know about it and you don’t really wish them harm. In fact, you are extremely nice to them out of spite, while secretly delighting in their inconsequentially misaddressing an email, their saying “would of” instead of “would have” and their criminally unself-aware tweets about #Veganuary. The best workplace nemesis is someone you don’t work with directly, of approximately the same seniority as you, mostly oblivious and ultimately harmless. (I respect those who say the nemesis dynamic is by requisite reciprocal, but in a professional environment, they’re playing with fire.) Also, the dynamic is only sustainable in big offices, where you can surround yourself with people you like.The benefits of having friends at work, not only for employees’ morale and motivation but organisational function, are well known – I’d argue the same applies to enemies. You may well love your job, but let’s not kid ourselves. If work is ever going to be more than something you do for money, you need to be engaged in something other than the actual workaday business of it. A little low-stakes antagonism, lightly worn (and freely shod once you leave the office, lest it fester), motivates you to work harder and be better. If you’re a bit competitive and a lot petty, there is no greater motivation than winning – even if it’s against someone who has no idea that you’re in competition with them.They can even foster better relationships with colleagues: the office enemy of my office enemy is my work friend.The idea, basically, is to write your own workplace sitcom – and no one watched The Office for the paper sales. You need a work spouse (someone you can count on to cheer you on and commiserate with), an office crush (with whom you can harmlessly flirt over Gchat and time your trips to the water fountain with) and an office nemesis to spur you on to greatness.Right now, I am blessed with so many work husbands and wives that I am virtually a professional polygamist (and I also have a delightful office crush), but I am short one subplot. In response to the handful of colleagues who have messaged me this morning asking: “WHO IS IT???”, I regret to say that I am currently sans an office nemesis. But – who knows – perhaps, after reading this, one will make themselves known."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8d3a4be72d444d2676143fc469209c4cc98d49ce/0_0_3500_2333/master/3500.jpg?width=660\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9992714f6d7998d593eb9b2ee731d7a7 660w","title":"are you starting to find it difficult to work in the eu as a uk citizen due to brexit","story":"If you have encountered a problem applying for or moving to a new job because of Brexit, we’d like to hear from youAre you a UK citizen working, short or long-term, in an EU27 country, and have you experienced difficulties applying for or moving to a new job because of your new employer’s doubts about your legal status and right to work in the EU after Brexit?If so, we would like to hear from you.

A press conference in which she only revealed her own inadequacy. Her inarticulacy almost total 15 minutes in which the normal laws of syntax broke down, a public humiliation made all the more excruciating by the lead actor’s almost total lack of self-awareness. Only the hunched shoulders and furtive glances betrayed a primal sense of danger. Her words just words, randomly generated, speaking a different language from her body, a mind body split made in a Cartesian heaven.My name is Theresa May and I’m... She paused, unsure of quite what she was. She checked her notes. That was it, she was the prime minister, even though it had been months – if not years – since she had shown any signs of leadership. But out in the UK badlands, she’d learned that you get what you can get.So we were lumbered with her. For the time being at least. Not that she’d be going quietly: they’d have to come mob-handed to get her out of Downing Street. After all, once Brexit was sorted she still had a domestic agenda to pursue. Yes, she really did hate her country that much.Showing no signs of remorse at having hijacked the first ever meeting of EU and Middle Eastern leaders in Sharm el-Sheikh to talk about Brexit, May blundered on. She’d had some constructive discussions with Donald Tusk, Jean-Claude Juncker and a few others in which absolutely nothing constructive had been discussed. Or to be more accurate, various people had offered her a way out by way of an extension to article 50 but she had just clamped her hands over her ears and said no.“A delay is a delay,” May said gnomically in answer to questions about why she was so reluctant to consider any possible alternative to taking Brexit down to the wire and forcing MPs to either accept her deal that had been already overwhelmingly rejected or end up with something – either a no deal or delayed Brexit – they might like even less. This was the new mantra. Brexit means Brexit. Delay means delay. Anything means nothing. Nothing means anything. A bad deal is better than a no deal.It was logic that would have insulted a five-year old, but still the prime minister persisted. By now she was on full Maybot, as so often, both there and not there. A mechanical presence, spewing automated responses to entirely different questions from the ones she had been asked. There was plenty of time to get Brexit done by 29 March. Hell, there were more than 30 days, so why all the panic? Brexit was within her grasp. It was within the country’s grasp. Aka, still bewilderingly out of reach.That was a high point. From Maybot, her plan descended into terrifying Dr Strangelove: bomb, bomb, bombety bomb. Here was the plan: rather than agreeing a deal with the EU and then trying to get it through parliament, she was going to do the precise opposite. Instead, she was going to come up with whatever deal she could finesse past the European Research Group in her own party and then present it to the EU as a fait accompli.For the first time, May allowed herself a smile. She couldn’t understand why no one else had thought of this. Negotiating international treaties was so much easier when you didn’t have to negotiate with other countries. Rather you just dreamed up your fantasy scenarios and then told Johnny Foreigner what was going to happen to him. The Hun could be forced to give us their BMWs for next to nothing and in return we’d give them Mark Francois and Boris Johnson. The ideal swap. And if that went well, we might even consider annexing the Sudetenland. It had been at least 80 years since anyone had tried that.One reporter made a final attempt to drag May back to an approximation of reality. Could he just get her to focus on Wednesday? Would she be sacking any ministers who voted for the Cooper-Letwin amendment? The prime minister just gave a blank death stare. Wednesday might never happen. Today might not even be Monday. Tuesday might just be a repeat of Sunday. That noise? The sound of one can kicking.Time and space were merely arbitrary constructs, different ways of measuring eternity. You couldn’t run down an imaginary clock that had no past, and no future. All that was clear was that we reaching the end of time. And as with any May press conference, that moment couldn’t come soon enough."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2af8900be20173b6a2917a6f30bb1d0a72fe08a3/451_39_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=074d04c4971a66e1f2cb3122956e8d2a","title":"independent group rules out electing leader until end of year","story":"MPs expected to make decision once group fulfils ambition to become a political party A leader may not be elected to the newly formed Independent Group of MPs until the end of the year when it hopes to have become a political party.The 11 former Labour and Conservative MPs’ first meeting in Westminster selected Gavin Shuker to act as its convener and organise future meetings but while there were initial conversations about roles and responsibilities, there was no serious discussion as to who might become leader.Chuka Umunna, a former Labour frontbencher, has been widely tipped for the role but friends of Heidi Allen, a former Conservative, have been pressing her to put her name forward when the election process begins.Speaking about the leadership, Allen said immediately after the meeting: “You’ll be gagging to learn we’ve started talking about the other jobs and roles and responsibilities.” Anna Soubry, another group member, added: “The most important thing this week is Brexit.”Over the weekend, Umunna sought to put himself forward, saying: “I’m clear I want to play the biggest role in this group.” It appears, however, that his immediate ambition has been rebuffed, at least temporarily.Others have suggested that Luciana Berger, the MP for Liverpool Wavertree, could also take the leading role, although because the group has no grassroots members yet, it is not clear how a leader could be legitimately elected.Insiders said the intention was gradually to turn the Independent Group (TIG) into a political party, and there would be “much more clarity about that by the end of the year” – although some specialist spokesperson roles could be assigned much quicker.Donations are understood to be coming “in the hundreds of thousands”, largely from iniduals giving fairly small sums. The money is likely to be spent on support staff initially.Although the group is not required to, it intends to follow Electoral Commission rules and make regular disclosures, reporting the identity of donors who supply more than £7,500 in one year. This follows accusations it could circumvent existing rules because it is not registered as a political party.TIG will not operate a whip, partly to resolve differences of opinion over other policy areas, although the 11 MPs are strongly aligned in opposing Brexit and supporting a second referendum.The first meeting also agreed that any MPs wishing to join TIG will have to apply. In theory, this would allow its members to block MPs who left Labour amid unresolved harassment claims from joining, including John Woodcock or Ivan Lewis.No further defections are anticipated imminently, although the group hopes that the forthcoming parliamentary battles over Brexit could see other MPs coming forward.TIG has no immediate plans to contest any parliamentary byelections or the council elections due in May. Its 11 members have repeatedly ruled out resigning as MPs and triggering a byelection until its organisation develops.Jo Swinson, the Liberal Democrat deputy leader, said her party needed “to be working together with the Independent Group MPs but we need to find a 2019 way of doing that and I’m open-minded about how that looks”.But despite Lib Dem enthusiasm, TIG MPs said they wanted Lib Dem MPs to quit their party and join them. They argued that the Lib Dem brand has been tarnished by the period when the party under Nick Clegg went into coalition government with David Cameron’s Conservatives."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/661e71bd59f4cfb7fddafb7c4a3f89906c5c06e6/184_116_2503_1502/master/2503.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=050d6a7bc4176adf120d1dde19f7420d","title":"labour to back moves for second brexit referendum","story":"Labour leader tells MPs party will back another vote as last resort to stop Tory dealFollow all the latest on Brexit with our live blogJeremy Corbyn has finally thrown his party’s weight behind a second EU referendum, backing moves for a fresh poll with remain on the ballot paper if Labour should fail to get its own version of a Brexit deal passed this week.The decision to give the party’s backing to a second referendum follows a concerted push by the shadow Brexit secretary, Sir Keir Starmer, and deputy leader, Tom Watson, who fear any further delay could have led to more defections to the breakaway Independent Group (TIG), whose members all back a second referendum.Although the move has delighted MPs who are backing the People’s Vote campaign, Corbyn is likely to face determined opposition from dozens of MPs in leave seats if the party whips to back a second referendum, including a significant number of frontbenchers.The former shadow minister Lucy Powell said she believed at least 25 MPs would vote against any whip to back a second referendum, meaning that it would face an uphill struggle to pass the Commons without significant Conservative support.A private briefing sent to Labour MPs on Monday night and seen by the  makes it clear that Labour’s policy would be to include remain as an option in any future referendum.“We’ve always said that any referendum would need to have a credible leave option and remain,” the briefing said. “Obviously at this stage that is yet to be decided and would have to be agreed by parliament.”The briefing also makes it clear that the party would not support no deal being included on the ballot paper. “There’s no majority for a no-deal outcome and Labour would not countenance supporting no deal as an option,” the briefing says. “What we are calling for is a referendum to confirm a Brexit deal, not to proceed to no deal.”The shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, indicated on Monday evening that both she and Corbyn would campaign for remain if there were a future public vote.“We would have a referendum on whatever deal it is that may or may not pass through parliament and we would be saying to people: ‘Do you want this, or do you want to remain?’” she told Channel 4 News.Thornberry said she “would certainly be campaigning for us to remain” in those circumstances and, when asked if Corbyn shared that view, she added: “If it’s a choice between a disastrous Tory Brexit or no deal, and remaining, then that is what we will have to do.” The redrawing of Labour’s objectives is likely to stem any fresh flood of resignations next week to TIG, whose members include the former Labour MPs Chuka Umunna and Chris Leslie as well as the ex-Tory MP Anna Soubry, all key figures in the People’s Vote movement.Corbyn told MPs the party would back a fresh poll as a final resort in order to stop “a damaging Tory Brexit being forced on the country”. Speaking to MPs on Monday night, a week after seven MPs who backed a referendum quit the party, Corbyn said that Labour would first table its own version of a Brexit deal, including a permanent customs union.That amendment is set to be tabled to the government’s Brexit motion on Wednesday, when Labour will also whip to back another amendment tabled by Yvette Cooper and the Tory Oliver Letwin, which would legislate for a delay to the UK’s exit date in order to avoid no deal.May is expected to make a last-ditch attempt to avoid a serious cabinet rebellion over that amendment this week.  reported last week that at least four Cabinet ministers and almost a dozen junior ministers and many others on the government payroll were ready to rebel and vote for the measure. The prime minister’s most likely option is a pledge to let MPs vote on delaying Brexit if the withdrawal deal does not pass by 12 March, though Cooper and Letwin’s backers have suggested they will reject that approach.Party sources said Labour would not introduce or back any amendment for a second referendum this week, but see the crunch point at the next opportunity – likely to be the next meaningful vote on the Brexit deal that May has promised to hold by 12 March.It is highly unlikely Labour’s amendment on its own Brexit deal will pass on Wednesday, making it almost inevitable the party will move to back another referendum.Corbyn told MPs that Labour “cannot and will not accept” May running down the clock towards no deal. “One way or another, we will do everything in our power to prevent no deal and oppose a damaging Tory Brexit based on Theresa May’s overwhelmingly rejected deal,” he said.“That’s why, in line with our conference policy, we are committed to also putting forward or supporting an amendment in favour of a public vote to prevent a damaging Tory Brexit being forced on the country.”Yet recriminations came from leave-supporting Labour MPs almost immediately in the private meeting on Monday night. John Mann, a Brexit supporter, said the decision to back a second referendum would cost Labour in the Midlands and the north. “The price will stop you being prime minister,” he told the meeting.Outside the meeting, the Labour MP Stephen Kinnock said he had “deep reservations” about the possibility of a second referendum and suggested it would not pass the House of Commons.“I think it would be deeply isive. It has a corrosive impact on the sovereignty of parliament and it is not clear to me still what should be on the ballot paper,” he said.It is understood that about a dozen shadow ministers could consider their positions if Labour whips MPs to back a second referendum.Those who vocally oppose a second referendum include the shadow justice minister Gloria de Piero, shadow housing minister Melanie Onn and shadow education minister Tracy Brabin as well as backbenchers including Caroline Flint, Gareth Snell and Lisa Nandy.A total of 17 Labour MPs, including eight shadow ministers, voted against or abstained on Cooper’s previous amendment to extend article 50 last month.Future Labour support for a second referendum could come in the form of backing for a proposed amendment to the meaningful vote proposed by the Labour MPs Peter Kyle and Phil Wilson.That proposal would approve May’s deal subject to a fresh referendum, though senior Labour officials are thought to be uneasy about backing any amendment that endorses the Tory Brexit deal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3df0a3fa907e9df195b2f7abfdf65a9f738dece3/0_98_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=669a133bab15b3d217065654dcf808ca","title":"what does labour brexit second vote referendum commitment mean","story":"Jeremy Corbyn’s announcement paves the way for the party backing a second referendumYes, in principle. But not quite yet.The party wants MPs to vote on its own Brexit plan on Wednesday first, when the next round of motions about the UK’s withdrawal from the European Union are debated in the Commons.That is expected to be defeated, at which point Labour has announced it is “committed to also putting forward or supporting an amendment in favour of a public vote to prevent a damaging Tory Brexit being forced on the country”.No date has been set for the next round of votes, but Theresa May has said that she will put her Brexit deal to the vote on 12 March. A second referendum amendment is expected then.This is not decided. One possibility is that Labour will back the so-called Kyle-Wilson compromise, an amendment being promoted by two Labour backbenchers, Peter Kyle and Phil Wilson.The essence of their amendment is that Labour would allow May’s Brexit deal to pass the Commons in return for it being subject to approval via a second referendum.But there are deep reservations about the Kyle compromise in some Labour circles because it would involve Labour allowing May’s Brexit deal to pass. When asked about the amendment, a Labour source repeated that the party “would not vote for a damaging Tory Brexit”.Kyle himself says that Labour could abstain to allow May’s deal through but that may not persuade the doubters. On the other hand, without promising that Labour would allow May’s Brexit deal through parliament, there is no realistic prospect of attracting Conservative support.Probably not, although it is not certain. The Manchester Central MP, Lucy Powell, estimated that there would be 25 Labour MPs who would simply not support a second referendum, regardless of how a motion backing it would be phrased.Only a handful of Tories support a second referendum – probably fewer than 10 – so without the support of Downing Street, it remains very unlikely to pass the Commons even with Scottish National party and Liberal Democrat support.The strength of Labour’s move is that it helps bring the parliamentary party together, at a point when the Conservatives are increasingly ided over a no-deal Brexit and the anti-Brexit Independent Group is hoping for more defections from Labour.The principal issue uniting the eight former Labour and three former Conservative MPs in TIG is opposition to Brexit and support for a second referendum. By finally opening the door to supporting a second referendum, Labour closes off their principal selling point."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/afd5974606511bd04eae5dc82ac6a1398f65bd00/42_168_2480_1488/master/2480.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=808c7e2d525123f3380152c432f19005","title":"did you solve it the worlds strangest families","story":"Answers to today’s kinship riddlesEarlier today I set you the following five puzzles.1) Anna’s father has four daughters. The names of the first three daughters are April, May and June. What’s the name of the fourth daughter?Anna, of course! Yes, it’s an old chestnut…2) Two men marry each other’s mothers. What is the relationship between their sons?They are unclenephew to each other. This puzzle dates from the eighth century, and is the earliest of this type of kinship riddle.(I’d also accept the answer posted below the line, which said the relationship would be “quite strained.”)Let’s call the protagonists Man 1 and Man 2, who have mums Mum 1 and Mum 2. The couples are therefore Man 1 and Mum 2, and Man 2 and Mum 1. If the first couple have Son A, and the second couple have Son B, then Son A is half-brother to Man 2, and thus half-uncle to Son B, who is Man 2’s son. It’s easier to see when drawn as a family tree.3) A certain man had great grandchildren, yet none of his grandchildren had any children. How come?The question talks about great grandchildren, not great-grandchildren. The hyphen makes all the difference. The grandchildren were great, top, brilliant and awesome, but childless.4) What’s the smallest possible number of people in a family group that contains a grandfather, a grandmother, two fathers, two mothers, four children, three grandchildren, one brother, two sisters, two sons, two daughters, one father-in-law, one mother-in-law and one daughter-in-law?Seven. Three siblings (two girls and a boy), their parents, and the father’s parents. Again, it is easier to see when drawn as a family tree.5) On one day my friend Olivia has her birthday. Two days later it is the birthday of her elder twin, Oliver. Please explain.Oliver was born on March 1 on a plane flying eastwards over the Pacific. A few seconds later the plane crosses the International Date Line, and Olivia is born. She is thus born on February 28, making her the ‘younger’ sister with a calendar birth date one day before her brother’s. On leap years, however, Olivia will celebrate her birthday two calendar days before her older twin.I hope you enjoyed today’s puzzles.

Owen Farrell is one of the best fly-halves in the world, if not the best, but everyone has off days and he just did not seem to have a feel for the game. We did not see adaptability from England – if one thing is not working, then try something else – and George Ford could have made all the difference.Wales were very good defensively, very well organised by Jonathan Davies in the wide channels and as a result we did not see space opening up out there as we did against France and a little bit against Ireland. Manu Tuilagi had one brilliant run but England needed more of it, Henry Slade was very strong defensively but not involved in the game and the back three were spectators to what was going on inside.When I say that Farrell did not have a feel for the game, he just seemed a bit too wedded to the kicking strategy. On the few occasions that England made dents with their powerful runners, when they did get on top, that was when Farrell needed to keep playing. You have a look to see where it goes, maybe it forces a penalty, maybe it leads to another linebreak but what we saw too often was another kick and it was obviously not working.That led to frustration, the penalty count started to creep up and that was when Ford needed to be introduced. He has a bit more of an attacking mind-set and England would have benefited from that change of direction, just as Wales did when Dan Biggar came on.England did not play particularly badly. It was a game of fine margins. But there was room to play a bit more when they got in behind. Instead they backed their kicking game, which worked perfectly in the first two matches but will never be perfect every time. Rugby just is not like that and even the All Blacks have to adapt if things are not going to plan. You do that by having different options on the bench and trusting them.With Ford on the pitch, England could have moved the point of attack, which would have brought Slade into proceedings. Davies and Hadleigh Parkes defended very well but, when there are 60-70 minutes on the clock, force them to make more tackles on the outside – not just after four or five phases but 10 or 12. Wales clearly targeted Farrell and starved him of space but, if Ford comes on, Farrell shifts to 12 and you then have two playmakers on and he has that little bit more time on the ball. That takes a bit of pressure off Farrell and allows Ford to control the attacking side of things. Farrell still leads as he does but from a different role.The thing with Ford is that you know he is going to move the ball. You still have Slade on the pitch, Elliot Daly, Farrell and Ben Youngs so you have plenty of kicking options as well as a more attacking mind-set, late in the game when there are a few soft shoulders and you tend to get over the gainline a little bit more. Keep playing, move the point of attack, move the Wales forwards around because they are going to be tired after a hell of a shift.Farrell is a world-class player but there is an expectation that these guys should be performing to their very best every single week. The game is so emotional at Test level and it takes a huge toll. England had that incredible performance in Ireland, then followed it up against France. Then you have a week off and it can often come at the wrong time. You are on such a high, then you all take a breath and then you have to come back up all over again. As Alun Wyn Jones said afterwards, Wales do not want this fallow week. They are on a roll, 12 wins in a row, and they want to keep those emotional levels high.Warren Gatland said it – Wales have forgotten how to lose and that is a great characteristic to have. They are like junkyard dogs, they scrap and fight for everything, Shaun Edwards has the defence very organised, they knew England were going to kick and they prepared for it. They exited on their terms, they won the aerial battle and they looked after the ball so much better than they did against France and Italy. They are the favourites now, the team to beat but that expectation brings a whole new set of pressures, from within and externally."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4662f61317ea0f71b4fe2db937d89d8512ccd482/0_367_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9443bc31b89a127deac0e1c10919e89e","title":"glory review dukes lancaster racism wrestling sport nick ahad","story":"Dukes, LancasterThree young fighters grapple with a world of blue-eyed heroes and foreign-looking villains in Nick Ahad’s witty playReal life has a way of sneaking into the theatre. Only days after Angela Smith appeared to use the phrase “funny tinge” to refer to people from minority ethnic backgrounds, the former Labour MP’s remark makes an appearance in this collaboration between the Dukes, Red Ladder and Tamasha. The comment is a good fit for Nick Ahad’s play, which is knowingly structured like a racist joke from the 1970s – the kind that would have begun: “This black lad, this Chinese lad and this Syrian walk into a gym.”As it happens, the owner of that gym, a wrestling has-been once celebrated under the fighting name of Jim Glory, makes it a rule for his proteges to keep real life out of the ring. Played by Jamie Smelt with a delusional, David Brent-like sense of his own worth, he believes in simple narratives, the instant goodie-versus-baddie stories that keep wrestling fans baying. He doesn’t want the complications of people’s actual experience when he can have the easy stereotypes of blue-eyed heroes and foreign-looking villains. For him, wrestling is show business, appealing to the gut not the head and, he reckons, all the more perfect an artform for it.His problem is with his fighters, who can’t help but bring real life in with them. Joshua Lyster’s Ben, Josh Hart’s Dan and Ali Azhar’s Sami are all victims and perpetrators of racial discrimination, pigeonholing each other even as they cry foul about the injustices they suffer. What all of them lack is the chance to be heroes of their own stories. For as long as the white leading man – or “babyface” – remains the norm in wrestling, as in life, they will be cast as outsiders.There’s a mechanistic quality to Ahad’s script: confessional soliloquies punctuate a conventional story about a down-at-heel gym making an 11th-hour comeback. But there’s also a wit in his writing and a generosity in Rod Dixon’s production that carries you along. Staged in a wrestling ring, like Claire Luckham’s Trafford Tanzi, it has the best stage fighting this side of the Royal Albert Hall, courtesy of choreographer Kevin McCurdy, and a keen sense of an old order being upturned."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/198f6787fde21e4fe67981693bb27311bf0f63bd/224_49_3405_2043/master/3405.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7c6b374c9b80608268d4f2b8b10d05d0","title":"elon musk tesla judge contempt sec","story":"Move follows settlement between regulator, Tesla and Musk over tweets pledging to take firm privateThe US Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday asked a judge to hold Tesla’s CEO, Elon Musk, in contempt for violating last year’s settlement with the federal agency.The regulator pointed to Musk’s 19 February tweet saying “Tesla made 0 cars in 2011, but will make around 500k in 2019”, noting that Musk did not seek or receive pre-approval prior to publishing this tweet, which was inaccurate and disseminated to over 24 million people.Musk thus violated last year’s settlement by engaging in the very conduct that the preapproval provision of the final judgment was designed to prevent, according to the regulator.Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.A US judge in October approved a settlement between the federal regulator, Tesla and Musk, over his tweets promising to take the company private.

TV, radio, posters, billboards and huge banners unfurled over public buildings urged the population to get out and vote. Even the electric ticker boards on buses chugging along Havana’s main thoroughfares read “I Vote Yes” (“Yo Voto Sí”).But the state was met with a surprisingly forceful challenge from an unofficial campaign against the new constitution.Evangelical churches concerned that the new constitution would create a pathway towards gay marriage hung banners reading “marriage: man + woman” from church walls, while religious activists daubed posters on lamp posts – a direct challenge to the state’s monopoly on public space.Although pastors did not explicitly call for a “no” vote, analysts say the church campaign mobilised non-religious, socially conservative sectors of the population to vote against the new constitution.And while state media gave no airtime or column inches to critical voices, #I’mVotingNo (#YoVotoNo) hashtags were trending on Facebook.While older citizens said they voted to support the government, a younger generation of Cubans, particularly those living in the cities, are more daring.Cuban journalist Mónica Rivero, 29, said: “I think the new constitution is too conservative. It crystallises the status quo rather than making changes.”Voting on the island is optional though strongly encouraged by the state and nosy neighbours. Cuba does not allow international observers to monitor its elections but citizens are allowed to watch the vote count at local polling stations.The new constitution reaffirms the Communist Party as the only legitimate political party on the island, defines access to health and education as fundamental rights, and claims that humans can only “reach full dignity” through “socialism and communism”.But there are also big changes. The new constitution introduces presidential term limits and enshrines the right to legal representation upon arrest.The document also gives constitutional backing to cautious pro-market reforms carried out since 2011. Private property is recognised, the rights of multinationals investing with the state are strengthened, and the market is recognised as a fact of life.Analysts estimate that one million Cubans now work in the private sector.Emily Morris, an economist from University College London, said the new constitution might open the path to stronger labour rights for those working in the island’s non-state sector.“Worker exploitation is already happening in the private sector,” she said. “But recognising private enterprise could be a step forward by facilitating improved regulation of relationships between employers and employees.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/716243e3079d3bdefc21900ead7dd346835606e3/0_132_4202_2522/master/4202.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a368be8235b49d8de2f414ae673c94e8","title":"irans foreign minister javad zarif announces resignation","story":"Official who negotiated nuclear deal apologises to nation but gives no reason for exitThe Iranian foreign minister, Javad Zarif, has resigned without warning, offering an apology to the nation as the nuclear deal he negotiated with world powers stands on the verge of collapse after the US withdrew from it.The veteran diplomat first offered a vague Instagram post with an “apology” for his “inability to continue to his service”. The post included a drawing of Fatima, the daughter of the prophet Muhammad, as Monday marked the commemoration of her birth.A foreign ministry spokesman, Abbas Mousavi, confirmed to the state-run IRNA news agency minutes later that Zarif had resigned but gave no reason for his departure.On Sunday, Zarif criticised Iranian hardliners in a speech in Tehran, saying: “We cannot hide behind imperialism’s plot and blame them for our own incapability.“Independence does not mean isolation from the world,” he said.Zarif’s resignation leaves Iran’s relatively moderate president, Hassan Rouhani, without one of his main allies in pushing the Islamic Republic toward more negotiation with the west.Analysts have said Rouhani faces growing political pressure from hardliners in the government as the unravelling nuclear deal further strains the country’s economy.The US-educated son of a wealthy family, Zarif overcame hardline objections and western suspicions to strike the accord with world powers in which Iran promised to limit its enrichment of uranium in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions.The deal later faced a challenge from Donald Trump, who withdrew the US from the accord, fuelling doubts of those in Iran still wary of the US decades after the 1979 Islamic revolution. Zarif himself faced withering criticism at home once for even shaking hands with the then president, Barack Obama.There was no immediate reaction from the US. However, officials in the Trump administration have increased their pressure on Iran on social media. One state department official tweeted an unflattering gif of Zarif saying: “How do you know @JZarif is lying? His lips are moving.”Zarif served as Iran’s ambassador to the UN from 2002 to 2007, first under the reformist president Mohammad Khatami and then under the hardline Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.Ahmadinejad wanted him replaced, but the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, intervened to keep him in the position for another two years as Iran soon found itself an international pariah over its nuclear programme. Iran insisted the programme was for peaceful purposes, while the west claimed it could be used to make nuclear weapons.Secret talks between the US and Iran in Oman became full-fledged negotiations over its nuclear programme. During the talks, Zarif met the then US secretary of state, John Kerry, more than 50 times – something unimaginable only years earlier."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e0154d5e97dabf0e016cf4bc30b8db3d68b7276a/0_37_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=948ae3218c5dea7d8ee9138135a2b8e2","title":"jorge ramos univision detained venezuela maduro interview","story":"Anchor, who has reportedly been released, asked question embattled leader did not approve of, according to Univision executiveThe Univision anchor Jorge Ramos has been detained in the Miraflores presidential palace in Caracas, Venezuela, the network announced on Monday evening.The Mexican-born journalist was interviewing Venezuela’s embattled president Nicolás Maduro when he and his crew were detained after asking a question the combative Maduro did not approve of, according to a tweet by the network’s US president, Daniel Coronell. The team’s equipment had also been confiscated, Coronell said.Coronell later said Ramos and his team had been released and he had spoken to the journalist. The equipment as well as the material that upset Maduro were confiscated. Reuters reported that Venezuela was going to deport the group.Ramos told Univision that the offending line of questioning came when he showed Maduro images taken on Ramos’ phone of Venezuelans eating out of the trash to prove people were living a humanitarian crisis.Ramos is arguably the best-known journalist in the Spanish-speaking world. He has gained particular notoriety for regularly locking horns with Donald Trump, who had him ejected from a press conference while on the campaign trail in 2015. The have since sparred over the US president’s proposed border wall among other contentious issues.Maduro, who is fending off mounting international pressure to cede power to opposition leader and self-declared interim president Juan Guaidó, has been accused of regularly detaining journalists. Last month, two French journalists were held after filming outside Miraflores. Numerous local journalists have been harassed or detained in recent years.The US state department received word of the arrest of Ramos and his team and insist on their immediate release, Kimberly Breier, assistant secretary for western hemisphere affairs, tweeted.The move against Ramos drew swift condemnation from Human Rights Watch, with the advocacy group’s Americas director, José Miguel Vivanco, calling for the immediate release of Ramos and his crew.“The international community must be alert,” he tweeted on Monday evening, later adding that “Jorge Ramos and his team are surrounded by Maduro’s intelligence services (responsible for atrocities).”López Obrador has drawn criticism from some international observers for refusing to back Guaidó.The Mexican foreign ministry condemned the crew’s detention after their release on Monday night. “Our country calls for respect for freedom of expression and reiterates its obligation in defense of the security of Mexican citizens abroad,” a tweet read.Univision is the largest Spanish-language network in the US. Ramos anchors its flagship nightly news program, Noticiero Univision."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/556d126883cbd7dabce1c052e6e7103e66bab40e/0_7_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=979a35ca3c9804b53ac100bcd97ba2a5","title":"venezuela mike pence maduro guaido","story":"Mike Pence says ‘all options are on the table’ in effort to oust Maduro while key allies warn they would oppose sending troopsUS vice-president Mike Pence has repeated a veiled threat of military intervention in Venezuela, but Washington appeared increasingly isolated in its willingness to contemplate using force to oust President Nicolás Maduro.Both European powers and some of Donald Trump’s key Latin American allies – all of whom have recognised opposition leader Juan Guaido as Venezuela’s legitimate leader – warned that they would oppose sending troops into the country.Guaidó had for weeks insisted his movement was focused on peaceful, democratic change. But after the opposition failed in a weekend bid to defy Caracas and bring aid into the country, he called on the international community to “keep all options open”.That hint at the use of military force won an enthusiastic response from hawks like US senator Marco Rubio, but sparked alarm elsewhere, particularly as Trump has previously mooted ordering an invasion.Speaking at an emergency summit of regional leaders in the Colombian capital Bogotá, Pence renewed the threat of intervention, describing Maduro as “a usurper”, and calling for a global push to oust him.“To leaders around the world: it’s time. There can be no bystanders in Venezuela’s struggle for freedom,” he said. “We hope for a peaceful transition to democracy, but as President Trump has made clear, all options are on the table.”But beyond the US, few appear willing embrace the prospect of violence. In Latin America, there is a painful and bloody history of US interventions, and the terrible fallout from the 2003 invasion of Iraq is another deterrent to the use of military force.An invasion would be complicated and bloody, with a strong chance of sliding into protracted civil war. Venezuela has armed forces that are more than 300,000 strong, thousands more members of pro-government gangs or guerrilla groups, complex terrain – and a government that still has some support from international partners including China and Russia.Brazil’s vice-president, retired general Hamilton Mourão, said on Monday that under no circumstances would his country allow the United States to intervene militarily from Brazilian territory, even though the country’s rightwing president Jair Bolsonaro has previously vowed to do “everything for democracy to be re-established” in Venezuela.Colombian president Iván Duque, has also now ruled out intervention, according to sources in his administration. Chile and Peru were also among other regional powers opposing military action on Monday.There was similar concern across the Atlantic, where European nations including Spain and Germany made clear they considered the deployment of troops a line that should not be crossed.“Not every option is on the table,” the country’s foreign minister, Josep Borrell, told the Spanish news agency Efe on Sunday, in a blunt rebuke to both Guaidó and US supporters of intervention.The European Union’s foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, insisted there could be no military solution to a political crisis.“The origins of the ongoing crisis in Venezuela are political and institutional, hence the solution can only be a political one,” she said in a statement. “We reiterate our firm rejection and condemnation of violence and of any initiatives that can further destabilise the region.”The Lima group also said credible threats have been made against the life of Venezuelan opposition leader Guaidó and his family, adding that President Nicolas Maduro was responsible for Guaido’s safety.“We want to hold the usurper Maduro responsible for any violent action against Guaido, against his wife and against their relatives,” said Colombian Foreign Minister Carlos Holmes Trujillo, speaking on behalf of the group.Pence said he would urge regional powers to freeze Venezuela’s oil assets and hand them over to Guaidó’s control. The opposition have reportedly already taken effective control of US-based refiner Citgo, one of the few remaining profitable assets of Venezuela’s state owned oil firm PDVSA.Earlier that morning the US announced it had added four regional governors to an already long list of sanctioned Venezuelans, and Pence said that tougher measures were still to come.“In the days ahead … the United States will announce even stronger sanctions on the regime’s corrupt financial networks. We will work with all of you to find every last dollar that they stole and work to return it to Venezuela.”But much of Venezuela’s government and industry are already sanctioned, making it harder for Guaidó’s allies to ramp up financial pressure on the regime."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"An investigation into the cause of the incident is ongoing, Irish Water saysLegislation aims to keep distressed borrowers in mortgage arrears living in their homesCouncil has identified four industrial areas it sees as \u0027new key growth areas of the city\u0027London to bring back direct rule in NI as administrative move in event of crashoutSocial integration \u0026lsquohas failed\u0026rsquo due to funding capsGalway Safe app also can help city visitors stay safe near the River CorribNo national data on how many children in care come in contact with garda\u0026iacute, report saysLancet flags impact on staff, financing, availability of medicines and vaccinesAll three were involved in care of man (52) who died days after being admitted with chest painsDriver Eamon Kavanagh (16) believed to have died instantly when vehicle hit wallRight to same-sex marriage and abortion universal, Taoiseach tells Arab LeagueLetters issued by NTA in recent days brings total number of properties affected to 1,400Incident occurred at the village of Shelton, near ArklowSecret Teacher: We feel increasingly insecure about what we are meant to be doingParents are urged to check supplements for children following the findings of UK studyKiller Alan Hawe transferred money to bank account \u0027while his family were dead around him\u0027Suicide note spoke of Alan Hawe\u0026rsquos shame and that \u0026lsquoit was easier for them to die\u0026rsquoSuspension imposed by Garda Commissioner on Fintan Fanning has been liftedViable device could have caused death or injury, Army bomb disposal team saysWoman who bought \u0026euro2,000 flat in Latvia to be placed on list under resolution of court case"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3806023.1551137454!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"clodagh hawe s sister we don t know what the truth is","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAlan Hawe (left) with   Clodagh and their sons Liam,  Niall, and Ryan.

Photgraph: HawesColl familiesPA WireThe family of Clodagh Hawe, the 39-year-old teacher who, with her three sons was murdered by her husband in their Co Cavan home, have spoken publicly about their deaths because “we don’t know what the truth is” about why they were killed.Alan Hawe (40) also a teacher, used an axe and knife to murder his wife, then stabbed their three sons, Liam (13) Niall (11) and Ryan (6) on August 29th, 2016 at their home in Ballyjamesduff.He subsequently took his own life.Ms Hawe’s sister Jacqueline Connolly and her mother Mary Coll refuse to accept evidence at the inquests into their deaths that Alan Hawe had a depression that escalated into psychosis resulting in Ms Hawe’s murder and the murder of her children.Ms Connolly said the family believed he was “avoiding the consequences of something he was doing at work.“He rang the INTO, we don’t know why, whether it was for a grievance or whether it was for representation. We know that he had conflict with a colleague.”She added that Alan Hawe said “he was leading them to a life of ruin essentially and Clodagh would have to clean up his mess. We still don’t know what that mess is. He said the truth was going to come out sometime, we don’t know what that truth is.”In a suicide note he spoke of his shame and that “it was easier for them to die than to have to live with the truth of what he was doing”.Call for changeIn an emotional and poignant interview on RTÉ Claire Byrne Live on Monday night the women talk about a daughter and sister, nephews and grandsons, plead for a new inquiry into their deaths and call for changes in the law to assist the families of victims of such family murders.Rejecting claims that the deaths were because of mental illness, Ms Connolly said “nothing in this country is going to change if we just throw a blanket on the inquest, a blanket of depression, and Clodagh, Liam, Niall and Ryan, their file is in a filing cabinet now with reference numbers and we still don’t know why”.They could not accept a psychiatrist’s diagnosis at the inquest of depression when he had been attending his GP for five years who never diagnosed him as depressed.She added: “He never missed time from work, he was never sick. He had a position of responsibility. He showed no signs of depression, he was out, GAA, football, out and about.”Ms Coll said her daughter confided in her and told her in February 2016, six months before they were killed, that her husband admitted he had been watching porn.He started to go to counselling, Ms Coll said “and then an issue arose in the school so his counselling sessions went from dealing with his porn addiction to his issues at school”.She added that “we do know now that we didn’t at the time that he was dressing in Clodagh’s underwear.“I mean Clodagh would never ever in her wildest dreams have thought of that, none of us would. We only found that out after the inquest. He said as well when I go back to school it will all blow up. What we don’t know. Was he going to face a grievance? If he was masturbating in the school well at the very least he was guilty of professional misconduct. That was at the very least.”They never found out what was going on in his work life."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3806140.1551129203!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"hundred more homes to lose part of gardens to bus corridors","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tGardens of properties in Terenure are among those that will be affected by the BusConnects core bus corridor project. Photograph:    Nick BradshawOne hundred more properties in the greater Dublin area will lose part of their front gardens to clear the way for proposed bus corridors in the capital than was originally anticipated by the National Transport Authority (NTA).It is understood the NTA has over the past few days issued letters to around 390 property owners along six further proposed bus corridors including Bray, Ballymun, UCD and Ringsend to the city centre, Blackrock to Merrion and Finglas to Phibsborough.This now brings to 1,400 the number of properties in the greater Dublin area which could lose part of their front gardens to clear the way for the routes.The majority of latest 390 impacted property owners (160) lie on the Bray to city centre corridor.The BusConnects project involves upgrading 16 core bus and cycle routes into the city along with a redesign of the network.IndicationsJust more than 1,000 other property owners were informed in recent months they are set to lose part of their front gardens under 10 of the corridors. These lie on the Clongriffin (120), Swords (110), Blanchardstown (100), Lucan (15), Liffey Valley (60), Greenhills (220), Kimmage (75), and Rathfarnham (255) to city centre corridors, along with Clondalkin to Drimnagh (15) and Tallaght to Terenure (40).The NTA announced last year a total of 1,300 property owners could lose part of their front gardens under the core bus corridor project. However, in recent months there were indications this figure could rise slightly.The authority is expected to publish details of the final six corridors on Tuesday afternoon. It has offered one-to-one meetings with affected property owners and is organising information and community forums for the final batch of corridors.The NTA has previously said those affected will lose on average one to two metres of their front garden but that some properties could lose up to four metres. Those affected will receive an average compensation payment of about €25,000."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3806182.1551132571!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"labour to back second brexit vote in effort to avoid no deal outcome","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritish Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn: “We are committed to also putting forward or supporting an amendment in favour of a public vote to prevent a damaging Tory Brexit being forced on the country.” Photograph:  Aaron ChownPAIn a major policy shift on Monday night, the British Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said his party would back a second referendum on Brexit. Mr Corbyn told Labour MPs that the party would also back a vote this week in the House of Commons that, if passed, would compel Theresa May to delay Brexit rather than leave the EU without a deal on March 29th.“One way or another, we will do everything in our power to prevent no deal and oppose a damaging Tory Brexit based on Theresa May’s overwhelmingly rejected deal. That’s why, in line with our conference policy, we are committed to also putting forward or supporting an amendment in favour of a public vote to prevent a damaging Tory Brexit being forced on the country,” he said.Mrs May will make a statement on Brexit to MPs on Tuesday ahead of votes on a series of amendments on Wednesday, including one tabled by Labour MP Peter Kyle that would put the prime minister’s deal to a referendum. Labour will table an amendment outlining its own Brexit plan, including a permanent customs union but it is almost certain to be defeated.“If parliament rejects our plan, then Labour will deliver on the promise we made at our annual conference and support a public vote,” shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer said.Possible delayLabour’s move comes as EU leaders, meeting in Egypt for an EU-Arab League summit, raised the possibility of a delay to Brexit by extending the article 50 process. Mrs May did not rule out a delay to Brexit but said it would not “deliver a decision in parliament”.Meanwhile, The  understands the British government is likely to reintroduce direct rule to Northern Ireland if there is a no-deal Brexit.The move is being planned principally because of a large amount of new legislation, regulations and government orders which will become necessary to deal with a no-deal Brexit, according to British and Irish sources who have been briefed on the plans.There is legal uncertainty surrounding the powers of civil servants in the North in the absence of the powersharing institutions, and British ministers and officials have been advised the legal changes necessary after Brexit may need to be done from London, necessitating a period of direct rule.Several Irish Government sources confirmed Dublin is aware of the plans, which have been suggested as an administrative necessity rather than a political move.Restoring Stormont The Department of Foreign Affairs did not comment directly on the prospect of direct rule but said the Assembly and Executive were “urgently needed in order to represent the interests of all of the people of Northern Ireland and address issues of concern”. The Northern Ireland Office said secretary of state Karen Bradley is “focused on working closely with the political parties and restoring the devolved institutions at Stormont”.Unionist parties have repeatedly urged the British government to introduce direct rule, but the move has been strongly resisted by the Irish Government. Sinn Féin and the SDLP also oppose the move.The British government has resisted the DUP’s request for the reintroduction of direct rule, though it was forced to introduce a “direct rule budget” for the North last year in Westminster to provide a legal basis for the continued spending on public services in the North under the direction of civil servants.But there are doubts about the legal basis for the extent of civil servants’ powers. A court judgment last year which found that Northern Ireland civil servants did not have the legal authority to sanction a controversial waste incinerator plant in Co Antrim has prompted caution by officials about the extent of their powers in the absence of the Assembly and the powersharing executive.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph:  Sanjay KanojiaAFPIn what’s being described as the world’s largest ever electoral exercise, some 900 million voters will be eligible to choose India’s federal government for the next five years in elections to be held before the end of May.The poll dates are yet to be announced by India’s election commission, but precedent suggests that electronic voting across some one million polling stations, from the northern Himalayan region to the country’s tropical south, will be staggered over multiple phases.The extended voting schedule, likely to last some five weeks, is to enable the deployment of large numbers of paramilitaries to ensure violence- and coercion-free polling, neither of which is unknown in Indian elections.The commission stipulates that a new Indian government has to be in place by the last week in May, indicating a voting timetable beginning around mid-April.Voter numbers in India have increased by about 100 million since the 2014 elections in which prime minister Narendra Modi’s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) assumed power. It convincingly defeated the Congress Party-led coalition that had been in power in two successive administrations since 2004.In the country’s first-past-the-post system, the BJP won 282 of 543 seats in the Lok Sabha,the lower house of parliament, securing India’s first single-party parliamentary majority in 30 years, on promises of economic development and jobs. Its overall tally along with its National Democratic Alliance partners was a a record-winning total of 336 MPs.Dynastic ruleThe Congress Party, led by Sonia Gandhi and her son Rahul, members of India’s age-old Nehru-Gandhi political dynasty, slumped to its lowest-ever tally of just 44 MPs. The party’s miserable showing was blamed on allegations of endemic corruption, misgovernance and nepotism during its decade in office. It was also seen as a revolt against the perpetuation of dynastic rule.Rahul Gandhi’s great-grandfather, Jawaharlal Nehru, was India’s first prime minister for 17 years after independence in 1947, and was succeeded, after a brief hiatus, by Rahul’s grandmother Indira Gandhi, who was premier for 15 years. Thereafter her son Rajiv – Rahul’s father – became India’s prime minister for five years and, some time later, his Italian-born widow Sonia became Congress Party chief, a post she held for 19 years, before handing over to son Rahul in late 2017.Modi launched his election campaign in January in what is swiftly building up to be a vicious and bruising contest. The BJP’s star campaigner, more in the presidential than prime-ministerial mode, skilfully exploits social media and offers to guarantee political stability, robust economic development and an uncompromising national security policy against troublesome neighbours such as nuclear rival Pakistan.At a recent rally, he maintained that the fractured coalition of the Congress and other opposition regional parties was one of “rich, corrupt and scam-ridden leaders” who would bring “negativity, instability and inequality” if elected.“They have formed alliances with each other. We’ve formed an alliance with 1.25 billion Indians,” Modi declared with characteristic flamboyance. They have “dhanshakti or money power, we have janshakti or People’s Power”, he added.Social unrestThe disparate opposition alliance, forged despite bitter past differences between its partners, has been formed with the sole aim of preventing Modi’s return to power.Opposition leaders consistently accuse Modi of fostering social unrest by pursuing anti-Muslim Hindu nationalist policies. They also accuse his government of causing economic turbulence through the arbitrary demonetisation of high-value currency notes in 2016.“We will not let the BJP be re-elected and destroy the idea of an inclusive India and all its institutions,” Gandhi said at a recent opposition rally in Chennai in southern India.Opposition leaders claim that Modi’s autocratic style of governance has undermined democratic institutions including parliament, the judiciary and media, and autonomous organisations such as the Central Bank, the Central Bureau of Investigation and the electoral commission.They hold the BJP-government responsible for fostering an economic crisis in the agrarian sector, which directly or indirectly sustains some 70 per cent of India’s population of 1.25 billion.Official figures say that 5,650 farmers across India took their own lives in 2017, the last year for which such figures are available. Opposition leaders, however, claim that the actual number of such suicides was far higher, as local officials sometimes decline to register them.“The upcoming elections are the only hope for the future of Indian democracy, and all political parties must co-operate to defeat the BJP,” former BJP federal minister Arun Shourie said recently in a televised interview. In an outspoken attack on the party, the former World Bank economist accused the government of “terrorising and choking the media to circulate ‘government falsehoods’”.Verbal duelsMeanwhile, rival party leaders are locked in slanderous verbal duels, trading abuse, insults, and derogatory personal jibes far fiercer than during the 2014 elections.Gandhi recently called Modi “the fuhrer” after he allegedly withheld alarmingly high unemployment statistics, to which the BJP responded by stating that the Congress Party leader had inherited fascist Italian dictator Benito Mussolini’s “short-sightedness”. The BJP’s riposte was a thinly veiled reference to Sonia Gandhi’s Italian antecedents.Rahul Gandhi also frequently refers to Modi in his public speeches as the “watchman-turned thief”, whilst Modi calls Gandhi “Namdar”, or dynast, and “Sahibzada”, or prince. Other BJP members openly refer to Gandhi as “Pappu”, or brat.“The 2019 elections promise to be one of India’s most vicious and isive,” said Seema Mustafa of the Centre for Policy Analysis in New Delhi. Their outcome would be critical to sustaining India’s democratic and secular credentials, she said."},{"url":null,"title":"westminster dog show 2019 pictures","story":"Wire fox terrier wins Best in Show at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show in New York on Tuesday night, emerging as the top dog among nearly 3,000 barking, tail-wagging competitors.Comment: The West is wrong to be cynical about Trump\u0026#39s diplomatic effortsHalf of female students subjected to unwanted sexual touching, poll finds Lord Sugar: they gave a Bafta to The Apprentice accountant but not to meGP ‘bribes’ to diagnose dementia undermine patients’ trust in doctorsKim Jong-un is ‘dancing rings’ around Trump, ex-UK ambassador to North Korea warns ahead of Vietnam summitSleepless nights of parents last at least six years, study finds  Most supplements for children do not contain enough vitamin D   One in 10 over 40s has diabetes, amid doubling in numbers with the condition   Crowds line the streets of Hanoi as Kim Jong-un arrives in Vietnam for summit with Donald TrumpIndian planes bomb Pakistan as Kashmir tensions escalateMaduro says US wants to \u0026#39fabricate\u0026#39 Venezuela crisis to start warEU warns against military action in Venezuela as Mike Pence and Juan Guaido meet at emergency summitVatican treasurer George Pell found guilty of abusing two choir boys R Kelly released on bail after pleading not guilty to sexually assaulting teenagersPrime Minister warned 15 Remain ministers prepared to quit if no-deal Brexit remains on the table Iranian foreign minister and architect of Iran nuclear deal abruptly resignsComment: Britain needs to stop playing the EU\u0026#39s game and take a harder line on BrexitWarren, episode 1, review: The final nail in the coffin for British sitcomJeremy Corbyn comes out for second Brexit referendum as Labour attempts to stop party splitsComment: With Labour imploding and Brexit in the balance, the Tories need to stick togetherGovernment planning to pay billions to Brussels - even in event of no-deal BrexitWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/02/20/TELEMMGLPICT000159430519_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"forget benefits screen time truly modern must teach children","story":"Perhaps the most modern thing we can do is to teach our children to exist beyond the world of screensHow did you learn your times tables?

Even more so now that the education secretary, Damian Hinds, has officially sanctioned educational apps as a tool for learning, even for pre-schoolers. “There is such a thing as good screen time,” said Hinds, whose department is piloting a scheme to find the top five educational apps, then distribute them for free to 20,000 disadvantaged families across the country, in a bid to boost language and literacy skills. ...To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeAlready have an account?

Experts have found dangerous diseases can pass from the livestock to humansA parasitic disease which affects more than 200 million of the world’s poorest people is transmitted between humans and their livestock through hybrid flatworms, a UK-funded project has found. Schistosomiasis, a chronic disease caused by parasitic flatworms which leads to an intestine or urinary tract infection, is common in communities without access to safe drinking water and sanitation.While efforts to control the disease have been partially successful, they have been limited by the flatworms ability to rapidly adapt and evolve. But in an announcement on Monday, scientists working in West Africa said that growing hotspots of the disease are driven by the emergence of highly infectious hybrid parasites, formed when species of schistosome from both livestock and humans combine. The research finding, which the World Health Organisation have incorporated into treatment guidelines, will have a significant impact on stemming the transmission and spread of the disease.“This finding is really important in terms of public health and demonstrates the huge potential for science to really make a difference,” she added.From animal to human | Ten significant zoonotic diseasesThe research is among a number of projects releasing findings on Monday as part of a UK government strategy to invest in zoonotic diseases, which can be passed from animals to humans. Such illnesses, which can devastate livestock and could be the source of the next global pandemic, are estimated to have cost the world more than $20 billion directly and $200 billion indirectly between 2000 and 2010.  “A billion people around the world depend on farming and livestock as a source of income,” said Penny Mordaunt, International Development Secretary.“By protecting cows and chickens from infections and tackling diseases that spread from animals to humans – like avian flu – UK aid is protecting them, supporting their livelihoods and reducing the risk of pandemics that could reach our shores.” In a project in Tanzania, scientists found that the insecticides farmers used to control ticks and flies on livestock also prevented the transmission of sleeping sickness, a deadly neglected disease spread by tsetse flies, from wildlife to humans. Newsletter promotion - global health security - end of articleAnother team identified a link between growing brucellosis infections and the rise of farming sheep and goats, which are becoming more popular to farm as they are less vulnerable to changing climates than cattle. “But what we also know is that animals, both wildlife and livestock, are an important source of new infections to humans. How we invest overseas has an impact on the UK as well as global health security.”Dfid also announced on Monday an additional £2.5 million for six projects in the Zoonoses and Emerging Livestock Systems (ZELS) scheme, taking the total invested by the UK to over £23 million. Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Comment: The West is wrong to be cynical about Trump\u0026#39s diplomatic effortsHalf of female students subjected to unwanted sexual touching, poll finds Lord Sugar: they gave a Bafta to The Apprentice accountant but not to meGP ‘bribes’ to diagnose dementia undermine patients’ trust in doctorsKim Jong-un is ‘dancing rings’ around Trump, ex-UK ambassador to North Korea warns ahead of Vietnam summitSleepless nights of parents last at least six years, study finds  Most supplements for children do not contain enough vitamin D   One in 10 over 40s has diabetes, amid doubling in numbers with the condition   Crowds line the streets of Hanoi as Kim Jong-un arrives in Vietnam for summit with Donald TrumpIndian planes bomb Pakistan as Kashmir tensions escalateMaduro says US wants to \u0026#39fabricate\u0026#39 Venezuela crisis to start warEU warns against military action in Venezuela as Mike Pence and Juan Guaido meet at emergency summitVatican treasurer George Pell found guilty of abusing two choir boys R Kelly released on bail after pleading not guilty to sexually assaulting teenagersPrime Minister warned 15 Remain ministers prepared to quit if no-deal Brexit remains on the table Iranian foreign minister and architect of Iran nuclear deal abruptly resignsComment: Britain needs to stop playing the EU\u0026#39s game and take a harder line on BrexitWarren, episode 1, review: The final nail in the coffin for British sitcomJeremy Corbyn comes out for second Brexit referendum as Labour attempts to stop party splitsComment: With Labour imploding and Brexit in the balance, the Tories need to stick togetherGovernment planning to pay billions to Brussels -

The majority of those who died were children under five.The Costa Rica Star reported that neither the boy nor his mother, 30, had been vaccinated.The father, 35, is reportedly not up to date with his vaccinations. The newspaper said the parents told a doctor in Costa Rica that other children at the boy’s school in France had contracted measles.A spokeswoman for the French health ministry confirmed that a French five-year-old boy in Costa Rica was suffering from measles.She said the measles vaccination had only been compulsory in France for children born on or after 1 January 2018, and the boy affected was therefore not covered by the requirement introduced by the current governmentCosta Rican authorities said they had informed their French counterparts so that they can track whether others in France have been infected.Costa Rica has not had a domestic measles case since 2006. The last recorded case brought in from another country was in 2014.The boy is being treated and both he and his parents will be held in quarantine for at least seven days at the Monseñor Sanabria Hospital in the port town of Puntarenas, near the Santa Teresa beach resort where they were staying. The family arrived in Costa Rica on 18 February.Andrew Wakefield was struck off in 2010The Costa Rican health authorities are trying to establish who may have come into contact with the boy at the resort, on his flight, or at a hotel in the capital, San José, where the family spent one night.The Costa Rican health ministry said 26 people known to have had contact with family have now been vaccinated. In a statement, the ministry said: “Our country enjoys very good vaccination coverage in general. However, in order to avoid particular cases and their possible complications, it is important that those in charge of minors ensure that children have the complete vaccination scheme.”In Britain, a paper published by a doctor in 1998 linking autism with the MMR vaccine (measles, mumps and rubella)  raised anxiety about the jab.The doctor, Andrew Wakefield, was struck off the UK medical register in 2010 for dishonesty and failing to act in the best interests of child patients.Comment: The West is wrong to be cynical about Trump\u0026#39s diplomatic effortsHalf of female students subjected to unwanted sexual touching, poll finds Lord Sugar: they gave a Bafta to The Apprentice accountant but not to meGP ‘bribes’ to diagnose dementia undermine patients’ trust in doctorsKim Jong-un is ‘dancing rings’ around Trump, ex-UK ambassador to North Korea warns ahead of Vietnam summitSleepless nights of parents last at least six years, study finds  Most supplements for children do not contain enough vitamin D   One in 10 over 40s has diabetes, amid doubling in numbers with the condition   Crowds line the streets of Hanoi as Kim Jong-un arrives in Vietnam for summit with Donald TrumpIndian planes bomb Pakistan as Kashmir tensions escalateMaduro says US wants to \u0026#39fabricate\u0026#39 Venezuela crisis to start warEU warns against military action in Venezuela as Mike Pence and Juan Guaido meet at emergency summitVatican treasurer George Pell found guilty of abusing two choir boys R Kelly released on bail after pleading not guilty to sexually assaulting teenagersPrime Minister warned 15 Remain ministers prepared to quit if no-deal Brexit remains on the table Iranian foreign minister and architect of Iran nuclear deal abruptly resignsComment: Britain needs to stop playing the EU\u0026#39s game and take a harder line on BrexitWarren, episode 1, review: The final nail in the coffin for British sitcomJeremy Corbyn comes out for second Brexit referendum as Labour attempts to stop party splitsComment: With Labour imploding and Brexit in the balance, the Tories need to stick togetherGovernment planning to pay billions to Brussels - even in event of no-deal BrexitWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/02/25/TELEMMGLPICT000081027736_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqJGdLpwOZ4ig0u7Q-LAYH6owfdGBvGwA8F1nDt3KQV8A.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"women top should walk away work culture toxic","story":"Karren Brady has stepped down as chairman on Sir Philip Green\u0026#39s holding companyEver since The  brought to light the murky allegations about Sir Philip Green, Karren Brady’s position has seemed somewhat compromised.

No casualties or damage.Photograph released by Pakistan military said to show site where Indian bombs fell in KashmirHe went on: “Under forced hasty withdrawal aircrafts released payload which had free fall in open area. No infrastructure got hit, no casualties.”Pakistan\u0027s government said it would hold an emergency meeting to discuss the incident and in the past has said it would retaliate against any aggression from Delhi.Tensions between the neighbours have been raised since at least 40 Indian paramilitary police were killed in a suicide bombing on their convoy near Pulwama in Indian-controlled Kashmir earlier this month.Narendra Modi faces a general election this spring and has come under intense domestic pressure to respond to an attack he says was carried out by the Pakistan-based militant group Jaish-e-Mohammad.Both sides claim Kashmir, which is ided between the neighbours by a heavily militarised line of control. Rivalry over the region has led to two of their three wars.Prakash Javadekar, India\u0027s human resource development minister, said: This was a necessary step for the defence of the country, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi had given the armed forces a free hand. The whole country stands behind the armed forces.Pakistan\u0027s foreign minister, Shah Mahmood Qureshi warned India not to challenge Pakistan and said better sense should prevail in Delhi.Comment: The West is wrong to be cynical about Trump\u0026#39s diplomatic effortsHalf of female students subjected to unwanted sexual touching, poll finds GP ‘bribes’ to diagnose dementia undermine patients’ trust in doctorsLord Sugar: they gave a Bafta to The Apprentice accountant but not to meKim Jong-un is ‘dancing rings’ around Trump, ex-UK ambassador to North Korea warns ahead of Vietnam summitSleepless nights of parents last at least six years, study finds  Most supplements for children do not contain enough vitamin D   One in 10 over 40s has diabetes, amid doubling in numbers with the condition   Crowds line the streets of Hanoi as Kim Jong-un arrives in Vietnam for summit with Donald TrumpMaduro says US wants to \u0026#39fabricate\u0026#39 Venezuela crisis to start warEU warns against military action in Venezuela as Mike Pence and Juan Guaido meet at emergency summitVatican treasurer George Pell found guilty of abusing two choir boys R Kelly released on bail after pleading not guilty to sexually assaulting teenagersPrime Minister warned 15 Remain ministers prepared to quit if no-deal Brexit remains on the table Iranian foreign minister and architect of Iran nuclear deal abruptly resignsComment: Britain needs to stop playing the EU\u0026#39s game and take a harder line on BrexitWarren, episode 1, review: The final nail in the coffin for British sitcomJeremy Corbyn comes out for second Brexit referendum as Labour attempts to stop party splitsComment: With Labour imploding and Brexit in the balance, the Tories need to stick togetherGovernment planning to pay billions to Brussels - even in event of no-deal BrexitOne in four teenage suicides involves the internet, official inquiry findsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"one 10 40s has diabetes amid doubling numbers condition","story":"New figures show the numbers of those suffering with the condition has doubled in the last two decadesOne in ten people over 40 now has diabetes, amid a doubling in the numbers suffering the condition within two decades, new figures show.The research by Diabetes UK suggests that by 2030, around 5.5 million people will be suffering from the condition, which is fuelled by obesity.  The figures show major variation in levels of the condition across the country, with Bradford the “diabetes capital” with rates three times those of Richmond, in south west London.In total, there are 3.8 million people diagnosed with diabetes in the  UK – an increase of 1.9 million since 1998, the figures show.Nine in 10 cases are Type 2 diabetes, which is driven by obesity.Almost one million more people are undiagnosed, the charity estimates, bringing the total number up to 4.7 million, a figure which is set to reach 5.5 million by 2030.And the charity estimates that 12.3 million people in the UK are currently at risk of developing the condition.The trend follows soaring rates of obesity. Britain is the fattest nation in Western Europe, with rates of obesity rising even faster than those in the United States.Two in three adults are overweight or obese.Experts said many cases of Type 2 diabetes could be prevented or delayed by healthy eating, being more active, and losing weight if overweight.Chris Askew, chief executive of Diabetes UK, said: “Millions of Type 2 diabetes cases could be prevented if we help people understand their risk and how to reduce it. Even though the older people get the more likely they are to have Type 2 diabetes, it is never too early to know your risk so that you can make changes to prevent or delay it.”The charity is urging those aged 40 or over to have a free NHS health check offered by GPs.It also said their own Know Your Risk online tool could help people to find out their risk of developing Type 2 diabetes.Mr Agnew said: “The signs of Type 2 diabetes are often not obvious, that’s why spotting them early can be life-changing. Early diagnosis means that fewer people will experience diabetes-related complications such as sight loss, amputation, kidney failure, stroke and heart disease, because they could seek support to manage their condition effectively as soon as possible.“We urge people over 40 to get an NHS Health Check and we advise everyone to find out their risk of developing Type 2 diabetes with the Know your Risk tool.”Experts said symptoms of diabetes - which include going to the toilet a lot, being really thirsty, feeling more tired than usual and losing weight without trying -  can be easy to miss especially in the early stages.The condition can go undetected for many years, with one in three cases not diagnosed until they have developed complications with their eyes, feet, kidneys or nerves.Under NHS plans, 5,000 people will be put on 800 calorie-a-day liquid diets in a bid to reverse the disease.Tam Fry, from the National Obesity Forum, said children should be warned in school about the risks of diabetes, with diagnosis now happening at an ever-younger age.He said: “Telling them that they could lose a leg or go blind from the disease if they fail to look after their health might seem extreme but it\u0027s the truth.”Professor Jonathan Valabhji, national clinical director for diabetes and obesity said: “The growing obesity epidemic is dangerous for the nation’s overall health and worrying for the NHS, fuelling growing numbers of people with Type 2 diabetes as well as costing taxpayers billions every year.This is exactly why the NHS Long Term Plan sets out radical action to tackle this growing problem by expanding the NHS Type 2 Diabetes Prevention Programme so that 200,000 people every year can benefit and introducing a pilot of very low calorie diets that have been shown to put Type 2 diabetes into remission in a significant proportion of those that already have it, he said.Caroline Cerny, from the Obesity Health Alliance said: “This dramatic increase in the number of people living with Type-2 diabetes is likely to spiral further as obesity rates continue to rise.

Those aged under one should be given a 8.5 to 10 microgram daily vitamin D supplement to ensure they get enough.But the study found that at least two thirds of products on the market contain insufficient levels.Researchers from the universities of Oxford and Southampton examined vitamins aimed at children sold by Asda, Morrisons, Ocado, Sainsbury\u0027s, Tesco, Boots, Holland and Barrett, Lloyds Pharmacy and Superdrug.In total, 67 multivitamin products made by 24 different manufacturers were included in the study.The daily vitamin D dose in the vitamins ranged from zero to 800IU.Only one multivitamin was suitable for use from birth and this supplied 200IU per day – around half the recommended amount.5 natural ways to get a shot of vitamin DFor children under six months of age, only one multivitamin contained more than 340 IUday vitamin D, but this was only recommended from four months of age.For children over six months, just 25 per cent to 36 per cent of the available multivitamins provided the recommended 400IU per day of vitamin D, the experts said.The researchers also looked at specific vitamin D products and vitamins marketed as being for healthy bones.Of the 24 products that were available, the range of vitamin D in them was from 50 to 1,000IU.Six products were suitable from birth, of which five contained 340 to 400IU per day – around the recommended amount.Writing in the Archives of Disease in Childhood journal, the authors concluded: There is a wide range of both multivitamins and vitamin D supplements available for children in the UK, yet most of these do not provide the recommended 400 IUday.Multivitamins typically had lower vitamin D content than pure vitamin D supplements or \u0027healthy bones\u0027 products, although some products labelled as \u0027for bones\u0027 contained very low levels of vitamin D.The team also looked at the Government\u0027s Healthy Start scheme, which provides free multivitamins to low-income families, but these provide only 300IU per day of vitamin D.The research comes after data analysed by the Press Association revealed 101,136 hospital admissions with a main or secondary diagnosis of vitamin D deficiency in 201718 – a rise of one third in a year.In addition, there were  474 admissions in 201718 where the main or secondary reason was rickets, up from 445 the year before. Almost all these cases were young children, with 332 admissions for rickets in children aged nine and under, up from 324 the year before.A further 80 admissions for rickets were among those aged 10 to 19, up from 67 the year before.The \u0026#039sunshine\u0026#039 supplement: should we all be taking vitamin D?Dr Benjamin Jacobs, from the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH), said: A normal healthy UK diet provides less than 10 per cent of the recommended amount of vitamin D.The natural way to obtain vitamin D is from sunlight, but there is inadequate exposure to sunlight in the UK so supplements are the only way to ensure UK children get the recommended dose.To learn that so many products fail to provide children with the recommended level of Vitamin D is highly concerning, especially when latest evidence shows our children\u0027s average intake are still below the recommended amount.These products are misleading parents who think they are protecting their children from serious conditions such as rickets, poor growth and muscle weakness.I would advise all parents to check that the supplements they use contain the recommended 400 units of vitamin D and consult their pharmacist if they are unsure.He also said the Government should seriously consider fortifying some foods and milk with Vitamin D.Dr Carrie Ruxton, from the industry-funded health and food supplements information service (HSIS), said: Food supplements are meant to supplement the diet, not replace the nutrients obtained from foods.In that respect, and since there are varying recommendations across different age groups of children, it is right that different supplements offer different doses.Smaller doses allow parents to use the same product for younger and older children by varying the amount given.According to the most recent National Diet and Nutrition Survey data, children and adolescents are only getting a fifth of the recommended vitamin D intake of 10 microgram from food alone.Many of the supplements in this survey would actually bridge the dietary gap topping up intake towards the recommended 10 microgram daily.Comment: The West is wrong to be cynical about Trump\u0026#39s diplomatic effortsHalf of female students subjected to unwanted sexual touching, poll finds GP ‘bribes’ to diagnose dementia undermine patients’ trust in doctorsLord Sugar: they gave a Bafta to The Apprentice accountant but not to meKim Jong-un is ‘dancing rings’ around Trump, ex-UK ambassador to North Korea warns ahead of Vietnam summitSleepless nights of parents last at least six years, study finds  One in 10 over 40s has diabetes, amid doubling in numbers with the condition   Crowds line the streets of Hanoi as Kim Jong-un arrives in Vietnam for summit with Donald TrumpIndian planes bomb Pakistan as Kashmir tensions escalateMaduro says US wants to \u0026#39fabricate\u0026#39 Venezuela crisis to start warEU warns against military action in Venezuela as Mike Pence and Juan Guaido meet at emergency summitVatican treasurer George Pell found guilty of abusing two choir boys R Kelly released on bail after pleading not guilty to sexually assaulting teenagersPrime Minister warned 15 Remain ministers prepared to quit if no-deal Brexit remains on the table Iranian foreign minister and architect of Iran nuclear deal abruptly resignsComment: Britain needs to stop playing the EU\u0026#39s game and take a harder line on BrexitWarren, episode 1, review: The final nail in the coffin for British sitcomJeremy Corbyn comes out for second Brexit referendum as Labour attempts to stop party splitsComment: With Labour imploding and Brexit in the balance, the Tories need to stick togetherGovernment planning to pay billions to Brussels - even in event of no-deal BrexitOne in four teenage suicides involves the internet, official inquiry findsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/01/28/16/drought-crops-death.jpg","title":"brexit food price rises no deal tariffs wto rules","story":"IM Subscribe \u0026nbsp registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

But how much might shoppers be affected by increased tariffs, border checks and a weaker currency?Business groups have issued a series of dire warnings in recent days over how much more expensive food shopping will become after Brexit.The impact will vary across different ranges of products and depends on a number of factors such as how dependent the UK is on imports rather than domestic supply and the import taxes that will be applied by the UK government.Producers are likely to pass on additional tariffs to retailers and ultimately to customers but these vary considerably. Birds Eye’s UK and Ireland boss Wayne Hudson said that for his business, additional tariffs will range from 2 to 20 per cent, which he said will almost immediately be passed on to customers.Delays at at the Channel ports are also set to add to costs because of mandatory EU checks\u0026nbspon people and goods entering the EU from the UK. This will affect both imports and exports at Dover and Folkestone because of the frequent and closed loop nature of the crossings, the Cabinet Office has said.Half of the UK’s food arrives through Dover and Folkestone, and during spring Britain is particularly dependent on imports of fresh fruit and vegetables because many are out of season in this country and must be imported from warmer climes.\u0026nbspAt this time of the year, around 90 per cent of lettuces, 80 per cent of tomatoes and 70 per cent of soft fruit is sourced from, or delivered via, the EU.World\u0027s food supply \u0027under threat\u0027 from loss of bioersityDespite Transport Secretary Chris Grayling\u0027s assurances that ports are ready for disruption, plans for additional ferry routes to ease congestion have not been successful, with only a fraction of the hoped-for capacity secured.\u0026nbspExchange rates are also likely to add to food costs if no withdrawal agreement is ratified. Economists forecast that the pound will fall sharply in the event of a no deal meaning less purchasing power, making imports more expensive. Much of this will filter through to higher prices on the shelves.It is not yet possible to quantify the exact effects of additional tariffs. We will know more\u0026nbspafter the Department for International Trade publishes a list of new import taxes that will apply to more than 5,200 products, including food.The EU imposes relatively high tariffs on some food products in order to protect European farming and food supplies. For dairy, the average tariff is more than 35 per cent while for some meat products, such as lamb, it is more than 40 per cent.A number of hard-line Brexiteers have advocated unilaterally slashing UK import duties to zero in order to reduce prices for shoppers. Such an approach could mean lower prices for some products.But the zero-tariff approach has been ruled out by environment secretary Michael Gove because it is likely to have a disastrous impact on UK farmers. They have developed their businesses in the context of the EU’s customs union but would suddenly have to compete with cheap imports from around the world, including from countries which apply lower food standards that the UK.\u0026nbsp“One thing I can reassure you it will not be the case that we will have zero-rate tariffs on products, there will be protections for sensitive sections of agriculture and food production,” Mr Gove told the National Farmers’ Union conference last week.Zero tariffs would not only hurt the UK food industry. Ceramic producers have warned that 22,000 jobs could be at risk from inexpensive imports, particularly from China.\u0026nbspIf the UK leaves the EU without a deal trade would fall back on World Trade Organization rules.This could mean for example, a 46 per cent tariff on mozzarella, 40 per cent on beef, 21 per cent on tomatoes and 15.5 per cent on apples, the British Retail Consortium has said.Every WTO member has a list of tariffs and quotas that they apply to other countries. While the average EU tariff is quite low, for food it is often relatively high.While the UK can lower its tariffs, under the WTO\u0027s “most favoured nation” rules, it has to offer the same raxes\u0026nbspto every member around the world unless it has agreed a trade deal with them.So far, International Trade Secretary Liam Fox has only been able to secure deals with a small fraction of the UK’s trading partners.Analysts at Retails Economics predict that the cost of staples like beef and tomatoes could soar, with an extra £9bn\u0026nbspadded to the overall cost of food for UK consumers.We’ll tell you what’s true.

The company’s finance director John Bason said there was a “real possibility of food shortages” in the event of a cliff-edge Brexit.“A Brexit where there is no agreement would be very disruptive and people need to understand that and the effect it would have on food,” Mr Bason told Bloomberg. His remarks followed ABF’s latest trading update in which the company reported that Primark sales were set to rise by 4 per cent in the first half of the year. The group is expecting to record growth across all businesses, including brands such as Ryvita, Dorset Cereals and Ovaltine, except its sugar arm, which has been in decline for years.

The vast majority of MOO’s sales are in the huge North American market, now accounting for 75 per cent of their revenues.In addition to its well known cards, the company’s range also includes hard- and softcover notebooks and business cardholders, among other things. Its London headquarters have recently moved from a warehouse in Shoreditch to a 35,000 square foot space down the road in Farringdon, which comes complete with an ice-cream machine, pool tables and a “library” – a giant bookcase, where MOO employees can bring in books to place on shelves.Created with Sketch.Hot desks: The coolest office spaces in the world Show all 5Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.So it might be hard to imagine the first iteration of the business was a bit of a flop, with the company nearly dying in late 2005.What changed? A little creativity and a lot of persistence.Born and raised in north London, Moross, now 40, describes his younger self as more creative than studious.“It wasn’t like I wanted to be a policeman or a firefighter. I didn’t have a clear sense of what I wanted to do,” he tells\u0026nbspThe Independent.“Retrospectively, it’s interesting that no one ever talks about becoming an entrepreneur at school. I remember doing career coaching and going to job fairs, and entrepreneurship was very underrepresented as an option,” he adds.Moross attended Sussex University to study philosophy and politics – a course he enjoyed, although he wasn’t inclined to make a career out of it. “I wasn’t interested in becoming a politician, and professional philosopher isn’t that much of a job,” he says.After a brief spell at the BBC he joined a startup called Sorted, a tool that told users about the hidden places – from coffee houses to bookstores – in their neighbourhood.The business eventually ran out of money and closed in 2001, prompting Moross to get involved with Imagination, a design agency.“What I loved at Imagination was working on big brands with smart people. But what I was missing in that role was being able to design products and make products better and more exciting. I didn’t want to do the campaign around the car, I wanted to make it.” he says.All of MOO’s products are sold via its websiteIt was 2004 when, during a sleepless night, Moross first had the idea to launch a startup selling paper cards. His first enterprise – the rather ambiguously named Pleasure Cards.“MOO was once Pleasure Cards. A great idea with a horrible name\u0026nbspthat didn’t work for all sorts of good reasons,” he admits.“The idea was to create a business card for your social life – to give out at a party, say, instead of in a business meeting.”Set up with £100,000 of seed finance from angel investor Robin Klein (who is still on the board of MOO today), the idea never took off.“By the end of the first year of business we were quickly running out of cash and people didn’t understand the concept. “I thought that instead of making these social cards, we should start printing for social networks, help people put their photographs on paper, give them access to design tools in order to make their brands look good.”The company was saved by a lucrative tie-up with photo-sharing website Flickr, which allowed users to print their pictures onto the business cards – sparking a lot of interest from investors.The promise of real revenue was enough to secure another £5m in investment and that was when MOO as we know it today was born.In the age of smartphones, the process of handing out a physical card with your information on it can seem remarkably outdated. But\u0026nbspthe digital revolution actually gave new life to one of the world’s oldest industries.Moross says: “Business cards might be 300 years old but without digital technology our business wouldn’t exist. We sell 100 per cent of our products through the website.”“MOO cards can also carry a different image on every single card, thanks to the digital printing press.“It show that, in a digital world, good quality physical objects still matter. Meeting someone is a much more special experience than receiving an email. When you meet in person, you want to be remembered and our hope is that our card helps you make that connection.”That is not to say that MOO has not made a few digital updates since its launch. In 2015, the firm released a new range of cards embedded with near-field communication technology that connects it directly to a web page or social media network when tapped with a smartphone.To fight off competition you need to understand the landscape, what your customers want and what they value. We’re constantly looking ahead and thinking of how we can make our products better.MOO is also continuously trying to improve its green credentials and sticking its nose into the world of eco-friendly papers.In 2017, the company collaborated with Mohawk Fine Papers to take discarded cotton T-shirt scraps and give them new life as premium business cards.Usually, the scraps left behind from a T-shirt go to waste. But MOO takes these bits of fabric and uses a traditional printing technique to turn it into a high-quality paper.“To fight off competition you need to understand the landscape, what your customers want and what they value,” Moross says.“We’re constantly looking ahead and thinking of how we can make our products better.“In the case of cards made out of cotton, many of our competitors already have eco paper – but we took one step further to create a new type of better quality green paper.”At about £14 for a pack of 50 original cards and £25 for a pack of luxe cards (printed on extra-thick luxury paper), MOO cards are a premium product. But they remain a cheaper option for those looking for customised business cards without the need to enlist a designer.“To some extent, if all you need is very cheap business card, you can just write an email to that person with your signature or write your number on a piece of paper.“But professional design is expensive and hard to access. So we talk about great design for everyone and we think about how to use technology to make the design cheaper and the software accessible or how we can help professional designers make their brand stand out.”A View from the Top: Jonathan Sattin, founder of Triyoga A View from the Top with insurance boss Amanda BlancA View From The Top: Kaidi Ruusalepp, founder of FunderbeamA View from the Top with Herschel Mayers, CEO of VitalityWhen MOO was first founded, the team, which then consisted of just eight people, decided they would gather for a staff lunch on a weekly basis.Fifteen years later, the tradition endures, with employees being treated to free lunch every Friday.Moross, a keen photographer who has visited more than 60 countries, wants employees to have a life outside their jobs, believing this only increases productivity and creativity.“I tend not to work on weekends and I switch off very easily. You’re failing at your job if you’re 15 years in and you’re still working every hour of the day. You’re either failing at your job or you’re failing at your life and probably robbing your team of the things they could be doing.“I want people to come to work and be themselves. No one has to wear a suit and tie unless they want to, they can wear what they would at home – providing they wear clothes, of course.”Refreshingly, for a tech veteran who has little to prove to anyone, Moross can’t seem to rest on his laurels and is already looking to the next steps. “It’s always about pushing the business further. “This year, we’ll be expanding our product range and building much more for professional designers. But at the end of the day, it all comes down to building a good, strong, sustainable business.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

Given the adorable viral video he posted in reaction to the nod, the countless selfies with every Hollywood actor he comes across, and the interviews in which he’s grinning ear to ear, it’s clear Grant decided to grab the opportunity with both hands.Tim Richards derisively described the film as a “made for TV movie” on account of its limited cinematic release.\u0026nbspHe said that it was still unclear\u0026nbspwhether Roma was screened on more than 13 UK screens at the art house Curzon Cinema chain, “representing less than 0.5 per cent of the cinema market” and for a week at the Filmhouse in Edinburgh.Richards went on to point to Bafta’s rules stating that: “Films should not be screened purely to qualify them for these awards, and the film committee may not accept entries if they do not deem the theatrical release to be meaningful.Bafta decided Curzon’s screens made it meaningful enough.\u0026nbspI was raised by domestic servants like the one in RomaThe controversy is far from unique to the UK. AMC Cinemas and Regal, two major US chains, refused to play Roma as part of their best picture Oscar showcases and didn’t participate in its very limited US theatrical run because of the short window available before Netflix subscribers got their hands on it. Even the offer of cheap rentals couldn’t entice them.\u0026nbspMexico, the film’s home market, was not immune either. Cuarón went so far as to tweet his disappointment that it was showing on more screens in Poland than his native land as a result of big chains saying no.\u0026nbspBut are cinema operators right to draw a global line in the sand over the “theatrical window”\u0026nbspthat Richards says “has successfully served all sides of our industry for many decades and is one of the core differentiators that makes cinema unique”?How about asking yourself this: how many subtitled films\u0026nbspwould you normally expect to see at your local multiplex, regardless of how good they are?\u0026nbspAlfonso Cuaron wins Best Director for RomaArthouse cinemas are mostly where they live. Roma is different chiefly because it has an A-list Hollywood director and a distributor with enough cash to give\u0026nbspit an Oscar campaign.Awards films don’t always get much of a run even when\u0026nbspthey’re in English. My local multiplex, for example, supported If Beale Street Could Talk\u0026nbspwith just one of its 14 screens for barely a week.\u0026nbspThe fact that I was able to catch it was greatly assisted by my having booked time off during that week.\u0026nbspRoma, by contrast, didn’t involve my jumping through any of the hoops families usually have to jump through when the parents want to see the sort of film they can’t take the kids along to. It was there, at my convenience, and it has remained in my head ever since.\u0026nbspIt’s the sort of film that does that.At the core of this controversy is a clash of business models, with Netflix’s desire to give its subscribers what it has paid for as soon as possible, clashing with the big chains’ demand for their cherished period of exclusivity.\u0026nbspBaftasAs ever, in these situations, the customer ultimately loses. I would still like to see Roma on a large screen and I would make the effort to do so, even after viewing it at home. The experience would be worth it.\u0026nbspRichards may be right to take shots at Netflix for scarcely making previous releases available for any sort of cinematic run at all, regardless of the window.\u0026nbspBut as regards the “window”\u0026nbspas a concept and the terms on which Roma was released, he’s on shakier ground. Note how he says the window has “successfully served all sides of our industry for many decades”. The problem is with that “many decades”. Things change.\u0026nbspSteven Spielberg takes thinly veiled shots at streaming servicesDespite people repeatedly calling its doom, the silver screen has adapted to a lot of changes, a bewildering array of them. It has weathered the emergence of TV, the widespread purchase\u0026nbspof home entertainment systems, video gaming, the internet, the explosion of choice in people’s leisure options.\u0026nbspIt can survive Netflix too, and cinemas’ rising global gross revenues\u0026nbspsuggests they are doing just that. I’d be willing to put money on their surviving shorter exclusivity windows for Netflix or for other films too.\u0026nbspThe latter’s customers, as a rule, tend to go to the cinema more than non-subscribers do anyway. They like movies. If they’re like me, they’ll often watch them more than once. But the first preference will always be to see them on the big screen, and it doesn’t matter whether it’s Roma or Captain Marvel, about which my daughter and I are positively breathless in anticipation.\u0026nbspThe cinema offers an experience that Netflix cannot, and that is worth paying extra for.\u0026nbspThe disruptive threat Netflix poses is being felt much more by traditional television operators than it is by movie theatre chains.\u0026nbspNetflix needs to change its tune too though. It should be more open to giving more of its properties a cinematic release as Amazon, which admittedly has a rather different business model, has done very successfully.\u0026nbspSurely the various sides in this debate ought to be be capable of reaching a compromise? It should to be in their interests to do so. It would certainly be in the interests of movie lovers and movie goers and, well, art.\u0026nbspWe’ll tell you what’s true.

But how much might shoppers be affected by increased tariffs, border checks and a weaker currency?Business groups have issued a series of dire warnings in recent days over how much more expensive food shopping will become after Brexit.The impact will vary across different ranges of products and depends on a number of factors such as how dependent the UK is on imports rather than domestic supply and the import taxes that will be applied by the UK government.Producers are likely to pass on additional tariffs to retailers and ultimately to customers but these vary considerably. Birds Eye’s UK and Ireland boss Wayne Hudson said that for his business, additional tariffs will range from 2 to 20 per cent, which he said will almost immediately be passed on to customers.Delays at at the Channel ports are also set to add to costs because of mandatory EU checks\u0026nbspon people and goods entering the EU from the UK. This will affect both imports and exports at Dover and Folkestone because of the frequent and closed loop nature of the crossings, the Cabinet Office has said.Half of the UK’s food arrives through Dover and Folkestone, and during spring Britain is particularly dependent on imports of fresh fruit and vegetables because many are out of season in this country and must be imported from warmer climes.\u0026nbspAt this time of the year, around 90 per cent of lettuces, 80 per cent of tomatoes and 70 per cent of soft fruit is sourced from, or delivered via, the EU.World\u0027s food supply \u0027under threat\u0027 from loss of bioersityDespite Transport Secretary Chris Grayling\u0027s assurances that ports are ready for disruption, plans for additional ferry routes to ease congestion have not been successful, with only a fraction of the hoped-for capacity secured.\u0026nbspExchange rates are also likely to add to food costs if no withdrawal agreement is ratified. Economists forecast that the pound will fall sharply in the event of a no deal meaning less purchasing power, making imports more expensive. Much of this will filter through to higher prices on the shelves.It is not yet possible to quantify the exact effects of additional tariffs. We will know more\u0026nbspafter the Department for International Trade publishes a list of new import taxes that will apply to more than 5,200 products, including food.The EU imposes relatively high tariffs on some food products in order to protect European farming and food supplies. For dairy, the average tariff is more than 35 per cent while for some meat products, such as lamb, it is more than 40 per cent.A number of hard-line Brexiteers have advocated unilaterally slashing UK import duties to zero in order to reduce prices for shoppers. Such an approach could mean lower prices for some products.But the zero-tariff approach has been ruled out by environment secretary Michael Gove because it is likely to have a disastrous impact on UK farmers. They have developed their businesses in the context of the EU’s customs union but would suddenly have to compete with cheap imports from around the world, including from countries which apply lower food standards that the UK.\u0026nbsp“One thing I can reassure you it will not be the case that we will have zero-rate tariffs on products, there will be protections for sensitive sections of agriculture and food production,” Mr Gove told the National Farmers’ Union conference last week.Zero tariffs would not only hurt the UK food industry. Ceramic producers have warned that 22,000 jobs could be at risk from inexpensive imports, particularly from China.\u0026nbspIf the UK leaves the EU without a deal trade would fall back on World Trade Organization rules.This could mean for example, a 46 per cent tariff on mozzarella, 40 per cent on beef, 21 per cent on tomatoes and 15.5 per cent on apples, the British Retail Consortium has said.Every WTO member has a list of tariffs and quotas that they apply to other countries. While the average EU tariff is quite low, for food it is often relatively high.While the UK can lower its tariffs, under the WTO\u0027s “most favoured nation” rules, it has to offer the same raxes\u0026nbspto every member around the world unless it has agreed a trade deal with them.So far, International Trade Secretary Liam Fox has only been able to secure deals with a small fraction of the UK’s trading partners.Analysts at Retails Economics predict that the cost of staples like beef and tomatoes could soar, with an extra £9bn\u0026nbspadded to the overall cost of food for UK consumers.We’ll tell you what’s true.

The company’s finance director John Bason said there was a “real possibility of food shortages” in the event of a cliff-edge Brexit.“A Brexit where there is no agreement would be very disruptive and people need to understand that and the effect it would have on food,” Mr Bason told Bloomberg. His remarks followed ABF’s latest trading update in which the company reported that Primark sales were set to rise by 4 per cent in the first half of the year. The group is expecting to record growth across all businesses, including brands such as Ryvita, Dorset Cereals and Ovaltine, except its sugar arm, which has been in decline for years.

May made a speech setting out the government\u0027s long-term plan for the National Health ServiceThe takeover target said on Monday that NSF’s\u0026nbspapproach could have a “negative and destabilising impact on its stakeholders, including its customers” as it advised shareholders to take no action.Patrick Snowball, chairman of Provident, said: “The board of Provident Financial believes that the offer does not reflect the underlying value of the company and its prospects.“It also has a number of concerns with regard to the offer, including its all-share nature and the executability of the strategy set out in the offer.“The board therefore intends to do everything it can to maximise value for all shareholders over the coming weeks and will explore all appropriate alternatives to achieve that objective.”Provident went on to list its objections to the deal, including opposing the sale of disposing of its Moneybarn and Satsuma units.It also questioned NSF’s track record and ability to manage a business of the scale of Provident.According to the terms of the NSF deal, which is backed by more than 50 per cent\u0026nbspof Provident investors, Provident shareholders will own approximately 87.8 per cent\u0026nbspof the new entity.Investors must vote on whether to approve the deal, but it has already received the blessing of star fund manager Neil Woodford, Invesco and Marathon.“It is extremely disappointing that NSF has chosen to announce an unsolicited and highly opportunistic offer for Provident Financial,” said Mr Snowball.“Provident Financial’s management team has stabilised the business in a very turbulent period over the past 18 months, which has largely consisted of addressing managerial mistakes of the past, and now has a clear strategy for delivering enhanced returns to shareholders.”Provident added on Monday that it is trading in line with expectations but, given the circumstances, the board will delay the announcement of its full-year 2018 results to March 13.Embattled Provident saw shares tumble in January after it warned that profits will be at the lower end of expectations.The group said it had seen a rise in bad debts at its Vanquis Bank arm and falling numbers of new accounts after clamping down on its lending.We’ll tell you what’s true.

But scientists didn\u0027t know that they themselves were still wrapped in the edges of the\u0026nbspgeocorona.The extra source of hydrogen laying far out from Earth is not enough to allow space exploration, or to support any kind of human life. Down here, it would be referred to as a vacuum.But fortunately those particles do not pose any threat for anyone interacting with them, such as future space travellers that hope to journey to orbit around the Moon.“There is also ultraviolet radiation associated to the geocorona, as the hydrogen atoms scatter sunlight in all directions, but the impact on astronauts in lunar orbit would be negligible compared to the main source of radiation -- the Sun,” says Jean-Loup Bertaux, co-author and former principal investigator of SWAN, the instrument that made the founding.But it could get in the way of future observations around the Moon, the researchers caution.“Space telescopes observing the sky in ultraviolet wavelengths to study the chemical composition of stars and galaxies would need to take this into account,” adds Jean-Loup.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The phones are difficult to buy in some counties like the US, which has repeatedly said the phones are unsafe.But it said those same technologies that have proven so controversial – the 5G networks that it is looking to provide in the UK and elsewhere – mean that this phone is quicker than any other.

As a new breed of smartphones, Huawei Mate X combines 5G, foldable screen, AI and an all-new mode of interfacing to provide consumers with an unprecedented user experience.The Huawei Mate X will be the first key for consumers to open the door to 5G smart living.The company confirmed the new device would cost 2,299 Euro - higher than Samsung\u0027s Galaxy Fold, which has been given a price tag of 1,980 dollars.The Chinese firm\u0027s presence in the 5G infrastructure market remains a geopolitical talking point, with the United States warning European countries it may find it difficult to work with anyone who choose to use Huawei products in their networks, after raising security concerns over the Chinese company.But Huawei appears to be ignoring these on-going issues as it continues to expand its phone business.Now the second largest smartphone maker in the world, it is also due to unveil a new range of flagship devices in Paris next month.In terms of its foldable device, The Mate X will also come with fingerprint sensor built into its power button as well as featuring a camera system engineered with German camera firm Leica.Additional reporting by agenciesBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Notice anything about that sentence?\u0026nbspOr what about this, a brilliant snapshot of the works of TS\u0026nbspEliot by WH\u0026nbspAuden: “T\u0026nbspEliot, top bard, notes putrid tang emanating, is sad. I’d assign it a name: gnat dirt upset on drab pot toilet.”As per the previous, it’s a palindrome, one of those weird and wonderful linguistic constructs that reads exactly the same backwards as forwards. There’s a letter in the dead centre (“I”), like a fulcrum, on which everything else hinges. The great French virtuoso Georges Perec (his parents were Polish), came up with one in French (“Le grand palindrome”) over 10 pages long. Eccentric, certainly, possibly mad. But what if all human history is like this, and with every step forwards we are just as certainly going backwards? Welcome to paleo world.Perhaps the best recent example of palindromic history is the fall of the Berlin Wall – after which all those bricks were neatly recycled to build other walls, and people are still calling a halt to government with a view to building another one, bigger and better than the last. Even though it’s going to be hard to beat the Great Wall of China. Or even, in its more modest way, Hadrian’s Wall, all designed to keep the barbarians at bay. Which is ironic, because we are the barbarians, gorillas who can hold a pen or a phone. The more sophisticated, the more primal. The more advanced, the more primitive. Behold, homo americanus, a species newly depicted in anthropologist\u0026nbspEmmanuel Todd’s vast and mind-expanding Lineages of Modernity: A History of Humanity from the Stone Age to Homo Americanus, which posits that “It is the very primitiveness of America that has made it successful.”I was reminded, reading a recent biography of the French anthropologist\u0026nbspClaude Levi-Strauss, how beautifully humbling anthropology can be, rather like looking out on the Milky Way on a cold, clear night. You think you’re you. But in reality you’re not. You’re just part of a massive system of interlocking parts, stretching across time and space. The very idea of the self is a product of society, designed to keep everyone going about their business. But it’s a delusion that works, as Todd brilliantly argues. It’s one of the great paradoxes of human evolution: the more we convince ourselves we are autonomous iniduals, possessed of free will and integrity, the more we are exemplifying an ancient zeitgeist.Created with Sketch.The fall of the Berlin Wall – in pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.110 The fall of the Berlin Wall – 25 years onEast German border guards stand on a section of the Berlin wall in front of the Brandenburg gate on November 11, 1989 210 The fall of the Berlin Wall – 25 years onCars line up at the Pomezy border station, on November 5, 1989 as East German refugees cross the border to West Germany310 The fall of the Berlin Wall – 25 years onEast German refugees penned behind barriers outside the West German embassy wait for the buses to take them to the railway station to leave Prague on 4th October 1989 410 The fall of the Berlin Wall – 25 years onThousands of young East Berliners gather at the Berlin Wall, near the Brandenburg Gate on November 11, 1989 510 The fall of the Berlin Wall – 25 years onEast Berliners climb onto the Berlin Wall to celebrate the effective end of the city\u0027s partition, 31st December 1989610 The fall of the Berlin Wall – 25 years onA replica of a watchtower of the former German Democratic Republic (GDR) on display in the Potsdamer Platz Arkaden shopping mall in Berlin where an exhibition titled 25 Years of the Fall of the Berlin Wall has been staged710 The fall of the Berlin Wall – 25 years onBerliners from East and West celebrate at the Brandenburg Gate in December 1989810 The fall of the Berlin Wall – 25 years onEast German drivers queue at the Schirnding border crossing  into Czecho-slovakia five days before the fall of the Berlin910 The fall of the Berlin Wall – 25 years onThe Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, watched by his wife Raisa, right, kisses his East German  counterpart Erich Honecker in East Berlin in October 19891010 The fall of the Berlin Wall – 25 years onPolice from both sides stand idly by as the Berlin Wall is breached for the first time between East and West, at the Sandkrug Bridge crossing-point on Invaliden Strasse, in November 1989110 The fall of the Berlin Wall – 25 years onEast German border guards stand on a section of the Berlin wall in front of the Brandenburg gate on November 11, 1989 210 The fall of the Berlin Wall – 25 years onCars line up at the Pomezy border station, on November 5, 1989 as East German refugees cross the border to West Germany310 The fall of the Berlin Wall – 25 years onEast German refugees penned behind barriers outside the West German embassy wait for the buses to take them to the railway station to leave Prague on 4th October 1989 410 The fall of the Berlin Wall – 25 years onThousands of young East Berliners gather at the Berlin Wall, near the Brandenburg Gate on November 11, 1989 510 The fall of the Berlin Wall – 25 years onEast Berliners climb onto the Berlin Wall to celebrate the effective end of the city\u0027s partition, 31st December 1989610 The fall of the Berlin Wall – 25 years onA replica of a watchtower of the former German Democratic Republic (GDR) on display in the Potsdamer Platz Arkaden shopping mall in Berlin where an exhibition titled 25 Years of the Fall of the Berlin Wall has been staged710 The fall of the Berlin Wall – 25 years onBerliners from East and West celebrate at the Brandenburg Gate in December 1989810 The fall of the Berlin Wall – 25 years onEast German drivers queue at the Schirnding border crossing  into Czecho-slovakia five days before the fall of the Berlin910 The fall of the Berlin Wall – 25 years onThe Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, watched by his wife Raisa, right, kisses his East German  counterpart Erich Honecker in East Berlin in October 19891010 The fall of the Berlin Wall – 25 years onPolice from both sides stand idly by as the Berlin Wall is breached for the first time between East and West, at the Sandkrug Bridge crossing-point on Invaliden Strasse, in November 1989If you’re starting to feel just a little bit weary of economics, then join the club. It’s one of the oddities of capitalism that, just as in Marxism, everything has to be seen in terms of economics or freakonomics. As the Bill Clinton campaign had it, it’s the economy, stupid! But what if, fundamentally and looking at it from an anthropological perspective, it’s nothing to do with the economy after all, stupid? Economics is only concerned with the conscious, even possibly rational part of human behaviour. But there is a collective unconscious too\u0026nbspthat we generally forget about, or would like to forget about: notably the family, or (to speak like an anthropologist) kinship relations.The present no longer exists: How our brains aren\u0027t past NeanderthalEveryone has one. To begin with, anyhow. Even if, as in the case of orphans, it may not last very long. But everybody gets orphaned\u0026nbspin the end. You lose your parents. Or maybe your parents kick you out. Or your parents split up. Maybe you lose touch with your siblings (if you ever had any in the first place). Maybe it’s Cain and Abel. Maybe your father takes you up a mountain to sacrifice you to Yahweh (thus Abraham and Isaac).I’m trying to remember if my parents ever actually said to me, “You’re on your own, now, sonny Jim,” or words to that effect, but it was definitely implied. I was confronted with the anguish of liberty early on. “You want to be a vegetarian? OK, let me see, I think we have some soya here somewhere.” Or “So you’re an atheist now. Interesting!” Or “That’s fine, you don’t have to be a solicitor.” And, “She seems nice.”Inidualism is entirely the product of the collective. The idea that there is ‘no such thing as society’ could not even begin to exist without the solid foundation of a highly organised society right behind itThe nuclear family, in other words, is about as close to anything-goes anarchy as it is possible to imagine within a rule-bound, semi-protective environment (“Remember to look before you cross the street”). It’s why we hate anyone to be “controlling”. The typical western-style family is, in essence, centrifugal, designed to shove you out into the world, producing adventurers and explorers and entrepreneurs and philosophers, prodding and probing and shaping reality. Rugged, dynamic, creative inidualists, with women given (in the best case) equivalent status to men. Rather like the early nomads that spread out to populate the earth, rather successfully, pausing only to exterminate Neanderthals along the way.Inidualism is entirely the product of the collective. The very idea that there is “no such thing as society” could not even begin to exist without the solid foundation of a highly organised society right behind it. And this sense of being doomed to wander lonely as a cloud is nothing new. It is – as Rousseau would say – “the state of nature”, our primal condition. Technological modernity coincides with our archaic origins. We are still savages, operating very much along the lines of hunter-gatherers, Bushmen of the Manhattan savanna, equipped with socks and shoes and a Twitter account. All the trappings of so-called civilisation are paper-thin. Strip away Sainsbury’s and Waitrose, and we would soon be picking up rocks and making spears and looking for a woolly mammoth to take down.The Flintstones never really went away. Which is why we now have paleo politics (what Todd calls “primordial democracy”) in the shape of Trump and Brexit. Or, as the existentialists put it so neatly, hell is other people. Some degree of xenophobia or plain old misanthropy is built into inidualism. Paranoia is a by-product of liberty. You’re on your own now, like the three pigs, but you have to beware of the big bad wolf. So build those walls strong and high.William Golding’s classic Lord of the Flies tells the tale of a bunch of polite British schoolboys who, left to their own devices on an island, are soon killing and slaughtering and worshipping idols. But it’s not fiction. I know a guy, Sam Fussell, who dropped out of Christ Church Oxford, where he was studying English poetry, got into bodybuilding, and eventually went primitive in the wilds of Montana where he shoots wolves and bears – sometimes with a bow and arrow. And the odd thing is, I really like this guy. He is my avatar. He taught me to shoot and has promised to save a bullet just for me for when the going gets too tough. Fussell is the closest real-life counterpart, in my experience, to the fictional figure of Jack Reacher, the XXL vigilante hero of Lee Child’s novels. They are both variations on homo americanus. Which is probably our biggest export to date, an exemplary product of the Anglosphere, and legitimate successor to 200,000-year old homo sapiens. Together with the second amendment of the American Constitution and regular urban massacres.But as T\u0026nbspEliot, top bard, pointed out, humankind cannot bear very much reality. We get protective, especially where our young ones are concerned. And this is where a different kind of family set-up stems from. Emmanuel Todd, who is a demographer as well as anthropologist, hit me with an amazing statistic. In Iraq, 35 per cent\u0026nbspof married couples are first-cousins (he reckons that this figure can rise to 50 per cent\u0026nbspin Pakistan). He finds that across vast areas of Eurasia, a different kind of kinship system has developed which is patrilineal and communitarian, with fathers transmitting power and property to sons and keen to see close relatives marrying. This leads not just to women being disenfranchised and segregated, but to the subordination of the inidual, social stasis and clan wars.of married couples in Iraq are first-cousinsThe powerful point that he makes, contrary to conventional wisdom, is that the more repressive, controlling, non-nuclear, more centripetal and inward-looking (or “endogamous”) family is not “primitive”, although it may well be medieval. It is the nuclear (and “exogamous”) family that is more primitive, more caveman, more nomad. The cosy-cousins family is a much more recent invention and should, to his way of thinking be deconstructed. We need to go more primitive, not less.If we consider, for a moment, the current political landscape in the UK, you would have to describe it as increasingly exogamous. Nuclear in the best sense. There seems no compelling reason why, like all good families, parties should not split apart. Schisms are probably a good thing. Better to be disunited if you’re only going to unite around something utterly dumb and dismal.If economics is conscious behaviour, and education and religion are our subconscious, then it is still family relationships that form the deepest level of our unconscious life. Hence it is around inidualism that the clash (or at least ergence) of civilisations will occur. Todd sets out a table in which different societies are compared in terms of their core values under various headings to do with attitudes towards equality, feminism, endogamy and\u0026nbspauthority. The “anthropological distance” between the Anglosphere and Denmark (hello, Danes!) is zero. At the opposite end of the spectrum, the combined distance from Saudi Arabia is 7.5. I think we can assume, in the aftermath of Khashoggi, that the Saudis don’t exactly prioritise press freedom. Todd offers an equation which explains 911: “Maximum incomprehension + intimate association  hatred.” On the other hand, we shouldn’t be so Russophobic. We are closer to Russia (1.5 distance) than Germany (2.5).But however inidualist, we are never going to give up the sense of wanting to belong. We all need a club to support (mine, for example, is West Ham, although if there was an East Ham team I’d probably support them, having been born in East Ham Memorial Hospital). Similarly, we readily fall back on the idea of a nation. It’s what makes the World Cup competitions so irresistible. The more global, the more tribal. It’s pure palindromic history. Even hunter-gatherers had to band together to bring down a mammoth. Doing something about climate control could be a great opportunity for collective effort. Our problem is we have never yet discovered a form of solidarity that doesn’t automatically encode a desire to annihilate the competition. Or as Todd puts it:\u0026nbsp“Group cohesion depends on hostility to other groups ... Peace is a social problem.”Emmanuel Todd is an anglophile Frenchman who studied in Cambridge. He reveres the British empiricists and fondly cites AJ\u0026nbspAyer’s Language, Truth, and Logic as a way of cutting through the French over-preoccupation with words. He also credits The Beatles with doing more to undermine the Soviets than the CIA. He tends to think of the European Community as a doomed and deluded project, “a rigid and hierarchical system”. In an almost scientific way, extrapolating from existing data, he is willing to offer a few predictions about the way things are going. I like his theory of zombie religions: “Protestantism and Judaism are dead even though they think they are alive.” In the future we can expect to see more feminism and a greater indifference to gender. But also less (in certain parts of the world). Hence more polarisation.The bifurcation of the sexes took place only a few billion years ago. If palindromic history is anything to go by, and the future increasingly resembles the past, we can expect to see a time when the sexes and sex will fade away. Kids will pop up out of vats and get to select their parents for a change and tell them what beliefs to adopt. Or we give up the notion of reproducing altogether. Finally the bubble bursts, light is extinguished, and the whole shebang folds up and shrinks into a lonesome, colourblind, extremely dense particle and we are crushed into a singularity. Even though there is no more “we”. Only “one”. And then none.Andy Martin is the author of ‘Reacher Said Nothing: Lee Child and the Making of Make Me’. He teaches at the University of Cambridge.

The new project that has not only envisioned but created such a molecule.“Life detection is an increasingly important goal of NASA’s planetary science missions, and this new work will help us to develop effective instruments and experiments that will expand the scope of what we look for,” said Lori Glaze, acting director of NASA’s Planetary Science Division.European Space Agency announces name of brand new Mars roverThe new research saw scientists create a new kind of molecule system that functions like DNA, but has an important difference. Instead of the usual four ingredients, it contains eight.It has all of the four that are found in life on Earth:\u0026nbspadenine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine. But it has four extra, synthetic ones, that mimic the structures of the ingredients found in regular DNA.The researchers call the new creation hachimoji” DNA – hachi means eight in Japanese, and moji means letter. It functions the same as our DNA, meeting the same requirements that allow it to store and transmit information.That has meant that the kinds of molecules that might be storing information in life on alien worlds could be similarly different. It suggests that life could structure itself in different ways than it does on Earth, at the most fundamental level – meaning that environments Earth-bound life could never live in might be teeming with unimagined life forms.“Incorporating a broader understanding of what is possible in our instrument design and mission concepts will result in a more inclusive and, therefore, more effective search for life beyond Earth,” said Mary Voytek, senior scientist for Astrobiology at NASA Headquarters.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They use futuristic motors to allow them to be precisely tightened up automatically, without any shoelaces or other input.All of that can be controlled by an app, which allows people to slip on the shoes and then let the motors do the work of tightening them up, in a way shoelaces would traditionally work. They use much the same technology that allowed Nike to recreate the self-lacing shoes from Back To The Future in a limited run.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialBut that feature has broken after the Android app stopped syncing with the sneakers.

Well, good things come to those who wait. The iconic 1461s from heritage Midlands brand Dr Martens are now also being made in a super shiny synthetic material that mimics patent leather, so that everybody – men included! – can bring a touch of rockstar to their footwear. The inner sole is worth paying that bit for – it’s air-cushioned and resistant to oil, meaning no slipping and blisters. We were relieved to find that these didn’t need to be broken in like other Docs do – they were comfy from the first day of wearing them and looked slick with trousersleggings or a grungy dress. Colour-wise, you can choose from black, the cherry red (seen here), silver chrome or rose gold chrome.Firstly, yes, these are Star Wars-themed trainers (think rubber Rebel Alliance badge, Star Wars logo and galactic silver colouring), so if you’re not a fan of the movie space saga, they might not be for you. If you or a friend are, however, they’ll make the perfect affordable footwear gift. They slip on and are fantastically comfortable from the off. The outer is made with linen and Pinatex (a fibre made from pineapple leaves), the lining is organic cotton canvas and the insole is made from cork and natural latex, which moulds to your natural foot shape. Islington-born brand Po-Zu (meaning to pause in Japanese) is not entirely vegan, but much of its offering is, and all shoes are ethically produced in Portuguese or Sri Lankan factories using sustainable materials. For the height of vegan sophistication, no-one does brogues better than Will’s Vegan Store in London. Made with a kind of Italian faux leather created from plants and organic bio oil, they are fully decked out with the traditional brogue trim. Our top colour pick is the tan – it shows up all that intricate stitching beautifully – but they come in black or dark brown too. The durable rubber soles offer strong grip, the comfy insoles are made with recycled rubber and there’s a small block heel for added suave. Sizing is regular though if you normally look for halves, go one up. The Vegan Society has given this entire range the green light, and Will’s is a carbon neutral company that only uses plastic-free packaging, making this the ultimate in ethical browsing.411 Merrell all out crush 2 gore-tex: £120, MerrellFor the more active vegans among you, trustworthy trainers are a must-buy. US brand Merrell often pops up as a go-to brand for its small but reliable range of versatile shoes and after trying a pair for ourselves, we can see why. This lightweight pair of colourful kicks are built from Gore-Tex, a synthetic material, which is breathable and waterproof so will protect your feet in all running conditions. The heel is lined with lycra to help prevent rubbing and the sole boasts an impressive grip, even through slippy mud. In fact, these were designed especially with Tough Mudder-type challenges in mind. Expect your arches to feel well-supported, with plenty of room for broader feet. They come in black too, but why go boring when you can go jazzy with these bright blue, pink and coral dazzlers? Half sizes are also available.What we love about Birks is that you’re offered the choice between regular width (on the wide side) and narrow width, meaning everyone can find a pair of sandals to live in next summer, regardless of the shape of their feet. These have criss-crossed straps that are more slender than the classic design you might be used to. They’re made from Birko-Flor – essentially PVC with a breathable fleece-like lining. Its look mimics leather’s two-tone effect and feels just as gentle on the skin while being easier to clean. It’s win-win. The footbed, meanwhile, is the German footwear giant’s standard cork with arch support, only it’s lined with microfibre, not suede. The sole is made from an elastic material with excellent cushioning. Our pick of the three colours is the cream (pair it with any summer dress imaginable), but we might have to splurge on the dark grey and rose too. Here’s hoping they offer a vegan version of the yellow ones soon.611 Collection \u0026amp Co porto black lace up brogues: £120, Collection \u0026amp CoFor something that bit edgier, check out the new, fully vegan, Bristol-based footwear brand Collection \u0026amp Co, who are doing all sorts of cool things with waste materials in an effort to be more sustainable. We fell in love with these lace-up brogues, which come in jet black or rusty orange. They’re made in small, ethically-run Portuguese factories from soft faux leather, with faux suede side panels to add textural interest to the design. They slip on and off and have padded insoles for extra comfort, while rubber soles will withstand a pounding of the streets on a shopping mission. The 4cm block heels add a glam bit of height, although shoe lovers with wider feet might want to go for a size up as these are a bit on the narrow side. Oh, and they’ve got Peta’s seal of approval, too.Go back to basics with some canvas shoes specially designed by minimalist British shoe company VivoBarefoot to mimic the sensation of being barefoot and free. These dotty delights are handmade in Ethiopia in partnership with social enterprise, Soul of Africa, which supports education projects for disadvantaged kids. Even the print – choose from black or natural – has been designed in collaboration with local painters. Canadian accessories brand Matt \u0026amp Nat totally shun all animal-derived materials, so you can shop conscience-free (sorry, reader’s bank balance). These 3-inch block heeled Chelsea boots caught our eye, and certainly do away with any preconceptions that vegan shoes can’t be ethical, comfortable and stylish. In fact, the company’s motto is live beautifully, in more ways than one. The Peta-approved Kalistas have a sophisticated pointed toe and are made from black imitation leather, which you’d never know wasn’t the real deal. They pull on easily thanks to a smart elasticated ankle panel and came up true to size, while the gum rubber sole is hard-wearing enough to see you through those long days dashing between meetings – and finally to the pub afterwards!Every woman needs a reliable pair of black stiletto heels, be it for work, play or both. These faux leather beauties from Brighton-based vegan footwear brand Beyond Skin were recommended to us by a vegan pal who was overjoyed to find some plastic-made shoes that didn’t rub and give her blisters (it doesn’t give as well as leather does, though). Handmade in Spain, they have pointed toes, a breathable faux leather lining made from recycled materials and a heel of roughly 9cm. Peta has given them the thumbs up, so you can strut down the corridor feeling ethically awesome. No wonder Oscar-winning actor Natalie Portman is one of many famous fans. Some sizes may be out of stock online but we’ve been assured that they’ll be back in shortly, with pre-orders sent out in early March – so don’t panic!M\u0026ampS deserves a shout-out as a high street store with a huge range of vegan shoes that aren’t just kind to animals, but well-made and chic too. We were drawn to these metal trim loafers, which come in cheery cherry red or classic black and offer women with broader feet a wide fit option. The man-made material mimics suede (so be careful in rainy weather) and has an elegant check lining. They’re an absolute steal at just £25 a pair, and so comfy you’ll forget to take them off when you get home from a long day’s slog. The only downside is that there are no half sizes – if in doubt size up and grab some insoles.Roll back to the Seventies with these laid-back corduroy kicks from Californian footwear favourite Toms. Though not a vegan brand per se, the company offers an extensive range of shoes that are. These sneakers, inspired by the Sunshine State’s seaside towns, shot straight to the top of our must have list as they tick our three boxes: ethical, comfortable and cool. They’re also not like any shoes we’ve spotted elsewhere, so expect compliments from admiring strangers on the street. Though blissfully lightweight to wear with a cushioned insole, they’re also sturdy thanks to a rubber sole. Our faves are the turquoise, but the spicy red ones are hot too. Catch ‘em while they’re 40 per cent off in the sale and you could even justify buying both, especially as for every pair sold, Toms gives another to an underprivileged child.

May made a speech setting out the government\u0027s long-term plan for the National Health ServiceThe takeover target said on Monday that NSF’s\u0026nbspapproach could have a “negative and destabilising impact on its stakeholders, including its customers” as it advised shareholders to take no action.Patrick Snowball, chairman of Provident, said: “The board of Provident Financial believes that the offer does not reflect the underlying value of the company and its prospects.“It also has a number of concerns with regard to the offer, including its all-share nature and the executability of the strategy set out in the offer.“The board therefore intends to do everything it can to maximise value for all shareholders over the coming weeks and will explore all appropriate alternatives to achieve that objective.”Provident went on to list its objections to the deal, including opposing the sale of disposing of its Moneybarn and Satsuma units.It also questioned NSF’s track record and ability to manage a business of the scale of Provident.According to the terms of the NSF deal, which is backed by more than 50 per cent\u0026nbspof Provident investors, Provident shareholders will own approximately 87.8 per cent\u0026nbspof the new entity.Investors must vote on whether to approve the deal, but it has already received the blessing of star fund manager Neil Woodford, Invesco and Marathon.“It is extremely disappointing that NSF has chosen to announce an unsolicited and highly opportunistic offer for Provident Financial,” said Mr Snowball.“Provident Financial’s management team has stabilised the business in a very turbulent period over the past 18 months, which has largely consisted of addressing managerial mistakes of the past, and now has a clear strategy for delivering enhanced returns to shareholders.”Provident added on Monday that it is trading in line with expectations but, given the circumstances, the board will delay the announcement of its full-year 2018 results to March 13.Embattled Provident saw shares tumble in January after it warned that profits will be at the lower end of expectations.The group said it had seen a rise in bad debts at its Vanquis Bank arm and falling numbers of new accounts after clamping down on its lending.We’ll tell you what’s true.

Prices for the Galaxy S10 start at £799.As the name suggests, the S10+ is essentially a plus-sized version of the S10.Measuring 6.4-inches, the S10+ features the same triple-lens setup on the rear of the phone but adds another lens to the front.It can also hold an incredible\u0026nbsp1.5 terabytes of data – 500GB more than its nearest rival (the Galaxy Note9) – if its 512GB expandable memory is utilised.The battery on the S10+ is also enormous, though without real-world testing it\u0027s difficult to say how far this will go in an average user\u0027s day.Up to 12GB of RAM makes this smartphone more powerful than most modern laptops.Prices for the Galaxy S10+ start at £899The Galaxy S10 5G is huge – and not only because of its 6.7-inch frame.Its real significance comes in its support for 5G, the next-generation mobile network that will define communications for the next decade.This phone will appeal to anyone wanting to see what this new world might look like, though it\u0027s likely going to be at least a year before 5G rolls out on any significant scale.In terms of general specs, the Galaxy S10 5G is most similar to the Galaxy S10, with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of internal storage.\u0026nbspSamsung is yet to announce a price or exact\u0026nbsprelease date for the Galaxy S10 5G, though it will likely be coming at some point in the summer.While some may be questioning what the point of a folding phone is, others are heralding the Galaxy Fold as the future of smartphones.Like the S10 5G, this is a phone for early adopters, with future generations likely to iron out any kinks that may arise from such a radically new technology.It comes with 512GB of internal storage as standard, 12GB of RAM and an incredible six cameras.\u0026nbspSamsung is yet to announce the cost of the Galaxy Fold in the UK, but with prices in the US set at $1,980 and €2,000 in Europe, British buyers can expect to pay around £1,600.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It would not be unfair to characterise them as dedicated Remainers pro-Europeans who have dedicated much of their political careers, in their respective former parties, to the European cause.Created with Sketch.

In this respect they share the instincts of many former colleagues in their old parties. In the words of Chris Leslie: “Choosing to stand by while our constituents’ lives and future opportunities are hurt by Brexit is a fundamental violation of Labour’s traditional values.”Debates about Brexit delay mean we’re missing the bigger pictureYet what might TIG do if a second referendum or a delay to Brexit – both it seems increasingly likely – was somehow not possible to achieve? Would they, when push comes to shove, back Theresa May’s deal over a no-deal Brexit – as logic would suggest? Or would they simply refuse to accept the choice as a genuine one and vote her deal down, if forced into such a dilemma? Might they have a free vote, each according to their own conscience?And if there was a Final Say referendum, what if Britain again voted to leave the EU? What then?More widely, in pursuit of their European beliefs, would TIG MPs be prepared to vote against the government in a vote of no confidence? The answer, as Heidi Allen told The Independent, is that they would not, because it might mean a government led by Jeremy Corbyn. But, on the other hand, that removes their negotiating leverage with Theresa May on Brexit she need not fear that they will eject her from Number 10.These sorts of questions, among many other tactical matters, is where differences of opinion will start to emerge – no doubt labelled “splits”. In future, particularly if they end up campaigning to re-enter the EU, TIG MPs will have more tense debates about having to adopt the euro, about the Schengen no-passport area, and about the UK’s contributions to the EU budget.Even so, the group’s 11 members have much more in common than points of difference, such as their enthusiasm for Europe. There is a reason, for example, why Ian Austin, an MP for Dudley, did not choose to join them when he defected from Labour – because he is prepared to support a version of Brexit and TIG is not.If and when the time comes for a general election, if the Brexit issue is still live, TIG will, with the Liberal Democrats, the nationalists in Scotland and Wales, the Greens and the Northern Irish republican parties, offer an unequivocally anti-Brexit, pro-second referendum, pro-Remain agenda.\u0026nbspGot an unanswered question about Brexit?

The EU has refused to give British banks passporting rights to trade within the EU, dashing hopes of a special City deal.The newspaper also claimed that 15 ministers would be ready to resign to stop a no-deal Brexit.The threat came after Ms May suggested she could try to take her EU Withdrawal Agreement through parliament before it had\u0026nbspbeen formally approved by the other 27 member states.Amid growing pressure to delay Brexit with just 32 days left on the clock, the Prime Minister insisted it was within our grasp for Britain to leave the EU with a deal on 29 March.European Council president Donald Tusk revealed that he had discussed the legal and procedural process for extending the two-year Article 50 withdrawal negotiations with Mrs May when he met her in Egypt\u0026nbspon Sunday.Mr Tusk said delaying the UK\u0027s withdrawal beyond March 29 wass now a rational solution, warning that the only alternative, if MPs could agree a deal, was a chaotic Brexit.Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte, who had talks with Mrs May in the Red Sea resort of Sharm El-Sheikh on Monday, said the UK needed to wake up.Major boost for fresh Brexit referendum as Corbyn gives backingMr Rutte told the BBC: The Netherlands is one of your best friends. What you guys are doing –\u0026nbspleaving the EU in this time of insecurity in the world, instability in EU –\u0026nbspis the wrong decision.It\u0027s four weeks until the end date and still the UK has not agreed a position.So, now we are sleepwalking into a no-deal scenario. It\u0027s unacceptable and your best friends have to warn you.Wake up. This is real. Come to a conclusion and close the deal.Despite also facing pressure from pro-Europe Tories for a delay, the Prime Minister insisted in a press conference at the end of a summit of EU and Arab nations that she was sticking to her timetable.It\u0027s within our grasp to leave with a deal on March 29 and that\u0027s where all of my energies are going to be focused, she said.Challenged over whether MPs would be able to vote on any additional assurances she secured\u0026nbspfrom Brussels before they had been formally signed off by the EU27, Mrs May told reporters: It is possible to do it either way.Rejecting calls for a delay, the prime minister said: An extension to Article 50, a delay in this process, doesn\u0027t deliver a decision in Parliament, it doesn\u0027t deliver a deal. All it does is precisely what the word \u0027delay\u0027 says.Any extension of Article 50 isn\u0027t addressing the issues. We have it within our grasp.I\u0027ve had a real sense from the meetings I\u0027ve had here and the conversations I\u0027ve had in recent days that we can achieve that deal.Created with Sketch.

Juergen Ziegler, CEO for Europe, said that while Brexit was not the only factor, it has brought forward the decision to relocateMr Tusk said it was absolutely clear that if there was no majority in the Commons to approve a deal, Britain faced\u0026nbspchaotic Brexit or extension.The less time there is until March 29, the greater the likelihood of an extension, he said.This is an objective fact. Not our intention, not our plan, but an objective fact.I believe that, in the situation we are in, an extension would be a rational solution, but Prime Minister May still believes she is able to avoid this scenario.Brexit delay a step closer as rebels and EU leaders pile on pressureNo-deal Brexit an \u0027unforgivable act of self-harm\u0027 say UK insurersAnother Tory signals she could leave her party over BrexitMrs May said she had good meetings in Egypt with Mr Tusk, Mr Rutte, European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Irish premier Leo Varadkar and Italy\u0027s Giuseppe Conte.What I sense in all my conversations with my fellow leaders, both here in Sharm\u0026nbspel Sheikh and in recent days, is a real determination to find a way through which allows the UK to leave the EU in a smooth and orderly way with a deal, she said.The meetings came after the PM admitted she would not get a Brexit deal in time for MPs to hold a meaningful vote this week.She said she would put her deal to Parliament by March 12 at the latest –\u0026nbsp17 days before Britain is due to leave the EU.The PM faces the prospect of another potentially damaging Commons revolt on Wednesday, when MPs are expected to mount a fresh attempt to block a no-deal break and extend Article 50.A cross-party group of MPs immediately confirmed they would table an amendment, giving the House the power to demand a delay to Brexit if an agreement was not in place by March 13.In recent days, three pro-EU Cabinet ministers –\u0026nbspAmber Rudd, David Gauke and Greg Clark –\u0026nbspsignalled they could be prepared to back the amendment if there was no breakthrough in negotiations.There was speculation that up to 100 Tory MPs,\u0026nbspincluding as many as 20 ministers, could be prepared to join them as patience among MPs opposed to no deal is stretched to breaking point.Labour MP Yvette Cooper, who drew up the amendment with Conservative former minister Sir Oliver Letwin, said it would become the real meaningful vote on the Brexit deal.She told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme: The Government doesn\u0027t feel to me to be behaving like a responsible government at all at the moment –\u0026nbspthe idea that we could be only a few weeks from Brexit and we still don\u0027t know what kind of Brexit we are going to have and we\u0027re not even going to have a vote on it until two weeks before that final deadline.I don\u0027t see how businesses can plan, I don\u0027t see how public services can plan, and I think it\u0027s just deeply damaging.Mrs May confirmed that Brexit negotiators would return to Brussels on Tuesday for further talks with the EU\u0027s Michel Barnier.We’ll tell you what’s true.

Liberal Democrats have led the campaign for a people’s vote. We have campaigned for it, we have marched for it and we will vote for it.”With dissatisfaction over Brexit having sparked several Tory and Labour MPs to quit their party and form the Independent Group, Sir Vince said he has been speaking to “many of these now independent MPs” and that they have “much in common” with his party.Created with Sketch.

Labour confirmed Remain would be on the ballot paper – but said it would not countenance\u0026nbspan option of a no-deal Brexit.Furthermore, the fear of another referendum may yet persuade Tory opponents of the deal to finally back it when the second “meaningful vote” takes place, probably on 12 March.Nevertheless, Peter Kyle,the\u0026nbspLabour MP who has proposed backing Theresa May’s deal subject to a referendum, said: “There\u0027s no going back on this now for Jeremy or the party.”No-deal Brexit an \u0027unforgivable act of self-harm\u0027 say UK insurersWhat is the Independent Group’s position on Brexit?Brexit ‘could trigger surge in animal testing’ as EU rules invalidatedAnother Tory signals she could leave her party over BrexitMr Smith said the referendum was a prize\u0026nbspworth grabbing for the Commons approving the stalled agreement.\u0026nbsp“It is the right thing to do for the country and for Labour voters,” he said.Clive Lewis, a shadow minister who warned support for Brexit would keep Mr Corbyn pout of power, said: “This decision is a hugely positive step for the Labour party and our movement as a whole.And Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat leader, said it could be a defining moment. We have long argued it is the right and logical thing to give the public the final say,” he said.The announcement came shortly before Mr Corbyn addressed the weekly meeting of Labour MPs, at which he was certain to face strong criticism about his confused stance on Brexit.At first, it was unclear whether Mr Corbyn was pledging to back a referendum on the prime minister’s deal, or only in the unlikely event of Labour’s own Brexit proposals being adopted.However, a briefing note for Labour MPs stated: “If our frontbench amendment does not win the support of the Commons this week, we will put forward or support an amendment in favour of a public vote.”Such an amendment “could be attached to the prime minister’s deal – or a version of it – should it win a majority in the House of Commons”.The sentence was a reference to the amendment put forward by Mr Kyle, and fellow backbencher Phil Wilson, for a confirmatory referendum.However, a Labour source said the party would not support the amendment in its current form, because “we will not be voting for anything which supports May\u0027s damaging Brexit deal”.It was unclear what changes the leadership would demand. Mr Kyle and Mr Wilson have argued that Labour MPs would not need to vote with the Conservatives, but merely abstain.The announcement drew some fierce criticism in the parliamentary Labour party meeting, the pro-Brexit John Mann telling Mr Corbyn: “In the Midlands and north of England this decision today will stop you from being prime minister. The price will be paid.”Earlier, speaking in Egypt, Theresa May suggested she could try to force her agreement through parliament before it had\u0026nbspbeen formally approved by the other 27 member states.Rejecting calls for a delay to Brexit, she said: An extension to Article 50, a delay in this process, doesn\u0027t deliver a decision in parliament, it doesn\u0027t deliver a deal. All it does is precisely what the word \u0027delay\u0027 says.”Ms May will make a statement to MPs on Tuesday, before the next round of Brexit votes – including on the cross-party bid to force an Article 50 extension if the deal is blocked again – on Wednesday.We’ll tell you what’s true.

The US also asked the United Nations Security Council to hold an urgent meeting on the crisis.“I want to assure you, President Guaidó, that the tragic events of the past weekend have only steeled the resolve of the United States of America,” Mr Pence said at a meeting of the Lima Group in Colombia.The meeting was attended by opposition leader Juan Guaido, who last month declared himself Venezuela\u0027s president.According to the Associated Press, Mr Pence added. “We are with you 100 per cent.”Also in Colombia at the weekend, where he visited efforts to transport US aid across the border into Venezuela –\u0026nbspan effort that resulted in violence and several deaths –\u0026nbspwas Republican senator Marco Rubio, who has been highly influential on Donald Trump’s Latin American policy and whom the New York Times has termed the “ouster in chief”.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Venezuela aid protests: Civilians demand food and medicine Show all 5Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Demonstrators push a bus that was torched during clashes with the Bolivarian National GuardDemonstrators are seen through the cracked windshield of a torched bus A woman moves away from the flames of a burning bus A bus that was torched during clashes with the Bolivarian National GuardDemonstrators push away a bus that was torched during clashes Demonstrators push a bus that was torched during clashes with the Bolivarian National GuardDemonstrators are seen through the cracked windshield of a torched bus A woman moves away from the flames of a burning bus A bus that was torched during clashes with the Bolivarian National GuardDemonstrators push away a bus that was torched during clashes On Sunday, he tweeted several messages attacking Mr Maduro’s government before then posting three images of ousted dictators –\u0026nbspLibya’s Gaddafi, Panama’s Manuel Noriega and Romania’s Nicolae Ceausescu. The gruesome, blood-laced image of the Libyan leader was taken as he was bayoneted to death by rebels in the city of\u0026nbspSirte in October 2011. Nato had earlier engaged in a devastating bombing campaign against Gadafi\u0027s\u0026nbspforces.Mr Rubio’s tweet of the image contained no text, but quickly sparked outcry on social media. A number of commentators said he was tweeting the equivalent of stills from a “snuff movie”.In Colombia at the meeting of nations from the Americas, Mr Pence spoke with Mr Guaido, who Washington had encouraged to declare himself the country’s “legitimate” president and who it quickly regonised as such after he did so. The UK, Canada and up to 50 other nations quickly followed, while China, Russia and Mexico still recognise Mr Maduo.Mr Pence accused Mr Maduro’s forces of burning several trucks containing medical supplies over the weekend as the opposition tried to deliver US aid, even though it was unclear how they were set alight.\u0026nbsp“As the world watched, the tyrant in Caracas danced as his henchmen murdered civilians and burned truckloads of food and medicine destined for the people of Venezuela,” Mr Pence claimed. “These men worked to block aid for people in need and suppress peaceful protests – and their actions will not go unpunished.“In the days ahead, the US will announce even stronger sanctions on the regime\u0027s corrupt financial networks. We will find every last dollar they have stolen and return that money to the Venezuelan people.\u0026nbsp“As we continue to bring economic and diplomatic pressure to bear on the Maduro regime, we hope for a peaceful transition to democracy, but as President Trump has made clear, all options are on the table.”But others - including several European nations - voiced caution. Hamilton Mourão, vice president of Brazil, one of the nations that has recegnised Mr Guaido, said under no circumstances would his country allow the US to intervene militarily in Venezuela from Brazilian territory.Trump could help Venezuela without invading – by talking to ChinaUS senator tweets apparent threat to Nicolas MaduroAt least 100 Venezuelan soldiers have fled to Colombia amid clashesPink Floyd\u0027s Roger Waters posts video of support to VenezuelaTwo killed in violent clashes over Venezuela aid suppliesMaduro breaks relations with Colombia as aid clashes continueMr Maduro has denied claims that he is refusing to accept aid. Indeed, the UN has\u0026nbspstepped up distribution of humanitarian supplies in the country. His supporters point out the US has previously used shipments of aid in Latin America to smuggle weapons to rebels. Three decades ago, Elliott Abrams, currently Mr Trump’s point person on Venezuela, oversaw such an operation against the democratically elected government of Nicaragua.Mr Maduro on Monday tweeted that the “empire and its lackey” must understand that in “Venezuela the self-determination of our people reigns. We will solve the problems in a national union, with the Bolivarian government that I preside over. Together for Venezuela!”.Meanwhile, the US asked the UN Security Council to discuss the Venezuela\u0026nbspsituation on Tuesday. Reuters said Washington wanted\u0026nbspthe 15-member council to formally call for free, fair and credible presidential elections in Venezuela with international observers, a move that prompted Russia to propose a rival draft resolution.We’ll tell you what’s true.

Heres more on the hottest day of .On February , parts of the UK were hotter than Malaga and Romeand the Algarve .The mercury reached .C in Ceredigion, Wales making it the warmest day of the year and the warmest February day.Yesterday beat the February and winter temperature record - the .C on February , , at Greenwich, London.Met Office records began  years ago in .Daytrippers were rushing to beaches and congesting coastal roads including the A to Brighton, A to Dorset, A to Cornwall and M to Blackpool.The hottest time of day is usually between pm and .pm.This is because the heat continues building from noon when the sun is at its highest in the sky.From midday, the temperature will continue to rise steadily as the earth is receiving more incoming heat than it is radiating back to space meaning the afternoon is actually the hottest time of day.Shortly after this, the sun begins lowering in the sky causing temperatures to gradually fall, accelerating around sunset creating a much cooler evening atmosphere.The hottest temperature in England was recorded in August  in Faversham, Kent, where temps hit .C.A Welsh high of .C was in Hawarden Bridge on August , .Scotlands top high is .C at Greycrook on August , , while Northern Irelands is .C on June , .From Thursday, forecasters warned Brits to expect of bouts of wet and windy conditions, with snow flurries in the North as highs tumble to C.A Met Office forecaster said: Some air has come from the Sahara, with temperatures more than C above average and no cloud in the sky almost everywhere.“But there’s a change by the weekend with the wetter and windier conditions arriving as the strengthened jet stream brings in weather systems.” Met Office forecaster Dean Hall said: “Its quite exceptional weather and such a contrast to the Beast from the East  months ago.“But a stark change is ahead, with later in the week seeing rain and strong winds risking gales of over mph.During a heatwave, it is advisable to drink as much water as possible to avoid dehydration.Experts suggest having lukewarm showers or baths, and to run wrists under the cold tap to keep body temperatures comfortable.It is also suggested that curtains and windows are kept closed during the day and you should replace your duvet with a thinner one.The public have been encouraged to keep an eye on vulnerable friends, family members and neighbours who may struggle to cope in the extreme heat."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/NINTCHDBPICT000295225347.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"car wash slaves","story":"If youve paid less than £, chances are they are a slave.Victims are threatened with violence against their families, have their passports stolen so they cant leave, and are crammed into rat-infested housing.Forced to work with toxic chemicals and no protective clothing, medics report cases where car wash slaves have found their shoes fused to their skin for weeks.Nor are these isolated incidents - there are , unregulated car wash sites, and  per cent of slave labour cases in  involved car wash workers.As part of the Suns Stamp Out Slavery campaign in conjunction with the Co Op, which proposes to extend support given to rescued slaves from  days to one year, we investigate the horrying truth behind cheap car washes.Joe, in his early twenties, travelled by coach from Poland to the UK after being promised building work in  - but when he arrived he was forced to work -hour days for free in a car wash and his gang master stole his passport so he couldnt leave.He and the other men working there were forbidden from taking lunch breaks or eating during their shts - and working in the cold and wet for so many hours left them sick.They were threatened with violence and given no rest - the men were forced to living in tiny room in a flat, with no heating or beds to sleep in - and they were fed scraps by their captors, who patrolled their digs at night.He says: “Whenever I complained about how badly I was being treated I was threatened with homelessness and violence towards me and my family.They claimed that they knew my family’s home address back in Poland and that they would go and hurt themI didnt do what I was told. They also showed me a box of weapons that they said they would use on anyone who went against them.Slavery takes a iety of forms, but most commonly forced labour, sexual exploitation, domestic work or forced criminal activity. The Home Office estimated that there are , people held in slavery in the UK, with the Global Slavery Index suggesting the figure could be as many as ,.The UK recognised a staggering , victims from  countries in , including adults who had been used for organ harvesting and children that were forced into sexual exploitation.At present, trafficked victims have just  days government support after being recognised as a victim. Campaigners and businesses say this is not enough time for victims to find a place to live and means to support themselves so they risk becoming homeless and destitute.We want the government to: Back Lord McColls proposed bill, which suggests all victims of modern slavery should be given a year to recover, and alongside that they should be given special support to help them, including housing benefits, financial support and other services.Fearing for his le, Joe eventually fled with nothing but the clothes he was wearing, and was referred to The Salvation Army who helped him find a safe house, where he is currently living. But sadly, like many victims of modern day slavery, Joe was so scared of his traffickers that he didn’t want to speak to the police so there was no investigation into his case.When labourer Sandu Laurentiu-Sava first arrived in the UK and landed a job in a car wash, he believed it was the perfect opportunity hed been looking for to earn enough money to provide for his family back home in Romania.However, the horric reality that greeted him was very dferent.When he arrived in the UK, he was forced to work long days at Bubbles Car Wash in Bethnal Green, East London, and kept in a squalid, rat-infested flat owned by his employer that he shared with five other workers.One summer evening in August  after a long sht Sandu, , was electrocuted and killed while taking a shower.Car wash owner Shaip Nimani, then , was jailed for four years after admitting manslaughter.Workers without rubber gloves have suffered burns from putting their bare hands into water tainted with chemicals, and a lack of protective footwear has also led to trench foot - a painful condition of the feet caused by long immersion in cold water.   Salvation Army medic Anne Read attended a police raid to provide support to potential victims last year and was horried by what she saw.She says: “We were offering them food and drink and the chance for a shower and a change of clothes while victims were being interviewed.“Whilst other men gratefully took the new clothes offered, one of them seemed reluctant to remove his shoes. When we askedhe was OK, he showed us his feet. He had been wearing just his own lightweight shoes to work on the car wash. Over time the harsh chemicals in the cleaning fluids he had been forced to use had fused his shoes onto his feet, which meant that he hadn’t been able to remove them for weeks.The shoes had to be surgically removed. This is just one of many stories of the unspeakable cruelty people face at the hands of their trafficker which we see everyday as victims of modern slavery come to us for support.Despite being promised work and accommodation by gang members posing as recruiters, sadly for the large number of car wash labourers trafficked to the UK, the pay and living conditions are diabolical.Hand car washing has grown largely unchecked for the past  to  years, car wash expert Dawn Frazer says.In November last year police raided a premises in Manchester and three men were detained. Police said  ‘potential victims’ of slavery were rescued following the sting on Drive and Shine car wash.In  Kristian Holub admitted forcing Czech immigrant Milan Tencik - who was made to sleep on the floor - to work in a car wash, and business owner Ali Mohammed Raza was jailed for six years in  for trafficking five Syrian illegal immigrants to Hull to clean vehicles. In the same year brothers Igor and Marek Marcin got  months and  months’ jail time for trafficking  Czech and Slovak men to work in car washes and factories, paying them just £ a week and putting them up in bug-infested rooms.Heartbreaking stories like these are why The Sun is backing calls for a change in the law so that specialist support given to modern slavery victims – including forced labour and human trafficking – is increased from as little as  days to a full year, as they rebuild their lives.You can sign the petition for the Modern Slavery Victim Support Bill here.Find out more about Co-Ops Bright Future programme, which offers employment to survivors of modern slavery, here.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Likewise, consistently receiving less than you need to because you are paying back an advance can push people over the edge and into destitution.To succeed, Universal Credit needs to raise the incomes of those locked in poverty and ensure that work is a route to a better le. Without further reform, its potential risks being unfulfilled.The best immediate step the Government should take would be to lt the freeze on working age benefits this April.One million people are already receiving it and by the time the system is fully rolled out in , nearly  million will be on it.But there are big problems with the flagship new system - it takes  weeks to get the first payment and it could leave some families worse off by thousands of pounds a year.And while working families can claim back up to  per cent of their childcare costs, they must find the money to pay for childcare upfront - we’ve heard of families waiting up to  months for the money.Working parents across the country told us they’ve been unable to take on more hours - or have even turned down better paid jobs or more hours because of the amount they get their benefits cut.It’s time to Make Universal Credit work. We want the Government to:Together, these changes will help Make Universal Credit Work.Join our Universal Credit Facebook group or email UniversalCredit@the-sun to share your story. JRF also want jobcentres to better use the hidden pot called the Flexible Support Fund to help Brits with their childcare payments upfront so Brits dont go into thousands of pounds of debt going back to work.They highlighted the thoughts of both people on Universal Credit and work coaches in their new report.Research from Britain Thinks revealed that working parents saw Universal Credit as contributing towards their poor standards of living, and not helping them.Many wanted to be able to keep more of their hard-earned cash rather than being hit by the taper rate, and felt trapped by their circumstances.When the couple moved onto the new benefit system in September their £ a month benefits were immediately stopped, leaving them unable to pay their rent.The Peterborough couple, who’ve been living in their current home for a year now, claim they have nowhere  to gothey are evicted and will have to be put in temporary accommodation, at a cost of £ a week to the city council.Its a disgusting situation to be in because you know its going to happen but youre absolutely powerless to do anything about it, Amanda told The Sun.We have no savings, no one to fall back on and we struggle to be able to afford the rent now that we’re in debt.If were are relocated to a completely dferent area then Brian will have to give up his job but I thought the whole point of Universal Credit was to get people into work  It makes no sense.A DWP spokesperson said that the scheme works for the vast majority of people.They added: Universal Credit reduces gradually as people’s income increases, which means they’re always better off in work."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/NINTCHDBPICT000470565142.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"defected tory mps tory far right claims","story":"So forget their paranoid and baseless ­fantasies about Ukip infiltrators. Or about the Tories, under their most left-wing leader in a generation, in fact being ruled by compassionless brutes.It’s window dressing aimed at disguising their sole obsession, a catastrophically isive second Brexit referendum.Perhaps they need to justy it to themselves. Because Anna Soubry, Sarah Wollaston and Heidi Allen backed the  referendum, vowed to respect the result, voted for Article , then stood for election promising Brexit in full: no single market, no customs union.They now consider it “extreme” to keep those promises instead of breaking them. Ex-colleagues honouring the referendum and manesto are “anti-EU zealots”.Wollaston and Soubry represent Leave constituencies. Wollaston even campaigned for Leave initially. How can these hypocrites deny their duped ­constituents immediate by-elections and a “final say” on their duplicity At least, though, we now know the new Independent Group’s only policy: to reverse Brexit. The Labour MPs mainly quit Corbyn’s party over its vile anti-Semitism and economic insanity. The Tories’ recruitment shts the entire focus.Their anti-Brexit arguments, though, are the same old Remoaner claptrap.Soubry even trotted out the feeblest of all, counting non-voters to claim  per cent of us did not back Brexit: A child’s logic, applying to every election ever.Allen claimed they heard the “clarion call for change” from .million Leave voters. They intend to ignore them.They said “compassionate Conservatism” had been sidelined, airbrushing out their own role as serial rebels helping to paralyse Theresa May’s Government.But now they hope she will dump the DUP and make a pact with them in exchange for their “people’s vote”. She could,she wished to destroy her party.The Tories rightly aim to be a “broad church”. But these three shameless defectors, puffed up on sanctimony and epic self-regard, were irreconcilable.They have betrayed their party and their voters. And they’re not done yet.NEXT week backbench MPs could snatch power from the Government over Brexit in one of the most recklessly insane acts ­Parliament has seen.A Labour-backed vote, joined by Tory Remainers, would “take No Deal off the table” and effectively end the PM’s negotiations. The fact this is the brainchild of Oliver “Poll Tax” Letwin should tell you what chaos it will unleash.Which is doubtless why the EU is going cold on compromising. Why should it,Remainers will postpone Brexit Tory Leave MPs must not assume this will fail. Brexit is in mortal danger.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Your mind is bought and sold by their computer programs — with no human intervention required.You are the digital content they auction off for sale to the highest bidder. Billions of pounds pass before your eyes every day. But you don’t see a penny of it.It’s unfair. Never has so much been taken from so many by so few.So it is time to have a big redistribution of digital wealth.Google shareholders and Facebook boss Mark ­Zuckerberg are now worth .TRILLION. How much are you worth Remember, your mind is  per cent of the revenue of these corporations. So it is only right to demand your share.The British people, who set the world an example in waging a revolutionary war against feudal slavery, now find themselves in the latest stage of wage-slavery, working for the benefit of these wealthy companies and ­billionaires.The richest and strongest profit and grab most, while the weakest are utterly robbed, tormented, crushed and strangled.The tech multi-billionaires are, perhaps, some of the richest of all, and geographically the most secure.They have profited more than all the rest from their unholy alliance with weak national governments, who say their own parliaments and laws are too small to control or regulate these giant global corporations.Call it what it is — collusion, crony capitalism. The big companies and big government are hand in hand.The House of Commons’ Digital Select Committee this week called the tech giants “digital gangsters”.But even a good Saatchi alumnus like Damian Collins — the committee’s distinguished chairman — concedes the politicians have no power over these companies.Instead, it’s time for the people — the customers who keep the tech companies afloat — to take a stand.It is unfair that these few companies are so rich, and the many people are so poor.So, I say: Let us march! We are  per cent on the side of the heroes. They are  per cent on the side of the villains. Black and white. No compromise.When the tech companies say: “We agree in principle”, it means they will do nothing in practice.They say fair exchange is no robbery. You provide them with all your personal details — your age, gender, every friend, every photo you send, every film you watch, every app you download, every website you visit, every message, every item you buy, everywhere you go and where you are now — and inthey give you the wonders of the internet world.And as your bonus, they only send you “personalised” ads. Soyou want a new shampoo they don’t “serve” you a dishwasher.They are for the haves who hold power. We are for the have-nots.This is not a question of “privacy”. Or “harmful material”. Or “election interference”.This is a question of money.They have too much. We have too little. So we will make what seems highly improbable in fact happen.Every time Google or Facebook sell you to an advertiser, you should get paid for the privilege. Fair shares for all. The technology exists to make this possible. YouTube already pays people for the number of times their uploaded data is viewed.These companies only care about the millions of users they can sell to advertisers.What was your name again  Here is your chance to get your own back. A business model that says I get  per cent and you get  per cent is not going to last.The tech giants should remember what all Prime Ministers and Presidents usually learn too late.We the people have all the power. It’s best not to push us to use it.I say we need a popular uprising. A people’s revolution. Agitate! Create disenchantment! Build discontent!Join me and say: Start spreading the news. I say we want control. Ownership of our own minds.The new tech billionaires once used to dream of changing the world. Now they’ve got the whole world, they don’t want to let it go.They used to say: Set sail for the end of the rainbow.But now they say: Don’t rock the boat. They are turning into exactly the type of people they once condemned.The time has come to call a halt to their complacency and self-satisfaction. Will this cost them money  Yes, peanuts.But whatever it costs, it will be less than having the money dragged out of them.A society without ownership is one in which inequality and resentment flourish.Honour, common sense and the interest of the country require that all free British men and women, wherever they be, now fight for control of their own minds.We will feel more responsible for our own lives.And everyone will agree that this makes everything much fairer and that the people have gained more dignity and self-respect.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A man raised by Jewish parents to battle anti-Semites, only to watch the party he loved for  years become a safe space for them.There was no regretful farewell from Corbyn’s malevolent mob. Only the sniping insults of Chris Williamson, a fan of Venezuela’s vicious tyranny and probably Parliament’s most odious MP.What a state the Opposition is now in.But the “moderates” who remain are in denialthey think it can be saved.Labour peer Lord Bragg tells The Sun he hopes for a new leader — and to “change it from within”. That is even less likely than “reforming” the EU.Corbyn and his cronies have won. Ed Miliband and others gted the party to them. And replacing Corbyn would change nothing... without the entire shadow cabinet, Corbynite officials and hard-left membership being ousted too.It won’t happen. Fantasising about it is self-indulgent and delusional.THE Sun has always said Corbyn would betray Labour’s Leave voters in the end. Watch it happen next week.It will be an unprecedented democratic outrage for a main party to back a second referendum before the first is enacted. But Corbyn says that is now “very much part of the agenda”.Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell admits the party is “moving towards a people’s vote”, even using the Remainer- run ­campaign’s deceitful nickname.The vast majority of Labour’s at-risk marginal seats, and those they need to win to take power, backed Leave.And those voters are watching.THEY’RE not short of ego, are they The new -strong Independent Group of MPs say their ultimate aim is to form a Government.

We should leave the EU and forge a new path in the world.It was put to a referendum and the rest, as they say, is history.For some, though, the result of the ­referendum is not history. It’s something they are desperate to re-run.Calls for an extension, a delay or even a second referendum are persistent — but so too is mydetermination, and the ­determination of this Government, to deliver on the will of the first one.Democracy is not about trying again until you get the result you want.It’s about compromise and accepting that while we might disagree with each other, we should respect each other’s views.That need for compromise is precisely why we continue to negotiate with the EU. The Prime Minister is fighting hard to make sure we leave with a good deal on March .That determination is the reason I believe that the Conservative Party is the only party delivering in the national interest.The Prime Minister has made clear through her actions that whether you voted Leave or Remain, the deal she seeks will look to bring everyone back together.Whether you are someone who can’t wait to see us leave the EU, or whether you wish the result of the referendum had been dferent — we all, each of us, just want the best for the UK.We have a bright future ahead and one in which the UK will continue to grow as a force for good in the world.The pressure isn’t all on Parliament.The EU needs to come to the table in the spirit of compromise too.It would be the most illogical act of senseless harmthe EU refuses to accept that the UK Parliament will not be trapped in a backstop and instead pushes us to leave with No Deal, thereby ­creating the exact problem with the Northern Ireland border they claim they want to avoid.As far as our current ­negotiation is concerned, we are well into extra time.As Leader of the House, I am responsible for passing the legislation necessary for our exit from the EU.We have a lot to do before March  but I remain confident thatwe resolve the backstop, we will be able to pass the Meaningful Vote and crack on with that vital ­legislation.We are so close to the ­finishing line, so my plea to politicians here and in ­Brussels is: Please don’t snatch defeat from the jaws of victory. The EU must lt its eyes and look beyond the current frustrations and towards the close friendship we all want in the future.The Labour Party must carry out the wishes of the majority of its own ­voters, who wanted to leave the EU.And my own colleagues on the ­Conservative benches must not make the perfect the enemy of the good.Don’t hold the PM to ­ransom at such a critical point.Instead, we must hold our nerve and push through.  We must hold fast to the reality of the PM’s deal — that it delivers us a clean exit from the EU and all of its ­institutions while at the same time ­offering a close trading and security partnership that addresses the hopes and aspirations of many in our country who voted Remain.So the prize is great — and it’s all of our futures.Let’s come together and, with one final heave, we can get the PM’s deal over the line and begin to look ­forward, not ­backward.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It is claimed that Ibbotson didnt do this.The report states Mr Ibbotson arrived in Nantes two days before the flight on January .Mr Ibbotson, , had written he was a bit rusty with the ILSon Facebook after arriving at the airport.He later wrote: Was not tobad when I got there but Im a bit rusty with the ils, in France now.A friend replied: Rusty with the ILS ! I cant believe that!Mr Ibbotson added: You wanna bet, a little on the high side hehe, better than on the low side.Sala arrived at the airport at .pm on the night of January  and the flight took off exactly half an hour later.The plane made last contact with air traffic control over the Channel Islands at .pm.The wreckage of the plane was found on the sea bed - along with Salas body - just  metres from where the last contact was made.Argentinian footballer Sala had just signed for Cardf City from French club Nantes for £ million when the plane crashed into the Channel on January .His body was recovered on February  but pilot David Ibbotson, , of Crowle, Lincolnshire, has not been located.Mr Ibbotsons family hope a fresh search for his body will begin this week after setting up an online fundraising campaign which has reached £,.The aircraft remains underwater off the coast of Guernsey after an attempt to recover it was hampered by bad weather.We pay for your stories!

We cannot and will not accept.One way or another, we will do everything in our power to prevent No Deal and oppose a damaging Tory Brexit based on Theresa May’s overwhelmingly rejected deal.“That’s why, in line with our conference policy, we are committed to also putting forward or supporting an amendment in favour of a public vote to prevent a damaging Tory Brexit being forced on the country.”Fears had been growing thatMr Corbyn didnt go against his principles and back a second referendum more Labour MPs would leave and join the new Independent Group.And the dramatic announcement may also temporarily move the focus away from the anti-semitism crisis currently surrounding the Labour party.But the announcement sparked a fresh bout of furious infighting and MPs representing pro-Leave constituencies vowed they would do all they can to stop a “corrosive” second vote.Gavin Shuker, ex-Labour MP for Luton South, was elected as “convener” at yesterday’s meeting. They have not yet chosen a leader.Heidi Allen said: “We’ve had a really good first meeting, discussing a lot of things structural around process, values and priorities.”Former shadow cabinet minister Lucy Powell said around  Labour MPs will vote against a second referendum.And Labour’s former Europe minister Caroline Flint said there will “never be unity in the party”it thwarts Brexit.While pro-Brexit MP John Mann  warned Corbyn in last night’s meeting: “In the Midlands and north of England this decision today will stop you from being Prime Minister. The price will be paid”.Stoke Central MP Gareth Snell told The Sun: “I won’t be voting for a second referendum under any circumstances.”Asked how many Labour MPs would vote against a second referendum, he said: “Enough to make sure it doesn’t happen.Labour MP for Aberavon Stephen Kinnock said he held “deep reservations” about a second vote and warned it would have a “corrosive” impact on democracy in the UK.Senior Labour backbencher Sir Kevin Barron also criticised Mr Corbyns decision to back a second referendum.He said: “The Labour manesto in  clearly stated that we accepted the referendum result, therefore I cannot understand why we are now being asked to back another.I will be sticking to my promise to my constituents and voting against any attempt to force a second referendum.”Meanwhile, London Mayor Sadiq Khan backed Corbyns U-turn, saying: It is the right decision for London - and for the whole country - to give the public their say for the first time on a final Brexit deal.Meanwhile Tory critics slammed Mr Corbyn and accused him selling out Leave-supporting Labour voters.Tory MP Simon Clarke said: Labour have been shaping up to try to overturn the decision of millions of northern voters for some time. Those voters will, rightly, feel bitterly betrayed.Colleague Bob Seely tweeted: Shameless #Corbyn who wanted Brexit now backs a second referendum to save his sorry leadership.Tory party chairman, Brandon Lewis, added: With only  days to go until we leave the European Union, it is clear that Jeremy Corbyns Labour want to betray the will of the British people and ignore the biggest democratic vote in our nation’s history.“Corbyn’s Labour have ripped up their promise to respect the referendum result and are now pursuing a isive second referendum that would take us back to square one.Once again it’s clear: Jeremy Corbyn is using Brexit to play his own political games.“Instead of working to thwart Brexit at this critical stage, Jeremy Corbyn should put the country’s interest before his party’s - by backing a deal that respects and delivers on the result of the referendum.”But the party’s Remainers were jubilant with the decision.Peter Kyle said: “I think it’s been part of our conference policy for a good six to eight months now, so I’m not surprised Labour has got to this point and the clock is ticking.”“The truth is I have spoken to as many people from Conservative side as I have Labour. I have spoken to people in the Cabinet down to backbenches.“Last week I had a Government minister call to meet up and discuss this deal.”Fellow Remainer Stephen Doughty said: “It’s a very welcome step forwards.”Lord Mandelson was delighted with the decision – saying a second referendum was now “inevitable”.Tottenham MP and People’s Vote campaigner David Lammy said: “It is welcome news that the Labour Party is now, at long last, signalling it will accept the principle of giving the public the final say on Brexit.”EvenMPs can agree some sort of deal, it would be wrong to force it on the British people when we now know so many of the promises made in  have been broken and any deal will be worse than the one we’ve already got inside the EU.But other Remainers poured scorn on Mr Corbyn’s commitment - saying he was “just kicking the can down the road”.Brexiteers also tore into Mr Corbyn’s annoucement, with the boss of the Leave Means Leave campaign John Longworth branding it a “cowardly decision from a man who should never be trusted with the Premiership of this country”.Mr Corbyn faced claims that he only acted to back a second referendum to avoid more of his MPs quitting the party rather than actually liking the idea.It comes after he lost eight MPs to the new Independent Group last week - most of whom blamed his reluctance to support a referendum.He added: “Leave Means Leave strongly believes no deal is no problem, however,Corbyn and his comrades get their way it won’t just be no deal for the UK but no future either. This Brexit betrayal must be stopped.”Jacob Rees Mogg told The Sun: “In an outburst of Socialist logic the Labour Party now backs a losers vote after those who most strongly campaigned for it have left to set up their new group.”Meanwhile, Labour will also endorse an amendment by Yvette Cooper due to be voted on this Wednesday which would rule out No Deal by giving the Commons the right to delay Brexit instead.And Westminster insiders suspect Mr Corbyns move is more to do with keeping his MPs happy than trying to overturn Brexit - given his lelong suspicion of the EU.On Wednesday, the Commons will vote on the way forward for Brexit.One of the amendments debated will express support for Labours alternative Brexit deal which would keep Britain in the EU customs union.Onlythat motion fails - as seems almost certain - will Mr Corbyn formally back a second referendum.Theresa May has vowed to bring her deal back to Parliament by March , andit passes then Britain WILL quit the EU.Butit fails, MPs will get a chance to vote on the next steps - and that would be the moment for Labour to support a referendum.EvenLabour, the SNP, Lib Dems and Independents win enough Tory support to get a peoples vote, its not clear what form the referendum would take.No one knows whether it would have two or three choices on the ballot paper - with the PMs deal, No Deal and Remain all potential outcomes.And to give Britain enough time for a second referendum, the EU would have to allow a delay of several months to the ongoing Brexit process.Mr Corbyn has previously resisted all moves to reverse Brexit despite pleas from pro-EU Labour activists.Todays move comes after nine of his MPs quit last week, with eight forming the anti-Brexit Independent Group.It could end up backfiring by panicking Tory Brexiteers into voting for Mrs Mays deal because theyre worried its the only way to deliver Brexit at all.Corbyn has already committed to trying to postpone Brexit on March .His conditional agreement to back a second referendum is a sickening reversal of his manesto pledges to honour the first.Imagine how Labour’s millions of duped Leavers will feelhis duplicity ends up negating their Brexit vote — after they helped him to a half-decent election performance in .Most of Labour’s at-risk marginal seats, and those they need to win, voted Leave.

The couple had been en route to London for a night out when the incident happened - and now say Lamborghini Birmingham arent interested after they claim they were nearly killed straight after the car underwent a pound, service. Mr Sira said he is considering taking legal action against the dealership. I was on the way to London with my girlfriend for a night out as I just had the car back and wanted to drive it around, he said.   We had only gone one junction when my girlfriend smelt petrol in the car, so I called the garages mechanic. He said the car has just been for a service and it is usual to smell a bit of fuel, so there wasnt a problem. So we carried on a bit further and my girlfriend asked me to open the windows, because the smell of fuel had got that strong. I stopped on the hard shoulder, between J and J, to remove the roof but then the next thing was we heard a loud bang, it was like a firework going off, and the back of my car caught fire.  I just had to watch helplessly as the car which I had worked so hard to buy went up in smoke. We nearly died,I didnt pull over when I did I dread to think what happened. It was very frightening and my girlfriend is scared to get in any car with me now. Lak, who earns pound, a year running an online trading company, is pointing the finger at the garage, accusing them of negligence.  I am meeting with my solicitor to see whether to take legal action as I cant believe its a coincidence that Id only just had the car back from the garage. The -year-old business man said that he worked his way up from a Sainsburys and a Yodel warehouse, and has worked from the bottomto own the Lamborghini, which he described as his dream car I worked   for four years in order to buy this car, he said. It was my pride and joy and I never imagined I would ever get to sit in one, let alone own my dream car.  Im absolutely devastated. I only had the car for a year and a half and I loved it.. I paid pound, to get it gold plated and pound, on the service - and then this happens. I want answers because it clearly wasnt safe to drive andit had burst into flames as I was going along then we could have been killed. A West Midlands Fire Service spokeswoman confirmed that ten firefighters were sent to the scene at .pm on Friday, using a hose-reel jet to drown out the car fire. A worker at Lamborghini Birmingham, who did not wish to be named, said: The dealership is not making any comment on the matter. Lamborghinis UK head office could not be contacted for further comment.

Despite Labours support it doesn’t mean that a second vote will happen. The numbers in Parliament are still not there.Around two dozen Labour MPs are thought to be against the plan, worrying that it would be too isive for the country. And only a handful of Tories back a People’s Vote, so even with the support of the SNP and the Lib Dems, it remains very unlikely to pass.That does not mean Corbyn’s move was futile. Is Labour united behind the move  As MPs in the crowded Westminster room last night testied, the parliamentary party was more united than it has been for months.  All the expectations were that the Labour leader would face a barracking over his handling of anti-semitism and flack for centrist MPs quitting the party. But by pulling the second referendum rabbit out of the hat, he looks likely to have staved off more defections for now. He has also given his increasingly mutinous core supporters - many of them young and enthusiastic Remainers - renewed faith. What do Labour MPs in Leave seats say  While some Labour MPs in Leave seats argue that backing a second referendum will be electoral suicide, that is unlikely to ever be properly tested. There is always the danger that the move could unite the Conservative party and help get the PM’s deal over the line.But there are some who believe that the Labour leader wouldn’t be too unhappy to see Brexit happen.Will a second referendum actually happen  Corbyn’s team know that while the move is a gamble, he is likely to end up on the right side of Labour Party history. It is probably too late for his backing for a People’s Vote to actually help deliver one. But the leadership will always be able to claim that, in the end, he came round.

Writing in the Daily Mail, they warned against being swept over the precipice on March , and said: It is a commitment that would be greeted with relief by the vast majority of MPs, businesses and their employees. We implore the Government to take that step this week. Butthe Prime Minister is not able to make this commitment, we will have no choice other than to join MPs of all parties in the House of Commons, including fellow ministers, in acting in the national interest to prevent a disaster in less than five weeks time that we may regret forever.   The paper also claimed  ministers would be ready to resign to stop no deal. It came after Mrs May suggested she could try to take her EU Withdrawal Agreement through Parliament before it has been formally approved by the other  member states. Amid growing pressure to delay Brexit with just  days left on the clock, the Prime Minister insisted it is within our grasp for Britain to leave the EU with a deal on March . European Council president Donald Tusk revealed that he had discussed the legal and procedural process for extending the two-year Article  withdrawal negotiations with Mrs May when he met her on Sunday in Egypt.   Mr Tusk said delaying the UKs withdrawal beyond March  is now a rational solution, warning that the only alternative,MPs cannot agree a deal, is a chaotic Brexit. Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte, who had talks with Mrs May in the Red Sea resort of Sharm El-Sheikh on Monday, said the UK needed to wake up. Mr Rutte told the BBC: The Netherlands is one of your best friends. What you guys are doing - leaving EU in this time of insecurity in the world, instability in EU - is the wrong decision. Its four weeks until the end date and still the UK has not agreed a position. So, now we are sleepwalking into a no-deal scenario. Its unacceptable and your best friends have to warn you. Wake up. This is real. Come to a conclusion and close the deal. Despite also facing pressure from pro-Europe Tories for a delay, the Prime Minister insisted in a press conference at the end of a summit of EU and Arab nations that she was sticking to her timetable.  Its within our grasp to leave with a deal on March  and thats where all of my energies are going to be focused, she said. Challenged over whether MPs would be able to vote on any additional assurances she secures from Brussels before they have been formally signed off by the EU, Mrs May told reporters: It is possible to do it either way. Rejecting calls for a delay, the Prime Minister said: An extension to Article , a delay in this process, doesnt deliver a decision in Parliament, it doesnt deliver a deal. All it does is precisely what the word delay says. Any extension of Article  isnt addressing the issues. We have it within our grasp. Ive had a real sense from the meetings Ive had here and the conversations Ive had in recent days that we can achieve that deal. Mr Tusk said it was absolutely clear thatthere was no majority in the Commons to approve a deal, Britain faces chaotic Brexit or extension. The less time there is until March , the greater the likelihood of an extension, said Mr Tusk. This is an objective fact. Not our intention, not our plan, but an objective fact. I believe that, in the situation we are in, an extension would be a rational solution, but Prime Minister May still believes she is able to avoid this scenario.  Mrs May said she had good meetings in Egypt with Mr Tusk, Mr Rutte, European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Irish premier Leo Varadkar and Italys Giuseppe Conte. What I sense in all my conversations with my fellow leaders, both here in Sharm El-Sheikh and in recent days, is a real determination to find a way through which allows the UK to leave the EU in a smooth and orderly way with a deal, she said. The meetings came after the PM admitted she will not get a Brexit deal in time for MPs to hold a meaningful vote this week. She said she will put her deal to Parliament by March  at the latest -  days before Britain is due to leave the EU. The PM faces the prospect of another potentially damaging Commons revolt on Wednesday, when MPs are expected to mount a fresh attempt to block a no-deal break and extend Article . A cross-party group of MPs immediately confirmed they will table an amendment giving the House the power to demand a delay to Brexitan agreement is not in place by March .  In recent days three pro-EU Cabinet ministers - Amber Rudd, David Gauke and Greg Clark - signalled they could be prepared to back the amendmentthere is no breakthrough in negotiations. There was speculation that up to  Tory MPs - including as many as  ministers - could be prepared to join them as patience among MPs opposed to no deal is stretched to breaking point. Labour MP Yvette Cooper, who drew up the amendment with Conservative former minister Sir Oliver Letwin, said it would become the real meaningful vote on the Brexit deal. She told BBC Radio s Today programme: The Government doesnt feel to me to be behaving like a responsible government at all at the moment - the idea that we could be only a few weeks from Brexit and we still dont know what kind of Brexit we are going to have and were not even going to have a vote on it until two weeks before that final deadline. I dont see how businesses can plan, I dont see how public services can plan, and I think its just deeply damaging. Mrs May confirmed that Brexit negotiators willto Brussels on Tuesday for further talks with the EUs Michel Barnier.

So I changed my focus to only eating food when my body needed it and I cut right back on my high-calorie diet, he said.  I started to exercise and taught myself about nutrition. The super slimmer decided to create the Fine Diet Plan, a fat-busting plan which counts weekly calories. Over three weeks the app calculates information about the user in order to work out their inidualised calorie requirements as accurately as possible. This information allows the team to calculate the user’s basal metabolic rate and, when combined with their occupation and activity levels, works out their optimum calorie intake for weight loss. Videos posted online show Ben’s transformation from being a st man with a -inch waist to becoming a trim st six months later with a -inch waist.   There is also a video showing him wearing the same T-shirt in his fat and slimmed-down days. I realised that it’s so old hat to count daily calories, which is why I used my experience to create the Fine Diet Plan, Benjamin said. On it, it’s fine to eat whatever you want – all the foods you love – and still lose weight. It’s all about nailing your maintenance calories – and everyone is dferent. I’m hoping that what I’ve learnt will help others to lose weight and could even tackle the obesity epidemic.

But realising he couldn’t swim, Swinfield then begged a police officer to pull him from the water. The officer in question was holding Swinfields baby at the time, having removed the child from the upturned vehicle.   Jailing him for  months, Recorder Simon King said: “This was as dangerous as it is possible to get without it resulting in death or serious injury not only to your partner and son but to other road users. “The horrible irony is that the two people who suffered the most serious injuries, although thankfully they were not too serious, were your partner and young son who you left abandoned in the car which you flipped. “The maximum sentence I can give you is two years and I am obliged to give you % credit for your guilty plea.   “Be assured thatthere was a more serious punishment available to me I would have no hesitation to handing it to you.” Sarah Slater, prosecuting, played CCTV footage of part of the chase to the court. It showed officers begin to follow Swinfield, in Nottingham Road, before he accelerates into Cleveland Avenue, reaching more than mph in a mph street.  Swinfield then speeds down Lansdown Grove, Florence Avenue, Norfolk Road, back on the Nottingham Road, Market Place and finally on to Tamworth Road where he collides with the final vehicle and ends up on the roof. Miss Slater said: “In a statement, his partner said she was asking him to stop and he was telling her it would be okay. “She said she remembers being in the car with it on the roof and with their child in a seat in the back. “She said he said to her ‘I have got to go’ and left her and the baby in the car which, by now, was smoking.” Miss Slater said the woman and baby were freed from the car and, as one of the officers was holding the baby, Swinfield was calling for help to get him out of the canal as he could not swim. He was arrested, charged and pleaded guilty to dangerous driving, failing to stop following an accident and to driving without insurance or a valid licence. The incident happened at .pm on Saturday, January , involved a Vauxhall Corsa and closed part of Tamworth Road, in Long Eaton. The partner and child were taken to the Queens Medical Centre following the crash which saw them both receive black eyes and bruising. Christopher Brewin, for Swinfield, said: “He does appreciate how serious this is and he’s ashamed of his conduct.” As well as the jail term, Recorder King handed Swinfield a two-year driving ban. In  Swinfield, of Marriott Avenue, Chilwell, Nottingham, was part of a gang of criminals who carried out a pound, “cash for crash” scam across Derbyshire.

The number of young women taking on roles as sugar babies in Cambridge is on the rise and some are reportedly making more than pound, per month. And a -year-old says taking up the role is easier than one might think. There are several companies which operate around the country, such as Seeking Arrangements, which enable users to meet a Sugar Daddy or Momma.According to the SA website, millions of students are taking on these roles as an innovative way to pay off their student loans. Nearly  students from the University of Cambridge are signed up to SA making it the th most popular destination for sugar baby activities in the country.The site has around  new signings each year from Cambridge University.Cambridgeshire Live spoke to a local sugar baby , , to find out what exactly goes on behind closed doors. What made you do it and is it for everyone I heard about the site through friends but it wasn’t until I read an article online about how this girl quit and actually married her Sugar Daddy that I decided to try it. You just have to be someone who is comfortable being upfront about what you are looking for in your next relationship. I was a student when I began using the site. I chose to date a higher class of man to help me supplement my living costs, yes.How much money do you make The men that I meet are not customers. I don’t think that’s allowed. We actually date! If I do receive financial or physical gts, the amount ies. I’d saythey are helping me with my bills, I’m gted about pound, per month. In total I’ve probably been gted about pound, since finding my most recent Sugar Daddy.Aside from the money are there any other perks of the job In terms of seeking, the best part is having access to people all over the world and I have met a few really cool people. I’m a major foodie so I love to go out to lunch or dinner. I have travelled a little bit throughout the country and to a few other big cities. Sometimes we go to concert events or Broadway shows.  You read all sorts about sugar babies getting designer handbags and Chanel No. - but whats the most expensive gt youve ever received The most expensive place that I’ve been was to Paris for four days last year. The most expensive gts that I’ve received have been a Rolex and a few designer shoes, a few Jimmy Choos, Louboutins and Louis Vuitton bags.Yeah sure, we all have Louboutins knocking around the house! But it cant be all designer gts and romantic getaways. Do you ever get scared something might happen to you The worst part is that there are some people on there with the wrong intentions or pretend to be someone they are not. It’s just like other dating sites that I’ve tried. I wasn’t so much scared because I know the cautionary steps of meeting someone for the first time, but I was certainly a little nervous to find out what he was looking for and how he’d approach this style of dating. As long as I am smart and cautious about who I meet, it’s no dferent than dating before. I do use a dferent name and number until I meet with the right match. I do this because it adds a sense of safety andthey somehow tried to expose my personal information online, it’d be harder to trace.Do you think of it as your real job The biggest misconception about sugar babies, is that people think we are lazy and don’t want to be more than a Sugar Baby. I have a job, I work part-time as a customer service representative and that’s my job. I have dreams, and goals that I want to achieve.Right, lets address the elephant in the room, do you have sex with your Sugar Daddies and do they have any weird fetishes I don’t have customers, just Sugar Daddies. If I feel like it’s grown to a point where I trust this person and see him in my le, why not. It’s no dferent than having a boyfriend of the same age, who is rich and can splurge on fancy dinners or gts. I have yet to meet one with a fetish but my friend has met a few with some interesting requests.Such as That would be telling...How often do you see each other I see my partners maybe two or three times a week. I prefer to date one person at a time. I also chat with my past Sugar Daddies all the time. They have been great influences in my le.Is there a lot of competition I thought that sales reps were in high demand but sugar babies are pretty sought after in the UK too.Do you ever find out much about what your *coughs* daddy does for a living I’ve met a few business executives, doctors, and sales directors.

But you just have to hope it works out.  Jenni originally saw sloths being sold online six years ago but her partner Terry was not so keen. This was until a trip to Greenville Zoo, Wisconsin, where the pair saw one up close for the first time and he also became enthralled by the unusual creature.

They will meet the next day for a brief one-on-one conversation, followed by a social dinner, at which they will each be accompanied by two guests and interpreters. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told reporters on Air Force One that would be followed by more meetings between the two leaders on Thursday.   Their talks come eight months after their historic summit in Singapore, the first between a sitting US president and a North Korean leader. While there is no real expectation that the second meeting will bring a final deal on ridding North Korea of nuclear weapons that threaten the US, there are some hopes it could lead to a declaration that the - Korean War is at last formally over. But the United States would expect signicant movement by Kim towards denuclearisation in .  In Singapore, Kim pledged to work toward complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula, but the vague agreement struck there has produced few concrete results. US Democratic senators and security officials have warned Trump against cutting a deal that would do little to curb North Koreas nuclear ambitions. Kim, who travelled from the North Korean capital by train, arrived at the station in the Vietnamese town of Dong Dang after crossing over the border from China. Vietnamese officials were on hand to receive him at the station with a red-carpet including a guard of honour and North Korean and Vietnamese flags flying.   Kim was seen leaving the train in Dong Dang and getting into a Mercedes Benz vehicle for the  mile journey to the capital, Hanoi, by car. He waved from the car before setting off to young people lining the street waving Vietnamese and North Korean flags. About a dozen body guards ran along side his car as he set off. Both Kim and Trump are also due to hold separate talks with Vietnamese leaders. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo also arrived in Hanoi, on Tuesday, a reporter travelling with him said.  Pompeo has been Trumps top envoy in his efforts to improve ties with the reclusive North and has made several trips to Pyongyang to negotiate steps towards ending its nuclear programme. Trump told reporters he and Kim would have a very tremendous summit. Tweeting on Monday, he stressed the benefits to North Koreait gave up its nuclear weapons. With complete Denuclearization, North Korea will rapidly become an Economic Powerhouse. Without it, just more of the same. Chairman Kim will make a wise decision! Trump said. In a speech on Sunday night, Trump, however, appeared to play down any hope of a major breakthrough at the Hanoi summit, saying he would be happy as long as North Korea maintained its pause on weapons testing.  Im not in a rush. I dont want to rush anybody, he said. I just dont want testing. As long as theres no testing, were happy. North Korea conducted its last nuclear test in September  and last tested an intercontinental ballistic missile in November . A South Korean presidential spokesman told reporters in Seoul on Monday that the two sides might be able to agree to a formal end of the Korean War, which ended in an armistice not a peace treaty, a move North Korea has long sought. While a formal peace treaty may be a long way off, the two sides have discussed the possibility of a political declaration stating that the war over. The possibility is there, the South Korean spokesman, Kim Eui-kyeom told a briefing.

carrying out a probe.Vehicles were also stopped from entering the car park close to the road block, but there was no evacuation of the area.Now a spokesman for police in Dundee has disclosed, after

a note written in Urdu.“We had it translated and apparently it’s some kind of good luck charm, whereby you write the note, wrap it in animal skin, cast it into the water, and it brings you good luck.”One witness at the riverside scene – which took place on Monday February  – said at the time: “It was quite exciting.“The package was about the size of a binoculars case and when it was opened there were other cellophane wrapped packages inside.”He added that his immediate thought then was it could be a drugs parcel which had been ditched into the water – but he felt nobody could have guessed what was actually wrapped up inside the box before it was eventually uncovered.Firefighters stood down as soon as it was confirmed there was no danger to the public and police began examining the package further.One officer wearing rubber gloves removed the parcel at around .pm.A police spokeswoman at the time thanked the member of the public who reported the package while walking along

Not that we really thought or spoke about it but I donrsquot think we were too far away from getting to the record of clean sheets and wersquod got there by playing some very good football.ldquoItrsquos disappointing. Something Irsquove never seen before. Itrsquos a bit embarrassing to be honest. Irsquom sure they woke up on Monday morning and were a bit embarrassed of how theyrsquove handled it. They had the chance to recty the situation after and did nothing about it.ldquoThe amount of work that we put in to those games before with the clean sheets, the way we defendedhellip and itrsquos gone out of the window for something that shouldnrsquot really happen in football.ldquoFor us to come in and them to say lsquoyou won the game anywayrsquo hellip thatrsquos just absolutely pathetic.James Scott set the goal up when he latched onto a throw-in that Liam Grimshaw had put into the left channel. As play slowed anticipating a casual passing of the ball back, it quickly became apparent that the teenager was going for goal.Scott looked sheepish as he left the pitch later in the game, almost apologising to his bench, and Motherwell manager Stephen Robinson cited the inexperience of the player as the reason for the goal that flouted convention.Bain, though, was scornful of the reasons offered as he insisted that the responsibility for it ought to have been taken by the Motherwell management.ldquoTheir manager tried to blame it on a young lads but yoursquod got the chance to recty the situation after and they donrsquot do it, said Bain.ldquoI dunno. So, what has [Scott] not watched football before  Hersquos not played a game before  Youth team levels all the way up, it happens at every level. I thinkyou are the manager you have to recty the situation.ldquoI donrsquot understand what he was thinking. Hersquos tried to blame it on a young lad but hersquos in charge. So between him and the rest of the players they can sort it out. But obviously they didnrsquot want to. They wanted to try and get a second goal and get a point or go on to win the game.It will be interesting to note just what happens in the next fixtures between the sidesthere is a similar scenario of a player on either side requiring treatment. Bainrsquos fury was still simmering as he suggested that he would be playing tit-for-tat in any future matches, but that would seem unlikely given Brendan Rodgersrsquo is always at pains to stress a respect for opponents.Still, though,it was up to Bain there would be no such understanding.ldquoIf it was up to me  No. Not a chance, he said. ldquoIn future wersquoll probably just play with  men and not put the ball out of play.

In fact, on average, Borderers are forking out pound less than their Northumbrian opposite numbers.Since First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced the end of the freeze in , Scottish Borders Council has taken full advantage of the ability to raise council tax by % each year, and this year is no dferent, as the council agreed to a three per cent increase in December .However, the deal agreed by the SNP and Scottish Greens allows councils to raise tax by up to . per cent for  .Council leader Shona Haslam, who represents Tweeddale East, has been adamant that Scottish Borders Council will not take advantage of the increased limit, and will not raise an extra . per cent on Borderersrsquo council tax, instead sticking to an increase of three per cent.Council will not introduce workplace parking levy:Scottish Conservatives in the Borders have been very vocal about their opposition to the Scottish Government plans to introduce a workplace parking levy, where employers will be charged an annual tax based on how many parking spaces they provide for their employees.The aim is to persuade more commuters to use public transport in a bid to reduce pollution, but the charge could lead to employers passing the bill onto their employees.Both councillor Haslam and Scottish Borders Councilrsquos SNP opposition leader Stuart Bell, who both represent the rural ward of Tweeddale East, have signalled their opposition to the plans, so it is extremely unlikely this will feature in the councilrsquos budget proposals.Borderers who travel to Edinburgh for work could possibly be affected by the levy though, as Edinburgh City Council is considering implementing the charges.A move to three-weekly bin collections:Rumours have been circulating amongst councillors that Scottish Borders Councilrsquos waste refuse collection service will move to three-weekly bin collections, from the current once-a-fortnight collectionThe local authority is currently reviewing its waste collection service, which is expected to feed into the new budget for  .In fact, at a meeting of the council in October , Selkirkshire councillor Gordon Edgar, the authorityrsquos executive member for roads and infrastructure, refused to rule out the possibility when questioned by Hawick and Denholm councillor David Paterson.,params: .pushThe veteran Hawick councillor said: ldquoIf they go to a three-weekly collection it would cause some very serious problems for many of the people that we represent and I am sure it would increase the incidents of fly tipping.No tourism tax:Another controversial aspect of the SNP Scottish Greens budget proposals is the introduction of a tourism tax on nightly accommodation.Much like the workplace parking levy, local authorities have discretion over whether to implement it or not, and again Scottish Borders Tories have ruled out introducing it here.Changes to grass cutting services:Grass cutting, or the lack of it, has been a constant thorn in the side of the council over the past year.As an issue which caused a large furore, Scottish Borders Council could well announce further changes to the grass cutting regime, particularly around the maintenance of cemeteries.Changing the frequency of grass cutting from a -day cycle to a -day cycle was widely criticised by communities, with residents reporting overgrown public spaces and ankle-high grass in the regionrsquos cemeteries.Many opposition councillors have called for a rethink on the councilrsquos grass cutting policy, and due to the large number of complaints from Borders resident it is expected to be addressed in Thursdayrsquos budget announcement."},{"url":null,"title":"sos-to-keep-youth-club-afloat","story":"AN SOS has been issued in a bid to keep a village youth club open.Walkerburn Youth Club needs adults who have an interest or experience in working with young people to get in touch.The club meets at the Public Hall every Thursday evening from . to pm -

according to new research.While there is a huge range of vitamins on the market for parents to choose from, the vast majority contain far less than the correct dose, experts said.Vitamin D is essential to prevent rickets, a condition that affects bone development in children and which can lead tothe growth of soft, weak and deformed limbs.It is dficult to get enough vitamin D from diet, and the main source is sunshine.However, the weather in the UK means that there is limited exposure to sunlight from November to March.Public Health Englandrecommends that children aged one to four receive a daily  microgramvitamin D supplement.Those aged under one should be given a . to  microgram daily vitamin D supplement to ensure they get enough.In the new study, experts from the universities of Oxford and Southampton examined vitamins aimed at children sold by Asda, Morrisons, Ocado, Sainsburyrsquos, Tesco, Boots, Holland and Barrett,Lloyds Pharmacy and Superdrug.In total,  multivitamin products made by  dferent manufacturers were included in the study.The daily vitamin D dose in the vitamins ranged from zero to IU.Only one multivitamin was suitable for use from birth and this supplied IU per day ndash around half the recommended amount.For children under six months of age, only one multivitamin contained more than  IU day vitaminD, but this was only recommended from four months of age.For children over six months, just % to % of the available multivitamins provided the recommended IU per day of vitamin D, the experts said.The researchers also looked at specic vitamin D products and vitamins marketed as being for healthy bones.Of the  products that were available, the range of vitamin D in them was from  to ,IU.Six products were suitable from birth, of which five contained  to IU per day ndash around the recommended amount.Writing in the Archives of Disease in Childhood journal, the authors concluded: ldquoThere is a wide range of both multivitamins and vitamin D supplementsavailable for children in the UK, yet most of these do notprovide the recommended  IU day.ldquoMultivitamins typically had lower vitamin D content than pure vitamin D supplementsor lsquohealthy bonesrsquo products, although some products labelled as lsquofor bonesrsquo contained very low levels of vitamin D.The natural way to obtain vitamin D is from sunlight, but there is inadequate exposure in the UKThe team also looked at the Governmentrsquos Healthy Start scheme, which provides free multivitamins to low-income families, but these provide onlyIU per day of vitamin D.The research comes after data analysed by the Press Association showed there were , hospital admissions with a main or secondary diagnosis of vitamin D deficiency in

admissions for rickets in children aged nine and under, up from  the year before.A further  admissions for rickets were among those aged  to , up from  the year before.Dr Benjamin Jacobs, from the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health , said:ldquoA normal healthy UK diet provides less than % of the recommended amount of vitamin D.ldquoThe natural way to obtain vitamin D is from sunlight, but there is inadequate exposure to sunlight in the UK so supplements are the only way to ensure UK children get the recommended dose.ldquoTo learn that so many products fail to provide children with the recommended level of Vitamin D is highly concerning, especially when latest evidence shows our childrenrsquos average intake are still below the recommended amount.ldquoThese products are misleading parents who think they are protecting their children from serious conditions such as rickets, poor growth and muscle weakness.ldquoI would advise all parents to check that the

Now, with less regulation in place, there are thousands.’True to the name, Viola FC is a family-run agency # his son Johnny joined its ranks in early  # with their main work both in representing players coming to the UK, and ‘brokering’.John explained: ‘We mostly represent footballers transferring to the UK, while brokering involves working with clubs, players and other agents to help bring those players here.‘That said, we have done a lot of work in countries such as Brazil and China in recent years, where there is a huge appetite for football. You make valuable contacts and get to see some exciting players.’However, for John the image of the football agent thrashing out a lucrative deal for himself as well as for the player, fails to tell the whole story.He explained: ‘Of course working in football can be financially rewarding, but it’s a hard job. People think you’re just walking around in a suit with a laptop and phone, but so much goes into being a player representative.‘You need to travel a lot, and that means lots of airport lounges and hotel rooms.‘You’re working long days and doing lots behind the scenes, and all year round,  because that’s what it takes.‘The public see the excitement of the transfer windows on TV and then think that’s all agents do.‘If an agent does their job properly, they are available day and night, looking after the whole package for the player, like houses and children’s schooling.‘We’re more than a ‘necessary evil’, we do an important service for both the club, and the player.’Thinking about Campbeltown visits again, John brings up a memorable trip to the Wee Toon, where his son Johnnybecame an unofficial pool champ.John said: ‘My uncle John took us to the Commercial Inn to watch a game of football on the TV.

But spring still feels like a long way off.I crave it, not just because it makes the evening walks in the woods possible once more, but because of the beauty it s to the landscape.The land is still dormant, with nature seemingly sleeping. Itrsquos at this time of year that the ugly results of peoplersquos disregard for the land can be most clearly seen. Litter of all kinds lsquodecoratesrsquo the roadsides. In summer it is partly hidden as hedges, roadside bushes and grasses grow. But in winter nature retreats and exposes the extent of peoplersquos uncaring behaviour.I canrsquot understand it, I really canrsquot. Our country is so beautul, yet so many people just throw rubbish from their car window. Do they not see the results and feel a sense of shame and horror  In a country where we have the facilities to dispose of our rubbish, there is simply no excuse to trash our landscape like this.And in a time when there are cuts to vital services, councils having to pay money to pick up peoplersquos rubbish from the sides of roads is just another unseen effect. Itrsquos not just that itrsquos ugly to look at, itrsquos polluting our environment, killing wildle and leaving an appalling legacy for our children.And so as we set off last Sunday for a walk, the sight of litter strewn everywhere along the roadside was quite depressing. And my children noticed its ugliness too. ldquoWhy do people litter like this  I was asked by my five-year-old Skye, and to be honest I struggled for an answer.ldquoI really donrsquot know, but it must be because they donrsquot care.My daughter seemed forlorn at this reply as we drove past a mass of discarded fast food remains, plastic bottles, beer bottles, plastic bags and yet more fast food rubbish.But I wanted to lt her spirits and so told her we were going on a hunt for something beautul. We were on a snowdrop hunt! And so as we drove to our destination, I reminded them of my version of the old story:lsquoMany years ago, Snow had no colour. It felt ashamed and left out to be colourless, especially when the land was so beautully covered in flowers of all dferent colours.And so Snow asked the flowersthey would be willing to share just a little of their colour. First Snow asked the daffodils, who were a beautul yellow. But they said no, they needed all their colour for themselves.Then Snow asked the bluebells, who were a wonderful blue. But they said they were too small to share any of their colour.Then Snow asked the whin bushesthey could share some of their vivid yellow, and they said no because they needed the colour.Snow even asked the roses of summer, but got the same answer: no.Then Snow heard a small voice and looked down. It was a small white flower. We can share some of our colour, with you it said.ldquoBut you are so small and you need your colour for yourself, said Snow. ldquoYes, the flower replied, ldquowe are small and we need our colour, but there are many of us andeach one of us gives a little then we can give you enough colour.ldquoThat is very kind of you but I donrsquot want to ruin your beautul appearance, said Snow.ldquoDonrsquot worry, said the wee white flower, ldquowe can all take a little colour from the inside of our petals, so it will not be noticed that any white is missing.rsquoAnd so that is how Snow became white. And because of the kindness shown by this little flower, Snow agreed to share its name with it, and so they became known as snowdrops.Snow also shared its space with the wee flower, so snowdrops and snow are often seen on the ground together. Andyou look carefully inside the snowdrop, you will see the hidden part where the white has been scraped off to give to Snow.With the storyrsquos end we arrived at Smeaton Lake, near East Linton, our destination for the snowdrop hunt. Itrsquos such a beautul place where a planted wood stands guard by a lake created  years ago. The woodland here is possibly unsurpassed in East Lothian for the canopy of snowdrops it displays.Excited screams at small patches of the flower soon gave way to ldquowow, look as we reached the end of the waterside and a wood carpeted by the wee flowers.My spirits were lted as I watched my daughter carefully examine flowers for evidence they had shared their colour. She showed her wee brother the green strips inside, explaining that is where the white was shared from. Both were careful not to damage or pick the flowers, despite their desire to do so.ldquoWersquoll find some growing in a less happy place and take those ones home, I assured them.And so we eventually headed back, a delicious bowl of ice cream at The Goth in Prestonpans, accompanied by traditional music, the reward for a good dayrsquos hunting.That night my daughter was reflective. ldquoI wish people wouldnrsquot spoil nature, she said. I felt guilty shersquos only five, I thought to myself, and shouldnrsquot have to be concerned about such things at that age. Perhaps I should have kept my thoughts to myself.ldquoBut I wonrsquot, and Irsquoll tell my friends not to as well. Can you tell me the snowdrop story again  So I told her the story once more.She had one wee snowdrop in a bowl by her bed. We had found it growing precariously at the verge of the road, surrounded by litter, and she wanted to lsquosaversquo it. So we did, hopefully with roots intact.ldquoWell we will plant the snowdrop in the garden and perhaps we will have our own snowdrops next year!

Such days are ones which have been borrowed from another month, and I think given the temperature and weather we have had recently the days have been borrowed from May.In , May will have borrowed Februaryrsquos days, so we can expect some unseasonal weather in that month as well, but in a dferent way.Sunday was a borrowed day for sure it was so mild and the later part sunny with a feeling of spring in the air. It was a perfect day for a discovery.We set off to find a place Irsquod only recently heard about. A friend had asked me what I knew about the lsquoKingrsquos Chairrsquo by Gullane. I had to admit that Irsquod never heard of it. He told me one of the holes at the golf course there has this name, but it seems it is named after a location nearby.This set me investigating. Sure enough, I found it marked on the map and searched for an image, which I found on a website called Ancient Stones: a large boulder, shaped like a throne, guarded by two other stones either side. It intrigued me and so our quest began.The starting point of our adventure was Gullane Beach car park. I knew roughly where to look but purposefully hadnrsquot brought the map so that we had a challenge to find the lsquochairrsquo. We knew what it looked like and that we needed to walk along the upper path, not the one that heads for the beach.We went the wrong way at first and got stuck in a mass of sea buckthorn, but on reflection that just added to the sense of adventure and achievement. We soon found our way and then suddenly there it was, up on Gullane Hill. The kids ran excitedly towards the stones, shouting: ldquoFound it, found it.I felt quite exhilarated at the discovery, and to be honest impressed by the sight of the Kingrsquos Chair. I can see how it got its name, as it looks something like a majestic reclining armchair. The two boulders on either side of it look like sentries keeping watch.The kids sat on it, of course, and I had to wait my turn after my we, who reckoned it could just as easily be a lsquoQueenrsquos Chairrsquo.When I finally got a chance to seat my majestic posterior on the chair, I realised the view was majestic as well, with Gullane Beach very visible in the near distance.I reflected on the fact we had recently visited Edinburgh Castle and seen the Stone of Destiny or Stone of Scone, along with the crown jewels. This rather uninspiring stone in Edinburgh Castle may be the coronation stone used for  years in England, but it is not, I am sure, the coronation stone used by ancient kings of Scotland, despite official claims that it is.I think itrsquos pretty clear that Edward I never got his hands on the real Stone of Destiny and I am convinced it has remained in Scotland, hidden somewhere, ever since. It occurred to me that this stone actually better fitted the early description of the original coronation stone at Scone than the one in Edinburgh Castle.ldquoImaginethis is the real Stone of Destiny and has been here all the time, I said fancully out loud. I know it isnrsquot, of course, but I have to saythis Kingrsquos Chair was on display at Edinburgh Castle it would certainly look more authentic.But sadly there seems to be no recorded tradition connected to this Kingrsquos Chair. I could find no story, or reference to the origin of its name. Perhaps some local people have some information on this There is an entry from the s that records the name, citing locals as the source, so there is some historic veracity in its title. But no suggestion is offered for the origin of the name, or any tradition associated with the stone. Its geology I could not say but it doesnrsquot seem to be a glacial erratic.And so we are left to wonder. We discussed how the stone got here and how it got its name. Maybe some children played here many generations ago and gave the boulder its title. Perhaps a Viking king who landed on Gullane Beach sat himself down on this natural throne to survey his warriors at their bloody work.Whatever the origin, the name, the location and the nature of the stone make this a worthwhile and fun discovery, even without a firm legend attached to it.And as I sat on the chair I watched smoke billowing from the coastline a little further to the west, close to the edge of Aberlady nature reserve. What caused the fire I didnrsquot know, but even from a distance it seemed destructive.It was a prophetic sight to witness from the Kingrsquos Chair. It looked like a burning coastline from a Viking raid. Thankfully the distant screech of fire engines told us help was on the way. The children wanted to go see the fire, but we kept our distance from the flames and let the firefighters do their job.So the trip to the Kingrsquos Chair had been an adventure in more ways than one. On our way back, the children advanced dferent theories about the origin of the name. It was universally agreed that a story must be made, but no agreement on the actual tale.ldquoPerhaps, I said, ldquowe should leave it to the imagination of those who search for and discover it, so they can sit and feel the power of the place and get ideas.My imagination was certainly ablaze. I saw the leader of the ancient Gododdin tribe, King Loth, sitting on the stone, looking out to the Firth as he watched his terried daughter in a small coracle being taken out to the open sea, his brutal punishment for her defiance of his authority.The story would fit as her journey began at Aberlady Bay, and so her small craft would have been seen from the Kingrsquos Chair as it passed by, being pulled out to sea by one of the kingrsquos boats.Itrsquos all a fancy of my imagination, of course, but thatrsquos my story.

for parents to choose from, the vast majority contain far less than the correct dose, experts said.Vitamin D is essential to prevent rickets, a condition that affects bone development in children and which can lead tothe growth of soft, weak and deformed limbs.It is dficult to get enough vitamin D from diet, and the main source is sunshine.However, the weather in the UK means that there is limited exposure to sunlight from November to March.Public Health Englandrecommends that children aged one to four receive a daily  microgramvitamin D supplement.Those aged under one should be given a . to  microgram daily vitamin D supplement to ensure they get enough.In the new study, experts from the universities of Oxford and Southampton examined vitamins aimed at children sold by Asda, Morrisons, Ocado, Sainsburyrsquos, Tesco, Boots, Holland and Barrett,Lloyds Pharmacy and Superdrug.In total,  multivitamin products made by  dferent manufacturers were included in the study.The daily vitamin D dose in the vitamins ranged from zero to IU.Only one multivitamin was suitable for use from birth and this supplied IU per day ndash around half the recommended amount.For children under six months of age, only one multivitamin contained more than  IU day vitaminD, but this was only recommended from four months of age.For children over six months, just % to % of the available multivitamins provided the recommended IU per day of vitamin D, the experts said.The researchers also looked at specic vitamin D products and vitamins marketed as being for healthy bones.Of the  products that were available, the range of vitamin D in them was from  to ,IU.Six products were suitable from birth, of which five contained  to IU per day ndash around the recommended amount.Writing in the Archives of Disease in Childhood journal, the authors concluded: ldquoThere is a wide range of both multivitamins and vitamin D supplementsavailable for children in the UK, yet most of these do notprovide the recommended  IU day.ldquoMultivitamins typically had lower vitamin D content than pure vitamin D supplementsor lsquohealthy bonesrsquo products, although some products labelled as lsquofor bonesrsquo contained very low levels of vitamin D.The team also looked at the Governmentrsquos Healthy Start scheme, which provides free multivitamins to low-income families, but these provide onlyIU per day of vitamin D.The research comes after data analysed by the Press Association showed there were , hospital admissions with a main or secondary diagnosis of vitamin D deficiency in   ndash % more than the

children aged nine and under, up from  the year before.A further  admissions for rickets were among those aged  to , up from  the year before.Dr Benjamin Jacobs, from the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health , said:ldquoA normal healthy UK diet provides less than % of the recommended amount of vitamin D.ldquoThe natural way to obtain vitamin D is from sunlight, but there is inadequate exposure to sunlight in the UK so supplements are the only way to ensure UK children get the recommended dose.ldquoTo learn that so many products fail to provide children with the recommended level of Vitamin D is highly concerning, especially when latest evidence shows our childrenrsquos average intake are still below the recommended amount.ldquoThese products are misleading parents who think they are protecting their children from serious conditions such as rickets, poor growth and muscle weakness.ldquoI would advise all parents to check that the supplements they use contain the recommended  units of vitamin D and consult their pharmacistthey are unsure.He also said the Government should seriously consider fortying somefoods and milk with Vitamin D.Dr Carrie Ruxton, from the

since there are ying recommendations across dferent age groups of children, it is right that dferent supplements offer dferent doses.ldquoSmaller doses allow parents to use the same product for younger and older children by ying the amount given.ldquoAccording to the most recent National Diet and Nutrition Survey data, children and adolescents are only getting a fth of the recommended

Irsquom not sure who exactly has been preventing transgender women using public conveniences. So far as I know, you donrsquot have to show a birth certicate, or undergo a medical exam to have a pee. But what do I know as a pale, stale male.What I do know is that ldquocis-gender is an ugly neologism which many women find offensive. They are content with their present sexual terminology. ldquoCis is in the same linguistic ballpark as ldquoTERF ndash trans exclusionary radical feminist, which is a term of abuse used against women who believe persons with penises are, er, male. I should be careful here because a number of TERFS have been banned from social media for saying that a person with a penis is a man. So I wonrsquot say that.Instead, letrsquos just take it as read that in future we are going to have to accept that the concept of sexual dferentiation with which we have been living for thousands of years is finally being exposed as a malign transphobic hood. At any rate, the Scottish Government appears determined to press ahead with reform of the Gender Recognition Act, which will allow trans people to assign themselves legally and biologically female. Hitherto, trans people have had to undergo medical examination and get a diagnosis of ldquogender dysphoria. No more. From now on, anyone can change their birth certicate to whatever they wish.Earlier this month, Holyroodrsquos culture committee warned that ending binary ldquoMale or Female questions in the Scottish census will render much of the results meaningless and, willy nilly, import an unscientic definition of sex into the law. But the Scottish Government is not listening. Nicola Sturgeon told a UN equalities conference last week that the concerns of feminists about the GRA are ldquomisplaced.Women ndash sorry, ldquomenstruators ndash who say that self-ID erases their sexual identity will be told: just get over it. They can complain that ldquosex is a protected characteristic under the  Equalities Act, and that women therefore have a right to their own unique spaces. But now that men can actually become women under the law, this right will be impossible to articulate. Trans women with male anatomy will be entitled to enter womenrsquos changing rooms, girl guide troops or womenrsquos prisons. Women who complain will be guilty of transphobia, and are likely to be visited by the police recording a ldquohate incident.Now, I have nothing against adults changing their gender, or identying as women, queer, non-binary, intersex or whatever. It seems to be reinforcing outmoded concepts of gender to suggest that, because someone wants to wear dresses, play with dolls and put on makeup, they must have a lady brain in a male body. I thought we had left pink-for-girls gender stereotyping behind. But never mind. No-one wishes trans people any ill ndash certainly not me. But now that we are abandoning the very biological definition of sex, there are some anomalies that need to be addressed.Last week, a British transgender man, who had IVF by sperm donation and gave birth, won a court battle to prevent his child having ldquomother on its birth certicate. It will be the first child in history to have no mother. The The AIRE Centre, a human rights charity, contested this on the grounds that it would make le dficult for the child in future, when they apply for visas or anything which enquires about family background. The Government said simply that this isnrsquot a problem. From now on, fathers can give birth ndash end of.But Irsquom not sure this is the end of the matter. Children have not been included in the gender recognition debate thus far, even though they have rights too. It could be psychologically disturbing for a child to find, one day, that its mother has decided to become its dad. That song ldquoSometimes I feel like a motherless child takes on a whole new meaning.Of course, the trans parent will still be present, but is it OK to expect a child to suddenly start calling her natural mother her father  I would have thought that a child has a continuing right to a legal motherthey were born with one. If misgendering a trans person is unacceptable, surely demothering a child should be too. This is going to be confusing to say the least.Then there is the question of sport. The controversy over athlete Caster Semenya, a woman with high testosterone, raises the question of how to regard trans womenrsquos participation in women-only sport. Athletes who have testes, and therefore posses greater body mass, muscle strength and bone density, have an unfair advantage over old-fashioned women who have genetically female bodies.Next week, the International Association of Athletics Federations will argue in a hearing in Switzerland that people like Semenya should take testosterone-suppressing drugs before competing. Not only would this drive a coach and horses through the anti-doping protocols, it surely poses problem for transgender athletes who, of course, also take drugs like testosterone to help them transition to their ldquocorrect male sex. I hope the sporting authorities can get their heads around that because I canrsquot.Yet this is a very live issue in many sports. In the US, the ban on trans women taking part in power-lting events is being lted to prevent accusations of discrimination. You might have thought that having beefy, male-bodied women participating in these contests is discriminating against women athletes. Though, of course, only transphobes would say that, so we wonrsquot go there.The logical solution to this conundrum is to end sexual segregation in sport. Andwomen who are born biologically female never win any medals, tough. Strangely, there doesnrsquot seem to be the same issue about female-bodied trans men participating in male-only sport . Irsquom sure that has nothing whatever to do with the fact that they wonrsquot win anything.So welcome to the brave new world of post-sexual dferentiation, where men become women and fathers have children. It is one of the most radical and abrupt cultural changes in human history.Women have had a pretty bad deal in previous centuries, when they were regarded often as chattels without rights. In some Muslim societies theyrsquore still second-class citizens. Now, as women are finally emerging from the shadow of patriarchy, they are being told, by men, that they no longer have exclusive rights to their sexual identity.Itrsquos a weird turn of events. It seems women are just on the wrong side of history. But somehow, I donrsquot think theyrsquoll go quietly."},{"url":null,"title":"Rosemary Goring  Now is the time for the Catholic Church   s own Reformation","story":"For this book Martel has conducted more than , interviews in the Vatican City in Rome, and across the world. He has spoken to priests, cardinals, bishops, monsignors, papal ambassadors, seminarians and the Swiss Guard. His conclusion, which will shock some and come as no surprise to others, is that about  per cent of the clergy in the Vatican state are gay. In other words, the HQ of a church that will not bless same-sex relationships, and forbids its clergy to have sex lives, is riddled with hyprocisy at its very core.Of these  per cent, Martel writes, some are celibate or in denial, others are living with their partners, or resort to prostitutes. A rule of thumb is that the more vehemently a cleric condemns homosexuality, the more likely he is to be in the closet himself. Hence the behaviour of the Colombian cardinal, Alfonso Lopez Trujillo. He was in the vanguard of the churchrsquos mission to prevent gay marriage. As the dire consequences of the Aids epidemic became clear, contrary to commonsense and compassion, he refused to encourage the use of condoms. Here was someone eager to be seen to uphold traditional values. Yet Martel claims that Trujillo, who died in , used male prostitutes.There are examples closer to home, among them the late Cardinal Keith OrsquoBrien, who pursued a similarly denunciatory anti-gay agenda, despite his own homosexuality and predatory behaviour. In fact, it doesnrsquot matter where you look. Throughout the Catholic churchrsquos parishes, globally and locally, there has been the mother of all cover-ups, not just in the buttoned-up past, but right now, here, today.You could say the church has been built on lies: countless men forced to hide who they really are, or to seek refuge in an all-male environment where they could find illicit love behind closed doors. Those clergy who were straight must have found themselves in a bewildering labyrinth of duplicity. That such depths of deceit have been allowed to thrive says all you need to know about the controlling power of those at the heart of the church.Martel believes that Pope Francis has earned enemies by adopting a very untypical approach. ldquoWho am I to judge  he replied, when askedhe condemned homosexuals, thereby loosening the ground beneath the feet of those in the Holy See who donrsquot want their secrets aired, or their way of le altered.The revelation of such widespread double standards is an echo of the medieval churchrsquos calamitous abuse of power and wealth. Out of it has sprung a culture where bullying, intimidation and blackmail have flourished. Andthat has been going on in this sphere, you can be sure it will have spilled over into every other part of the churchrsquos affairs.In the wake of the revelation of child abuse on a grand scale in the church, you begin to see why hiding the truth was the default position. This is not to make a link between homosexuality and child abuse but to see why the ecclesiastical authorities were so quick, and adept, at making the problem disappear. In avoiding scandal, they were intent on protecting their own rather than those who had been so grievously harmed.With evidence of institutionalised deception of the extent Martel claims, the church brings shame on itself: not for the numbers of priests who are gay, but for the willingness to lie about it, and to break vows, and the spirit of vocation, to an extent that will appall devout parishioners.Now is the time for the Catholic Churchrsquos own Reformation. No-one can any longer doubt that the le expected of a Catholic priest is unhealthy. And since there is no biblical injunction on him to be celibate, why can this not be changed  Already the church is embracing married Anglican vicars in flight from the ordination of women. Why not allow Catholic clergy the same right to open relationships, whether they be gay or straight Until the double-speak on which the modern church stands is addressed, there is no hope of winning back the faithful who have lost all trust and respect in this once revered institution. Obliging men to profess one thing while being another, is psychological torment. The denial of clergyrsquos humanity and self-expression is as cruel as anything the Inquisition devised. If the Vatican could bring itself to accept homosexuality, and gay marriage, and a non-celibate priesthood, it would be a truly Christian act.Read more: Cardinal Keith OBrien asked for forgiveness"},{"url":null,"title":"Marianne Taylor  Last chance for Mundell to put country before party","story":"The majority of these demands are perfunctory, of course, made in the knowledge and expectation that they will be ignored by the target, while playing well with the initiatorrsquos supporters.The craziness of the last few months has precipitated a flurry of genuine and warranted resignation demands, however, which under normal political circumstances would have resulted in multiple ministerial heads rolling in any other era the Prime Minister would have been forced out long ago.Marianne Taylor: BBC is better off without Neil and HumphrysAnother case in point is Scottish Secretary David Mundell, whose stubborn insistence on being ineffectual in the face of the biggest crisis this country has faced in generations is matched only by that of Jeremy Corbyn.

If you like, it was four minutes encapsulating what moviemaking is about - making you believe.The laughs were less scripted.British actress Olivia Colman has come a long way from the days of her understated role as a scruffy and unstable love interest of the socially awkward and despondent loan manager played by David Mitchell in Peep Show.Since then she has become a serial winner of awards for her acting culminating in her first, surely of many, best actress Oscar for her role as as Queen Anne, the erratic and gout-ridden monarch in The Favourite.Her endearingly scatterbrained and scattergun speech has to go down as one of the most bizarre, emotional yet hilarious acceptances in recent years.She began by wiping the tears from eyes and said: \"Ooooh, its genuinely quite stressful... this is hilarious. Got an Oscar.\"In a typicallyoff-the-cuff acceptance speech, Colman said she wanted to ldquothanks lots of people and thatshe forgot anyone she would find them later and give them ldquoa massive snog.Colman said how shocked she was to be there, having once worked as a cleaner and then blew a raspberry as she was asked to wind up.She also thanked Glenn Close, who was widely tipped as the likely best actress winner, saying she had been ldquoher idol for so long this is not how I wanted it to be.She went on to thank her children Finn,  and Hall, , adding she ldquohopes they are at home and watching, because ldquothis isnrsquot going to happen again.The Oscars have major flaws, of course, and viewers have to swallow the conceit that the best movies appear to be American.And, of course, the winning films are often worthy and issue-driven with action blockbusters, comedy and horror barely getting a look in.. So the best picture winner was race relations drama Green Book and included among the eight nominated best picture gongs are BlacKkKlansman, a movie about an African-American detective inflitrating the Ku Klux Klan, and Roma, a Mexican drama about the Mexican director Alfonso Cuaroacuten upbringing in the Colonia Roma neighborhood of Mexico City.Its asthe Academy are making a conscious effort to love Mexico in the midst of Donald Trumps determination to pledge to build a border wall.If that was not obvious politicisation over art, then Spike Lees comments while accepting the Best Adapted Screenplay award for BlacKkKlansman definitely was.He implored Americans to praise ancestors \"stolen from Mother Africa\" who have \"built this country into what it is today along with the genocide of its native people\".He said during Sunday nightrsquos ceremony: ldquoThe  presidential election is around the corner. Letrsquos all mobilise. Letrsquos all be on the right side of history. Make the moral choice between love versus hate. Letrsquos do the right thing.Trump, who is on his way to a summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Vietnam, responded with a personal jab on Twitter saying: ldquoBe niceSpike Lee could read his notes, or better yet not have to use notes at all, when doing his racist hit on your president, who has done more for African Americansthan almost any other pres!The controversy over Lee did not end there. He would later declare ldquothe ref made a bad call when Green Book won and reportedly tried to storm out of the Dolby Theatre after the announcement.Green Book, based on a true story of the friendship between a black pianist and his white driver touring the racially segregated deep south during the s, also won for best original screenplay and supporting actor, Mahershala Ali.In the press room backstage, Lee recalled that his film Do the Right Thing had failed to earn a best picture nomination for the Oscars in , the year that Driving Miss Daisy ndash about a black chauffeur for a white elderly southern woman ndash won the award.ldquoIrsquom snakebit. Every time someone is driving somebody, I lose, Lee said.The director, a fan of the New York Knicks basketball team, said when he heard Green Book announced as the yearrsquos best picture winner: ldquoI thought I was courtside at the [Madison Square] Garden, and the ref made a bad call."},{"url":null,"title":"david-pratt-outsiders-are-playing-fast-and-loose-with-the-fate-of-venezuela","story":"A military escalation is the last thing the country needs, but such are the high stakes for both sides in this struggle for power there seems an increasing readiness to go down that route.The ldquoall options are on the table talk that some weeks ago characterised the rhetoric coming out of Washington in support of the Venezuelan opposition and echoed in response by the government of President Nicolas Maduro, now has a distinctly scary ring.Yesterday Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guido only added to that fear as he met US Vice President Mike Pence and asked other countries to consider ldquoall options to remove President Maduro from power.Mr Guidorsquos request in all likelihood will only further intensy a violent situation on the ground that last weekend saw clashes between opposition forces and security forces as well as armed supporters loyal to Mr Maduro that led to several deaths and hundreds being injured.The most dramatic scenes unfolded on Saturday on the bridges connecting the Colombian city of Cucuta to Venezuelan towns across the Tachira River.There, Mr Guaido, now recognised by dozens of countries as Venezuelarsquos legitimate interim president, called for convoys of humanitarian aid to be let into his beleaguered nation.For weeks Mr Guaido trumpeted the day as the moment when Venezuelarsquos long-suffering people would get the aid they so desperately needed. But some say what might have been a masterplan to increase pressure on Mr Maduro has only pushed the country down an even more chaotic course towards civil war.It was a gesture say critics of Mr Guaido that had more to do with provocation than humanitarianism and which left some global organisations like the UN and the International Committee of the Red Crosswarning all sides of the dangers in ldquoweaponising aid. Perhaps the most worrying aspect in all of this however is the apparent willingness of other outside players to play fast and loose with the fate of Venezuela and its people.Just what did US Senator Mark Rubio think would be the outcome of him posting two photographs of former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi on his Twitter account on Sunday Itrsquos well known of course that Mr Rubio is an influential voice in Washington on Venezuela policy and a staunch critic of Mr Maduro. But his tweet showing the Libyan leader bloodied and injured shortly before his death at the hands of rebel militiamen is the crudest and most incendiary of messages to Mr Maduro.That Mr Rubio had previously tweeted another photo of former Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega, who was captured in  after a US military invasion, is likewise unequivocal it its meaning and can, as intended, only be read one way by Mr Maduro. The message is simple, your time is up and forcenecessary, will be used.How Mr Rubio and those in Washington think such gestures strengthen their case for democratic change in Venezuela is baffling. Surely rather that stoke an already dangerously volatile situation, the US government should be doing all it can to ensure that such a process happens through the ballot box The Trump administration is now clearly losing patience with Mr Maduro and no longer cares how he is removed from office so long as he is and their chosen leader Mr Guaido takes over.Just last week President Trump at a speech in Miami urged ldquoVenezuelan patriots to rise up against the regime. Mr Guido at the weekend did the same on Twitter.ldquoTodayrsquos events force me to make a decision to formally propose to the international community that we must have all options open to secure the freedom our country.For many Latin America analysts such talk bodes ill and presents serious warning signs.ldquoThere is no question that a military intervention to resolve the Venezuela crisis is more plausible than ever, Michael Shter, president of the Inter-American Dialogue, a US-based think- tank, told the Washington Post over the last few days as the crisis deepened.ldquoGuaidorsquos insistence that lsquoall options are on the tablersquo echoes President Trumprsquos words, first uttered in August  and widely interpreted as serious consideration of military action, warned Mr Shter.Some observers however insist that the US history of attempted regime change in the Latin American region and Mr Trumprsquos loose language are both working against the opposition that faces a still formidable foe in Mr Madurorsquos regime.Many Venezuelans remain suspicious of Washingtonrsquos motives, evenyet more defections to the opposition from within the ranks of the Venezuelan security forces have taken place over the past few days.More than  members of Venezuelarsquos armed forces defected during the clashes last weekend, with Mr Guaido promising the defectors would be given amnesty and congratulating them on joining ldquothe right side of history.Mr Maduro meanwhile still believes himself to be on the right side of history evenlast weekendrsquos blockade of foreign aid has left him facing a diplomatic siege.As the crisis worsens UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has appealed for ldquoviolence to be avoided at any cost and insisted everyone should lower tensions.Washington however is paying little heed and more than ever seems intent in doing whatever it takes to get its way in Venezuela. ldquoThe eyes of the entire world are upon you today, every day, and every day in the future, Mr Trump told Mr Madruo in a speech last week. ldquoYou cannot hide from the choice that now confronts you, the US president warned.For now all eyes are on the outcome of yesterdayrsquos meeting in the Colombian capital Bogota between Mr Pence and Mr GuidoIf indeed all options are on the table, as both men have made clear, then Venezuela might be about to face the most dangerous moment in this crisis so far. What an even greater catastrophe it would beUS military intervention were the option chosen."},{"url":null,"title":"tv-review-marks-out-of-10-for-bbc-scotlands-the-nine","story":"Still, here we were, the evening after the channel launch the night before, with flagship news programme The Nine about to make its debut with anchors Rebecca Curran and Martin Geissler.But no pressure, people.It was such a big deal London had sent network media editor Amol Rajan to Glasgow to explain to the rest of the UK why pound million of their licence cash was being spent on this new channel. Something about decades of pressure and dissatisfaction with coverage of the independence referendum, apparently.But no pressure, people.No pressure, either, about launching this new bulletin in Scotland, the country that watches more BBC than other parts of the UK but is the least satisfied with what it sees. The new show had a few tests to pass. First, how many people watched  On Sunday, Still Game pulled in an impressive , viewers. Second, did the programme break its own stories  The team has had months to prepare, andthere was ever a time to put some goodies in the shop window it was now. Did it run smoothly, and was it dferent enough, and Scottish enough, to satisfy those who wanted a Scottish Six Is new channel magic or mince Before we arrive at some answers, the important stuff: what were the spring-autumn combo wearing  Geisslerrsquos outfit was Status Quo meets the designer shirt section in John Lewis. Curran had gone for a simple top and trousers coupled with heels so high they made her crossing of the set a thing of wonder and terror. I predict flatties by Thursday. As for the set, a large box in the centre of BBC HQ in Glasgow, it looked like the cell they placed Hannibal Lecter in before he escaped.The first item was Labourrsquos backing of a second EU referendum. With the story breaking around pm, the show had a real opportunity to steal a march on its pm competitors, but despite going to dedicated correspondents in Westminster and Brussels, nothing new emerged.Labours backing for second voteBack in the studio, both Curran and Geissler tackled Labour MSP Neil Findlay over Jeremy Corbynrsquos shting position on Europe. The interview was shouty and unedying, with lots of pen pointing and talking over each other, and that was just the anchors. Findlay wisely left them to it and sailed serenely on.The exclusive report duly arrived and it was into the buying of cheap, potentially deadly pills on social media. Scotland and a drugs story: jeez, what were the chances of that Next was an update on the investigation into the death of Kirsty Maxwell in Benidorm, including an interview with her father. This was followed by a report on medication to prevent HIV infection, then it was over to James Cook, chief news correspondent, in Reykjavik, where he was asking tourists their views on Brexit. So far, so unremarkable.But Cook had also landed an interview with the countryrsquos Prime Minister, Katrin Jakobsdottir, who spoke well on what it was like to be an independent country yet still have a trading relationship with the EU. This was more like it: an item with obvious relevance to Scotland tackled in an intelligent, engaging way.Sports presenter Amy Irons had a joint interview with Alex McLeish and Gregor Townsend about the pressures of managing the national teams, which was going fine till the anchors joined the trio on the sofa and, as with the Findlay interview, the conversation became garbled. BBC over-manning strikes again.The lighter stuff at the end was tired. The disappearing Scottie dogs story had been in the Sunday and Monday papers, ditto the interview with the young Scot who won The Greatest Dancer on Saturday. The last item, about the Oscars, must have been terribly interesting to the one person left on Earth who did not know Olivia Colman had won best actress.Come pm it had been a busy hour but a long one. This was a competent but underwhelming debut. It didnrsquot feel fast moving and agenda setting or whatever the hype had promised. Nor, the Cook report aside, was it very Scottish.

A culture of ugly bullying, of neanderthal bigotry, would have been allowed to fester inside schools doing their best to instil respect and decency in children growing up within a hate-filled sectarian society scarred by The Troubles.That zero tolerance approach to bigotry within the school gates probably helped create a generation which turned its back on religious hatred and ushered in an end to violence and the beginnings of peace in the s. To be uncompromisingly tough with the worst excesses of human behaviour is often the only way to help forge a better world.So itrsquos little wonder that Scottish football, the Old Firm, and their toxic tribes of hardcore bigoted fans disgust me. Sadly, outside of Scotland, football in this country is seen through the prism of Rangers and Celtic. The Old Firm is Scottish football to most of the world. Fans of other teams may not like that fact, but itrsquos the case ndash what the Old Firm does reflects on the entire Scottish game, on every team and fan.When bitter anti-Catholic Rangers fans call Steve Clarke, the Kilmarnock manager, a ldquoFenian b******, when bitter anti-Protestant Celtic fans call Kris Boyd, the Kilmarnock striker, an ldquoOrange b******, everyone outside Scotland sees the game and its supporters through this lens.I cannot believe that supporters who view themselves as decent human beings would wish to be in any way associated with the glamorisation of sectarian hatred, with the glorication of terrorism ndash as revealed in the vile and petty songs and banners of the worst fans in both clubs. How can you support a team, or go to a game, where religious hatred exists in any form  In any other walk of le ndash any other business ndash such behaviour would spell a mass exodus of public support and concomitant financial collapse. But football is given a place of exceptionalism - and so for some, social norms can be disregarded and society debased while money is made.Decent supporters of Rangers and Celtic ndash of whom there are many ndash may not like to be lumped in with the UVF-adulating mob at Ibrox, or the IRA-supporting mob at Celtic Park, but to many people yoursquore judged by the company you keep. If I stand peaceably in a crowd enjoying a game of football but within that same crowd there are fans chanting ldquoFenian b****** or ldquoOrange b******rsquorsquo, I have to accept that this isnrsquot a good look for me. Some might see me as guilty by association. Some might see me as passively accepting what is happening. Some might see me as too cowardly to disassociate myself from such behaviour. Some might think I get a little vicarious thrill from what is going on. At the very best Irsquom guilty of being a bystander ndash of deciding the game, the club, is more important than common decency.But supporters are supporters, and clubs are quite a dferent thing, and some ndash like Rangers and Celtic, it could be saidndash sit atop mountains of gold mined from bigotry and hatred. Perhaps these clubs havenrsquot deliberately enriched themselves by allowing sectarianism to flourish within their grounds, but as long as such behaviour continues they are guilty of passive acceptance, of a failure of responsibility.If I own a company and a byproduct of my work as a business is something seen as a social ill, then I have to take responsibility for it. Social media companies are being pilloried every day ndash rightly ndash for failing to act over fake news or abuse. The CEOs are dragged before politicians, therersquos public talk of boycotts. But with football, itrsquos simply a matter of exceptionalism.Irsquom sick to death of hearing excuses for the so-called beautul game ndash itrsquos a bloody ugly game and it needs dragged to heel as roughly as possible. Humza Yousaf spoke for a silent majority of decent people across Scotland at the weekend when he issued what he called ldquoa very stark warning to football clubs. Mr Yousaf said that the ldquoGovernment is looking at every single option that is on the table, including strict liability and stadium licensing. I cheered as loudly as any football fan when I heard him say that. Mr Yousaf has put the clubs on warning thatthey donrsquot act, the Government will.ldquoStrict liability is just a complicated way of saying the clubs will be fined and suffer other sanctions, and stadium licensing means that a game could be played with no fans in attendance. Mr Yousaf should impose a ticking clock now, giving the clubs a limited window of time to get their act together. If, and when, the clubs fail to take what he described as ldquodefinitive measures to deal with sectarianism then the Government needs to take control and pass legislation ndash and make the legislation draconian, so once a club is hit, the fines and empty stadiums will leave them cowed and obedient.Similarly, the police and prosecution service must ensure that any breach of the law by fans within or outwith football grounds is cracked down on fearsomely. If a fan so much as drops litter in the street, then arrest them. Anything even remotely resembling harassment or intimidation should end in court and a criminal record.Docking of points should be a regular sanction ndash either legislation should cover it, or government should strong-arm footballing authorities to use such powers.

He said some areas of the town, such as Shore Street and Upper Ormlie, had been designated as one-way streets some time ago but this had not been implemented. \"That needs to be corrected,\" he said at Tuesday nights meeting.Mr Potts and other community councillors felt something had to be done to address the issue of speeding and one suggestion was for more sleeping policemen to be installed in problem areas of Thurso.Councillor Rosie, who represents Thurso and Northwest Caithness on Highland Council, said what is needed is a transport review which can take a comprehensive look at the issue. \"We need a strategic look at the whole thing ndash something which covers transport management and pedestrians,\" he said.However, community councillor and former police officer Bert MacLeod urged caution. He said: \"You need to be careful you dont go overboard with this  mph limit. Modern cars can stop quicker than vehicles did in the past. We need to be sensible.\"Mr Potts claimed \"some of the driving in Thurso is abysmal\".Mr MacLeod replied: \"Why should you and I be affected because someone drives like an idiot \"He also pointed out there are problems with installing sleeping policemen on roads. New laws have been introduced as cars have been damaged by them, he said.\"It is not just a case of putting them down,\" stated Mr MacLeod. He argued that enforcement is the key to tackling the problem.\"If you had a traffic warden in each town again that would help,\" he added.Community councillor Colin Johnston said something should be done to address the issue of traffic and parking in the town.Struan Mackie, another Thurso and Northwest Caithness Highland councillor, stressed that it takes time to process traffic orders and pointed out that the mph plan for Wick began over two years ago.He also pointed out that the county is going to get traffic enforcement officers which should help deal with some of the parking issues.Mr MacLeod commented: \"You have got to watch you do not overdo these things.\"But Mr Potts said: \"Parking has been an issue for a long time.

We have been calling for more parking enforcement in Wick for a while now.\"High Street and Bridge Street are far too regularly packed with cars parked where they shouldnt be.

Some people think they are above the rules and for too long theyve got away with it.\"He added: \"Under the current proposals Bridge Street and much of High Street will essentially become double yellows, meaning no parking at any time. This should also help stop the constant issue of people selfishly parking in areas like the Market Square.\"The parking bays there are intended only for those who are disabled badge holders but these rules are often ignored by people who just canrsquot be bothered walking.\"Councillor Sinclair said the order would give council officers the power to enforce parking restrictions once they receive the required training but, initially, existing enforcement staff would carry out the work.\"We should expect a much more regular presence than under the old system,\" he said. \"The discussions Irsquove had with the officer responsible for parking have been extremely encouraging.\"Having an enforcement officer in the town for regular and random visits is a great start butthe situation doesnrsquot improve we will still be pushing to get someone in this post locally to clamp down on rogue drivers.\"He explained that in Inverness several council employees have been trained to undertake parking enforcement duties as well as their day-to-day jobs. \"There is no reason why the same couldnrsquot be done up here. If these orders get the go-ahead, and I am confident they will, then I hope we will begin to see a dference in peoples behaviour.\"The Caithness civic leader, Councillor Willie Mackay, also backed the plan. \"It is a fantastic idea but it is the enforcement that is the key to the success of this,\" he said. \"If we can get enough staff trained up to act as traffic wardens ndash and I am pretty sure we can ndash then their presence will deter bad parking.\"Parking in the centre of Wick has been a contentious problem for some time and has often been raised by the local community council and others.

Whether they are using our website to book their journey, making a connection from other forms of public transport or coming on board one of our vessels, we believe that passengers should experience a service that caters to all their needs.“The new website software will allow visitors to customise what they see and hear and as more and more visitors from around the world choose NorthLink Ferries to travel to the Northern Isles, ‘Recite Me’ is a great tool to help them plan and book their journey.“Our workshops are also a great way in training our staff on how they can best help and understand passengers’ needs.

Those wrecks are still the primary focus of recreational ers, but the remains of the vessels that were mostly recovered and removed from Scapa Flow have also been a recognised ing resource for many years.However, the exact extent and composition of these so-called salvage sites was unknown until this week, when the report of the second phase of work on these sites was published online.The overall aim of the Scapa Flow Salvage Sites Project was to determine what remains of the many vessels of the German High Seas Fleet that were salvaged in the years that followed their scuttling in June .Phase One, undertaken over the winter of  , involved a side scan sonar survey of the main anchorages and other areas thought to have been involved in the salvage process.In the second phase of this project, ers and remotely operated vehicles examined and recorded the remains in detail.The overall result is that the vast majority of salvage sites in Scapa Flow have been located and the remains at each site have been directly investigated and recorded.The full report is now available for public download through the Scapa Flow Historic Wreck website http:www.scapaflowwrecks projects salvage-sites-phase- Further details in The Orcadian on Thursday.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Known today as Rae Strait, it was the missing link in what would become the first navigable Northwest Passage.He also reported back on the ill-fated Franklin expedition, reported evidence of cannibalism — findings which were effectively rejected by the then establishment, and which led to Rae#s achievements being almost completely ignored.The modern-day team, who hope to raise further awareness of these achievements, will be led by Scottish-born and Canada-based expedition leader David Reid, with Scotland also represented by Broxburn-based former Royal Marine Richard Smith.The team will also include two Canadians — adventure film-maker Gerry Tutte and adventurer Frank Wolf.Over  years later and supported with modern-day kit from outdoor specialists Tiso, the explorers are hard at work preparing for the physical and mental challenge of hauling kg sledges for nine hours daily and for up to  consecutive days.Their route will cover undulating, windswept tundra, river valleys and sea ice during what can be the coldest time of year.The Arctic expedition will finish once the four explorers have finally reached Gjoa Haven on King William Island.Mr Smith said: #The Arctic Return expedition will be extremely tough but ultimately our aim is to raise awareness fo the exploits of John Rae and to help restore his rightful place as one of the greatest Scottish explorers in history. It is also our hope that this awareness will inspire the public to support fundraising efforts by the John Rae Society, to restore Rae#s birthplace at the Hall of Clestrain in Oprhir.The team have said any addition funds raised are to be used to produce a documentary film and book about the le and exploits of Rae, the expedition and the history communities, culture and wildle of the Arctic.The public will be able to track the team#s progress at their official website and through social media.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Mr McArthur believes this reflects a change in approach by the government, after months of campaigning by the Orkney MSP and a range of organisations involved in tackling fuel poverty across the Highlands and Islands.During his remarks, Mr McArthur pointed out that when it comes to fuel poverty, rural and island areas are disproportionately affected, with Orkney having the highest proportion of households in fuel poverty and extreme fuel poverty anywhere in Scotland.Commenting after the debate, Mr McArthur said: “Fuel poverty blights communities across Scotland, but there is no doubt that it has a disproportionate impact on rural and island areas. Until recently, however, the Scottish Government appeared unwilling to recognise this fact or indeed the higher costs faced by those living in our rural and island communities.“Over recent months, working with a range of organisations with a wealth of experience and expertise in tackling fuel poverty, I have made the case for the Minister, Kevin Stewart to think again.  It was a case that the Local Government Committee was also persuaded to support.“I am delighted, therefore, that the Minister has had a change of heart and committed to bring forward amendments to his bill at stage two that better reflect the specic nature of fuel poverty in places like Orkney.  I look forward to seeing the detail of those amendments and will work with Mr Stewart, and local stakeholders in Orkney, to make sure we get this right.“Given the impact fuel poverty can have, not just on people’s quality of le but their physical and mental health, this bill has the potential to make a real dference.  For that to happen, it must be both effective and ambitious in eradicating fuel poverty from communities across the country.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

We will be looking to strengthen the Bill as it progresses through the Scottish Parliament and ensuring that the Scottish Governmentrsquos pledges are met.\"Before Wednesdayrsquos debate Mr Stewart said: ldquoWithin this ground-breaking legislation, not only are we one of the few countries in the world to define fuel poverty, we are also setting a goal towards eradicating it.ldquoBy changing the definition of fuel poverty so itrsquos more closely aligned to relative income poverty and taking steps to ensure it works for remote rural and island communities, we are ensuring our support is focussed on those who need it most.\"He added: \"In this day and age, it is unacceptable that any Scottish household should have to choose between having the heating on and cooking their dinner.Councillor Ian Cockburn, who represents the Wester Ross, Strathpeffer and Lochalsh welcomed the Bill as \"something has to be done about fuel poverty\" while arguing it is also time to rethink infrastructure like the national grid.\"It is ambitious but has to be tried to get fuel poverty down in rural areas. We are one of the most energy rich countries in the world so we should be able to get something done. Too many people take it as just being part of the landscape up here so we need to change that thinking as well to get people the assistance that they need.\"Scotland should not be in this state. But you have to look back, the National Grid was set up at the end of the war, the Highlands is considered off-grid despite supplying much of the rest of the country through hydro and wind power. It is time for a rethink.\"Calum Macaulay, chief executive of Invergordon-based Albyn Housing Society, said: ldquoWe welcome this development in the Scottish Governmentrsquos approach to addressing fuel poverty in rural areas. The push to include minimum income standards feels like a signicant step forwards. This is something that the Rural and Islands Housing Association Forum has been promoting for quite some time.\"This has included research undertaken with the support of Highlands and Islands Enterprise and others into minimum income standards in rural communities. The results of this highlighted the pressures of lower average household incomes and higher average fuel costs across the northern parts of Scotland.\"What do you think  Share your views by emailing newsdesk@spp-groupTuesday  Feb  : AMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

If the facility is not taken on by the community then it will close on March as per report to the Highland Council [on] October .ldquoNo survey will be undertaken, the facility will transfer in lsquoas seen, as isrsquo condition, the facilities will transfer in their current operational condition. The position of toilets remaining open whilst negotiations are ongoing is for this financial year only. There is no budget to retain facilities... which is why we want to get the leases sorted out before the end of March.Despite that the director of the Groam House Museum Doug Maclean, who recently attended a meeting of the community council where the future of the toilets was on the agenda remains hopeful.ldquoWe are confident that by some means or other, through a charitable trust taking over the running of the toilets and the good services of the local people, we will be able to keep the toilets open, he said.However, Mr Maclean was in no doubt about how serious an effect the closure would have on Rosemarkie as well as Groam House Museum.ldquoFrom the museumrsquos point of view it is absolutely vital for our existence. We have groups of school children that come here and of course children need to go to the toilet, he said.ldquoWe also have groups of mainly elderly American tourists and they are not in a position to make their way to the beach cafeacute. And we would lose both those groups without the toilets which put the museum in jeopardy.Black Isle ward councillor Gordon Adam said: ldquoI am in discussions with the council over the time limit of March , my view is that the council needs to be flexible.

There are many reasons why this course of action is necessary, the main one being the struggle to secure sufficient finances to run the organisation.About pound, to pound, is needed annually but Ms Cochrane said that the NHS is doing a review of third sector input, and can only confirm funding up to June.Without the support of the NHS, they will find it dficult to win the support of other funding bodies.The news will be a blow to the  service users currently on the books of ACSRS many of whom faced a personal battle before seeking help and then keeping on attending to receive the support on offer.However Ms Cochrane said they will do everything in their power to ensure their clients receive alternative assistance with their dependency. Around  people with alcohol dependency are referred to them each year.She said: ldquoThe board is actively pursuing alternative arrangements for our service users and volunteer counsellors who wish to continue their support or volunteering.ldquoACSRS has been indebted to many people over the years who have given their time and expertise freely as volunteers. Some have assisted in the management of the service as board members providing governance and support for staff and volunteers.ldquoOthers have given thousands of hours of their free time as trained volunteer counsellors. There are six counsellors and not all of them will be wanting to move on though some might seek paid employment.ldquoThe training for these counsellors was previously provided free. It now requires a source of additional funding.ldquoAs for other voluntary organisations, the burden of bureaucracy has increased without the corresponding increase in income, and the task of securing additional funding has become more challenging.ldquoACSRS is the only voluntary organisation within Ross-shire and Sutherland offering a free professional one-to-one counselling service for those affected by their own or a loved onersquos addiction. Our work complements the work done by NHS Drug and Alcohol Recovery staff.ldquoWe would like to thank all those people for their extremely valuable contributions which made it possible for us to serve our community for over  years.Councillor Margaret Paterson, Dingwall and Seaforth, said: ldquoI know this group and this will be a dreadful loss as they give a tremendous service. It is quite distressing to hear this because they have given people with addiction and their families such help for so many years. Their volunteers have given such time and talent to help the vulnerable in society, butthey donrsquot have money then they just canrsquot do it. I hope that something can be done to continue their good work.Two service users who wished to remain anonymous praised ACSRS for the help they received. One said: ldquoI can honestly say that ACSRS played a major part in my recovery.

I think I first saw the murals last year and they are quite stunning. Whoever is doing it is obviously very talented. Itrsquos a fascinating site. We know Invergordon became a naval town and was the base for the Home Fleet in World War I.

I am sure we could find more projects for them in Invergordon including the town house which the community wants to take back into public ownership.A website documenting historical and derelict places in Scotland reveals the depot was built in conjunction with secret oil storage tanks a few miles away.It records the underground tanks were built to hold  million gallons of oil fuel and were built into a solid rock hill to protect it from bombs.On February ,  a Junkers  is reported to have carried out a solo attack on the tank farm, dropping two lb bombs damaging two tanks.

David Lammy, a prominent Remain-supporting Labour MP, said Corbyn was “taking the first step to reunite our party by showing he is listening to our voters and members on this, the biggest issue of our time”.: Brexit: Labour to back second referendum in parliamentIt is often said that the EU referendum was held in an attempt to solve an internecine war within the Conservative party. Now, it seems, Labour’s internal troubles could bring about another one.Clearly, the chances of this actually happening will depend on the attitude of many Conservative MPs – and not just Remain ones. Labour’s decision could simply prompt Brexiteer MPs to drop their opposition to May’s deal, fearing the ‘will of the people’ is now pro-Remain.But,a second vote does come about, the big question will be the question. BrexitRef would undoubtedly be a isive affair and there would be a serious risk of a boycott by Brexiteers, which could cause potentially irreparable harm to democracy in this country.So considerable efforts would need to be made to try to bring Farage, Rees-Mogg and the like on board. And the question would have to be one that allowed all sides of this most tortuous debate to have their final – final – say on the matter.: Brexit: The Scotsman calls for second referendum – leader comment©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"oscars 2019 hollywood reveals its true colours once again dr claire jenkins","story":"Another year, another Oscars Ceremony. Red-carpeted self-congratulations, the popping of flashes and the anticipation of the popping of corks at the many after parties for the rich and famous. And, once again, another Academy Awards in which no women were mentioned in the important category of best director, writes Dr Claire Jenkins.In the  years that the awards have been running, only five women have been nominated for this coveted award – and only one, Kathryn Bigelow, has come away with the statuette: this represents about one per cent of nominees and winners. It’s a shockingly low statistic, even when you take into account that a mere eight per cent of Hollywood’s top  films in  were directed by women. In  America’s Equal Employment Opportunity Commission found Hollywood to be guilty of discrimination against female directors, but as yet there have been no signicant shts in the number of women directing.But while there is clearly much to do, there may be some small tremors discernible on Hollywood’s Geiger counter. Take Mimi Leder‘s newest film On the Basis of Sex, about the career of US Supreme Court justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Leder was effectively ostracised by Hollywood after the commercial failure of Pay it Forward , so herto directing with a biopic of one of America’s most prominent feminist icons suggests that Hollywood is softening in its treatment of women on, and off, screen.Leder’sto the director’s chair comes alongside the impressive success of Ava DuVernay, who has been breaking ground for women of colour in the film industry. DuVernay became the first African-American woman to make over USm at the American domestic box office with A Wrinkle in Timeand was subsequently offered a m deal with Warner Bros. This deal came despite the film’s lukewarm critical reception, and claims that it was helped to box office success by The Incredibles , with which it was paired at ious drive-ins in the US. It should be noted that DuVernay’s deal with Warner Bros was to develop television content. It is in the television and streaming sectors that women seem to have more opportunities. It was as a television director that Leder has been working since her film career faltered, gaining acclaim for her work on The Leftovers, and DuVernay has oscillated between television and film – taking on a number of producing roles for the small screen.: Oscars : Olivia Colman named best actress in shock winThe current Hollywood climate continues to favour male filmmakers, with its penchant for high-octane action blockbusters and superhero movies that are more often than not films for – and about – men. Coverage of the forthcoming Captain Marvel movie may be trying to draw on the film’s feminist credentials – with its female lead and female director – but Anna Boden is only one half of the directorial team . So despite Marvel boss Kevin Feige’s claims that “many” of the upcoming Marvel films will be directed by women, as yet no movie from what is known as the “Marvel Cinematic Universe”has a female director, although Australian director Cate Shortland is expected to helm the Black Widow film.EvenMCU and other action-producers continue to hire women directors, though, this will not necessarily affect the Oscars – Black Panther currently standing as the only MCU movie to be nominated.Big-budget, but low-brow action movies are generally overlooked during awards season – instead it’s those films that we might term “Indiewood”, independent-style films funded or distributed by specialist arms of the major studios, that tend to be celebrated. In , two of the three English language films nominated for best director were distributed by major studios, or their specialist arms. The Favourite was distributed by Fox Searchlight, and BlacKkKlansman was distributed by Focus Features, a subsidiary of Universal.Independent filmmaking has, historically, offered more opportunities for women directors, and therefore the lack of women nominated for the Best Director award seems even more pronounced. Although figures for women working within the independent sector are less well publicised, the Celluloid Ceiling Report suggested that women are better represented in the independent sector, making up  per cent of the directors of narrative features screened at festivals in  and .: Academy refuses to pull James Bulger film from Oscars despite family’s pleaStatistics such as these demonstrate that women directors are working in the American industry, but the big studios are failing to hire them and the Academy is failing to recognise them.Women directors slated for nods this awards season all made films that fall into the independent or Indiewood category: Debra Granik’s Leave No Trace, Lynne Ramsay’s You Were Never Really Here and Marielle Heller’s Can You Ever Forgive Me.Anne Fletcher’s latest film Dumplin’ was independently produced and distributed by Netflix. Fletcher had box office success with mainstream rom-coms including  Dressesand The Proposalbut after the failure of Hot Pursuit it appears that she too has been pushed out of the mainstream.That Dumplin’ was distributed by Netflix, and You Were Never Really Here was distributed by Amazon Studios, demonstrates that there are dferent outlets for women within the changing media culture but there is still a lack of support for women in the mainstream – the big studios. And even those women who have had success in Hollywood are rarely recognised for their achievements.The death of Penny Marshall in December was met with a public outpouring of grief via social media and popular press. She was hailed as a trailblazer as the first woman to make over m at the American domestic box office with Big . But Marshall is not a household name. Big is remembered as the film that made Tom Hanks’ name, not Marshall’s. Marshall is just the first in a long string of women who have changed Hollywood, but they are not recognised for their achievements.The American film industry must do better – in hiring women directors, in rewarding women directors and in highlighting and protecting their legacies.Dr Claire Jenkins is a lecturer in film and television studies at Leicester University.

And we have called for it to do the same with the two-child cap on claims for tax credits and Universal Credit, and the rape clause that comes with it. Let’s call this what it is, a particularly abhorrent piece of Tory social engineering, which forces women to re-live the trauma of being raped as part of a claim for financial support for a child.These measures, as illustrative as they are, barely scratch the surface of the level of cuts to social security imposed by the Tories since  – and, of course, supported by the Liberal Democrats in the coalition government. Billions of pounds slashed from benefits and support programmes for the very people who most need our help: sick, disabled and unemployed people, and those who rely on extra support because they are not paid enough to live on. Cruel cuts underpinned by a cruel sanctions regime, so painfully and accurately portrayed in the film ‘I, Daniel Blake’, based partly on people’s experiences in Scotland.This is the brutal reality of austerity. A political choice to use the power of the state in one of the wealthiest countries in the world, not to make iniduals’ lives better and to improve society as a whole, but to tear people’s lives apart. And this is without even mentioning the tens of billions of pounds cut from our public services.: Tony Blair: Scotland would be independentnot for devolutionAnd it is before we have even begun to consider the Tories’ despicable hostile environment that targets migrants, conceived by Theresa May as Home Secretary and continued under her as Prime Minister. Remember those ad vans sent out by May’s Home Office with the nasty threat “Go home or face arrest”  Policies rooted in the worst instincts of the Tory Party, egged on by sections of the press whose front pages regularly scream about the threat posed by migration but never shout about the positive benefits it brings to our country, our culture and our way of le.But it is not some fanatical Tory clique in England that claims all of this is “necessary”, this is the Conservative Party right across the UK including here in Scotland. Ruth Davidson has proudly talked about how she backed Theresa May as leader, and how she “will back her in the future”. Scottish Secretary David Mundell and stand-in Scottish leader Jackson Carlaw line up foursquare behind the Prime Minister, even as her Brexit shambles goes from farce to horror.This is the Conservative Party that former Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair bizarrely said last week had claimed the “middle ground” of politics. If that is the middle ground, I shudder to think what would be right of centre.Scottish Labour has serious work to do, no one in our party is pretending otherwise and no one has ever claimed it is easy-going. We are rebuilding after years of decline and a series of electoral shocks, not least the  General Election when all but one of our  MPs were voted out, including the then leader Jim Murphy.Far from abandoning the mythical “middle ground” which, in truth, only pundits talk about, we are rebuilding on the basis of popular, common sense policies that focus on the real change that Scotland needs. An end to austerity and the cuts to social security and local services, and public ownership of our trains, buses, energy and Royal Mail, to put people before profit. We need Labour governments in Scotland and across the UK to put this into practice.Of course, it was gravely disappointing that just over a week ago a small group of Labour MPs chose to walk away, to join forces with former Tory MPs in a new Independent Group. In going, they have raised some important issues about Labour, not least the issue of antisemitism which we are determined to root out of our party and wider society. There is no place for antisemitism in the Labour Party.But they have also been clear that their disagreements range wider and are on matters of policy. In a magazine interview, one of the former Labour MPs has already criticised plans to bring the railways into public ownership and raise the top rate of tax. Another has suggested the group could replace the DUP in propping up the Tory Government. The first act of one of their former Tory colleagues was to declare that the coalition government, which ushered in austerity and led to record levels of poverty and homelessness, “did a marvellous job”.: Lesley Riddoch: Citizens’ Assemblies could help build a new ScotlandThese are very dferent ideas to the ones that proved so popular in the  election and which they were elected to Parliament on, so it is right that their constituents get the chance to ask them in by-elections what they now stand for. The group claims to represent a new, forward-looking “centre ground”. Butall it is going to offer is support for austerity, tax breaks for the rich and privatisation of public services, it will look very much like the failed politics of the past.No one yet knows what the political fall-out will be. But it will not deter Labour from our mission to bring the curtain down on this rotten Tory Government and so to see the back of the party of social security cuts, the two-child cap, austerity, homelessness, foodbanks and inequality. And it will not deter us from campaigning to win back people’s trust and so to win power again in the Scottish Parliament.We stand for something completely dferent. We don’t look at the housing crisis and see an opportunity to blame and punish the very people it affects the most. We won’t cut the lelines from our communities and our industries, we will invest in them, and we will build an economy and a society where everyone benefits, not just a wealthy few.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"brexit labour to back public vote in parliament","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Jeremy Corbyn threw a leline to supporters of a second EU referendum, saying Labour would back efforts to bring about a so-called People#s Vote in a bid to placate anger in his party that saw eight MPs walk out.In the most signicant step towards a new vote on Brexit, the Labour leader said he was committed to “putting forward or supporting an amendment in favour of a public vote to prevent a damaging Tory Brexit being forced on the country”.However, a second EU referendum still face a signicant hurdles, with a People’s Vote still unable to command majority support in the Commons.The announcement comes with Downing Street braced for resignations today by Remain-supporting ministers left unmoved by Theresa May’s promise of a vote on her Brexit agreement by  March, just  days before the UK could crash out of the EU without a deal.One senior government insider said Number  was “very worried” about ministers walking out over the failure to accept a delay to Brexit in order to rule out a no-deal.“If there aren’t any resignations by ministers or PPSs [Personal Parliamentary Secretaries] today, we’ll be very surprised,” the source said.At a press conference in Egypt on the margins of an EU-Arab summit, Mrs May said she was sticking to her timetable to deliver Brexit on  March.“It’s within our grasp to leave with a deal on March  and that’s where all of my energies are going to be focused,” she said.“An extension to Article , a delay in this process, doesn’t deliver a decision in Parliament, it doesn’t deliver a deal. All it does is precisely what the word ‘delay’ says.”AskedMPs might be asked to vote on additional assurances over the controversial Irish border backstop on  March, before they have been formally signed off by EU leaders at a summit a week later, the Prime Minister told reporters: “It is possible to do it either way.”European Council president Donald Tusk revealed he discussed legal details of extending the Article  withdrawal process in talks with Mrs May when they met on Sunday in Egypt.Mr Tusk said delaying the UK’s withdrawal is now a “rational solution”, warning that the only alternativeMPs cannot agree a deal is “a chaotic Brexit”.And Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, who had talks with Mrs May in the Red Sea resort of Sharm El-Sheikh on Monday, said the UK needed to “wake up”.Mr Rutte said: “We are sleepwalking into a no-deal scenario. It’s unacceptable and your best friends have to warn you.“Wake up. This is real. Come to a conclusion and close the deal.”In a furious Brexit diplomatic effort on the fringes of a summit focused on Middle East cooperation, Mrs May also met with European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Italy’s Giuseppe Conte.The Prime Minister confirmed that Brexit negotiators willto Brussels on Tuesday for further talks with EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier.: Lib Dems won’t back ing to EUShe will make a statement to the Commons this afternoon ahead of votes on Brexit tomorrow, knowing that senior cabinet ministers and up to  of her MPs could rebel to back amendments ruling out a no-deal scenario.At the weekend, Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd, Business Secretary Greg Clark, and Justice Secretary David Gauke threatened to back an amendment put forward by Labour MP Yvette Cooper and Tory Oliver Letwin, which seeks to block a no-deal through legislationthere no Brexit agreement in place by  March - a day after Mrs May’s deadline for a ‘meaningful vote’.The government source said any ministers who backed the amendment “will be expected to resign”.With the threat of further resignations by and the party losing support in the polls, Mr Corbyn told a meeting of his parliamentarians that Labour would “do everything in our power to prevent No Deal and oppose a damaging Tory Brexit based on Theresa May’s overwhelmingly rejected deal.: David Mundell: SNP want no-deal Brexit“That’s why, in line with our conference policy, we are committed to also putting forward or supporting an amendment in favour of a public vote to prevent a damaging Tory Brexit being forced on the country.”Labour is in talks with backbench MPs Peter Kyle and Phil Wilson over an amendment they are proposing that would approve Mrs May’s deal, but put it to a public vote. The Labour leadership would rather voters be presented with a choice between its own deal and remaining in the EU, as it tries to strike a balance between pro- and anti-Brexit opinion amongst its supporters.The Kyle-Wilson amendment is not expected to be tabled tomorrow, but could be pushed forward on the day of the meaningful vote in March.Last night the shadow Foreign Secretary Emily Thornberry said Labour would seek a “deal or remain” referendum.Politicians and campaigners backing a People’s Vote issued a cautious welcome to the announcement. Edinburgh MP Ian Murray, one of its strongest advocates, said the announcement was “signicant progress”, but said campaigners had to “win the arguments to get a majority in Parliament to win a public vote with the option to remain”.First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: “A referendum with no remain option would be ludicrous”.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"peers summon jeremy corbyn over exodus of mps from labour party","story":"Jeremy Corbyn has been summoned to address Labour peers amid fears members of the group in the House of Lords could join a growing exodus from the party.At a meeting this week following the resignation of seven of the party’s MPs, Labour peers were united in anger at the response to allegations of anti-Semitism by the leadership.Only one peer at Wednesday’s meeting – writer and campaigner Baroness Bryan of Partick, who was appointed to the Lords by Corbyn in June – spoke up in defence of the Labour leader, a source told Scotland on Sunday.At the end of the stormy gathering, peers agreed to ask Corbyn to address them and explain what was being done to respond to the concerns raised by defecting MPs.Explaining her decision to quit, the Liverpool Wavertree MP Luciana Bergersaid the Labour party had become “institutionally anti-Semitic”.Another parliamentarian who quit Labour on Friday, the Dudley North MP Ian Austin, said his Jewish father came to the UK as a child refugee in  while his family remained in Czechoslovakia and were murdered in the Holocaust.“I don’t think I could look at my dad in the eyeI stayed in the Labour Party,” he said.One Labour peer said colleagues fear senior Jewish members of the Labour group in the Lords could quit.The source said senior figures such as former English FA chairman Lord Triesman and the one-time Labour donor Lord Levy were considering their positions.“Only one person defended him [Corbyn]: Baroness Bryan,” the source said.Peers considered sending a deputation to the Labour leader, but a majority insisted he be called to address them. One Jewish peer told colleagues that it was “dficult to go amongst the Jewish community and be a member of the Labour party”.Responding to the wave of resignations, the peers were nearly unanimous in saying they “understand what they’re doing” and “neither condone nor condemn it”, the source said.Labour shadow chancellor John McDonnell admitted that the party needed to be “quicker and fiercer” in responding toincidents of anti-Semitism.In a bid to calm the anger over his handling of the anti-Semitism storm, Corbyn appointed the former minister Lord Falconer to lead a review of the party’s processes.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"snp call for david mundell to act on eu investment after brexit","story":"The SNP has accused the UK Government of preparing the ground for a nine-figure cash-grab from the Scottish Parliament in a growing row over the future of EU investment funds after Brexit.The SNP has accused the UK Government of preparing the ground for a nine-figure cash-grab from the Scottish Parliament in a growing row over the future of EU investment funds after Brexit.UK ministers plan to replace EU development funds worth £ million to Scotland over six years with a ‘Shared Prosperity Fund’.

The conference is shaping up to be an important moment for the party, as it will allow members to publicly air their views on the timing of IndyRef and the Growth Commission report.Nicola Sturgeon has

Until now.All these club names have representation in the Scottish women#s under- squad which flew out to Portugal this week to take on three matches in an international development cup.And proudly flying the flag for the Western Isles women#s team is Rachael Johnstone, a -year-old goalkeeper from Balallan with a steely focus on forging a successful career in the ever-improving world of women#s football.Sport-daft Rachael took her first footballing steps while attending Stornoway Primary, where she says coach Gordon MacRae gave her huge encouragement to play.She started as an outfield player but began playing as goalkeeper for Stornoway Aths juniors in her first year at high school. She continues to train and play at the island#s capital club, as well as with the Western Isles women#s squad.Progress has been swt, and Rachael first featured for the Scotland under-s last year.

It#s hard work, but I love sport and I#m determined to keep improving and go as far as I can in the game.#Being selected for the Scotland under-s makes me really proud # it#s insane really. It#s not really kicked in yet, and probably won#t until I am out on the field.#Rachael was in the starting line-up for the Scotland under-s opening match against the Netherlands on Thursday. Paul Brownlie#s side drew -, before going on to narrowly lose - on penalties. Their next match sees them take on hosts Portugal on Saturday before they conclude the three-match tour with a match against Germany on Monday.Mum Rhona was also making the journey to cheer Rachael on. She said: #I#m very proud. You always encourage them, but you don#t ever expect your children to be asked to represent their country. It#s a huge honour and I just want to support her as much as I can.#Rachael, who is a fourth-year pupil at Sir E Scott School in Tarbert in Harris, said she owed a big debt to local coaches Euan and Jenna MacLeod for their advice and encouragement as well as to her school for allowing her time off to pursue her footballing dream.Another of Rachael#s ambitions is to represent the Western Isles at the World Island Games # an event which has been pivotal in fostering women#s football in the Hebrides.#Ever since I was about seven it#s been my goal to make the Western Isles team and to go to the Island Games # that would be a huge thing for me,# added Rachael, who identied Scotland under- goalkeeper Lee Alexander as a key influence and role model, and star Scotland and Cha midfielder Erin Cuthbert as possibly her favourite player.As far as the future goes, Rachael says her priority is simply to keep learning the game, but she has already developed a keen sense of what it takes to be a top keeper.#Mindset is really important for a goalkeeper,# she added. #You need to keep the head up and keep going. If you let a goal in, you have to learn how to deal with it. Commitment is also really important.#My dream would be to get a pro contract, and be full-time in football.

It is a safe bet that there are only three: Robert Somerville, John Keenan, and Bob Fulton.Back in March , when they were union shop stewards at the town#s Rolls Royce plant, the three men # and thousands of their co-workers # were responsible for virtually grounding the air force of Chilean dictator General Augusto Pinochet, who had seized power just a few months before in a savage CIA-backed coup. The documentary #Nae Pasaran#, screened in Portree last weekend, tells the story of how these principled trade unionists came to be awarded the highest honour the Republic of Chile can bestow upon foreigners.With much of the world appalled by the overthrow, in September , of the democratically-elected socialist Government of Salvador Allende, it fell to Bob Fulton # a burly, no-nonsense Christian with wartime experience of fighting fascist dictators # to set the ball rolling in East Kilbride. Arriving for work on the morning of th March  he uncovered a chilling truth about the eight Rolls Royce jet engines that had just been delivered to the plant for servicing: the engines came from the British Hawker Hunter jets used by Pinochet loyalists to bomb, amongst other targets, the presidential palace in Santiago where Allende died on the day the coup began.Now in his mid-s, Bob immediately #blacked# the engines that is, he declared them subject to an industrial dispute. As such, they could not be touched by any worker # or anyone , for that matter # until the dispute was resolved. His colleagues soon followed suit, much to the consternation of management and the UK Government. And so the engines sat, untouched, out in the open air for the next four years, until they became useless lumps of rusting metal. Moreover, the East Kilbride plant was the only place in the world licensed to service the engines. So, aside from the eight now-engineless jets, the rest of Pinochet#s air force could not be kept airworthy while workers thousands of miles away stuck to the principles of international solidarity. How many lives this saved on the ground is a moot point.#Nae Pasaran# is a paean to what can be achieved by collective action, and to what might be described as the golden age of trade unionism. But the documentary # written and directed by Felipe Bustos Sierra, son of an exiled Chilean journalist # also works as an emotionally-charged voyage of discovery.For over  years, Bob, John and Robert, and other former plant workers doubted whether or not their actions had any lasting effect on the lives of persecuted Chileans, many of whom were trade unionists like themselves. #Nae Pasaran# works in a dramatic sense because we watch as this gap in their knowledge is filled. The Scottish refuseniks did make an impact. Their stand mattered.What makes #Nae Pasaran# so moving is that the surviving union men, interviewed atby Sierra in his adopted homeland, are shown interviews he conducted back in Chile with survivors of Pinochet#s brutality. Now old men themselves, the victims recalled how they took solace in smuggled radios tuned to Radio Moscow, which broadcast regular updates on the Scottish union#s boycott. The action # or rather inaction # of the Rolls Royce workers gave many Chileans hope that they would not be forgotten or abandoned by the outside world. It may even have contributed directly to the saving of seven lives.Among the hundreds of Chilean exiles arriving in the UK were seven rumoured to have escaped execution or imprisonment because the air force acquired spare parts from Israel, South Africa, and India. So desperate were the Chilean authorities for this materiel they may have swapped the seven detainees for what they needed. Sierra never proves this conclusively, however, because the UK Home Office refused to release certain files relating to the boycott.And what of the jet engines, left to rust in East Kilbride  They were whisked away early one morning in . To this day no one knows who took them, but the Rolls Royce workers were told they were back in service with the Chilean air force. A year later Margaret Thatcher came to power and relations with the Pinochet regime were quickly normalised. Arms exports resumed in earnest.But the #blacked# engines were never used again. One of them, which Sierra discovered in a derelict yard outside Santiago, was shipped back to Scotland in , the year before #Nae Pasaran# hit the cinemas. It is due to be installed, as a lasting monument to the boycott, in a college campus in East Kilbride in the very near future.#Nae Pasaran# celebrates people power. After the screening, the topic was the subject of a short talk by Councillor Chris McEleny, leader of the SNP Group on Inverclyde Council, who also answered questions from the audience on British involvement in the destruction of Yemen, the desire by Tory Brexiteers to deregulate and deunionise even further, and the situation in Venezuela. Indeed, Mr McEleny drew an #obvious parallel# with Venezuela, where the democratically-elected socialist Government of another resource-rich South American country is being targeted for regime change.He said: #In Chile, before the coup, US corporations had huge commercial interests in copper mining and they sought to undermine and destabilise the Allende Government, and this is pretty much what we are seeing in Venezuela right now. Poverty in Venezuela has been engineered by the US, just as it was in Chile. We are seeing the same media pattern, a capitalist conditioning programmeyou like, drip-feeding propaganda to make intervention look like the right thing to do. We are seeing that right now with Venezuela so we need to see the same solidarity that Bob Fulton and others showed in the s.#Sadly, as Bob and his comrades lamented, in an era of weakened trade unions such a workplace boycott could probably not take place now.

Jeremy Rossiter is one, he was the first person I spoke to.“I also have work from a couple from Skeabost, Gill Williams, who is a photographer, and her husband Ian Williams – who is more of an abstract painter.“What I like might or might not be what other people like, so I am intrigued to see how things go.”Robert said that he planned to open the gallery through to at least October and would operate on a commission basis, giving the artists the freedom to price the work themselves.He added: “A lot of galleries just focus on professional artists, but I want it to also be a place where amateur artists and photographers can sell their work.”He went on to say: “When people are buying something, especially work that’s expensive, it’s better to see it in the flesh than on a computer. It’s a  for people to sell their work, and I am just acting as an agent, selling it for them and supplying the location.”He added: “We are calling it the Isle of Skye Gallery – keeping it simple. That way everyone knows where it is, and it doesn’t prioritise one type of artwork over another. We have a Facebook page — Isle of Skye Gallery, and we’re on Instagram too — it’s not my forte but it’s a good  to promote it.” that while the gallery was due to open this week, an official launch would take place next month.With th March marking the one-year anniversary of Tommy’s death, perhaps the new crop of artists present will draw inspiration from the indelible impression left by the gallery’s former incumbent as the space is brought back into use."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1433384.jpg--.jpg?1549442071000\n","title":"cambridge house schoolfriends collaborate for charity single","story":"A BALLYMENA writer and his singer schoolfriend have teamed up to release a new single, the proceeds of which will be donated to a mental health charity.Daryl Ball and Marc Little both attended Cambridge House and both became involved in the arts in later le - but are now joining forces thanks to a chance encounter with a book.Daryl, who records as a solo artist as well as being a member of the Ballymena band Stripped, explained: An old schoolfriend Marc Little had a book of poetry published in .Its called Out Of Darkness and it was a very personal collection by Marc dealing with dficult yet common subjects like anxiety and depression.I bought a copy last year and really enjoyed his writing style as well as being very moved by the honesty in his poetry. “They inspired me to write a song on subject.I contacted Marc to ask would he mindI used words from two of his poems to create a new song.He was excited by the idea of working together and I agreed to send a rough demo to make sure he was happy with my treatment of it before proceeding.

As Moy Park celebrates  years in business, Aaron reflects on changes in the sector and milestones along the way. He said: “I first joined Moy Park in  when I was still at school, working part time at the weekends as a factory operative. “As a student, it was a great insight into the world of work and business. It taught me the value of hard work, money earned, and motivated me to want to do more of both! “After gaining a degree in Health and Leisure from Queen’s University Belfast, I was keen to move into a business environment and decided to apply to Moy Park’s Graduate Management Programme, to find out more about a career in one of our fastest growing industries, agri-food. “The two-year programme was the ideal way to find out more about ious strands of a business, from operations to finance, HR and marketing, and what might suit my skillset best. “From my time as a sht worker on the factory floor, I had a healthy respect and interest in the processing side of Moy Park, and the opportunities and challenges therein. “Once I completed the Graduate Management Programme - which we still use as a recruitment tool today - I took up a position as a sht manager, capitalising on my people management skills and interest in operations. “Since then, I have worked my way up across a number of Moy Park’s sites – moving from factory manager to area manager and have now been General Manager at Ballymena for two years. “Ballymena is a great place to work. From a business point of view, it’s strategically located with fantastic transport links and from a social standpoint, you’ll never find yourself wanting for something to do – from shopping to socialising over a drink or a bite to eat. It’s also quickly becoming the spa capital of Northern Ireland! “While Ballymena has faced a number of economic challenges, it’s an area with a rich history and heritage of business success. This spirit is still very much evidenced by the people, businesses and organisations in the town today. “Mid and East Antrim Council has an ambitious integrated economic development strategy for the area to help encourage business growth across the borough, and it’s one we are keen to help support. “It’s a strategy important not just to Moy Park as a business, but to me personally. “I sit on Mid and East Antrim Council’s Manufacturing Task Force Team, a working group committed to supporting and fostering growth. I was delighted to attend Westminster with a delegation from the Task Force recently when Northern Ireland representatives presented their plans for a Belfast City Deal. “Hearing these plans certainly gave us food for thought when it comes to nurturing growth locally. “As Ballymena’s General Manager, I’m responsible for all business s at the site – from technical to HR and finance. “With over , members of staff, it’s a erse and busy job but that’s what makes it worth doing. In the last  years, business management has evolved signicantly. “While there might be more paperwork, regulations, travel and late nights, there is also an incredible amount of collaboration - with customers, industry, educational bodies and government and our local communications. “Managers today cannot afford to work in silos, you need to adopt an attitude of knowledge sharing and foster an environment of innovation to truly succeed. “My key piece of advice to anyone viewing management as a career is to do your research and bolster your skillsyou need to. Being a good manager isn’t a static position, you constantly need to challenge yourself, and a good employer is one who lets you not only challenge yourself but equips you with the skills to overcome these challenges. “One of my own personal highlights over the last  years was been being named ‘Young Processor of the Year’ at the Meat and Poultry Processing Awards in . “Given my background working on the factory floor, it was great to win an industry award. At a business level, I’ve been very proud to see Ballymena evolve to become a Centre of Excellence, focused on driving innovation in food manufacturing. “As General Manager, it’s my ambition to see our facilities continue to grow.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1460456.jpg--.jpg?1550570314000\n","title":"mp hails amber light on scotland bridge plan","story":"North Antrim MP Ian Paisley has welcomed talks about a prospective bridge connecting Northern Ireland and Great Britain.Mr Paisley recently, along with South Antrim DUP MP Paul Girvan met with the Secretary of State for Transport, Chris Grayling to discuss the bridge.After the meeting between the three MPs, the Transport secretary said he would be in contact with the Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer in order to discuss a feasibility project which would investigate the economics of the bridge and whether it would make financial sence to construct the bridge.The proposed bridge could be placed anywhere along the Northern Irish coast line, either at the shortest distance to Scotland at  miles or at the longest of  miles.

Inevitably, as he sedately passes, the lad with the ball loops one over the roof of the passing vehicle – Squinter seems to rememberthe player had hit the kerb with that shot he’d have got two points instead of one.It got Squinter to thinking – again – about the death of street games, for while the sight of two kids playing the iconic Belfast street game was enough to brighten the darkest day, the smile that it put on Squinter’s face faded a little with the realisation that it only highlighted the sad fact that such a sight is very much a rarity these days.It’s not the first time – and probably won’t be the last – that Squinter has lamented the passing of al fresco children’s entertainment: Rally-Oh!, Kick-the-Tin, -- Red Light. But here’s another street game that hasn’t been documented and yet was played in just about every house in Squinter’s street.When new gutties were required for the childer, we all got them at the same time: start of summer, new school term, bingo win – occasions like that. Brothers being intensely competitive beings, we were all keen to establish the superiority of the new footwear that had been bestowed upon us. And so we’d pull on the new gutties, lace them up with loving care and outside we’d go for a race.The winner was never going to be the fastest runner – the winner was going to be the one with the fastest shoes. We’d line up out in the square and, after the usual fussing and fighting over  starts and wrong counts, off we’d bolt, feeling aswe were being powered by some unseen but powerful motor in our pristine new gutties. Then we’d do some jumps, because of course those new gutties could not only make you run like the wind, they could make you leap like an antelope.Squinter’s not sure that kids do that now with their £-plus gel-cushioned, gas-injected fashion statements. In fact, he’s fairly sure that by the time a child grows out of them they’re as unmarked as the day they left the factory, given that they’ve spent more time on a sofa than they have on the street.Squinter’s running days are most likely over, sad to relate , which means that he will never again appreciate the unalloyed joyof pulling on a new pair of trainers. He did buy a sturdy pair of brogues recently which will face up to the rigours of any Belfast winter, but sadly aren’t designed to propel a person along a flat tarmac surface at any appreciable speed not like a good pair of Sizzlers."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"irsp claim psni are intimidating families","story":"AN IRSP member who says he is followed by the PSNI daily has accused police of attempting to “intimidate” party activists.Lower Falls man Michael Kelly was one of a number of IRSP members who were searched by the PSNI as they arrived for a meeting at Costello House earlier thismonth.Speaking to the Andersonstown News, Mr Kelly reiterated his parties claims that PSNI are involved in “political policing”, and accused police of harassing party members and their families.“I have been getting stalked – it’s every day,” he said.“There are days when it’s worse than others, but there are comrades who get it far worse than myself.“We have a member in St James’ and the cops have a patrol outside his house every morning when he is going to work and bringing kids to school.

He’s currently in Maghaberry. Alan Lundy, of Thornberry Close, appeared before Belfast Magistrates Court on Monday charged with intent to steal and having a firearm. He is accused of being one of two masked men who forced their way into a house on the Ligoniel Road on Friday night where a suspected gun was brandished.However, defence solicitor Darragh Mackin said Alan has provided a detailed account of his whereabouts on the night in question, ranging from being in a KFC fast food outlet  miles away from the scene of the crime,then travelling home and accessing WhatsApp and Facebook. Mr Mackin told the court that cell-site analysis and wi account details can be provided to show Lundy was messaging on social media rather than taking part in any burglary and said it was a “fundamental case of mistaken identity”. District Judge Fiona Bagnall refused Mr Lundy bail, citing potential witness interference and he was remanded in custody to appear by video-link on March .Alan’s partner’s house was raided late on Friday where he was arrested in front of his young children.Alan’s brother Daniel told the North Belfast News that he is innocent and his arrest and remand is the latest in a long list of intimidation against his sibling.“Alan is innocent, it is just internment,” he said.“There is sufficient evidence to prove where he was at the time of this so-called incident.“He is constantly stopped and searched and harassed. His family know where he was and everyone knows where he was.“Alan’s partner’s house was searched and has been on numerous occasions with the doors put through and his kids literally dragged from their bed at all hours of the morning. This is nothing but MI-directed.”North Belfast Saoradh representative Dee Fennell says Alan is “a victim of the state”.“Evidence has already been presented to the Magistrates Court when it was alleged he was involved in an incident in Ligoniel that he was  miles away in a fast food outlet and there is CCTV to prove that,” he said. “There is also proof via his phone that he was not there. There were also conflicting witness reports – one said it was Alan wearing a beige coat and the other said it was Marty wearing a black coat.“In any other situation, Alan would be at home with his family and children but instead he was remanded and sent to Maghaberry. This is the second time Alan has been a victim of malicious prosecution and internment.“In , Alan was a steward at a GARC protest and was accused by a PSNI officer of throwing a stone. He was sent to Maghaberry and served three months and it was only then that the PSNI officer retracted the evidence. His family is constantly harassed on a regular basis and, in my view, Alan is a victim of the state.“In the last ten years, Alan has been arrested between  and  times, had his house raided on more occasions than that, stopped and searched hundreds of time.“I am a youth worker. There are four definitions of abuse: physical, psychological, sexual and neglect. No-one can tell me that Alan Lundy’s children being dragged out of their beds in the middle of the night is not psychological abuse of children.“Alan Lundy personies what is happening to republicans across the six counties.

Those affected by non-state actors were asked to accept the early release of prisoners.For victims of the state this was not relevant because those responsible benefited from impunity.While the RUC was disbanded their positive reputation in their own community and wider society was secured with a St George’s Cross presented by the queen of England. The costs of changing the RUC to the PSNI ran into tens of millions with severance packages available to those who served in the RUC who did not want to change to PSNI. Those former officers also received pensions. Some of them also came into the PSNI as “civilian staff”.The thing about all of that was that it was never made clear why the change was necessary. It was alluded to as an issue of “community confidence”, because the RUC had been  per cent Protestant. But, of course, that did not explain the need for a human rights-based approach to the PSNI, for multiple s of accountability, including a Policing Board, a Police Ombudsman’s office and formal community engagement structures.Because we had not had an honest accounting for our conflict and impunity reigns supreme, the crimes of the RUC, which include extensive collusion with loyalism, have gone unmentioned and without proper investigation, with the can of dealing with the past being kicked so repeatedly down the road that it has become a sick joke.When George Hamilton became Chief Constable he made promising and assuring statements about the need for a comprehensive process to deal with the past. However, last year when proposals to do exactly that were published the organisation representing his own rank and file rejected them, because of reputational issues for the RUC.Last week’s focus on files not disclosed to the Ombudsman have led to a wider discussion about policing structures. However, despite international and domestic law being on their side, the very people who have been harmed yet again by these systemic and deliberate failures are those whose concerns, for the best will in the world, were sidelined in favour of wider political “progress”.The question is, will those same families, or any other families, ever see their rights being vindicated in a truly independent process  Is it conceivable that they would once again be asked to compromise in favour of wider processes  The anger we all feel this week should be remembered for those days when those questions are asked."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37851867.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/tusk_may_.jpg","title":"brexit formal talks between may and tusk on delaying uk exit","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeSpring EditionHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Thornton told jurors they would hear evidence of how the two bomb blasts ripped apart two pubs on what was a “perfectly ordinary evening”, in Birmingham.He told them there would be evidence alleging British security forces may have had some forewarning about the attacks, widely thought to have been carried out by the provisional IRA, including an “over-heard” conversation which took place in prison two weeks before the bombings.Sir Peter, continuing his opening statement, added that the inquests would not deal with the issue of who planted the bombs, adding that was a “task of police, prosecutors and the criminal courts”.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  The Mulberry Bush pub He added that although a single hearing, lasting up to six weeks, the inquests would deal with “ separate people,  separate lives lost from two terrible events”.As well as those killed,  were injured in the blasts, which were carried out at the height of an IRA bombing campaign in the West Midlands, the jury was told.A third bomb, jurors heard, was planted near the Barclays Bank on the Hagley Road but failed to properly detonate that night.The coroner said that there had been “over ” incidents involving bombs and incendiaries “in and around Birmingham” in  and , but that after the pub blasts “the campaign in the West Midlands stopped”.He told the six women and five men of the jury it would be a matter for them whether the IRA called off its Midlands campaign because of the “outrage of civilian deaths on this scale” or “some other reason”.Sir Peter said: “This is something that the city of Birmingham has suffered now for many years.“While the inquests will inevitably focus on those who died we must also remember many other lives were and continue to be affected.”\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  The Tavern In The Town pub, which was in a basement, was devastated by the blast Jurors, sitting at Birmingham Civil Justice Centre, were told they would hear evidence from only a few eyewitnesses of those there on the evening, because some were “no longer alive”.He added: “They will be doing their best to recollect events accurately, but we all know memory will sometimes have gaps.“Recollection may sometimes be distorted or inaccurate, it may be correct.”Sir Peter said “nobody has been successfully prosecuted for the attack”, and that the only men ever to stand trial, the Birmingham Six, were freed on appeal in .He also said: “Nobody is on trial here, an inquest does not decide matters of criminal or civil liability, and this is not a question of attributing blame to any iniduals.”He told jurors who “may well be wondering why now”, that the original inquests were put aside in , with the start of the six men’s criminal trial.The former chief coroner for England and Wales added that there would be details of the so-called “forewarning issue”, and evidence the British authorities may have received information signalling there were to be bomb attacks.Among them, evidence of an alleged tip-off concerning a “possible conversation in a local prison nearly two weeks before the bombings”.Jurors would also hear an account of “evidence of a students’ visit to a police station the evening of the bombings, which was cancelled”.Detailing the chain of events that night, Sir Peter said that at .pm, the Birmingham Post and Mail newspaper received a coded bomb warning from a man “with an Irish accent” accompanied with the code word “double X”.The caller, ringing from a telephone box, spoke of a bomb in the city’s landmark Rotunda, and the tax office in New Street.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  The aftermath of the blast at the Mulberry Bush, which was on the ground floor of the Rotunda Sir Peter said that the newspaper’s telephonist’s record of the message made no mention of pubs.The two bombs detonated in “massive explosions” between .pm and .pm, killing  on the night – eight in the Mulberry Bush, at the foot of the rotunda, and two outside the nightspot.Another nine died in the Tavern In The Town, which was a large pub in the basement of the same building as the tax office, King Edward’s House.Two died later of their injuries, with  of the victims under .Sir Peter said: “It was a normal Thursday evening in Birmingham, on November , .“It was not a weekend, but the pubs, two in particular, were busy enough and both quite popular with young people.”He added the premises were only some  yards away from one another.“At pm that evening, it was a perfectly ordinary evening in the two pubs, a film was showing at the Odeon cinema but just after .pm, all of that changed,” Sir Peter said.“Moments later there was an explosion at the Mulberry Bush, and just minutes later a second explosion at the Tavern In The Town.“They were massive explosions.”He told jurors: “After hearing the evidence you may conclude the bombs were brought and planted in such a way that extensive loss of le, injury and devastation, would have been caused.“They were planted in enclosed spaces in busy pubs, where there were many people.“You may be asked to determine whether those who died were unlawfully killed.”Hearings will continue on Tuesday and Wednesday with pen portraits of each of the victims, while on Thursday, the jurors will be taken to the former sites of the pubs – both since long gone.The inquests, which are being held in Birmingham, are the culmination of years of campaigning by relatives of the dead for a full account into the circumstances of what happened on the night of November , .\" width\"\" \"\"

But all we are seeing are cuts to health visiting, children’s centre closures and increasing child poverty.“The Government must now show inspiring leadership to help children get the best possible start in le.“If our country is serious about prevention and reducing health inequalities then we must make massive investments and drive coordinated action right at the start of le.”Improving the health and wellbeing of the youngest children should be a major priority for every societyFiona SmithFacebookTwitterFiona Smith, the Royal College of Nursing’s professional lead for children and young people’s nursing, said improving the health and wellbeing of the youngest children “should be a major priority for every society”.She added: “Health visitors work on the frontline in local communities and make vital interventions from birth, helping to prevent illness and promote health and wellbeing – however, Government ambitions to increase the size of this workforce in England were not underpinned by a comprehensive workforce plan and as a result numbers are now flat-lining.“The committee’s call for an ‘Early Years Revolution’ is one that the Government and NHS England must demonstrate they share through investment, not just in health visitors, but in all parts of the nursing workforce that support children and young people.“Anything less will see this revolution remain words on a page with families missing out on the very interventions that can be the dference between leading a healthy le, and not.”Leader of the House of Commons, Andrea Leadsom, is chairing an inter-ministerial group on early years family support, and said the report showed there was “growing recognition” of the importance of improving support.“As we continue our work and look to make signicant policy recommendations for the earliest years, we will consider the select committee’s views very carefully,” she said.A Department of Health and Social Care spokesman said: “Children’s health is a key priority for this Government and we want every child to have the best start in le.“The NHS Long Term Plan has committed to make the NHS one of the best places in the world to give birth and expand provision of quality mental health support for new and expectant mothers and their families.“The Health Secretary has also set out his prevention vision, supporting good health and support for families to stop problems developing in the first place.”"},{"url":null,"title":"labour and a second brexit referendum what does it all mean","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeSpring EditionHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

But letters from the company’s lawyers included in Monday’s filing argue that Mr Musk remains in compliance with the settlement.The SEC had sued Mr Musk last September for using his Twitter account in August to announce he had secured financing for a potential buyout of Tesla — news that caused the company’s stock to swing wildly.He later backed off that buyout idea, but regulators concluded he never had lined up the money to pull off the deal that probably would have required at least  billion dollars to pull off.Mr Musk initially contended that he had not done anything wrong before reluctantly agreeing to have future tweets that could affect Tesla’s stock be pre-approved.Now the SEC is alleging that Musk broke the terms of that agreement with a February  tweet projecting that Tesla would make about , cars this year.   About four-and-a-half hours after that tweet, Mr Musk corrected his statement, saying he meant that Tesla had started to manufacture cars at a weekly clip that would translate into , cars during yearlong period, but not necessarily for calendar .Mr Musk acknowledged he did not get company approval for the initial February  tweet, according to the SEC, even though car manufacturing statistics can affect stock prices of carmakers.In his defence, Mr Musk said he did not think his tweet needed clearance because he was basing it on information that had been disclosed in late January.Both February  tweets occurred while the US stock market was closed. Tesla’s stock rose by less than % the next day.But the SEC illustrated Mr Musk’s allegedly contemptuous behaviour with some of the comments he made during a television interview with  Minutes that aired on December .In that interview, Mr Musk revealed that no one at Tesla was screening the tweets he posts to his account, which now has  million followers.When pressed how Tesla officials could know whether his tweets might be violating the SEC settlementthey were not readying them before they were posted, Mr Musk replied: “Well, I guess we might make some mistakes. Who knows ”The SEC also pointed out that during the same interview, Mr Musk declared: “I want to be clear. I do not respect the SEC. I do not respect them.”Tesla’s legal team realised Mr Musk may have crossed a line with his February  tweet about car manufacturing, according to the SEC.After that tweet was posted, a Tesla lawyer “immediately arranged to meet with Musk and draft the corrective statement that Musk tweeted out over four hours later”, it added."},{"url":null,"title":"dobbins seeks public input future boom hall","story":"SDLP Councillor Angela Dobbins has urged the public to attend information sessions this week regarding the Boom Hall estate.Cllr Dobbins commented:“Derry City  Strabane District Council will be hosting two public information sessions to provide updates on the ongoing preparation of a conservation management plan for the council-owned Boom Hall house and estate.“Work has been progressing on the production of the conservation management plan, in particular the inspections of the house and masonry structures.

The centrepiece of the celebrations was a specially baked cake.Mrs Hilman has seen huge changes over the past four decades, including progressing from a manual typewriter and maintaing a hand written register to a state-of-the art computer system with touch-type keyboards and scanners.However, one thing that remains the same is the children, who are as much an inspiration today as they were when she first walked into the school.Mrs Hilman began working as secretary in  when Mr James McIlhinney was the principal. At the time there were just  pupils, but today that number has risen substantially to .Mrs Hilman, who has a grown-up son and daughter who both attended the school in the s, said: ldquoSince the early days I have worked for three principals mdash Mr McIlhinney, Mr George Smyth and our current principal, Mr Stephen Moore. At the start I only worked three hours each day but that has more than doubled in recent years.ldquoMy husband, Raymond, who was chairman of the PTA, and I presented the school with a silver cup in the late s which became known as the Hilman Cup. We present it to the child that has earned the highest overall achievement each year. We are almost running out of space now to engrave names, she laughed.Mrs Hilman, who has become a very familiar face over the years, recalled some of the highlights during her time at Academy Primary.She said: ldquoIn  I had the opportunity to accompany two other long-serving staff members to attend a royal garden party at Hilsborough Castle. I got to speak and shake hands with Prince Charles and it was certainly a very memorable occasion for me.ldquoOf course I will never forget the surprise dinner that the staff had for me at Rockmount Golf Club a few weeks ago. There were  people who attended that evening and they made a big cake for me with lots of candles on it. They wrote and performed a song for me and I was very taken aback by it all.It is obvious that Mrs Hilman has formed quite a strong bond with everyone at the school mdash children and staff alike.She said: ldquoI will miss the children very much indeed. Each child is an inspiration to me, especially the two special needs children. They wave at me as they go home and I find them so sweet and friendly. They are treated the same as all the other children. They inspire me each day to just get up and get on with it.She continued: ldquoI have received terric support from Mr Moore since he first arrived at the school  years ago. My time here has been a very happy one and for that Irsquom very thankful. I have formed some great friendships.Mrs Hilman has plenty to occupy her in her retirement. She confesses she is more of a lsquotidy-upperrsquo around the garden but canrsquot wait to become more involved with planting and creative borders. She also loves to walk and travel.Mrs Hilman has two young grandchildren, Jamesand Aimee , and she says she will be able to spend more time with them, as well as becoming more involved with the Saintfield Womenrsquos Institute. It sounds like she will be busier in retirement than ever.Mr Moore described Mrs Hilman as an institution. ldquoWe would certainly wish Mrs Hilman a very happy retirement with many years of good health to enjoy it, he said.ldquoShe has given us many years of service which can only be described as remarkable. We will miss her very much indeed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Roadworks set to begin on pipeline in Saintfield  ","story":"WORK to bring natural gas to the heart of Saintfield is to start earlier than planned.Phoenix Natural Gas mdash which is investing poundm to extend its expansive network to towns across East Down mdash was due to start work in the townrsquos Main Street area in September.However, contractors will be in the town early next month at the request of roads officials with the work focusing on an area starting at the Fair Green, running through to Station Road via Main Street and Todds Hill. The work is expected to take seven weeks to complete.Contractors are due to begin work in the centre of Saintfield on March  and Rowallane councillor Billy Walker is urging people to be patient during the scheme.Today, between pm and pm, Phoenix officials will be hosting a public information event at the Rowallane Community Hub in Main Street to outline the programme of work and discuss it with residents and the business community.Phoenix says it is making signicant progress on its East Down investment proposal and revealed that Transport NI is managing a number of other construction programmes in surrounding areas which include road closures.Cllr Walker said as a result, Phoenix has been asked to bring forward its work in the town centre to fit in with other planned projects in the area.He also confirmed that the new pipeline programme has been discussed with several community representatives including Saintfield Development Association officials and a representative from Saintfield Traderrsquos Group who had expressed concern aboutthe works taking place in September.While Phoenix admits that the construction programme will ldquoinevitably not be convenient for a number of residents and business owners, it says bringing the work forward by six months will result in the most disruptive set of works being completed by late April or early May, rather than later in the year.Company officials have also visited businesses to outline the nature of the work, with Phoenix undertaking to do all it can during the construction process to accommodate business needs.Officials plan to work closely with the townrsquos Development Association and provide funding for a lsquoshop localrsquo campaign to encourage trade within Saintfield as work on the scheme continues.Residents in the area affected by the pipe laying work have also been informed about the change in the construction timetable.Cllr Walker, who is a keen supporter of bringing natural gas to East Down to provide consumers with an additional element of choice when it comes to their energy supplier, hopes contractors will not encounter any signicant hurdles as they progress along Main Street.ldquoIt is important people remain patient during the latest aspect of the work in Main Street, he said. ldquoAs this is the main route through the heart of the town, disruption will be inevitable.ldquoThe fact that the work programme has been brought forward is positive given that it will be carried out when the days are longer. Hopefully this will mean that the work could potentially be completed sooner than planned.Cllr Walker says Phoenix will hope to use underground drilling where possible and is appealing to people to continue to support local businesses.He added: ldquoThe Saintfield business community is the backbone of the townrsquos economy and provides essential employment. It is important everyone continues to support traders during this scheme..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/9428337.jpg","title":"seans surreal abbey road experience","story":"With his great grandfatherrsquos fiddle in hand, local musician Sean Magee recently recorded a single at the iconic Abbey Road Studios, a place made famous by The Beatles.Calling the experience of recording in the same studio as The Beatles ldquosurreal, Sean explained how the opportunity arose.ldquoIrsquove just recently joined up with a guy called Rory Gallagher, hersquos from Kilcar, Donegal, and his project is called Rory and the Island for he owned the Island Bar over in Lanzarote for five or six years before he came home. He asked me would I come along and join him so we have been out on tour and we were over playing in Camden, in London last week, said Sean.He continued: ldquoHe signed with a record label called Buddy Records and they got it all sorted for us to go in and record with Abbey Road, so we were recording our new single lsquoCall My Name.rsquoWith the new single due to release on Spoty at the end of next week, Sean said: ldquoWersquove got it all nearly ready to go so therersquos just a few mixes that need to be done.Talking about the recording day, Sean said: ldquoWe were in early morning and we were just straight into it, I never really got thinking about it and about midday we took a walk around the building and seen all the big studios.ldquoWe recorded in the Gate House studio and we went into Studio Two and Studio Three to do wee bits of sample and background vocals. That was where The Beatles, Ed Sheerin and Adele all wouldrsquove recorded in as well. So it was just madness, he added.During the recording of the single Sean played his great grandfatherrsquos fiddle, an instrument which has a tale of its own to tell. Sean explained: ldquoMy great grandfather had ordered this fiddle in  before the First World War broke out and hersquod sent the money with the order. Basically then the war broke out and the fiddle didnrsquot turn up so he thought all was lost. As soon as the war was finished in , the fiddle arrived at the door. He couldnrsquot believe it. So I took it with me to Abbey Road and the song we were recording was a slow song, and therersquos a lovely deep tone out of the fiddle so I took it with me.ldquoIt was my grandadrsquos father and my grandad was delighted that I took it with me, he added.When asked how he first met Rory, Sean explained that it was through his dad, Conor Magee. He said: ldquoRory was in a band way back years ago called The Revs and they wouldrsquove been doing sets at the likes of Slane Castle. My dad is a sound engineer, and he done the sound for The Revs about  years ago. We were going over to Lanzarote and I didnrsquot know Rory at all and dad had messaged him to seehe would get me up for a song in the Island Bar.Sean continued: ldquoHe got me up and shortly after that he sent me a message to seeI wanted to do a couple of gigs over in Lanzarote. He asked me thenI wanted to go out on tour with him when he was home. So it came out of nowhere really.Sean has since been touring with Rory and the Island for the last six months, travelling all over Ireland and the UK. Talking about their upcoming gigs, Sean said: ldquoWersquove Germany for St. Patrickrsquos weekend and America then in April, over to New York.He added: ldquoWe also have a local gig in Charliersquos Bar on March .

Everybody understands how, when you were young, feeling like everything your mum and dad said was unfair.“There are things that everyone, no matteryou are Irish or not, can identy with.”She said the theme was always to make people laugh and have a good time.Tragic nine-year-old girl killed in one-car collision is named Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"She said: “Those sort of darker times have to co-exist with the lighter times as well, we try to always be truthful about that.”Derry Girls centres on -year-old Erin Quinn, played by Saoirse-Monica Jackson.She said: “It is definitely bigger and braver, we had an absolute ball filming it.“It was a dferent experience this time round, we know each other so well and we know our characters so well, so it was a lot more enjoyable in that sense.“It is always a great job to do when it is comedy because you are just laughing all the time.”The premiere of the show was held in Londonderry earlier this month.Jackson said: “Truth always translates well and it is very authentic, it is very true.“Anybody from a small community or a big family can connect to the show, it does not matter what background you are from.“Each one of the characters that shehas created is so well-rounded and so sculpted in such an honest but brilliant way.”try catch            ..

I canrsquot see that there is any way the council can fix this, there just isnrsquot the infrastructure.ldquoItrsquos obvious that it is not going to work, it would be a waste of money to even try it.But another Plassey Street resident, Bat Goddard, said: ldquoTo spend pound, on an experiment, which in  months they could reject, is ludicrous.ldquoWe have the widest street in Penarth here but they want to turn it in to a one-way system.ldquoWe need to stop this folly now.Vale council member Geoff Cox, who is the cabinet member for Neighbourhood Services and Transport, has since said a report will be put forward that retains the roundabout and instead looks at enhancing other ideas to solve crossing issues and traffic problems.Cllr Coxsaid: ldquoAs the Cabinet meeting date approached, I became more aware of the strength of local feeling associated with the highway option being proposed, hence my decision to defer the report meaning it was not even considered by Cabinet on January .ldquoI have since reviewed the ious options further, which has included my meeting with local ward members to obtain their detailed views on all options. I now intend to present an amended report to cabinet on February .ldquoThe report will propose that option one in the previous report now be taken forward, which retains the current roundabout though enhances the gateway route into Penarth whilst providing much safer crossing opportunities for cyclists and pedestrians. There is no requirement to complete any spending on this project by the end of this financial year.ldquoIt is very dficult to please everyone with highway improvement schemes but I very much hope that this option provides the active travel benefits we are seeking and is viewed by residents and visitors to Penarth as being the most appropriate. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was made with willow grown in the grounds of Cogan Primary School.More than  people attended the hill rolling ceremony down Clf Hill towards Penarth Esplanade - with the school pupils from Cogan and pupils and families from Ysgol Pen Y Garth helping to roll it along.The head was accompanied by a wooden frame from the Mabinogion stories called the Window of Sorrows made by Tony Simms, and the artist Ifor Davies undertook the ritual sawing of the Window of Sorrows on the clftops and read the Bendigeidfran story from the Mabinogion tales before the rolling went ahead.The head of Bendigeidfran and the Window of Sorrows was accompanied by Penarths Mari Lwyd which is a symbol of hosting, and negotiating hospitality through song and teasing. Richard Parry led the Mari Lwyd this year, and on arriving at the bottom of the hill the celebration visited local shops and resaurants along the sea front wishing the proprietors and customers a Happy New Year. We sang for Romeo Italian restaurant, The Fig Tree, James Sommerin, The Crazy Cafe and Hamptons seaside shop. After reaching the bottom of the hill the head was carried by the children along with the Mari Lwyd to the shops and cafes along the seafront where dferent New Year songs - called Calenig - were sung in each venue and led by local opera singer Richard Parry.Speaking about the event, artist Haf Weighton said: \"I loved working with Cogan School. Itrsquos a hidden gem in Penarth with very enthusiastic staff who were happy to jump in to get involved in this project at short notice. Richard Parry and the schools deputy head Tom Lewis, ran a assembly to the whole school on the new year traditions. Then children from across the school came to see me working on the piece. \"It was lovely to hear children who donrsquot come from homes where Welsh is spoken enthusing about the mabinogi tales and Welsh traditions. Children from Pen y Garth joined in after the head was created. They helped us roll it down the hill from the clf tops.\"Richard Parry, who helped to organise the event and led the Mari Lwyd, said: \"It was great to see so many people come together to celebrate Hen Galan in Penarth. The giant Bendegeidfran got his name because he was the Blessed Bran - the best friend anyone could ever want - and in the stories of the Mabinogion he was loved by those who knew him. He is a symbol of friendship and celebrating together. \"The community celebration on the clftops was thoroughly enjoyed by children and adults alike, and even though its a bit chilly it was wonderful to see so many people out of doors, celebrating, singing and enjoying wishing everyone we met Blwyddyn Newydd Dda and Happy New Year.\"The head will now go on display at a iety of places, including Pen y Garth School, Cogan Primary School, Penarth Library and The Hearth Gallery Llandough Hospital. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

A consultation is being held on the councilrsquo website, while a drop-in session was held atSt Augustinersquos Parish Hall on January . article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Dealing with this type of call prevents our staff from dealing with genuine emergencies.ldquoCalling an ambulance when you donrsquot need one wastes time and resources which could have been better spent responding someone genuinely in need of the high level clinical care ambulance crews provide. Ambulances are not a taxi service and arriving at hospital by ambulance does not mean yoursquoll be seen quicker.\"She added: ldquoIf someone is seriously ill or injured and their le is at risk, you should call  immediately.

The development connects to the entrance to Murch Road.After complaints from residents of vehicles tracking mud from the site across the nearby Murch Road, Barratt have promised to introduce improved wheel washing facilities.Plaid Cymru Community Councillor Chris Franks said residents had spoken to him to express their frustrations.He said: ldquoThe mud has splattered cars and made the whole area dirty.

That being the case, this council, like many others in Wales, is unable to continue to provide the level of subsidy to outdoor sports provision that it has in the past.ldquoExploring dferent ways of working, including the transfer of responsibilities in appropriate circumstances to community groups is a key element of the councilrsquos strategy moving forward as it addresses dficult budget priorities.ldquoFollowing the successful transfer of responsibilities for five libraries to community-based organisations and looking at a number of successful sports clubs across the Vale of Glamorgan who operate without any subsidy from the Council, it is hoped that the majority of clubs currently using council facilities will be able to continue to provide opportunities for all to participate in sports activities. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

vitamin d","story":"While there is a huge range of vitamins on the market for parents to choose from, the vast majority contain far less than the correct dose, experts said.Vitamin D is essential to prevent rickets, a condition that affects bone development in children and which can lead tothe growth of soft, weak and deformed limbs.It is dficult to get enough vitamin D from diet, and the main source is sunshine.However, the weather in the UK means that there is limited exposure to sunlight from November to March.Public Health Englandrecommends that children aged one to four receive a daily  microgramvitamin D supplement.Those aged under one should be given a . to  microgram daily vitamin D supplement to ensure they get enough.In the new study, experts from the universities of Oxford and Southampton examined vitamins aimed at children sold by Asda, Morrisons, Ocado, Sainsburyrsquos, Tesco, Boots, Holland and Barrett,Lloyds Pharmacy and Superdrug.In total,  multivitamin products made by  dferent manufacturers were included in the study.The daily vitamin D dose in the vitamins ranged from zero to IU.Only one multivitamin was suitable for use from birth and this supplied IU per day ndash around half the recommended amount.For children under six months of age, only one multivitamin contained more than  IU day vitaminD, but this was only recommended from four months of age.For children over six months, just % to % of the available multivitamins provided the recommended IU per day of vitamin D, the experts said.The researchers also looked at specic vitamin D products and vitamins marketed as being for healthy bones.Of the  products that were available, the range of vitamin D in them was from  to ,IU.Six products were suitable from birth, of which five contained  to IU per day ndash around the recommended amount.Writing in the Archives of Disease in Childhood journal, the authors concluded: ldquoThere is a wide range of both multivitamins and vitamin D supplementsavailable for children in the UK, yet most of these do notprovide the recommended  IU day.ldquoMultivitamins typically had lower vitamin D content than pure vitamin D supplementsor lsquohealthy bonesrsquo products, although some products labelled as lsquofor bonesrsquo contained very low levels of vitamin D.The natural way to obtain vitamin D is from sunlight, but there is inadequate exposure in the UKThe team also looked at the Governmentrsquos Healthy Start scheme, which provides free multivitamins to low-income families, but these provide onlyIU per day of vitamin D.The research comes after data analysed by the Press Association showed there were , hospital admissions with a main or secondary diagnosis of vitamin D deficiency in   ndash % more than the , in  .There were an additional  admissions in   where the main or secondary reason was rickets, up from the year before.Almost all these cases were young children, with  admissions for rickets in children aged nine and under, up from  the year before.A further  admissions for rickets were among those aged  to , up from  the year before.Dr Benjamin Jacobs, from the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health , said:ldquoA normal healthy UK diet provides less than % of the recommended amount of vitamin D.ldquoThe natural way to obtain vitamin D is from sunlight, but there is inadequate exposure to sunlight in the UK so supplements are the only way to ensure UK children get the recommended dose.ldquoTo learn that so many products fail to provide children with the recommended level of Vitamin D is highly concerning, especially when latest evidence shows our childrenrsquos average intake are still below the recommended amount.ldquoThese products are misleading parents who think they are protecting their children from serious conditions such as rickets, poor growth and muscle weakness.ldquoI would advise all parents to check that the supplements they use contain the recommended  units of vitamin D and consult their pharmacistthey are unsure.He also said the Government should seriously consider fortying somefoods and milk with Vitamin D.Dr Carrie Ruxton, from the industry-funded health and food supplements information service , said: ldquoFood supplements are meant to supplement the diet, not replace the nutrients obtained from foods.ldquoIn that respect, and since there are ying recommendations across dferent age groups of children, it is right that dferent supplements offer dferent doses.ldquoSmaller doses allow parents to use the same product for younger and older children by ying the amount given.ldquoAccording to the most recent National Diet and Nutrition Survey data, children and adolescents are only getting a fth of the recommended vitamin D intake of  microgram from food alone.ldquoMany of the supplements in this survey would actually bridge the dietary gap topping up intake towards the recommended  microgramdaily..push,i[r].l*new

But all we are seeing are cuts to health visiting, childrenrsquos centre closures and increasing child poverty.ldquoThe Government must now show inspiring leadership to help children get the best possible start in le.ldquoIf our country is serious about prevention and reducing health inequalities then we must make massive investments and drive coordinated action right at the start of le.Fiona Smith, the Royal College of Nursingrsquos professional lead for children and young peoplersquos nursing, said improving the health and wellbeing of the youngest children ldquoshould be a major priority for every society.She added: ldquoHealth visitors work on the frontline in local communities and make vital interventions from birth, helping to prevent illness and promote health and wellbeing ndash however, Government ambitions to increase the size of this workforce in England were not underpinned by a comprehensive workforce plan and as a result numbers are now flat-lining.ldquoThe committeersquos call for an lsquoEarly Years Revolutionrsquo is one that the Government and NHS England must demonstrate they share through investment, not just in health visitors, but in all parts of the nursing workforce that support children and young people.ldquoAnything less will see this revolution remain words on a page with families missing out on the very interventions that can be the dference between leading a healthy le, and not.Leader of the House of Commons, Andrea Leadsom, is chairing an inter-ministerial group on early years family support, and said the report showed there was ldquogrowing recognition of the importance of improving support.ldquoAs we continue our work and look to make signicant policy recommendations for the earliest years, we will consider the select committeersquos views very carefully, she said.A Department of Health and Social Care spokesman said: ldquoChildrenrsquos health is a key priority for this Government and we want every child to have the best start in le.ldquoThe NHS Long Term Plan has committed to make the NHS one of the best places in the world to give birth and expand provision of quality mental health support for new and expectant mothers and their families.ldquoThe Health Secretary has also set out his prevention vision, supporting good health and support for families to stop problems developing in the first place..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Families need more support in early years to give children  ubest possible start u article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

When he was in his s, Pat McKeever took over the farm after the death of his father Peter, who had run an apple canning business on the site. Pat said: “My daddy was one of three brothers who used to can apples. They’d get the apples from the local orchards, peel them and can them. Daddy then started growing his own apples and supplying the fresh market and the cider markets.”Now Pat’s son, and Peter’s grandson – also called Peter – is the third generation farmer who is set to carry on the business. Pat’s we Catherine and their four daughters also have integral roles to play as the craft cider making end of the agri-business continues to grow.Pat, Catherine and Peter McKeever of Long Meadow FarmLong Meadow started off with two craft cider drinks in  before introducing a mulled cider and a cider aged in oak barrels, some of which had been used in the original apple canning business. Over the past two years the company has branched out into flavoured ciders, apple juice and apple cider vinegar – famed for its health benefits.Catherine said: “I know everything goes through a bit of a fad, but I think the craft ciders are still holding their own. The mindset of cider has changed with craft ciders. “A lot of people would have associated cider in their younger days – maybe when they were at university – as a cheap drink you can buy in big quantities and get a hit off.“But that wasn’t craft cider. People are prepared to pay that little bit extra for the quality that comes with craft cider.“We’re using all our own fruit. We make it in smaller quantities so it can hold all the flavours, that’s the way we want to keep it. We only use hand-picked fruit, not any that has fallen on the ground.”Of the harvesting process, Pat said: “We would have between  to  pickers. They would come the third week in July and do a bit of summer pruning.Resurfacing works on A Portadown Road, ArmaghBrexit and data protection - will firms still have to comply with the new EU GDPR  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"“Once that’s finished, in August they start into the picking of the apples, that goes right through to the end of October, first week in November.“The picking season we call it the nine weeks of hell. It’s your livelihood. You are depending on that fruit.“We harvest approximately , tonne of apples yearly.”Catherine explained how the orchard came to be illuminated: “A man called Walter Holt came to the farm last year to buy some apple cider vinegar. “I got talking to him and he gave me his card and told me what he did – an outdoor lighting artist.“I didn’t think much of it at the time, but I think the seeds had been sewn. I played about with it in my mind for a long time that it could be something we could work with.”Walter Holt and his assistant Orlanda Delaforce spent a total of  hours working on the installation of the lighting scheme.Walter commented: “The challenge on this particular scheme was working with smaller trees in an orchard setting. It’s a compact area and our solution was to develop a one way circular trail. “We tried to have as much creative iety as possible, implementing dferent approaches to dferent trees, with the whole colour scheme carefully thought out.”The light display is accompanied by music composed by Londonderry musician Sharon Graham.Catherine said: “We chose Valentine’s week for the treelumination launch as we felt it was a novel way in terms of adding to the romance of walking in the moonlight, but it’s by no means just for couples, it’s designed very much as a family experience for everyone.“I think we all have a vision of apple orchards complete with apple blossom or an abundance of fruit.“This illuminations event highlights the orchards in a totally dference perspective – a raw natural resting state before the cycle of growth begins.”The light show – designed by Walter Holt of Travelling Treeluminations – is the first of its kind to be held in an orchard environment and will open to the public from today until Saturday, from pm to pm each evening at  Loughgall Road.Entry is £ per adult and £ for children. A family ticket for two adults and two children costs £.Visitors will be given the opportunity to see the pressing and blending facilities on the farm as well as taste some of the products.Artisan food will be on sale as well as some free refreshment including tea, coffee and hot chocolate. Set to benefit from the four-day event is local charity ‘Katie-Rose’s Journey’.For more information on this week’s illumination event and other aspects of the farm go to www.longmeadowcidertry catch  TrendingThree vehicle crash near PortadownPartner and child were lsquomaking too much noisersquoDiscovery of mans body sparks murder probeJail sentence for man who spat and screamed at hospital staffConcern as disabled woman who carrys oxygen tank slapped with parking ticket          ..

Subject to confirmation by the all-island Single Electricity Market Committee, the auction for electricity generators to be awarded capacity contracts, on an all-island basis, has identied electricity capacityof , MW which will be in place for the year starting October ,  – , MW of that all-island total is attributed to Northern Ireland.This is a critical series of draft decisions which will reassure the large conventional generators about their contracts and will impose the discipline of revenue limits constrained by the capacity auction. The draft decisions also point to the expectations in terms of the capacity earmarked from renewable sources, from inter-connection with the Scottish grid and the capacity adjustments that may follow from demand-side adjustment contracts.SONI has not been as open and transparent as should have been possible. Readers must make the assumption that ties location to where capacity payments are identied in sterling and euro.The SONI statement lists  generator names ,  of which are identied as DSUswhich leaves  others. Eight are shown as part of the AES capacity in Ballylumford and Kilroot: four are small capacity generators, six each have capacity of over MW , and the last capacity source linked to Northern Ireland is the Moyle Interconnector.SONI does not present the capacity awards in a way that allows readers to identy the location of each successful unit.The Utility Regulator has agreed that the available Northern Ireland capacity should include  MW from the Moyle Interconnector which represents over % of locally available capacity. This is a judgement that might be queried. Is the interconnectora guaranteed source of capacity  If, at a time of peak demand in Northern Ireland, demand in the grid in GB had no spare capacity, presumably the capacity might not be available for supply to Northern Ireland. The regulator and SONI are well placed to judge the probability of this outcome and might argue that it is a minimal risk.There are some interesting features stemming from the assumptions made in setting the framework for the capacity auction. First, Northern Ireland has been treated as meriting some contract iations because of locational constraints. This is a reflection of the limited capacity of the electricity grid on the whole island to send electricity to the places where there is demand. Both the Dublin area and Northern Irelanddid not attract auction bids adequately to supply these area locational constraints. For Northern Ireland. the easy explanation lies in the absence of the long awaited north-south grid expansion from to the planned distribution hub in Co Tyrone.The capacity auction allowed for the acceptance of bids with prices which are higher than the main auction prices which would match supply and demand across the whole island. Because of the locational deficit, some Northern Ireland bids now show capacity payment prices above the all-Ireland ceiling of £, per MW which applies to most of the successful bids.In the quotation from AES for the two large fossil fuel burning units, the proposal is that they should attract payment prices of £, and £, per MW. At first sight this appears to allow a premium of nearly % on the payment price for each MW. This seems more than a marginal cost and points to the possible cost savingsthe proposed new north-south link had been operational.This answer for the older high capacity units at Kilroot is a further reflection of the doubt about the continued viability of these units. It will be remembered that a year ago, these same two units were deemed unsuccessful in the auction but, at a late stage when faced with a request for a derogation to be allowed to close these units, the initially agreed settlement was revised.A year ago, the first capacity auction under the rules of the newly instituted I-SEM, was accepted with a capacity supply of near to , MW for all of Northern Ireland. Now, in early , SONI has concluded that for security of supply Northern Ireland should contract for just under , MW. There is no obvious major uplt in demand in Northern Ireland so that, quietly, the suggestion is that the arithmetic in late  may now be thought to have been slightly too risky.The capacity auction is a fundamental building block of electricity supply policy for Northern Ireland. However, on its own, the allocation of capacity and the possible scope for investment in new generating capacity must also be seen in the context of increasing,market forces allow, the proportion of electricity supply that is supplied from renewable sources. The distribution of generating capacity is still dominated by fossil fuels. Northern Ireland’s capacity is nearly % from gas andcoal. However, the statistics showing the proportion of electricity supply from renewables points to average consumption from renewables of nearer to -%. Because of the iability in the contribution of wind based renewables, it would be hazardousgreater security dependence was allocated to renewables.In turn, the caveat about the possible role of renewables points to the possible value of further investment in energy storage for which no major scheme has been launched. If Kilroot power station survives for a further three to four years, then the experimental electricity storage capacity on that site may become an attractive asset.There are several continuing questions about Northern Ireland’s security of electricity supply. Will Kilroot be given further stays of execution after   Will the North South interconnector eventually be built  Will the proposed large natural gas burning power station be built in Belfast  Will the politically unpopular investment in anaerobic digestion plants be tackled  Will the Brexit settlement, or lack of it, damage the continued operation of the all-island single electricity market  But... it seems Kilroot has been given a temporary extension of its role in keeping the lights on.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/pmcg.jpg","title":"ryder cup legend to address belfast leadership conference","story":"Posted on Friday February  by Ulster Business Ryder Cup legend Paul McGinley has been revealed as one of the key speakers at a leadership event taking place in Belfast next month.

Its surveying team are members of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors . Nurturing talent and progression is a core principle that the firms stands for with  of their surveying staff having become qualied throughout the firm’s training program. We sat down with three members of the team.Gail Prentice-Jackson, associate director Over the last  years, Gail has worked right across the business, now within the asset management department.She manages a large mixed-use portfolio of property which includes leading shopping centres and retail parks right across Northern Ireland.Within that her role is ied and includes managing one of Northern Ireland’s most successful retail schemes. Day-to-day this can include everything from managing service charge budgets to maximising rental income through lease renewals and rent reviews. Another key role is to provide regular accounting and financial reports to clients.“One of my key roles is to support my agency department colleagues in their  acquisitions of investment assets and upon completion ensure that a comprehensive management regime is followed to ensure continued growth of our clients assets,” she says.“The role of a ‘property manager’ has evolved signicantly over the course of my career with much of our work now focusing on compliance and risk management. We pride ourselves on making sure our clients are well advised, mitigating any risks that may be involved with their particular property.”Some of those clients include retail sites such as Rushmere Shopping Centre in Craigavon.Gail is also one of just eight female surveyors in Northern Ireland with the designation of FRICS, a Fellow Member of RICS.“While females still only make up % of the surveying profession as a whole there are a signicant number of women working within the commercial property sector in Northern Ireland, it’s no longer a male orientated profession.”As for the business landscape Gail says that whilst there is general economic uncertainty they are seeing an increase in demand for their services as investors seek to maximisefrom their investments.“Interestingly we took on a number of new properties over the course of , often on behalf of investors who were keen to maximise rental s and ensure their property is run as efficiently as possible.”  Marian McFlynn, surveyor Since graduating from Ulster University in  with a degree in property investment and development, Marian’s career began on the other side of the globe – working for multi-billion dollar US-owned LaSalle Investment Management at its offices in Sydney.“In Sydney, as part LaSalle’s centre management team, I was responsible for leasing, marketing, administration and operation of a bulky goods shopping centre, home to over  homemaker and lestyle stores,” she says.“I ed to Northern Ireland, and joined the property and asset management department of Osborne King as a graduate surveyor in June ,” she adds. And following training, Marian became a chartered surveyor in . She’s now responsible for managing a range of commercial assets on behalf of clients. “This involves asset enhancement advice, tenant liaison, building maintenance, health and safety management, rent collection and accounting, service contract tendering and service charge administration,” she says.“I continue to build on my client and property portfolio.”And Marian also says that uncertainty hangs in the air for investors, while the ongoing lack of clarity over a post-Brexit landscape still exists.  Lisa McCaffrey, surveyorLisa has five years at Osborne King under her belt. Having graduated from the property investment and development course at Ulster University’s Jordanstown campus in , she worked at a Belfast estate agents before joining Osborne King in  becoming a chartered surveyor in .She works within the professional services team which sees her carry out valuations for a wide range of clients including private iniduals, large companies and the major lending institutions. As part of this Lisa is a member of the RICS Registered Valuers Scheme.Lisa also provides rent review and lease renewal advice to landlords and tenants throughout Northern Ireland.Additionally, Lisa was involved in the  non-domestic rating revaluation providing advice to a wide range of clients and negotiating the valuations with Land  Property Services on the clients behalf at application and appeal stages. Following the  revaluation Osborne King saved clients in excess of £.m. Lisa is working on the upcoming  non-domestic revaluation on behalf of a iety of clients.“I am fortunate to be involved in a wide range of work, some of which involves regular reporting to key clients such as one of Northern Ireland’s largest car showroom operators and well-known supermarket, convenience store businesses and global coffee brand.”  For more information contact Osborne King on   , email property@osborneking or visit the website at www.osbornekingView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/light_12112.jpg","title":"belfast office building comes on to the market","story":"Posted on Tuesday  February  by John Mulgrew A major city centre office building with around , sq ft of space has gone on the market.
