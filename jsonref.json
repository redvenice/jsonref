He is grinning mischievously and clutching a beloved Jumelle box camera that had recently been given to him by his father. In the next few years, Jacques will constantly record the world around him, photographing his bedroom, making portraits of uncles and cousins, and framing his older brother, Zissou, as he leaps into the air from a boat.Another 60 years will pass, however, before the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York hosts the first exhibition of his work, belatedly bestowing on Jacques Henri Lartigue the recognition he deserves as one of the great innovators of 20th-century photography.When the celebrated American photographer Richard Avedon saw Jacques Henri Lartigue’s work for the first time on the eve of the MoMA show in 1963, he wrote to his compatriot to express his gratitude: “It was one of the most moving experiences of my life… You brought me into your world and isn’t that, after all, the purpose of art?”The world Lartigue created with his camera was a reflection of the one he was brought up in as a privileged, pampered boy in a family environment that was both bourgeois and carefree. His father Henri, a self-made businessman, insisted that neither Jacques nor Zissou attend school, instead recruiting private tutors whose main aim was to keep Henri’s offspring amused. He once said: “I have plenty of money. My children should learn how to spend it.”Later, Lartigue’s name would become synonymous with a certain kind of ritzy glamour and elegance, epitomised in his countless images of his lover, Renee Perle, whose sultry beauty captivated him. In the 1920s and early 1930s, he was known primarily as a society photographer, shooting the rich and beautiful in the resorts along the Côte d’Azur, where he felt effortlessly at home. The life he lived seems to have been as gilded as the lifestyles of the film stars, models, socialites and playboys he photographed.In her new book, The Boy and the Belle Époque, Louise Baring concentrates on Lartigue’s childhood and teenage years, the majority of the photographs included having been taken before he turned 18. She traces a formative journey that begins in the early 1900s, when the Lartigue family lived in opulence in Paris and their country retreat in the Auvergne, and continues until 1914, when the outbreak of the first world war signalled the end of the belle époque.Lartigue’s life during this period pertains to the arc of a classic French coming-of-age novel. He was an instinctively gifted, voraciously curious prodigy who found his creative medium as a child, and was sustained by it throughout his formative years and into his adult life.From the start, it seems, Lartigue had one eye on posterity, creating photo-albums and journals of the things he witnessed. Aged 11, he photographed his bedroom from ground level, furniture and a mirror looming over his toy racing cars.More often, as the array of model racing cars suggests, he was drawn to movement, and, as a child, often photographed relatives and servants jumping off walls and over tables to his instructions. In one memorable image, he captured his cousin Simone taking a tumble from a homemade scooter. His most intriguing early subject, however, was Zissou, a daredevil and a dandy, who built and raced his own go-karts, tearing around the grounds of Chateau de Rouzat, the family’s country retreat, in goggles and a tailored suit. Zissou was the eccentric action man, while Jacques, as Baring puts it, was “a sensitive child who became a lifelong spectator”.Later, he would photograph speeding racing cars in a blur of motion and beautiful socialite women framed like exotic creatures in closely cropped compositions. When these images were belatedly discovered and exhibited decades later, they attested to Lartigue’s instinctive embrace of what later became known as the snapshot aesthetic, a term loosely applied to 60s iconoclasts such as Garry Winogrand and Lee Friedlander, who disregarded the rules of formal composition. Back in the early 1900s, when Lartigue embraced blur and movement, his approach was so singular that it amounted to what Baring calls “a new visual language of the 20th century”.On 29 May 1910, Lartigue, then 15, began a new adventure in a new setting, arriving at the Avenue du Bois de Boulogne in Paris with an unwieldy folding plate camera. His aim was “to photograph the ladies in the most outrageous and beautiful hats”. Back then, the Bois de Boulogne in early summer was an open-air promenade, where society women paraded their style. They often crossed paths on the Allée des Acacias with the more bohemian and even more fashionable women of the Parisian demimonde: actors, dancers, musical hall stars and “grand cocottes” – courtesans like Liane de Pougy, a friend of the novelist Colette, and Émilienne d’Alençon, a great beauty who would later become Edward VII’s lover.Although cold-shouldered in public by respectable members of Parisian high society, these demimondaines, writes Baring, “set the style, deciding which couture creations would rise or fall in the coming season”. Lartigue captured them all, often startling his exotic subjects with the loud click of his camera’s shutter. The results are fascinating, a record of a time and place when this sartorial exhibitionism was simply another ersion in, as Colette scathingly put it, “the bustling lives of people with nothing to do”.At times, Lartigue inevitably comes across as a proto-paparazzo. More often, though, he captures vignettes that speak volumes about the elastic social mores of the belle époque. His snatched portraits, for all the period detail they capture, seem, like his previous images of speed and movement, oddly contemporary. The blur, the often fantastical silhouettes, the sideways glances, the way he crops his images so that his subjects loom large – and even more exotic looking – in the frame, point to a singular sensibility that was at odds with traditional composition.Throughout this period, his love of speed and movement remained. He photographed the early French pioneers of flight, Gabriel Voisin and Louis Blériot, as they risked life and limb in an aerodrome near Paris. At the 1912 Grand Prix in Dieppe, he made one of his most famous early photographs, freeze-framing the rear of a Delage racing car as it sped past him at close range. The driver clutches the wheel as observers on the other side of the track appear as leaning shadows, their blurred outlines evincing the sense of motion that Lartigue set out to capture. In retrospect, all those childhood days snapping Zissou on his go-karts and his cousins leaping through the air seem to lead to this defining moment.If Lartigue was a photographer of the age of speed and modernity, he was not a man of action when it came to the war, which, for the main part, seemed to pass him by as if happening elsewhere. As France ordered general mobilisation, he retreated with his family from Paris to the Auvergne and the sanctuary that was Chateau Rouzat.“The war inevitably made us unhappy,” he wrote in a secret diary, “but it was happy all the same… I played sports and we still amused ourselves.” There is a single image in the book that suggests the unfolding horror: a platoon of marching soldiers silhouetted against a grey sky as a spindly aeroplane flies overhead. The war inevitably curtailed his carefree life, writes Baring, but “Lartigue emerged intact, plunging into life with the passions of a child, refusing ever to grow up”. That childlike optimism would fuel his life and his photography for decades to come."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0814345af234de0659b1083e7836a90d04294451/0_1513_4253_2551/master/4253.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f8a5fabf6d550a6bfea908be1bf52ccf","title":"the big picture on the road in post ceaucescu romania","story":"An odyssey around remote parts of central and eastern Europe led Fabio Ponzio to this incongruous sightBefore the collapse of the Soviet Union, Italian photographer Fabio Ponzio would look at a map of Europe and find his eyes always drawn to the east, to its “mysterious names, inscrutable frontiers and roads that ran on into unknown, prohibited lands”. It seemed to him that the iron curtain was “the ision between the conscious and the unconscious mind of Europe”.He first travelled across that dreamlike frontier in 1987, two years before revolutions reunited the continent. After the wall came down, over the course of a couple of decades, he drove determinedly through all the remote territories from which he had been excluded, with a tent and a stove and a sleeping bag in the back of his car, along with three Nikon cameras and 100 rolls of film. He slept in woods or in the homes of people he met. Once, in the mountains of Albania, the villagers told him that he was the first foreigner they had seen since two Italian soldiers fleeing the armistice of 1943.His pictures from those years – of weddings and funerals, of drunks and pilgrims, the homeless of the cities and the rural poor – caught cultures in the hinterland after communism and before consumerism. That period, as the hope of liberation gave way to endemic uncertainty, is the subject of his book East of Nowhere. Ponzio’s camera was drawn to incongruity. He took this picture in Romania in 1997, eight years on from the fall of Ceaușescu. The international licence plates and the open road stretching out beyond the mountains might promise new freedoms, but the sheep in the back of the car root this image in a stranger, older more unstable kind of reality. The car is going nowhere."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c668e64d2ef1183035e97c7e145348f71b425e0/0_23_3157_1895/master/3157.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f38acbded3c98f6564b645a6436cbe77","title":"photography daido moriyama in pictures","story":"He is one of Japan’s most renowned photographers, a giant of the Provoke movement whose compelling images take a disturbing view of city life and the chaos of existence"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff72729a35e5fdc83f6d1d159f0c2ff5815c36b5/0_87_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5ebc7e21af9ba0479e4b8d399fb7722e","title":"uk supermarkets ease coronavirus shopping restrictions","story":"Aldi, Lidl, Morrisons and Waitrose relax quantity curbs after decline in footfallSeveral supermarkets have loosened purchasing restrictions designed to prevent stockpiling during the coronavirus outbreak, as Tesco announced it could handle an extra 120,000 online orders per week.Aldi, Morrisons and Waitrose relaxed their policies on Tuesday, while Lidl removed quantity controls on all groceries except toilet paper.In a letter to its customers, the Lidl chief executive, Christian Härtnagel, said the decision had been taken as Britons made fewer shopping trips as a result of the lockdown.“We have seen a decline in footfall so we can see that you, our customers, are following the government advice to go out food shopping as infrequently as possible,” Härtnagel said.“At the same time, our supply chain is still processing very high volumes which means that product availability in store is improving on a daily basis.”Aldi has also scrapped a store-wide policy that limited shoppers to buying four of anything. Controls remain in place for a number of key lines including antibacterial hand sanitiser, toilet tissue and long-life milk.“While we would still encourage people to buy only what they need, product availability in store is good and the move will make it easier for people to shop for vulnerable people and those who are self-isolating,” the retailer said.The Bradford-based Morrisons chain has increased the purchase limit on products from three to four, and removed them altogether on some products. the changes would make it easier for people to donate to food banks, it said.Waitrose also said it was no longer restricting the quantity of fresh food, including meat, poultry and ready meals, that people could buy. Caps remain in place for other products, including toilet roll, in its stores and on its website. M\u0026ampS said it was starting to stock some brands, such as Tilda rice, to boost availability.Tesco, which recently limited online shoppers to buying 80 items at a time, said its home-shopping service had been scaled up and could now handle 780,000 orders each week for either home delivery or click \u0026amp collect.That compares with 660,000 slots a fortnight ago, with the UK’s biggest supermarket planning to add another 100,000 spaces in the coming weeks.The supermarket has bolstered the delivery slots by hiring 7,500 van drivers and product pickers. Its in-store limit of three items per customer on every product line remains in place.The chief executive, Dave Lewis, said: “We’re doing everything we can to increase the number of slots available and to support vulnerable people. We’ll expand the number of slots available each week but this still isn’t enough to meet the demand. For this reason, it is vital that customers who can come into stores and shop for themselves do so.”The update came as Lewis announced a £30m package of support for the community groups, including food banks and charities, that were “really under pressure”.The sum includes £15m of food donations to the redistribution charity FareShare and the anti-poverty campaign the Trussell Trust over the next 12 weeks."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/80da76561a3a62ff6dcbad4cb126dbce2d42919d/0_148_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fad907dae6965c1dd5b6d0d28261ebe5","title":"the stock markets have rallied so is peak panic over","story":"In the past fortnight an optimism of sorts has returned but the rebound rests in part on some pretty heroic assumptionsGrounds for optimism? It’s far too soon to say, obviously. All one can conclude from the outbreak of relative calm is that investors like the policymakers’ responses so far. A fortnight ago, their big fear was a credit crisis – and the first stirrings were definitely present. Central banks (at least for now) seemed to have seen off that risk by flooding the financial system with liquidity and “whatever it takes” messages. That was the moment when peak panic passed. Even the rush to the haven of US dollars has abated.The script could indeed develop that way but some heroic assumptions are being made. The rapid bounce-back theory rests on the idea that lockdowns will last only two or three months, at most, with no need to reimpose them.Perhaps that will be accurate but, remember, the investment consensus eight weeks ago was that Covid-19 was mainly a China-only affair and would be over quickly. Projections have been made to look very silly very quickly in this crisis. It is why little should be read into Tuesday’s better-than-expected survey of business confidence in China: one unreliable piece of data does not imply a lasting rebound.Nor do we know if governments’ support packages, though they seemed enormous on announcement, will be sufficient. Look at the calls for extra help already piling up at the UK Treasury’s door: even commercial landlords, who should be well placed to take some strain, are begging the state to cover shortfalls in their rental income.Stock markets can, obviously, look through such worries – they are in the business of peering round the next corner. All the same, it’s hard to believe this bear market will be banished quickly. Stuttering progress, punctuated by frequent disappointments, feels as much as one can reasonably expect from shares for a while.

To slow the spread of a virus, the government must convincingly inform and instruct the public. And to do this, it must inspire trust – trust that it is following the science, acting out of the interests of the population, and enforcing measures that will help to keep the public safe. Trust depends on transparency. If governments appear to be concealing the truth, or withholding information, their credibility can quickly crumble.The Egyptian government has long seen transparency as a weakness, and guarded information as though it were a national security threat. Much like Donald Trump’s White House, Egypt’s leaders have responded to reports about the estimated number of coronavirus infections as though they were a personal attack, rather than a health crisis the entire world is struggling to contain.Anyone found spreading “rumours” about the coronavirus now faces imprisonment and fines. Websites – such as the BBC and the US-based Arabic language Alhurra news channel – continue to be censored, and the government has sought to silence journalists. Egyptian officials recently expelled the British  journalist Ruth Michaelson following her report on mathematical modelling that indicated Egypt’s number of actual infections may be far higher than the official figures.At the time of Michaelson’s report, Egypt’s ministry of health claimed there were a total of 126 confirmed infections. Rather than respond to the study’s contention, Egyptian officials condemned the  for reporting it, expelled Michaelson and rebuked the New York Times’ Cairo bureau chief, Declan Walsh, for deigning to even tweet about the study.An environment of opacity and suspicion has made the Egyptian government into its own worst enemy, and aggravated what Egyptian officials seemingly fear: that the world could suspect they are covering up the real scale of infections. By expelling a journalist who reported on the country’s coronavirus cases, the government has invited others to wonder what it has to hide.It may have nothing to hide at all. Thus far, there is no evidence of an orchestrated cover-up of infections. Egyptian authorities responded faster and more aggressively than their counterparts in the UK, shutting schools and universities weeks ago. The government has halted flights and pledged a coronavirus package of 100 billion Egyptian pounds to combat the virus.Moreover, no country can claim a perfect response – the scientific consensus about the virus is still emerging, and nobody yet knows how much devastation it will ultimately wreak. Egypt could have acknowledged that most countries undoubtedly have more infections than confirmed numbers, because testing is still limited.The UK itself is contending with two dramatically different models: one from Imperial College London researchers, who argue the country is still early in its fight with the virus, and another from researchers at Oxford University, which suggests that as much as half the population (over 30 million people) may have already been infected. In the absence of data about the virus, such models are partly reliant on assumption and speculation, as has been argued in the .Rather than concede the complexity of the subject, debate the merits of these claims or explain their views on the matter, Egypt’s government lashed out at the reports, intensifying suspicions that it had something to hide.Indeed, its persistent aversion to transparency has led many observers and foreign governments to view most official claims with a degree of suspicion. When Isis downed a Russian passenger jet over Sinai in 2015, Egypt spent several months denying what countless governments had already concluded was true: Isis’s affiliate in Sinai, Wilayat Sinai, was responsible. But Egyptian investigators pressed on, insisting there was no evidence of terrorism or foul play.Several months after the attack, Egypt’s president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, casually acknowledged that the plane was brought down by terrorists in a speech about the economy. To this day, conclusions from the investigation have not been made public. The government’s strict insistence that nothing be said until its conclusions were published now seems like an effort to delay discussion until the matter was forgotten.But terrorist attacks have plagued other countries. Fatal security failures are a regular feature of our era. Admitting to failures, and working openly with other countries to resolve them, would have helped to build confidence in Egypt’s government. Instead, by spending months denying and obfuscating, many countries questioned whether Egypt was truly committed to improving airport security.Not only was the government’s response harmful – it was also unnecessary. After the Sinai incident, Egypt took steps to improve airport security, which has continued to be far more stringent than before the crash. But the damage to its reputation had already been done, and would last for years. Flights from the UK to Sharm el-Sheikh only resumed in February, and Russia still doesn’t permit flights to the Red Sea resort town.It’s the same story with coronavirus. The government would do far better by responding transparently to concerns, and being open about the measures it is taking. During a pandemic, transparency is not a liberal luxury, but a vital feature of effective governance.• Timothy E Kaldas is an independent risk adviser and nonresident fellow at the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ceb5237f58a0f6b53b54e8b527a961bdd50691c/0_9_4600_2760/master/4600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1945e5a0969a9c031e4b69924f019279","title":"virus neighbours covid 19","story":"Across the world, Covid-19 has triggered community action on a vast scale. It’s a powerful riposte to both government and private moneyYou can watch neoliberalism collapsing in real time. Governments whose mission was to shrink the state, to cut taxes and borrowing and dismantle public services, are discovering that the market forces they fetishised cannot defend us from this crisis. The theory has been tested, and almost everywhere abandoned. It may not be true that there were no atheists in the trenches, but there are no neoliberals in a pandemic.The shift is even more interesting than it first appears. Power has migrated not just from private money to the state, but from both market and state to another place altogether: the commons. All over the world, communities have mobilised where governments have failed.In India, young people have self-organised on a massive scale to provide aid packages for “daily wagers”: people without savings or stores, who rely entirely on cash flow that has now been cut off. In Wuhan, in China, as soon as public transport was suspended, volunteer drivers created a community fleet, transporting medical workers between their homes and hospitals.In South Africa, communities in Johannesburg have made survival packs for people in informal settlements: hand sanitiser, toilet paper, bottled water and food. In Cape Town, a local group has GIS mapped all the district’s households, surveyed the occupants, and assembled local people with medical expertise, ready to step in if the hospitals are overwhelmed. Another community in the city has built washstands in the train station and is working to turn a pottery studio into a factory making sanitiser.In the US, HospitalHero connects healthcare workers who don’t have time to meet their own needs with people who can offer meals and accommodation. A group called WePals, created by an eight-year-old, sets up virtual play dates for children. A new website, schoolclosures.org, finds teaching, meals and emergency childcare for overstretched parents. A network called Money During Corona texts news of job opportunities to people looking for work.In Norway, a group of people who have recovered from Covid-19 provide services that would be dangerous for non-immune people to offer. In Belgrade volunteers organise virtual coffee mornings and crisis counselling. Students in Prague are babysitting the children of doctors and nurses. Estates in Dublin have invented balcony bingo: the caller sits in the square between the blocks of flats with a large speaker, while the players sit on their balconies, taking down the numbers.In the UK, thousands of mutual aid groups have been picking up shopping and prescriptions, installing digital equipment for elderly people and setting up telephone friendship teams. A mothers’ running group in Bristol have restyled themselves “drug runners”, keeping fit by delivering medicines from chemists’ shops to people who can’t leave their homes. A virtual pub quiz organised on Facebook brought togethermore than 100,000 people.Around the world, self-organised groups of doctors, technicians, engineers and hackers are crowdsourcing missing equipment and expertise. In Latvia, programmers organised a 48-hour hackathon to design the lightest face shield components that could be produced with a 3D printer. A number of UK groups are encouraging companies with protective equipment in their storerooms to give it to frontline health workers. In the Philippines, fashion designers have repurposed their workshops to produce protective suits. Sharing techniques through the website PatternReview, home sewers have been mass-producing masks and scrubs.In just one week, a group of doctors, technicians and other experts organised themselves to design a crowdsourced ventilator, the OxVent, which can be produced from widely available parts for under £1,000. Another design, VentilatorPAL, can be manufactured for $370, according to the community of technicians that created it. The Coronavirus Tech Handbook is an open-source library pooling technologies and new organisational models for beating the pandemic. In the US, self-organised expert groups are filling some of the catastrophic gaps in public health provision, carrying out testing and tracking projects, creating directories of vulnerable people and speed-matching medical specialists with the hospitals that need them.The horror films got it wrong. Instead of turning us into flesh-eating zombies, the pandemic has turned millions of people into good neighbours.In their book Free, Fair and Alive, David Bollier and Silke Helfrich define the commons as “a social form that enables people to enjoy freedom without repressing others, enact fairness without bureaucratic control … and assert sovereignty without nationalism”. The commons are neither capitalist nor communist, market nor state. They are an insurgency of social power, in which we come together as equals to confront our shared predicaments.A thousand books and films and business fables assure us that the fairytale ending to which we should all aspire is to become a millionaire. Then we can isolate ourselves from society in a mansion with high walls, with private healthcare, private education and a private jet. The commons envisages the opposite outcome: finding meaning, purpose and satisfaction by working together to enhance the lives of all. In times of crisis, we rediscover our social nature.You can tell a lot about a society from its quirks of language. We repeatedly misuse the word “social”. We talk about social distancing when we mean physical distancing. We talk about social security and the social safety net when we mean economic security and the economic safety net. While economic security comes (or should come) from government, social security arises from community. One of the extraordinary features of the response to Covid-19 is that, during this self-isolation, some people – especially elderly people – feel less isolated than they have done for years, as their neighbours ensure they are not alone.We still need the state: to provide healthcare, education and an economic safety net, to distribute wealth between communities, to prevent any private interest from becoming too powerful, and to defend us from threats. It currently performs these functions poorly, by design. But if we rely on the state alone, we find ourselves sorted into silos of provisioning and highly vulnerable to cuts. Rich social lives are replaced with cold, transactional relations. Community, then, is not a substitute for the state, but an essential complement.There is no guarantee that this resurgence of collective action will survive the pandemic. We could revert to the isolation and passivity that both capitalism and statism have encouraged. But I don’t think we will. I have the sense that something is taking root now, something we have been missing: the unexpectedly thrilling and transformative force of mutual aid."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dae784d2438739fcf589d092dfd33dbf702f72cc/0_0_3556_2135/master/3556.jpg?width=685\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=aa12177c8a30a1270868e978cd9a9fe1 1370w","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of ambience","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘ambience’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘ambience’.Share your photos of what ambience means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 1 April at 10am.

You do have to keep upright and breathe in, but they are comfortable.For the premiere of the first film, I got dressed up for the red carpet and then had to get on the back of a police motorbike to drive across London to the Old Vic theatre, where I put on an overall and slippers for my role in Noises Off. Then I jumped back on the bike and went to the party. Talk about going from the sublime to the ridiculous – it was a great adventure.I absolutely loathe shopping. My stylist will usually bring me five outfits. I generally try on, choose and fit the first one.

In his down time, he is taking up a DIY challenge to make a patchwork quilt based on a dress he made during the filming of Next in Fashion, using other designers’ leftover scraps. The design – inspired by concerns over the melting polar ice caps – is an arctic landscape. “Ever since the show, I’ve been inundated with requests to make similar quilted items, so I thought this was a good opportunity to show people how they can do so themselves.“You can make it from any leftover fabrics you have. This time, I used some leftover damaged denim from my studio as the quilt base. I don’t imagine everyone has that lying around so use what you have.“Heavier is better for the base so it can hold the appliqué – maybe some old curtains or an existing blanket that needs some love. If you don’t have enough to do a blanket, you could use the same technique to make a cushion. For the appliqué, it could be old clothes, tablecloths, tea towels – anything you can get your hands on.“I went quite abstract with my pattern, but you could come up with a more elaborate design.“Mine took me five hours on a sewing machine. You could hand sew it instead. It’s going to be a much longer process but could be very therapeutic, which is something we could all do with right now.”Difficulty level: intermediateEquipment needed: an old blanket (or similar), scraps of fabrics, thread, sewing machine needle“For the nitty-gritty, head over to my Instagram – my wonderful sister captured the whole process.”Liam Hodges has recently moved house, so his time in self isolation has been spent unpacking and making rugs.“I learnt to crochet last October and have found it really relaxing. For our AW20 collection, we crocheted a lot of squares as embellishments. I’ve kept it up and even tried to make a skipping rope when I first went into isolation.“I had been wanting to make some rag rugs and started working out how to crochet graphics into them. I made the graphic in Photoshop so that each pixel represented each crochet stitch.“It took me around two and a half hours to complete and is made up of old, shredded T-shirts for the coloured section and yarn made using Wool and the Gang offcuts for the main black areas, so it is entirely made from waste.”Difficulty level: intermediateEquipment needed: an old T-shirt, a crochet hook, yarn and scissors“Use our how-to digital zine on Instagram, which has the pattern as well as instructions on how to crochet.”Designer Christopher Raeburn’s team are adapting to the current situation by releasing weekly creative tasks via their #RaeburnAtHome initiative.“This project is to make one of our shark mascots. We have always featured animals in our collections, initially as a way to highlight and support endangered species through our WWF UK partner. The Shark is one of our most popular animals we keep it in our collections each season, but it always evolves.“You need no more than one square metre of fabric – even less if you are conscious of pattern placement for waste reduction. Using a variety of smaller cuts of fabric is encouraged though as this adds pops of colour and texture to the final shark.“Not only is reusing and repurposing old fabric a more interesting way of working, but extending the lifetime of garments is instrumental in reducing planetary impact. When people are spending more time at home than ever before, now is the chance to pull out those bits that we no longer use and give them new life.“Unless you are an absolute master, it should keep you busy for about 10 hours. We only recommend a sewing machine for ease and speed – top marks for effort go to anyone tackles it by hand.”Difficulty level: advancedEquipment needed: a sewing machine, fabric, scissors, thread and paper.For the full instructions click here you can download the shark pattern here. It is designed to fit on A4 paper.Designer Edward Crutchley’s lockdown aim is to set himself a project each day. His first was to cut a pattern for and sew a one-piece kimono-inspired garment. Next up is making miniature sculptures of the kings and queens of England using modelling clay.“How to make Japanese clothes by John Marshall is a book I have on my shelf that I thought it would be great to lose myself in during isolation.“I love traditional Japanese clothing and now is the perfect time to study. What I love about kimonos is that they are traditionally dictated by the fabric – they are the width they are because that is how wide the looms could weave. For a fabric geek like me, that’s a dream.“A traditional kimono pattern looks like some different-length rectangles put together, but nothing is ever that simple and it takes a lot of skill to construct a traditional kimono properly. The one I made is much, much easier.“I used three metres of fabric left over from the last collection, but you could make it with two metres if it’s 150cm wide, or you can easily add seams to the patterns or patchwork fabrics together. Repurposing old curtains or a bed sheet would be perfect.“It took me around four hours to complete – there are only three seams and three hems. I tried to make it as simple as possible.”Difficulty level: advancedEquipment needed: a sewing machine, two to three metres of fabric, thread, scissors, paper and dressmaking pins.While social distancing, Rosie Wolfenden and Harriet Vine, the designers behind Tatty Devine jewellery, are doing daily making challenges.“It’s amazing for your mental health and the perfect antidote to these strange and unsettling times. This so-called shrinky necklace is something we did as kids. We first made one as Tatty Devine in 2001. It was very early days, when we made jewellery from whatever we could get our hands on. We enjoyed having to eat crisps.”Difficulty level: beginnerEquipment needed: old crisp packets (not foiled or metallic, such as Chipsticks or many supermarket own brands) a chain necklace (whether new or something you already own) greaseproof paper, a baking tray, a damp tea towel (for safety reasons), an old tea towel, a hole punch, a regular jump ring and two pairs of flat-nose pliers.You can stop with one pendant or layer up for a charm effect.Despite having no previous knitting experience, dancer Meshach Henry has made three scarves in as many days, documented on Instagram by his partner, the Radio 1 DJ Nick Grimshaw.“I always said I would learn a new skill like plumbing or plastering if I ever had a lot of time on my hands. But they aren’t ideal skills to practice in this current situation. So, having seen knitting supplies in a craftshop window recently, I thought, ‘Here’s my new hobby.’“I purchased a thick wool because it looked easier to use and less fiddly. I bought 10mm knitting needles, which I thought were an average size but later found out are strangely big – but I’m really happy with the chunky effect they produce.“What I like about knitting is that you can see your physical product. As a dancer, I rarely get to see my own work, so to be able to see and hold this tangible thing is a whole new world for me.“My intention is to move on to knitting jumpers. I want to create a matching jumper for every scarf, just to keep things interesting.”Difficulty level: beginnerEquipment needed: knitting needles and wool“I taught myself by watching an eight-minute Knitting for Total Beginners tutorial on YouTube. The tutorial taught me how to cast on in the first instance. Then there are follow-up links to a second video that teaches you how to change knitting style and how to cast off.”Lucinda Chambers is co-founder of fashion brand Colville and online shopping platform Collagerie and was fashion director at British Vogue for 25 years.“I was in Paris six months ago having a glass of water in the Bon Marché and I noticed the glass looked suspiciously like the end of a wine bottle.” When Chambers investigated she found a world of home crafters making their own tumblers from pre-used wine bottles.“I found an inexpensive kit on Amazon,” she says. “Each glass is a labour of love as I sand them by hand it’s strangely therapeutic.”Difficulty level: mediumEquipment needed: empty glass bottles, a glass cutter kit (available online, for instance from Amazon).“The kit has everything you need to make the glasses: a stand, saw and markers that you place on the empty bottle at the height you require your finished glass to be. You can make French-style low tumblers or something taller. Once you’ve cut the bottle you need to sand the cut edge smooth.”The internet is full of videos, such as this one, that show you more details."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9018f055b3426cb09f10dcebac9c4a5d4846eeb7/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=99f745dfc1667b1d2d7fbd1c559c63c1","title":"rihanna makes history did i ever imagine that i would see a durag on the cover of vogue","story":"The singer appears in fashion magazine wearing a sartorial symbol of black powerRihanna has made history, becoming the first woman to appear on the cover of British Vogue wearing a durag.The garment, which is used to help the development of braids, waves and dreadlocks, has had a storied history in the black community. From being worn by slaves through to members of the Black power movement, it is a potent sartorial symbol of African-Caribbean survival and celebration.After a period of criminalisation (it was banned by some high schools in the US), it has been reclaimed. As Observer beauty columnist Funmi Fetto wrote in Vogue: “The tainted fabric has been reclaimed as a symbol of black beauty, a signifier of style worn on the streets, the catwalk, the red carpet ... And now, in a powerful mic-drop moment, the durag is making its first appearance on the May 2020 cover of British Vogue.”“Did I ever imagine that I would see a durag on the cover of Vogue?” asked the British Vogue editor Edward Enninful on his Instagram page.In the lengthy post, Enninful revealed that it was the singer’s idea to wear the headwear, which was designed by the famed milliner Stephen Jones. “For this month’s shoot, she wanted Rihanna for a new decade,” he said. “We worked through a substantial archive of visual references (her fashion and cultural knowledge is encyclopaedic) to find a new proposition,” he explained. “Then suddenly, at 2am, my phone pinged with the latest WhatsApp: ‘How about we go with a durag?’”It’s not the first time the singer has worn the garment. At the 2014 Council of Fashion Designers of America awards she paired a sheer, Swarovski encrusted Adam Selman dress with a crystal durag. Two years later, she she opened the 2016 MTV VMA’s wearing a black and white design by Moses Gauntlett Cheng.More recently, versions of the headdress were worn by singers Solange and Janelle Monae at the 2018 Met Gala, while in January, the Californian rapper Guapdad 4000 wore a 10ft-long durag on the Grammys red carpet, designed by Faded NYC."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7baed359211a8a0a1d0d75d7a7bd0975e3752465/0_187_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6b546a88ced88041f4e761e4ffef9c54","title":"how to make tinned veg more interesting","story":"Tinned vegetables are a lot more versatile than you might thinkHow do I make tinned veg more interesting?Brian, BrusselsWe’re all in the same boat as you now, Brian, staring in bewilderment at our kitchen cupboards and wondering how to cheer up whatever’s in there – anyone else got some use-by-2017 kidney beans? No, just me then.Your best friend right now, as in many a savoury culinary challenge, is the spice rack, no matter how dusty (a copy of Jack Monroe’s wonderful Tin Can Cook wouldn’t go amiss, either). It doesn’t matter which herb or spice you use, says chef and food writer Claire Thomson: “They’ll all add an extra dimension to humble tinned veg, from cumin or turmeric to oregano or bay. And if you have an onion andor garlic, even better.” Sweat any alliums until they’re soft, add the ground or whole spices – if they’re on the old side, revive them first by toasting in a dry pan until aromatic – then stir in the veg, heat and, voila, a more than serviceable dish that’s ready in minutes. (If you have any, lob in a few chopped fresh herbs at the end for final flourish.)Ready-made spice pastes are another invaluable source of oomph, Thomson says: “Things like Thai chilli paste, harissa, miso and chipotle in adobo bring much-needed intensity.” The same goes for tomato puree: “It’s like a steamroller of flavour. Even just a blob rewards you with a big hit of richness.” For a welcome sharp note, try a spritz of lemon or lime juice. “Ideally fresh,” Thomson says, “but there’s nothing wrong with the stuff in bottles, if that’s all you have – I’ve always got some in for emergencies.” She also swears by preserved lemons and oranges, which she also uses, diced small and mixed with oil, in pungent dressings for all sorts of cooked veg.It’s a cinch to make your own simple paste, too, says Romy Gill, chef, food writer and one of the stars of BBC2’s newly revived Ready Steady Cook. “Even one made with just blitzed fried onion, garlic and any spice works magic on tinned veg, whether pulse, potato or bean.”Gill adores vegetable tikkis, India’s answer to croquettes - “You can make them with tinned as well as with fresh: potatoes or chickpeas are especially good” - and is also an advocate of tinned spuds in salads: “They’re already cooked, so drain and dress as you normally would, or dice them and stir into yoghurt with herbs and spices.”Marwa Alkhalaf, who until the restaurant trade abruptly shut down last week was chef and co-owner of Nutshell in London, says the key is variety. “Mix and match tinned pulses,” she says. “Combinations of lentils and beans have a range of textures and stop dishes from being one-note.” Add noodles or pasta for the same reason: “We had aash reshteh, a Persian lentil, chickpea and kidney bean soup with noodles, on the menu, but any pulses will work. You can’t go wrong.”• Do you have a culinary dilemma?

Occasionally, I stir in a little finely chopped crisp bacon together with the fat in which it has cooked.

It was one of the best halves of European football we’ll ever see. It ends with United ahead on the away goals rule after a spectacular comeback from 2-0 down, sparked by a symbolic goal from their inspirational captain Roy Keane. But he has also been booked and will miss the final if United get there. If United play in the second half as they did in the last 25 minutes of the first, they will get there. Their performance was quite glorious, and I’m quite sure all supporters of English football – especially those in Liverpool, Leeds, north London and the other half of Manchester – will wish them well for the second half.45+1 min Blomqvist wins the ball with a beautiful, Giggs-like sliding tackle on Birindelli just inside his own half, and off United go again. His angled pass infield is dummied by Yorke and runs to Cole, who waits for Blomqvist to catch up with the play and frees him on the left. Blomqvist tries to complete the one-two-three with a first-time cross towards Cole at the near post, where Iuliano does extremely well to get in front of Cole and poke the ball to safety. 44 min The board goes up to signal one minute of added time. Both teams have certainly earned their half-time wellness juice.43 min Conte slashes a volley wide from Di Livio’s cross. It wouldn’t have counted anyway as Inzaghi had been flagged offside.42 min Deschamps takes a quick free-kick to Zidane, who is wrongly flagged offside. He would have been through on goal, although Stam might have got back to him. 40 min This game is already an all-time classic, and it’s not even half-time.40 min “Breathless stuff this, Rob,” says Chris Wilkerson (10 years, 8 days). “Dad has said I can stay up past bedtime! YORKE! Wow!” 39 min: Yorke hits the post! Neville floats a long pass towards Blomqvist on the edge of the area. Birindelli heads it away but only to Yorke, 25 yards from goal. A brilliant first touch takes him away from Iuliano, then he pushes the ball into the area and drives a ferocious low shot that beats Peruzzi and smacks off the far post!38 min: Good save by Schmeichel! Inzaghi almost completes a first-half hat-trick to put Juventus back in front. Di Livio, on the left, lofts an angled pass to Inzaghi in the area. He backs into Stam expertly, then wriggles away from him on the edge of the six-yard box and hits a low shot that is excellently blocked by Schmeichel. The ball comes back to Inzaghi, who screws it wide from a tight angle. The first chance was the big one.38 min In the other semi-final, Mario Basler has given Bayern Munich the lead against Dynamo Kiev. Bayern now lead 4-3 on aggregate, and the away goals rule means that Kiev needs to score at least twice.38 min Cole and Yorke have been unplayable in the last 20 minutes. The Juventus defenders cannot cope.37 min United are all over Juventus now. Irwin feeds a pass into Cole, who turns superbly and hammers a snapshot that is held by the tumbling Peruzzi.36 min “Hi Rob,” says Michael Minihan. “Is there a hint of male pattern baldness creeping in with Zinedine Zidane?”A hint?! That’s like saying there’s a hint of saturated fat in a full English.United are ahead in the tie! This is an extraordinary turnaround. They looked finished at 2-0 down, and now they are ahead on the away goals rule! Neville pinched the ball off Di Livio with disdainful ease - Juventus just can’t get out - and drove a long straight pass towards the edge of the area. Beckham headed it down to Cole, in a bit of space 30 yards from goal. He controlled the ball and curled a magnificent half-volleyed pass over the defence to Yorke, who flew at the ball like a superhero to slam a ing header past Peruzzi. What a goal! The pass from Cole - it would be an insult to call it a cross – was glorious, taking four defenders out of the game, and the finish was emphatic. It’s Yorke’s first goal in a month and a half.33 min: KEANE IS OUT OF THE FINAL! If United do make it to Barcelona next month, they will be without their best player. Keane has been booked for a foul on Zidane. Blomqvist, just inside the Juventus half, played a slow square pass that Keane miscontrolled on the run. He tried to win it back with a lunging tackle, but Zidane got to the ball first and Keane brought him down. The yellow card was out straight away, and Keane accepted it without complaint.He saved his tongue for Blomqvist, waving his hands and shouting “Pass the fucking ball!” Blomqvist would be well advised not to point out that pass the ball is precisely what he did. I suppose what Keane meant was ‘pass the effing ball properly’, forward andor with pace, not slow and sideways.It wasn’t a great pass, although Keane’s first touch was unusually sloppy as well. He’s had a superb game so far, dominating midfield with faithful lieutenant Nicky Butt, and United will hope it doesn’t affect him as it did Paul Gascoigne on this ground all this years ago. Knowing Keane, I doubt it will.31 min The TV camera zooms in on Didier Deschamps, who looks absolutely shattered already. He’s carrying plenty of water right now, most of it sweat. 30 min: Stam heads off the line! Zidane meanders down the left, away from Butt, and lobs a cross towards the penalty spot. Schmeichel comes but is beaten to the ball by Conte, whose header goes miles in the air and is about to dip into the net when Stam appears from nowhere to clear with his granite bonce. 29 min There’s a good example: Davids tries to find Inzaghi on the halfway line, Stam bounces him off the ball and United come again. Irwin’s long ball down the left is headed on by Yorke to Cole on the edge of the area. He returns it to Yorke, who drives well wide from 25 yards. It was another good link up from United’s front pair, who look as telepathic as at any point since that blizzard of goals at the start of the year. 28 min According to a graphic on ITV, United have had 62 per cent of possession in this game. I’ve no idea how they work that stuff out but I bet it’s a long time since any team has had that much of the ball away to Juventus. At the start it was a mixed blessing, because their passing was ponderous and Juventus were deadly on the counter. But in the last 10 minutes United have been relentless, with Keane’s progressive passing setting the agenda. I can’t believe I’m typing this but Juventus, the ultimate power team of the last few years, are struggling to live with United’s tempo. They can’t get out of their own half.The captain Roy Keane has dragged United back into the game! Beckham fizzed the corner to the near post, where Keane arrived late to flick an emphatic header into the far corner. He got between Pessotto and Zidane, who ended up his backside, and flashed it past Peruzzi. There’s no celebration from Keane: he points to Beckham, acknowledging the quality of the corner, and runs straight back to the halfway line to get on with business. 24 min United move the ball smoothly from right to left, where Cole wins a corner.23 min “I’m watching this in The Dickens Inn in Philadelphia, Rob, and the mood is glum right now,” says Justin Kavanagh. “Although Andy from Norn Iron is wearing his “lucky jumper” (a red and black hoop Denis the Menace affair), it certainly isn’t working for United tonight. There we were dreaming of a Treble. Football, eh! It always kills the hope in you.”22 min: Juventus should be down to 10 men! Ferrara has got away with a blatant professional foul on Yorke. It all stemmed from a Schmeichel goalkick, which was headed on by Butt on the edge of the centre circle. Iuliano misjudged the bounce of the ball, which allowed Yorke to slip past him and through on goal. He then cut across the covering Ferrara in the D, only to be dragged down by the shoulder! United might still have scored through Beckham, whose shot from the edge of the area was blocked, and then Cole was given offside. Replays confirm it was a clear foul by Ferrara, although it was definitely outside the area. That’s scandalous refereeing.20 min Beckham is brought down on the right wing by Di Livio the free-kick is headed away by Deschamps. This is a decent little spell for United, whose passing is quicker and more rhythmic. 19 min That’s a little better from United. Blomqvist plays a clever reverse pass to release Irwin on the left. His low pass infield is dummied by Yorke and runs on to Cole, who lobs it back towards Yorke in the area. He takes it down on the chest but slices a volley high and wide. It was a tight angle and he was off balance. But the build-up play was encouraging.18 min Davids, who has made another dominant start, yelps with pain after a late tackle from Keane. The referee Urs Meier has a word with Keane, who is one of the many players on a yellow card. If he is booked tonight he will miss the final should United produce a miracle.17 min Nothing much is happening. United have at least restored a bit of order defensively.16 min You have to wonder whether Alex Ferguson will ever win the European Cup. United have improved enormously since returning to the competition in 1996, but the final hurdle looks as insurmountable as ever. In fact, it could be a long while before any English team wins it. 15 min Butt plays a ball towards Yorke, who dithers and is robbed contemptuously by Iuliano. As in the first leg, Yorke and Cole are really struggling the ball isn’t sticking at all.15 min “Spare a thought for my brother Andrew,” says Jim Danson, “whose missing this game because he’s on a geography field trip in North Wales.”14 min On the touchline, Ferguson looks relatively calm, chewing on gum and saying something to his No2 Steve McClaren “If he pulls this one out,” says Ron Atkinson on ITV Sport, “it’ll be the greatest achievement since he’s been at United.”13 min “Well, that’s it,” said Jeff Black. “I’m going to switch over and watch Brookside.”The Naked Chef is on BBC2, I’ve heard good things about that.12 min Juventus have played United like a fiddle: sit deep, wait as long as it takes to win possession and then strike like a cobra.Oh lord. Alex Ferguson’s European dream has gone up in smoke. The first goal may have been avoidable, but this was desperately unfortunate. Di Livio and Davids combined to find Pessotto, who eased a pass into Inzaghi on the left edge of the area. He waited until he felt Stam behind him, then shifted the ball down the line and hit a speculative cross-shot that took a wicked deflection off Stam and spun over the head of Peter Schmeichel. The bounce was a freak of physics. I don’t think it was on target before it hit Stam, but Inzaghi will claim it. 10 min I suppose Manchester United had to score anyway. The difference is that a 1-1 draw would take the tie to extra-time, whereas a 1-0 win would have put them through.9 min Birindelli drives a long pass towards Inzaghi, who wrestles with the last man Johnsen and then falls over. The referee isn’t interested. But Juventus look so dangerous on the break.8 min An immediate response from United. Keane chips a cute ball down the line for the overlapping Neville, who lobs it first time across the penalty area. Cole, 12 yards from goal, connects well with an overhead kick but hits it straight at Peruzzi.It’s an even better start now! Filippo Inzaghi has given Juventus the lead from the corner. Zidane took it short to Di Livio, received the return and curled a wicked first-time cross into the six-yard area. Inzaghi was the only Juventus player in there, but he got away from Neville at the far post to volley in from two yards.Neville’s defending was less than ideal. He was thrown by a sudden movement from Inzaghi and ended up trying to manhandle him, like a bouncer bundling somebody out the back door of a nightclub. He wasn’t even looking at the ball as it flashed across the face of goal onto Inzaghi’s right foot.6 min Davids shields the ball from Keane near the halfway line, then suddenly opens United up with a marvellous pass down the inside-left channel. Beckham slides in ahead of Pessotto to concede a corner. This is a strong start from Juventus.5 min The decidedly uncrowded Zidane has time to drive a long, angled pass over the defence. For a second it looks like Inzaghi is through, but Stam shows good pace to catch him up and put the ball out of play. Moments like that are exactly the reason United bought Stam, who is arguably the best one-v-one defender in the world.4 min The early signs are that United have no special plan to deal with what Ferguson called “the Zidane thing” in the build-up. He is playing in the hole between the defence and midfield, and it looks like United are planning to crowd him rather than man-mark him.4 min “I’m just about to finish college, the world is my oyster, everything seems rosy,” says Matt Dony. “Maybe my band will get the record deal we deserve. (Otherwise, I’ll probably end up as a boring, bitter middle-aged grump. Urgh.) The world is full of opportunity. I don’t even mind seeing United do well (although, they stand no chance tonight), because I’ve got a good feeling about Liverpool over the next few seasons. Next year will be our season.”It’ll be Sean Dundee’s season. You heard it here last.3 min A frantic start, although United have seen plenty of the ball. Zidane plays a first-time through ball towards Conte, and Schmeichel rushes from his line to claim.2 min “Great pre-match tune featuring Ian Brown,” says Peter Oh. “Do you reckon that the Stone Roses will ever reform?”No chance. They’ve got far too much class to go down that desperate road.1 min Peep peep! United kick off from right to left as displayed by the Independent Television cameras. Drink!There’s quite a din in Turin. The atmosphere is smoky, primal – and, even on a television screen, pretty damned intimidating. This is it.Alex Ferguson is radiating calm during his pre-match interview on ITV. He looks excited but relaxed, with a half-smile on his face as he considers the match. “It’s a massive game and I feel good about it. I think we have a very good chance. It’s gonna be a tough game, we’re aware of that. They’ll start 100 miles an hour, they’ll try to finish us off in the first 30 minutes. We’ve got to make sure we’re ready for that, and counter-attack with real purpose. It’s gonna be a great night I hope.”“Hi Rob,” says Sean Doyle. “I’ve lost a lot of money this week betting on the weather but after Juve’s performance in the first leg I’m confident that my ridiculously large bet on a comfortable home win will turn my luck around.”Come on: how much, and what odds.Edgar Davids, Juve’s Dutch pitbull, was in bullish mood earlier in the week.United are supposed to have the best midfield in the world but we had the better of them at Old Trafford. We were like a steam train, overrunning them. I felt sick to my stomach when Giggs equalised for them. The longer I was out there, looking at opponents who had been described as such big stars, the more I realised what was in it for us. I have no fears any more. I want to get at them again.Twelve men, some angrier than others, are on a yellow card and will miss the final if they are booked tonight: Irwin, Johnsen, Keane, Scholes, Phil Neville, Conte, Deschamps, Davids, Di Livio, Zidane, Montero and Peruzzi. It was on this ground that Paul Gascoigne started shedding them during and after the Italia 90 semi-final.There’s no Ryan Giggs, not even on the bench. Ferguson has decided to keep United’s width and replace him with Jesper Blomqvist rather than Paul Scholes. That’s one of two changes fron the first leg. The other was widely predicted: Nicky Butt replaces Scholes in central midfield, where United were outnumbered in the first half at Old Trafford.Dwight Yorke and Andy Cole return to the starting line-up after being on the bench or in the stands for the last two games. They haven’t scored in over a month, and Yorke in particular had a beast in the first leg, but Ferguson was always likely to trust them in such a big game. They’ve scored 10 between them in this season’s competition, the same as the entire Juventus squad.Juventus also make two changes from the first leg. Ciro Ferrara replaces Paolo Montero, who is only on the bench. That must be because of injury. The suspended right-back Zoran Mirkovic is replaced by Alessandro Birindelli at right-back. The young French winger Thierry Henry, who scored twice at Lazio on Saturday, is cup tied. Juventus have stuck to the same 4-4-1-1 formation that was so effective at Old Trafford, with Zidane playing behind Filippo Inzaghi. The sixth best team in Italy are also the most feared in Europe. Juventus may have taken most of the Serie A season off, but they still have an aura the size of a continent. If you don’t believe me, here’s Exhibit A: Gary Neville’s face when Juventus sneaked into the quarter-finals after drawing their first five group games. Juve were still scary when they were crap. On current form, they’re terrifying. They took the leaders Lazio apart in Rome at the weekend, and they were awesome for the first hour of their 1-1 draw at Old Trafford two weeks ago. “We’ll score over there,” said a combative Ferguson after that game, and United will have to: if it ends 0-0, Juventus go through on away goals.This really is the ultimate challenge for Ferguson’s intrepid, Treble-chasing team. The good news is that they could barely be in better form going into it. United are unbeaten in four months, and the astonishing drama of last week’s FA Cup semi-final win over Arsenal has created a powerful sense of destiny. But while they are hoping to reach the European Cup final for the first time in 31 years. Juve are expecting to reach their fourth in a row, and their sixth European final in seven seasons. Dwight Yorke reckons it’s 5050 George Best says United need “a miracle”. I wouldn’t go that far, but Juventus are big favourites - especially as United are likely to be without Ryan Giggs, who did not train last night because of his ankle injury. Forget what Juve’s new coach Carlo Ancelotti said earlier this week Giggs is the one United player Juventus truly fear.Giggs starred when United beat Juventus 3-2 in the group stages last season, their most important European rite of passage to date. That was a glorious victory – but it was at Old Trafford, and Juventus had 10 men for the last 25 minutes. This challenge is on another level. In recent seasons Juventus have been United’s benchmark, inspiration and nemesis. If Ferguson’s team are going to reach the European Cup final, there’s no better place to do it.Kick off is at 7.45pm BST on 21 April 1999 (and 31 March 2020)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3a8e93a3b8c433556c361e39238cbd2cf1e5befc/0_19_750_450/master/750.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eb7f23b8078128b878ed1d43f18350e7","title":"virtual choir practice singing in dark times we can turn our voices to the light","story":"Rather than shutting down, some Australian choirs have moved their activities online, providing a welcome distraction for their membersFrom my bed, propped up with cushions and with my fancy headphones on, I sip gin and watch the screen as I sing an arrangement of Ball Park Music’s Surrender.“It’s OK, it’s alright, true terror in the middle of the night, give in if it makes you feel better. So surrender, so surrender.”On the Facebook livestream members of our choir make comments and jokes, or poke the emoji button until we are swirling in a sea of hearts. In my little house, my family stack the dishwasher and play with the dog. But I’m “at choir”, singing while ginning, connecting to voices, virtually.Sophia Exiner has run Melbourne Indie Voices for the past three years with technical director and guitarist, Josh Teicher. Starting out in her front room with a small group of 30, there are now more than 250 of us, rehearsing over three nights in a Collingwood studio. “We’ve tried to build a community with the choir,” she says. “It’s a unique space for connection and also a chance to let go.” But now the world is shutting down. Since last week Exiner and Teicher have had to work on technological connections, bringing our choir rehearsals live via Facebook to our devices. Two weeks ago a number of choristers showed up in person, but more than half of us followed direction in our own homes via the livestream.“Last week I felt like everything was splintering, but we just felt so together at rehearsals,” Exiner says. “Getting online has highlighted what our core values are: inclusivity, community, love of music and shared experiences. We’ve realised that for a lot of that, it doesn’t require us to be in the same physical space.”Of course it wasn’t the same as being in a sea of voices, feeling buoyed by the waves of sound around me. I missed the energy of that human frisson. Sometimes, in pre-corona rehearsals, we would turn to face each other and sing in a circle so we could hear our different parts, the blending together of melodies and harmonies. We can’t do that online, but we are still singing together. For many of us it feels like a lifeline.Now Melbourne Indie Voices is running totally online. We all let a deep breath out to the image of a golden thread, “a beautiful sparkly network of connectivity”, as Exiner describes it.To refine the online choir delivery, Exiner has added our choir soundtrack to the livestream. Last week when we sang our parts at home, we didn’t feel so alone. It worked so well that when the applause came at the end of the recording, many of us felt like we were there, in the room together.Excited comments streamed on to the screen: “Yes!” “That sounded great!” “I feel like I’m surrounded by you beautiful choir people.” There were nearly 400 comments, likes, and even jokes, though the slight time lag can make comedy delivery difficult. (Knock, knock ... silence.)In our little community of singers, we can step away from the viral vortex, follow a beat, breathe in and breathe out. The repetition of singing phrases and melodies can give us a sense of control in our swirling lives.Other choirs are adapting to distancing too: Jane York’s Just Holler Choir has had live broadcast singalongs from a loungeroom. Astrid Jorgensen’s Pub Choir has stitched together a mass participatory video performance. Sydney’s Polyphony choir are hosting practices over Zoom. People are connecting while staying apart, using technology’s bridges.Melbourne Indie Voices still plans to record an album this year, somehow. Even if we are singing in dark times, we can turn our voices to the light,by the glow of our screens, surrounded by a community of hearts.If you know of a choir hosting practices, singalongs or other activities online, let us know in the comments."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a20c9644def0a022535742cd9b1afc8a8f09a760/0_6_1654_992/master/1654.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8f6ab8e470462c5c70228cd7a4c03ad3","title":"how mr motivator davina mccall lizzie webb and other fitness gurus stay healthy at home","story":"How do you stay active when the gyms are shut? Davina McCall, Lizzie Webb and others explain the secrets to staying motivatedThese are trying times. Children run between rooms as parents on video calls shush them in vain millennials in cramped house-shares attempt to carve out space to work from home. Gyms and leisure centres have closed, and elderly and vulnerable people may feel worried about venturing outside to exercise. So how can we stay active as we hunker down and ride out the coronavirus pandemic?During the coronavirus crisis, we have all got to stay motivated to work out. One way to do this is to focus on your blessings. Every day when you wake up, think of five reasons to be grateful.Then put your trainers on. Not your slippers. Walk around your house and put music on. Headbanging music, funky music – whatever gets you going. Now you’ve got your trainers on and your music pumping, you can have some fun. If you’re a young buck, start running on the spot. If you’re older, hold on to a chair or a work surface and bring your knees up and down in front of you. Now pretend you’re sitting on the loo. Then it’s time for squats! Lower yourself down, control your stomach, tighten your thigh muscles and squeeze it all in.For older people who aren’t as active, sit straight-backed in a chair and imagine there’s an orange between your shoulder blades. Now squeeze the juice so it runs down your back.If you have kids, hide things around the house for them to find. That will wear them out. Or ask them to lie on the floor and spell out the letters of the week in the air with their legs. If they knock over some of the furniture, it’s no bother. It’s all part of the fun. As long as they stay safe.When your kids are at home, it’s important they stay active. My son and I go for long walks with the dog – honestly, our dog has never been walked so much in her life! She’s beside herself. When things started getting really serious with coronavirus, I made a free fitness programme, Own Your Own Goals, for people to use. I wanted to do something to help. While we’re all still allowed out by the government, I’d recommend a power walk – on your own and far away from other people. Sunlight and fresh air are good for our mental health.Lots of people worry that they will annoy their neighbours if they exercise inside, but you can do most toning stuff inside without making any noise. Biceps curls and shoulder presses are good for toning. If you don’t have weights, improvise with a good old can of baked beans.There are so many things you can do in a plank. Mountain climbers (where you drive your knees into your chest in a plank position) or spider-mans (where you raise your right knee to your right elbow in a plank, then switch sides) are fantastic.During this pandemic, I’m going to be making sure that I have a daily routine. Without it, you lose purpose. Wake up at a reasonable hour, enjoy being able to spend more time with your family – and try to fit in 20 minutes of exercise every day. It will make you feel happier.One positive thing to come out of the coronavirus crisis is that people often have more time to focus on themselves and their bodies. But be sensible: if you aren’t a regular exerciser, don’t suddenly go mad on a programme. Ease in gently. There’s no rush. Every day, increase the number of repetitions or exercise for a little longer.I’d recommend exercising with the children – they’re going to be home with you, so why not? I’m a big fan of getting them to learn their times tables – but not sitting down at a desk. Instead, sit or stand the children opposite each other and have them throw a ball to one another while doing their times tables. The person who gets the highest is the winner.The best bit of kit in your house is always a chair. Hold on to the back of it at waist height, and use it as you would a ballet barre. Put your feet at hip-width apart and do squats. If you’re strong enough, hold the “barre” with one hand while squatting.If you’re not very mobile, there are lots of things you can do in a chair. Make sure you’re sitting with a straight back. Hug each knee to your chest, then put it down. You can even grab some bags of sugar or bottles of water to use as light weights: sit on the edge of the chair and do biceps curls.On TV-am, I would always make a point of saying: “Clear your space.” You don’t want to hurt yourself. I remember one viewer writing in to tell me that she was doing my exercises in a caravan. And, obviously, wear comfortable clothes. You want to have freedom of movement.Coronavirus has had an impact on my motivation to train – even I am having to use my own videos to motivate myself. I have been running live workouts on my YouTube channel, and yesterday I had 120 followers waiting to work out with me. I sat on the mat and told them the truth: I feel heavy, but I know that I’m going to feel better after we exercise together. And I did.Working out virtually with other people in real time is the best way forward, especially if you usually go to classes and find it hard to motivate yourself on your own. Make it social: arrange a virtual date with friends to train together and afterwards talk on FaceTime about how much you loved – or hated – it.If you can get your hands on some weights or kettlebells, I recommend weight-training at home. The resistance is beneficial for bone density and helps to reduce the effects of muscle loss, which is important as many of us are likely to be sedentary for long periods of time under lockdown.At the end of the day, we’re going through a global pandemic. No one gives a toss about abs. Aesthetics are out of the window. What you should think is: OK, movement is going to support my brain function, it’s going to help me feel better and release endorphins.Normally, you would exercise for long-term health. This is different. Now we are training to not get ill. The stronger and fitter you are, the more likely you will be to fight coronavirus off, and your recovery time will be shorter. You are less likely to end up in an intensive care unit bed, and if you do end up in one, more likely to get out of it sooner – freeing it up for someone else. So try to do something.There’s another good reason to exercise, which is that humans are inherently social animals. We depend on other people for our happiness, our wellbeing, advice and reassurance. Right now, we’re cut off from other people. So exercise is crucial to maintaining mental health. If you can, leave the house regularly and go for walks, but stay away from other people. Download a step counter on to your phone and aim for 10,000 steps a day. Or do a basic circuit at home. My only word of caution would be that your home is not a gym. Be careful. You don’t want to get injured and put the NHS under more strain.There’s a thing in geriatric medicine called pyjama paralysis. It’s when you admit older people to hospital, and they stay in bed all day in their pyjamas. It’s really bad for them: they lose muscle mass fast. So getting dressed in the morning is a good start.Walk up and down your stairs five times. If you have a garden, buy a skipping rope online and go outside and skip. Find a fitness YouTuber you like the look of, and copy their videos. It’s so easy to get caught up in the technical aspects of exercise: how much should I be doing and what should my heart rate be? Do I need the advice of a doctor? But it’s not complicated – just aim to get out of breath for a few minutes every day. That’s it.If you can, do a simple circuit of press-ups, sit-ups and squats. I stand by the view that something is much better than nothing: one press-up is better than none, and five are better than one. If you don’t know where to start, look up the Royal Canadian Air Force exercises. They were devised in the 1950s, and are just as relevant today. It’s a great set of movements."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d2943f011fbffa02dc27dc8ef7472b5195f6fc53/0_120_1600_960/master/1600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=66409515b1941e4a93ec7a6a93270a3c","title":"the day was full of joy and love how people are getting married while in lockdown","story":"Couples preparing to tie the knot have seen their plans wrecked by the global coronavirus outbreak. But from Zoom conferences to micro-ceremonies, love is finding a wayThe bride wore white and carried a bouquet of plastic flowers, from Amazon. The aisle was from Amazon, too, and so were the fairy lights strung around the chuppah. The wedding party was small: only immediate family and the rabbi. Although rain had been forecast, the weather held, and when 23-year-old student Eliana Amrami, from Chicago, married her boyfriend, 22-year-old Elliot Birn, in her parents’ garden, the sun was shining. As is customary during Jewish weddings, the bride and groom prepared to smash a glass underfoot.Unable to attend the wedding in person due to the coronavirus shutdown, the couple’s extended family and friends had driven to neighbouring streets, and dialled into the wedding on Zoom or caught it via a YouTube live stream. Cocooned in their cars a safe distance away, they watched on smartphone screens as the couple clasped hands and stamped on the glass. As it shattered, the sound of car horns filled the air. On a laptop, elderly relatives watching the ceremony smiled and waved.Amrami had initially planned to marry at the Chicago Hilton on 29 March. But on 12 March, the governor of Illinois, JB Pritzker, advised that all large events should be postponed until May. The prospect of having to wait was agonising. “We’re Orthodox Jews,” Amrami explains. “We haven’t lived together! We couldn’t wait. We were dying to get married.” After a night full of tears, the family decided: they would have a backyard wedding on Zoom. The rabbi was willing to do it, as long as it was outdoors.It was more perfect than Amrami could have hoped. “Before the wedding, I was so upset,” she says. “I couldn’t believe this was my life. Now I don’t regret it. It was so much better than I could have imagined.”If you have spent years planning your perfect wedding, the disruption caused by coronavirus can be a bitter pill to swallow. “I’m coming to terms with it now,” says Debbie Odukoya, 29, a clinical psychologist from London. She was supposed to marry her fiance, Oluchi, 33, over two days in Lagos, Nigeria, in April. Eight hundred guests were scheduled to attend the Nigerian ceremony, followed by a western wedding for 400 guests the following day. Organising not one, but two weddings was a considerable effort. “We spent a whole year literally planning,” Odukoya sighs.From the beginning of March, guests started pulling out – the airlines had cancelled their flights. But Odukoya still hoped the wedding could go ahead. Then on 18 March, the Nigerian government announced that anyone landing in the country would be subject to supervised isolation for 14 days. The wedding was in less than two weeks. It was over. “I had to go to work that day,” Odukoya says. “It was really hard trying to pull myself together, because I didn’t want to break down.”Odukoya is thankful that all her vendors and the venue have been willing to rearrange the wedding at no extra cost she hasn’t lost any money, apart from flights. And her friends have promised to re-book transport, when the time comes. “Everyone has been so nice about it,” she says.Gemma Finn, a 28-year-old communications worker from Uxbridge, London, narrowly avoided ending up out of pocket. She was due to marry her girlfriend, Ali, 28, on 15 May. On 11 March, they went to pay a deposit at the pub where they had been planning to hold their reception. Finn was ready to hand over the money – but Ali urged caution. “She said: ‘Maybe we should think about this,’” Finn says. It was the right decision. “I’m glad she’s the sensible one,” Finn jokes. “She saved us over £1,000.”“We were completely devastated,” James says. “Our wedding was cancelled. And then to face a huge bill ... To be told we are out of pocket for them cancelling our wedding is bizarre.” After a backlash from James and other couples in a similar predicament, the venue agreed to allow them to rebook. But the experience has been so stressful that James doesn’t want to get married there any more. “It’s left such a bad taste in our mouths,” he says.Elliot Metson, 30, an admin assistant from Bishop’s Stortford, Hertfordshire, was one of the last people to get married in the UK before the lockdown, the day before Boris Johnson announced the measures on 23 March. But getting married with the coronavirus pandemic hanging over you casts a pall over proceedings. In the days leading up to the wedding, people kept dropping out. Metson didn’t blame them. “We understood their concerns,” he says.Metson and his partner, Hannah, 31, approached the venue, a hotel. “We said: ‘How many more people who are important to us need to cancel before we say: ‘We need to reschedule this?’’” In the end Metson and Hannah got married that Sunday, as planned. As Hannah was getting ready on the morning of her wedding, more guests were texting her saying they couldn’t attend, due to health concerns. “It put a bit of a downer on things,” says Metson.In the end, just 40 people attended the wedding, about half of the confirmed guest list of 87. It definitely wasn’t ideal – due to the social-distancing guidelines, the Metsons spaced out their wedding guests so much that some tables were half empty – but they are sanguine. “I would have preferred to rearrange it, personally, and my wife would have as well,” he says. “But we don’t have any regrets. It was a nice day for everyone who did turn up and we’re happy to be married now.”For some, the lockdown has made them reassess what’s important. Isobel Burston, 25, a teacher from Weymouth, Dorset, was due to marry her fiance, Ian, 26, in April. On 16 March, the government banned gatherings of more than 10 people. Burston and Ian sat down to discuss the wedding, to which they had invited 120 guests. “We both had a little cry,” she says. “But we knew we couldn’t ask people to put their health at risk.” The venue agreed to postpone the wedding, at no cost. A few days later, reports began to emerge that a national lockdown could be imminent.“I turned to Ian and said: ‘I would like to marry you,’” Burston recalls. “‘How about this weekend?’ He looked at me like I was mad. And then we had this moment of realisation, like: if we want to marry, we have to do it now.” The following day, Ian called the registrar, who agreed to perform a ceremony at short notice. Their original venue gave them the use of a small room. Burston ordered an Asos dress for next-day delivery, and Ian raided their local supermarket for flowers.On 21 March, with only immediate family present and grandparents dialled in via FaceTime, the registrar married them. Afterwards, they ate a spread of quiche and sausage rolls that Burston’s mum had picked up from M\u0026ampS, and took some photos on the beach.“It sounds so cheesy, but as soon as I walked in and saw Ian there and our family, I thought: ‘What did I spend all this time worrying about?’” Burston says. “It felt super-irrelevant. What was present that day was joy and love. It didn’t feel like we’d missed out on anything. In a way, maybe it was more special.”For now, all plans of a honeymoon are on hold. “It’s an interesting way to start married life,” Burston jokes. “Spending 247 together in a tiny flat.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/73c880bd6b14ca6834e06b4d8ae203761269b13d/0_117_4276_2566/master/4276.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=349fc9fa4aa74e8120c7a9ec72a0da46","title":"the one change that worked share your coronavirus stories","story":"We want to hear about the biggest lifestyle change you have made as a result of the Covid-19 epidemicWe are living in extraordinary times and coronavirus has meant that for many life as we know it has changed exponentially in a matter of weeks.

But it is willing to consider following other European countries and implement a funding model “linked directly to an existing common household bill” such as an internet connection, council tax, or electricity supply.“This would be a significant change for the UK and we are not, at this stage, advocating it,” the corporation said in its submission. “It does however raise an interesting question as to whether the current system could be made much simpler, more efficient and more automated. We are open to exploring this further.”The consultation on whether to decriminalise non-payment of the licence fee closes on Wednesday, with the BBC warning that the initial cost of creating a new system where non-payment is enforced as a civil debt – similar to a utility bill – would be almost £300m.The former culture secretary Nicky Morgan launched the consultation on decriminalisation two months ago, in the aftermath of a rancorous general election campaign in which the BBC’s news output came under fire from across the political spectrum. At the time, Downing Street was picking a fight with the BBC, stopping ministers from appearing on major political programmes and warning of a forthcoming upheaval and a need to cut the corporation down to size.The approach has changed substantially since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, with Downing Street making peace with news outlets and the BBC – along with other broadcasters - attracting enormous audiences for its programmes featuring prime ministerial press conferences and providing public health advice.The corporation argued strongly that the existing criminal sanctions should remain in force until the BBC’s royal charter is renewed in 2027, arguing that – unlike a civil system – magistrates had the flexibility to impose appropriate fines that take into account an inidual’s circumstances.About 130,000 people were prosecuted in 2018 for non-payment of the licence fee, with the substantial majority being women who are more likely to live alone or be at home when enforcement officials knock on doors. Five people in England and Wales were ultimately sent to prison for failing to pay court-ordered fines.“The BBC is a universal service – one to which everyone contributes and everyone receives something in return,” said the BBC in its argument to maintain the current system. “Any system based on a universal contribution must have a sufficient deterrent and sanction to ensure that principle holds up and the system is fair to those who do pay, as well as those who don’t.”It also pointed out that the current system indirectly subsidised the court system, through the estimated £28m a year charged in magistrates’ fees to people prosecuted for non-payment.The BBC is already facing a financial black hole, having suspended this summer’s planned introduction of the licence fee for most over-75s by at least two months, to ensure older viewers do not feel threatened or cut off. Cuts to BBC News staffing levels have also been postponed, while the national lockdown has also led to the suspension of visits to homes by TV licensing officials, meaning evasion is likely to increase as people suspected of watching television without a licence are no longer being chased for payment.Many iniduals in the corporation view the lockdown as a chance to show ministers what a public service broadcaster can do for a country in crisis, especially with commercial media outlets facing a dire outlook due to a collapse in the advertising market."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c4c50bc74c564aa092e569aaad12790eca7ae06d/0_271_3601_2162/master/3601.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7776b247c246283858b203757143defc","title":"waxahatchee katie crutchfield getting sober birmingham alabama","story":"As she releases her superb fifth album, Alabama musician Katie Crutchfield shows us around her native Birmingham, and explains how sobriety opened up her songwritingKatie Crutchfield pulls up in her dad’s rugged Jeep outside my hotel in a suburb of Birmingham, Alabama. She grins when I voice my surprise at her ride. “I should have told you it was a ragtop with crazy tyres,” she says. It’s early March, and we head to a nearby coffee shop then she steers us into the city. As soon as I take out a notebook, the bumpy ride upends my pen. “Sorry,” she says. “I love driving it so much, but it’s a little wild.”With a licence plate repping the college football powerhouse Alabama Crimson Tide, the vehicle blends into Crutchfield’s home town. Her relationship to the place is more complex. One of the US’s sharpest and most acclaimed songwriters, she’s about to give me a tour of Birmingham as she viewed it as a teenager: through the lens of the underground punk scene. Now 31, Crutchfield about to release Saint Cloud, her fifth album as Waxahatchee, which finds her reexamining her southern roots with increased self-awareness. It’s one of the year’s most bewitching albums, the bristly indie rock for which she’s best known enhanced by country and folk, and the clarifying effect of new sobriety. “If you’re getting sober, you’re facing all of this stuff that has been shoved deep down and covered in booze for years,” she says. “And I’m like, oh my god, my brain is a scary place right now.”Crutchfield is the product of a fairly conventional white, southern, middle-class upbringing. When we pass the Alabama theatre, she notes that the historic movie palace once hosted a production of the Nutcracker in which she, her twin Allison and their younger sister tap-danced. The classic rock and country in the Crutchfield household fitted the atmosphere of an industrial city in the American deep south that had absorbed generations of formerly rural people and spilled into tree-lined suburbs. Crutchfield has fond recollections of the family going to see Shania Twain dazzle an arena.Turning next to 16th Street Baptist Church, she brings up an elementary school field trip to this site of an infamous white supremacist bombing during the civil rights struggle. She points out the memorial to the four slain African American girls. The public school curriculum made this seem as if it was an ugly but distant past. “We were taught, ‘Things used to be bad, and now it’s good,’” she says. But she eventually recognised that she was “from a place with a complicated history” and that that legacy was still very much present, defining how outsiders saw Birmingham.As teenagers, Katie and Allison shared the urge to rebel. They quit tap-dancing, swore off country music and used file-sharing to enable their developing tastes for grunge, the British invasion, indie, punk and riot grrrl. They made music in the basement, Katie as singer-guitarist and Allison on drums. Katie wryly admits she was “struggling with my country music past. I was like, ‘That’s my parents’ music. I don’t care. I like Bikini Kill.’”In a scene teeming with boys who preferred hardcore, she stood out singing Velvet Underground covers at all-ages club Cave 9, in the twins’ first band, the Ackleys. “How did I end up like that?” she marvels as she drives. “It wasn’t really set up for me to do that. A lot of this stuff is even more meaningful to me now, because there were a lot of things that feel a little happenstance.”Cave 9’s long-shuttered original location is on today’s sightseeing list. Crutchfield parks next to a decaying brick building. The glass front doors are papered over, but a small tear lets us see the balcony that faced the old stage. We go on past the railroad tracks where she drank with friends and darted out of the way of approaching trains the house dubbed the Dandy Dill where she and her roommates hosted shows, one of them wild enough to collapse the floor. “I did a lot of urban exploration in my youth, trying to break into weird, creepy warehouses,” she says.Eventually, she and Allison left Birmingham in search of a new scene, trying New York before settling in a house full of musicians, including other members of Allison’s band Swearin’, in Philadelphia. Katie’s solo project took shape when she went to write at the family’s rustic retreat in Alabama. She borrowed the name of nearby Waxahatchee Creek and collected her songs on 2012’s American Weekend, an album spiky and revealing in spirit but lo-fi in execution. It landed her at the vanguard of an acclaimed new wave of singer-songwriters bringing hushed intensity and emotional specificity to indie rock: Julien Baker, Mitski, Torres, Soccer Mommy and more.On subsequent Waxahatchee releases, she added sinew to her sound, always with musical contributions from Allison. She continued writing with a nerviness that felt uncomfortably unfiltered. (“And I will visualise a tragedy  And blame you for it.”) She noticed how it was sometimes interpreted like a literal transcription of a diary as opposed to consciously chiseled expression. “For so long, my music was always described as confessional,” she says. “That felt really gendered to me. I always felt that implies that there is no thought or art. Everything I ever write is thought through and laboured over.”Her work found its loudest form to date on her 2017 album Out in the Storm, her singing half-submerged in a brutal guitar attack, a musical approach that felt right to her in the aftermath of a breakup. “I was just so on edge, and you can hear that on the record,” she says over a Caribbean-style lunch. “It’s claustrophobic, there’s so much happening.”Ultimately, she decided that neither the punishing physicality of performing that music night after night (which contributed to her hearing loss), nor the boozy night-owl lifestyle she’d grown accustomed to were sustainable. “I’m a really productive person,” she says. “I’m at my best when I’m waking up early and getting a bunch of shit done and I’m dependable. I was watching alcohol make me not that. I would stay out really late, I would sleep in, I would feel like shit. I would be argumentative with everybody, I would procrastinate, I would forget to do things. It sounds so cheesy to say, but I was really not the best version of myself.” She clarified that it was “never anything crazy. I wasn’t like getting into car wrecks or anything like that.”After contemplating quitting alcohol for a few years, Crutchfield pulled the plug for good on tour in Barcelona: “I had a few crazy nights and decided: I don’t think I’m gonna do this any more.” As she entered a new phase of her life, she found value in looking back. That included a brief return to Birmingham, cut short by her decision to join her boyfriend, musician Kevin Morby, in Kansas City, and to immerse herself in the music she’d so emphatically rejected in her teens – not so much mainstream country, but the artful Americana of Lucinda Williams, Gillian Welch and post-80s Emmylou Harris.Covering Williams’s songs, Crutchfield noticed “my voice sounds really good when I go in that direction”. She readily came up with new, lilting melodies of her own, but struggled with other aspects of sober songwriting. “I feel like I keep chipping away at this authentic thing that’s down there somewhere,” she says. “Slowly but surely, I’m getting closer to it, and as I do that, lyrics become hard for me – the rhyme scheme becomes more important, the amount of syllables I use.”The songs on Saint Cloud describe knotty interior states and examine intense interactions from a reflective remove. Fire sets conflicted feelings against the scenery of a southern road trip. Halfway through the gently loping Ruby Falls, inspired by a friend who passed, her delivery is stoic yet sentimental: “Back home at Waxahatchee Creek  You know you got a friend in me.” Crutchfield finds it amusing that she’s been asked in a couple of recent interviews whether her life has become boring – as if exploring rootedness and committing to sobriety had shrunk her horizons, rather than opening new ones.Before the coronavirus outbreak forced the cancellation of shows, she was scheduled to headline Saturn, the city’s leading rock club, in April. It’s closed during the daytime, but she suggests we visit the attached cafe where she can get another coffee and show me the Real Alabama Music Hall of Fame. It’s in no way a formal institution. A collection of square, folk art portraits by Paul Cordes Wilm are slowly taking over wall space inside: foundational figures of jazz, country and R\u0026ampB the studio rats who created the Muscle Shoals sound scene lifers whose legends are strictly local. Crutchfield notes with casual pride that around the same time that folk revival icon Odetta’s likeness went up, she and Allison each received squares of their own.• Saint Cloud is out now on Merge Records."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db6ae56067649adb2103a33d4ba91a139a3ad021/2_0_5903_3543/master/5903.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4b23c12530242b06f8655c349abf527c","title":"looking for a distraction here are 25 of our favourite long reads","story":"If you feel like reading about something other than coronavirus – and filling some more time during lockdown – then e into a few of these highlights from the long read archiveWhen a drilling platform is scheduled for destruction, it must go on a thousand-mile final journey to the breaker’s yard.

From the plethora of TV shows on competing streaming platforms to the seemingly infinite choice offered by online music and gaming services, the wealth of new material being released each month is staggering. Yet when it comes to cultural consumption, audiences are increasingly choosing to seek out classic, safe bets – forgoing the next big thing in favour of the last big thing.According to UK media watchdog Ofcom, the single most-watched programme in the first quarter of 2019 was the 1990s sitcom Friends. In the US, the top Netflix spot has long been held by the US version of the Office, which first aired 15 years ago. Meanwhile at the box office, sequels and reboots abound. Last year’s top five grossing films in the UK included the remake of the Lion King, Toy Story 4, Frozen 2 and Star Wars: Episode IX – the Rise of Skywalker.Even computer gaming is stepping increasingly back into the past. Two of the biggest launches in recent years have actually been mini versions of the comparatively ancient 80s and 90s games consoles, Sega’s Mega Drive and Nintendo’s SNESNES. “Without a doubt, people are going back to the classics,” says Iain Simons, director of the National Videogame Museum in Sheffield. “They pioneered so many of the things we have today.”One obvious reason why audiences are opting for classic, safe bets is the sense of comfort they can provide in a world that feels increasingly precarious. This feeling of comfort isn’t simply a function of nostalgic familiarity, however. Today’s new TV shows often reflect our current dystopian mood and the fashion for grisly narrative plot twists and traumatic backstories. Think Black Mirror compared with Frasier.There are other reasons for playing it safe when it comes to pop culture. Partly, it can be about taking joy in simplicity amid the complexity of the world we live in. Our frantic pace of life makes spare time so rare that people are wary of not enjoying the little they have of it. “I can see the appeal in a safe bet, especially if you are going to spend a lot of money on tickets,” says Anna Smith, film critic, broadcaster and host of the all-female film review podcast Girls on Film.Likewise, Simons notes that there’s a beauty in the relative simplicity of older video games: “There’s something comforting about only having three lives in a game there are only so many hours in the day.”Nostalgic cultural consumption can also remove the all-too common problem of too much choice. “The overabundance of content can make people feel overwhelmed,” says Cristel Russell, a professor of marketing at Graziadio Business School, who has conducted several studies into people’s re-reading of stories and reconsumption of media. “It’s like going to a restaurant and the menu being 20 pages long. You’re probably just going to order something you’ve had before.”One of Russell’s studies found that revisiting cultural favourites is such a deliberate act – as opposed to a habit – that she coined the term “volitional reconsumption” to describe it. She also found that nostalgic culture can offer something that new works can’t: a form of self-discovery. “The thing you’re watching hasn’t changed, but you have,” explains Russell. “You’ve accumulated all this knowledge and experience, so you’re not looking at it through the same eyes. When you revisit it, you get to see how much you have changed as a person.”Revisiting pieces of classic cultural entertainment can also give us bonding social experiences. For instance, events such as Secret Cinema, which screens old favourites in specially-created immersive worlds, thrive on the feeling of community and belonging you get when you bring fans of a movie together to celebrate it. “I think one of the keys here is the community aspect: we love to watch a cherished film with others, and laugh and cry together,” says Smith. “In a society that feels increasingly less community driven, in many ways this is an outlet for a positive shared experience.”There are other possible psychological benefits to reconsuming cultural works. Erica Hepper, a lecturer in personality and social psychology at the University of Surrey, has researched the social emotion of nostalgia, including the reconsumption of works of art. One study involved letting participants choose an old, beloved song to listen to and then comparing their emotions with those of people who hadn’t done so. “Time and again, we found that people who listened to something that was nostalgic experienced all of these psychological boosts – they feel more connected to people, they feel better about themselves, they feel more optimistic,” says Hepper. “They also feel more motivated to achieve their goals. So nostalgia isn’t about being stuck in the past, it actually looks to the future.”Indeed, one of Russell’s studies showed that reconsuming cultural works can even involve more intense cognitive processes than watching something for the first time. To test this, subjects were made to wear eye-tracking equipment while watching a black-and-white Russian film twice. The equipment monitored both the movement of their eyes and pupil dilation, which can indicate the intensity of the cognitive effort they were undergoing. “Sure enough, on the second viewing, your eye gaze goes to different parts of the screen – you are taking it in in a different way,” says Russell.She found that people were watching in a way that suggested they appreciated the film much more as a work of art on the second viewing. For instance, they were looking at all the creative details rather than just following the plot. Moreover, she found that people’s pupils were more dilated while doing so. “When you rewatch something, the cognitive effort involved changes. You are hyper-responsive – all of your senses are on. It is a much more intense process than watching something for the first time.”That intensity might seem counterintuitive, given how comforting nostalgic pop culture can feel. But as the trend itself illustrates, opting for comforting pop culture isn’t a passive act.

Alexi Duggins explains why playing it safe is a smarter step Has there ever been a more underrated word in the English language than “safe”? For something that is fundamentally a good thing, people can be weirdly dismissive about it. Eyes are rolled at workplace health and safety as though it’s somehow uncool to not lose a hand to poorly maintained machinery. Romcoms lazily wield it as an unflattering cliche: “Oh, I don’t know. My award-winning humanitarian of a partner is perfect in every conceivable way – but they’re just so … safe, you know?”Meanwhile, there’s no bigger cliche than being edgy just for the sake of trend-chasing. Over the past two decades, the fad for extreme sports has reached (and plummeted from) ever-crazier heights. Our fetishisation of high-risk, high-wire living has even spread to dining, with foodies flocking to increasingly ridiculous eateries simply because they look cool on social media. How many times have our friends told us they tried out a Hot New Place that wasn’t actually very good – while we pity their gullibility and coo soothing words such as: “Oh what a shame that insect-based menu wasn’t actually that delicious.”Spurred on by the peer pressure of social media and clickbait articles about patently daft new trends, people all too often act as if they’re playing a gigantic game of chicken. When they aren’t posting smiling holiday selfies from the post-nuclear wreckage of Chernobyl, they’re braving the latest Insta grooming trends that you just have to try – even if they leave you looking like you’ve had your eyebrows rubber stamped on to your face.The 21st century seems so unhinged, it feels as though it’s drastically in need of a friend to confiscate its phone and force-feed it a sensible mug of Horlicks. So as we enter a new decade, it’s time to wake up to the obvious truth that sometimes playing it safe might be the smarter option. Sure, it won’t necessarily make for great social media content or keep trend forecasters in business, but the tried and tested route at least offers proven enjoyment.But there are things out there that are just unfailingly brilliant – melted cheese, beaten-track holidays, every Bill Murray film ever made. These are just some of the reasons that “safe” should be something we embrace. Another is the obvious fact that safety keeps you, well, safe. Just consider all the revolutionary advances in car safety technology.The safe option is one that doesn’t lead to you royally screwing up. It’s a guaranteed good time. It’s not being afraid to use your critical faculties, shun desperate fads and to do something that you genuinely know to be great. It’s suiting yourself, no matter the pressure to do the same stuff that everyone else is talking about.It isn’t always easy. But increasingly, playing it safe is the boldest thing you can do.We’re under so much pressure to be edgy these days that we often overlook safer, more rewarding options. Here are some user-friendly safety tips to help you navigate modern lifeBinge-watching TVWe might be living through an extended golden age of television, but the explosion in edgy programming has also given us an awful lot of duds. So it can be all too easy to make a habit out of wasting 12 hours of your life. Protect yourself from another bad long-term relationship with a TV show by learning when to quit. Studios like to make a big splash on their opening, so if the first episode sucks, it isn’t going to get better from there on in. But what happens when you’re, say, four episodes in? One way to develop the discipline to quickly give up is to think of your time as an economic investment. Just because you’ve invested four hours, it makes no sense to invest more if there’s no likely payoff. Economists call this the “sunk cost fallacy”. Instead, focus on the future time you’ll gain rather than on the time you’ve already sunk.The beaten trackIt’s easy to have that once-in-a-lifetime holiday: go somewhere you’ll never, ever want to visit again. Plenty of people willingly do this in the name of adventure or to prove their alpha credentials. But there is much to be said for the relaxing and restorative joy of the safe, well-trodden path – such as comfortable beds, rainproof roofs and nice food. The trick to taking your first step back to the beaten track is to refrain from judging other people for choosing the tourist trail and package holidays – then hopefully you’ll stop judging yourself.Foodie warningSocial media and TV cookery shows have conspired to make food even more of a feast for our eyes than our taste buds. But trying to assess food’s deliciousness with your eyes is like trying to appreciate music with your mouth. It’s important to take food-based Instagram posts with a pinch of (figurative) salt, as some restaurants try to capitalise on these trends by creating dishes based around how they’ll look on social media. Avoid regrets by engaging in real conversation: if you see friends posting about having eaten somewhere that looks great, get in touch to check they actually rated the taste of the meal. Just because someone shares a pretty photo, it doesn’t make it a food recommendation.Before you startup, stopThe digital revolution has fuelled such a fixation with startups that it almost feels de rigueur to quit your job and start your own venture. Alternatively, you might be tempted to devote yourself full-time to your side hustle. Before you consider whether or not to take the plunge, one question you should ask yourself is whether the thing that you’re really fetishising is the idea of being a risk-taker rather than the venture itself. So be sure to scrutinise your real motivations. For instance, are you following your passion or your ego? And bear in mind that sometimes our egos are actually fuelled by feelings of insecurity.Savvy tech is safe techEach month brings a cacophony of new digital bells and whistles and it can be easy to simply dismiss them. So how do you sift useful tech from pointless tech? One tip is to ask whether or not the new app, gadget or feature will save you time, give you pleasure or make you safer. The latter question often gets overlooked. But when it comes to developments such as smart homes and in-car technology – including driver monitoring and assistance systems – making things safer is actually the main point.Safety mattersYour world matters to us.

And these devices are already proving their worthWho hasn’t found their attention straying behind the wheel? Modern life is riddled with distractions that fight tooth and nail for our attention – whether it’s noisy children, garish adverts, tiredness, traffic cameras, personal pressures, endless to-do lists or those digital devices and social media notifications that we forgot to switch to silent. We always seem to be spreading our attention too thinly or are exhausted from having to think 10 different thoughts.This is one reason why the focus of vehicle safety design has shifted in recent years. Whereas in the past it was about applying materials and design to mitigate damage to occupants in crashes, it’s now about using the latest technology to prevent accidents happening in the first place. In short, it’s about cars that can take control when you have lost it.The shift in emphasis is often referred to as a switch from passive safety systems to active safety systems. Indeed, when it comes to cars, making things safer is one of the main drivers of tech developments. Advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) can aid concentration and alertness and encompass features including automated braking that relies on technologies such as radar, cameras and lasers. “ADAS has been a step change,” says Andrew Morris of Loughborough University’s Transport Safety Research Centre. “There was a consensus that human fallibility is hard to eradicate and that all passive systems can do is reduce damage. At that point, the focus shifted to prevention. New technology offers solutions in the shape of sensing and automation, which is a better philosophy because it also protects vulnerable road users like pedestrians and cyclists.”Japanese carmaker Subaru has been at the forefront in the development of ADAS since 2013, when it introduced its “second pair of eyes”, the EyeSight system. This uses two sophisticated colour cameras mounted inside the car on the upper edge of the windshield above the rearview mirror. The system is capable of processing accurate stereo images to identify vehicles travelling in front, as well as obstacles, traffic lanes and other objects such as pedestrians.Using images generated by the cameras, EyeSight can run a suite of six ADAS:As with all the company’s core safety tech, EyeSight is continually evolving. For example, the Forester e-BOXER and Levorg now feature the EyeSight assist monitor, which provides a heads-up display of EyeSight system warnings for drivers to see more clearly.EyeSight is fitted as standard to all Subaru models, save the BRZ sports car. In 2019, the Forester e-BOXER achieved the maximum five-star Euro NCAP rating for safety and was declared “Best in Class 2019 in the Small Off-roadMPV Class”.Other Subaru safety systems include its Driver Monitoring System, which can detect the driver’s eyes closing or looking away for an extended period of time and trigger audio and visual warnings. This could be a potential lifesaver given that, according to Thatcham research centre, at least one fatal sleep-related crash occurs every day in the UK. Subaru’s Driver Monitoring System won the Technology Award at the 2020 What Car? Awards. What Car? praised the system, calling it “the most advanced of its kind”. In the tests, it proved to be more accurate at identifying when concentration was lost, compared with other manufacturer systems.Reverse Automatic Braking (RAB) and Subaru Rear Vehicle Detection also use sensors to spot potential objects behind the vehicle or in blind spots and RAB can even apply the brakes to avoid a collision.While driver distraction can be lethal, education and legislation – like the law banning handling a mobile phone – can only go so far.Full autonomy is some way off but, as of 2022, new safety technologies will become mandatory in cars and vans under EU law and are likely to be adopted in the UK – specifically lane-keeping assistance and advanced emergency braking. This will contribute to the long-term goal dubbed “Vision Zero”, of moving close to zero fatalities and serious injuries.But is eradicating all accidents possible through technology?“It’s very aspirational certainly and hard to achieve in the foreseeable future,” admits Morris. “However it’s a sound concept, a safe-system approach, which says if an accident happens for whatever reason we blame the system rather than the driver. And these systems will definitely become more effective as they are refined.”Safety mattersYour world matters to us.

Given that the nurses on the frontline risk becoming the patients, coronavirus presents a double whammy. This “absolutely demonstrates what we’ve been saying for a long time”, she says.“I don’t think you could ever say that we could get all the people we need for a pandemic, but it has put us more on the backfoot than we might have been if there’d been the proper investment.”Beasley, who is also chair of the London region of Health Education England, points to the fact that the pace of growth has stepped up in recent months.Knowing that something needed to be done about nursing numbers, Boris Johnson made an election pledge for 50,000 more nurses by 2024-25. But the shine soon came off amid accusations of double counting when it emerged that over a third of the figure factored nurses already in the job. Although the government announced an annual grant of at least £5,000 for healthcare students, which will kick in from September 2020, critics say this doesn’t go far enough since tuition fee costs will remain a barrier for many. That was before Covid-19 overtook events and it was all hands on deck. To help cope with the crisis, final-year nursing students in England have been asked to join the ranks, and a call-out for experienced hands has seen 5,605 former nurses and midwives come back. It’s a sensible move and one that Beasley very much welcomes, but she doubts that the former nurses coming to help with the pandemic intend to return permanently.It’s down to the government to invest better financial support for nursing students and a more conducive environment for staff already in the workplace, says Beasley. And she doesn’t just mean regarding working conditions and pay – the starting salary for a nurse is £24,214 – but ensuring that nurses can further develop their skills and careers. She also makes the case for the need for nursing practice to change so that we can “make the most of the nurses that we have”. This means allowing nurses to work to the top of their proficiency, supported by other colleagues such as nursing associates and healthcare assistants, and expecting more patients to manage their own health, including using basic technology. “It’s happening in parts of the health service, but we need to push that much more.”Beasley completed her own nurse training as far back as 1965, yet her interest in nursing shows no sign of waning. Since retiring as chief nursing officer, she has held a number of non-executive posts, and has been a trustee of the Burdett Trust for Nursing for nine years.The charity, which grants funding to support nurse-led innovation, is also responsible for footing the £500,000 core costs for Nursing Now – a three-year global campaign to raise the profile and status of nursing worldwide, which concludes at the end of this year. As chief nurse, Beasley pressed home the importance of clean hands during the battle against hospital-acquired methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in the early noughties. The initiative was very much nurse-led, she says. “Most doctors didn’t believe that it could really make any difference to MRSA because it was a byproduct of modern medicine, and consequently they slightly stepped aside,” Beasley recalls. “Obviously they then came on board.” She is pleased that awareness about handwashing, and the use of sanitisers in hospitals in battling infection are now the norm. But they are only part of the story in tackling the latest bug on the block.There is a “big challenge” in getting testing kits and protective equipment to hospitals to keep staff safe. “The equipment is getting through, but that needs to be sustained and it needs to be done faster.”Health and safety also means that staff should not be doing 12-14 hour shifts “day after day after day”. She adds: “No matter if you’re a cross between Mother Teresa and the Angel Gabriel, you’re not going to be able to sustain that.”“When all of this finishes, which one day it will, society will look back and say of both nurses and doctors: ‘We need these folks. We can’t just wait until something awful happens and then quickly ramp up the numbers.’” Status: Married with three sons.Education: Westcliff high school for girls, Southend-on-Sea, Essex.Career: 2004-12: chief nursing officer, Department of Health 2003-04: partnership development director, NHS Modernisation Agency 2002-03: head of development and nursing, Directorate of Health and Social Care 1998-2002: regional director of nursing and operational development, NHS London 1996-98: regional nurse director, North Thames 1994-96: acting regional nurse director, North Thames Regional Health Authority 1990-94: chief nurse, Riverside Health Authority 1990-91: acting chief executive, Riverside Health Authority 1987-90: director of community nursing, Hammersmith \u0026amp Fulham 1981-87: community services manager, Ealing Health Authority 1978-81: district nurse, Ealing 1969-78: career gap to raise three sons 1965-68: staff nursejunior sister, Royal London hospital 1962-65: nurse training, Royal London hospital.Public life: Trustee, the Burdett Trust for Nursing chair of the Florence Nightingale Museum chair, London region, Health Education England chair of council, University of Buckingham."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/087b17987e9930074e6dce859b7cdad0831abefb/0_0_4513_2708/master/4513.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=da948b26c4aa74c615e8a5a4b8573f02","title":"ecb could delay the hundred 61m cricket aid package coronavirus","story":"The England and Wales Cricket Board has given its strongest hint yet that the launch of the Hundred may have to be delayed until 2021. Announcing a £60m rescue package for the domestic game, the chief executive, Tom Harrison, said the sport’s “core audience” would be the priority amid what he described as “the biggest challenge the ECB has faced in its history”.The prospect of a significant part of the 2020 season being lost appears to have focused minds, with one upshot being a marked shift in the rhetoric surrounding the flagship 100-ball competition. “It is at times like this when you go back to what is really important,” Harrison said via conference call. “We are going to have county fans who won’t have seen any cricket, players sitting around. All of our decisions are based on those factors.”As a matter of urgency, the ECB is exploring the possibility of staging international matches behind closed doors. The chief operating officer, David Mahoney, is liaising with the government on safety matters while the director of events, Steve Elworthy, is exploring the logistical side, including chartering aircraft and quarantining entire hotels.The governing body has announced an immediate stimulus package of £40m to support counties and clubs struggling with cashflow. In addition, £20m in grants and interest-free loans will be available for recreational clubs over the coming weeks.This will see the early release of ECB handouts for May to July, as well as the suspension of international staging fees for the next four months. In the longer term the ECB is exploring a range of wider cost-cutting measures, with the possibility that some staff may be placed on temporary leave via the government’s furlough scheme. Harrison will be taking a pay cut, although contracted England players will not be forced to do so.Harrison promised “more pain ahead” if a substantial part of the season cannot be played and promised that the burden would be shared across the game. He also responded to criticism that the ECB, whose cash reserves dropped to just £11m in the most recent set of financial accounts, could have prepared better. “There are very few businesses that are prepared to take a situation where they’re suddenly generating zero,” he said. “On a risk register that’s something that is very difficult to plan for.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3bbd576995c2d8840c819dcf83971a3787b491e0/0_0_4670_2803/master/4670.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c3834c27fb448e68e6526470533ed36d","title":"rory mcilroy interview golf portrush the open masters tiger woods","story":"The world No 1 has been undergoing a resurgence since missing the cut at his home Open and feels adversity has helped his game Rory McIlroy turned responses to personal adversity into an art form long ago. His Masters capitulation of 2011 was followed up by winning the US Open. A courtroom appearance against his former management and the high-profile cancellation of a wedding preceded the hitting of professional heights.McIlroy was at it again last autumn. Five weeks after missing the cut at the Open - and not any Open - he took delivery of the FedEx Cup and its $10m bounty.He has enough perspective to realise the coronavirus crisis means golf is insignificant now and has joined a social media campaign to that end but, in a purely sporting sense, he must rue this hiatus. We will never know how far McIlroy’s rebound from the gloom of Royal Portrush last July would have taken him in the context of April 2020 and the Masters. Evidence suggested this was his finest chance to complete the grand slam of major titles.His consistency was rewarded with a return to the top of the world rankings in February. “I don’t think I’ve ever felt this comfortable with all facets of my game,” McIlroy said before sport shuddered to a halt.We speak a number of weeks before the coronavirus takes hold. McIlroy adopts self-deprecation on being reminded of his sentiments 12 months ago the Open’s visit to Northern Ireland for the first time since 1951 was dominating his thoughts. “How did that work out?” asks the 30-year-old with a smile.“As dejected as I was after Portrush … It was a gradual build until I got back to the top spot in the world. That might not have happened if Portrush hadn’t turned out as it did. I had to take a long, hard look at myself. I needed to press the reset button and that might not have happened had I finished 12th or 10th. It was a huge catalyst for me to change a few things. I’ve been disciplined and worked hard.”The grisly details from Ireland’s north coast will live long in the memory of anyone who witnessed them. McIlroy watched his first shot fly out of bounds. Backed by vociferous support, he came so close to surviving for the weekend but an opening round of 79 proved fatal.He was close to tears during Friday interviews, with the complex relationship between a global star and his homeland laid bare. Christmas spent back in Holywood was “a little bit different” as a consequence.“I have always felt like I’ve been relatable and approachable,” he says. “I think there was a thing back home where people didn’t feel that way about me any more. Because of what I went through at Portrush, maybe to show that vulnerability, people could relate to me a little more again. It’s a weird one.“When someone becomes who I have … I play all over the world and am a very recognisable sportsperson. I come from such a small place, I don’t know if people think you get above your station and forget where you are from? I said it at the time, I forgot how much the place and the people mean to me.”McIlroy was encouraged to loosen the shackles that naturally tighten as a career plays out so publicly. “I’ve nothing to lose,” he says. “Falling flat on your face in front of your home people, at a tournament you’ve been thinking about for 10 years, that’s the worst that can happen. So what have I got to lose after already experiencing that? Nothing else can top that in terms of disappointment, so let’s go for it.”In normal circumstances McIlroy would now be in the midst of Masters mayhem but he regularly emphasises the psychological distance he puts between himself and tilts at history. Spend all winter thinking of Augusta? No chance.“Why would you? I’ve never really done that. I don’t really think about tournaments until I get there. What’s the point? I don’t see the point in over-analysing it.McIlroy is equally candid when discussing his emotions at Augusta last year. He was frustrated at not being competitive, a feeling intensified by the prospect of answering questions about Tiger Woods’s epic win for months to come. The cloud lifted sharply.“I wanted to get out of there,” he says. “It had been a disappointing week, I wanted to get home. I removed myself from it and thought: ‘Jesus, this is unbelievable.’ The longer Tiger is at the top of the game, the better it is for all of us. I messaged him. Anytime I win a tournament or have a chance, he is the first one to text me. All the time. So I always make sure if he is doing anything, that I’m right there.”The pre-Masters stories around McIlroy had been amusing. The admission that meditation and mindfulness were now part of his routine raised eyebrows. He seemed a tad baffled. “Once I get into things I really get into things. I enjoy reading, I enjoy self-help, I enjoy psychology. I can be portrayed as anything, I don’t care. I know who I am.”It seems astonishing to think nine years have passed since he threw up his hands in despair during rough weather at Royal St George’s. The Open is scheduled to return to the Kent course this year but is shrouded in doubt. “I was a lot younger and back then I wasn’t good at embracing a challenge or adversity,” McIlroy says.Golf has missed McIlroy in that major-winning scene. The US PGA marks the last of his four triumphs. There are mitigating circumstances but they matter not, including to the player himself. “I am obviously good enough, I can win World Golf Championships and FedEx Cups. If we played 100-round tournaments I would come out on top every time as shown by my stroke average, strokes gained and stats. But tournaments are over four. It’s putting those four together.”McIlroy may be afforded this year’s Masters shot in the autumn. It is such a shame - relatively of course - that for now he is denied the opportunity when his form is so formidable. The grin returns when he contemplates whether any aspect of Portrush can be directly relevant at Augusta National. “At least if I hit it left off that tee, I’ll be all right …” The thrill will be in standing there in the first place."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29c046df2d367b7fd1bb33d21d364dc61d86300f/0_44_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4977c756927a423985d265406341e35e","title":"a zoologists view of tiger king a crass expose that could do some good","story":"The smash-hit documentary lets the murder-mystery take centre stage. But it also cunningly conceals a powerful message about the cruelty of small-scale zoosThe “man with questionable fashion sense inflicts abuse on cats” category of true-crime TV has a new monarch: the Tiger King himself, Joe Exotic. This seven-part true-crime doc is a smash hit for Netflix, and that’s no surprise – it’s arresting, gripping, horrifying and jaw-dropping in equal measure. To parrot Mrs Merton: oh Netflix, what drew you to the story of the polyamorous, power-ballad singing, gun-toting, murderous tiger-collector Joe Exotic?Yet, many fans of big cat conservation had hoped that Tiger King might have been something else. All the talk was that this would do for the US’s captive tigers what Blackfish did for captive marine mammals. Finally, an exposé on those that keep tigers and other big cats as pets those that breed said cats for profit those that keep big cats in totally ill-suited environments. Appetites were whetted. So, were our expectations met?The good news is that, in its early stages, the show did plenty right, exploring the swap-meets and the “collector-mania” that many in this industry seem to possess. And it didn’t hold back in exposing the suffering of these poor animals. Many of Joe Exotic’s 200 or more tigers are shown pacing their cells. They pant. They stare idly. Incredibly, it seems they occasionally live off handouts from a local Walmart. This was heartbreaking to see.But there were problems with the show, too. There was a distinct lack of independent commentators on the tigers and why Exotic’s behaviour was, to say the least, reprehensible. The show lacked someone to explain that “good” zoos have standards for housing captive tigers (here are the Association of Zoos and Aquarium’s guidelines, for instance) nobody to explain why tigers being forced to give birth to cubs in tiger mills (sometimes producing litters three times a year) to provide for the public’s appetite for tiger cubs is deeply unnatural, disturbing and unethical. At one point, Tim Stark, the owner of a roadside zoo, Wildlife in Need, argues that breeding captive tigers in the US is just what we need to do to get them off the endangered list. This point, though grossly misleading, goes largely unchallenged.The truth is that not a single one of these captive tigers would be suitable for release back into the wild. Their genetic history is now marked by enforced inbreeding over many generations. The white tigers (featured throughout all seven episodes) are a case-in-point: this genetic strain is prone to strabismus, a condition that causes tigers to cross their eyes when stressed. White tigers are also more prone to club foot, kidney problems or a twisted neck. It would be catastrophic were they ever to breed with wild tigers.In the early stages, the show does lean on one expert for these sorts of scientific insights. That expert is Joe Exotic’s adversary Carole Baskin, owner of Big Cat Rescue. The trouble with Carole is that, by episode three, she is well and truly thrown under the bus for the sake of story, with the introduction of the controversy over her missing millionaire husband.And the show, rather conveniently, gives a free pass to the source of this vile industry’s funds: the people that are happy to pay $10 to have their photo taken with tiger cubs or who visit Joe Exotic’s park and roadside zoos like it. These punters (some of whom no doubt are Netflix subscribers) generate enormous revenue for these enterprises, sometimes more than $1m each year. Educate them, one could argue, and you cut off an entire income stream for Joe Exotic and people like him. Yet there they are, in the background of many shots throughout Tiger King, grinning for their tiger cub photo shoots or pootling around gift shops, inadvertently (and one hopes, unknowingly) funding the continued abuse of tigers at the hands of Joe Exotic and his cronies.If you were hoping for Blackfish, you will be sorely disappointed. Instead, this an entirely different – perhaps more watchable – beast. Netflix’s most masterful trick is that, with this show, it has packaged up an important animal welfare issue into a true-crime maelstrom, machine-tooled to keep us coming back for the next episode. For this reason alone, millions upon millions of people around the world are waking up to this abuse of big cats in a way that a serious, more thorough documentary simply wouldn’t have been able to achieve.Anyone interested in how to engage the masses in the ethical treatment of animals should watch and learn.

What are the risks of handling packages and groceries?More people are staying indoors to avoid contact with people potentially infected by Covid-19. But in light of a recent report from the US’s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that said RNA from the virus that causes Covid-19 was found in the Diamond Princess ship 17 days after its passengers had left, what are the risks of handling packages, groceries and what scientists call “high-touch” surfaces?Dr Julia Marcus: A CDC investigation of the cruise ship found evidence of viral RNA in cabins that hadn’t yet been cleaned. But to be clear, that just means the virus was detectable – not that it was viable or that contact with those services would have been able to infect someone. (Editor’s note: RNA, or ribonucleic acid, carries the virus’s genetic information.)Dr Akiko Iwasaki: It just means that there are parts of the virus that still remain. The virus needs many other components to be intact. If you have bits and pieces of RNA, that’s not going to make a virus, you need an entire intact genome. Just because you had a little piece of RNA doesn’t mean that there’s an infection.Marcus: The New England Journal of Medicine just published a study that tested how long the virus can remain stable on different kinds of surfaces within a controlled laboratory setting. They found that it was still detectable on copper for up to four hours, on cardboard for up to 24 hours, and on plastic and steel for up to 72 hours.But it’s important to note that the amount of virus decreased rapidly over time on each of those surfaces. And so the risk of infection from touching them would probably decrease over time as well.Marcus: As far as we know right now, people are much more likely to be infected by close contact with an infected person than by touching a contaminated surface. That said, it’s still important to be conscious of what we’re touching, especially high-touch surfaces, and be careful about cleaning our hands after touching things. For example, public transit or grocery stores and places where there tend to be a lot of people.Marcus: It’s a low risk, but it’s possible that if someone is delivering a package to your house and they are sick, that may be a route for transmission. I would recommend that any time something new comes into your household, be conscious of washing your hands after handling it.Iwasaki: There’s definitely a possibility of contamination, but it’s much more likely that the outer cardboard itself will come into contact with a lot more people than what’s inside. And if it takes days to get to your home, whatever virus that was inside will be deactivated already."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0161bbba05de1f9db2321260d44ed7b1a89d18c3/0_27_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=af4f1bb07a5edef0896de0fe29b254f8","title":"are you cohabiting because of coronavirus share your stories","story":"We’d like to hear from people who have unexpectedly moved in together due to the coronavirus lockdown, and from partners who’ve had to remain apart As measures to restrict the spread of coronavirus force people to stay at home, couples who live separately have had to decide whether to move in together or remain apart for the duration of the measures.Because of the short notice of the lockdown announcement, others may have had to remain at a house which isn’t their usual home, or with people they don’t usually live with.We’d like to hear from those who’ve unexpectedly moved in together, or those who have decided to remain apart.Are you living with your new in-laws?

Sinocare, a biotech company in Changsha last week gathered employees in a park, each standing a meter apart, and urged them to remove their face masks.“The war against this epidemic has reached a new stage. We must return to normal … Take off your masks and let your dreams soar!” its chairman and CEO, Li Shaobo, shouted, according to an article posted on the city government’s website.In Wuhan, as the city marked its first full week with no new infections, shopping malls reopened and residents trickled out from their homes. On Tuesday, Ma Xiaowei, director of the National Health Commission, said that the country had contained the virus, with Wuhan reaching a milestone of 63,000 Covid-19 patients discharged.But the road to recovery has not been without bumps. Fugong fuchan (“resuming work, resuming production”), the government mantra of the past few weeks, has proceeded in fits and starts. Officials have struggled to restart the economy after an unprecedented nationwide shutdown, while also trying to prevent another outbreak.Cinemas, briefly reopened with plans to lure customers back with Harry Potter in 3D, were ordered to shut again. In Shanghai, indoor tourist attractions have again been suspended. The city of Jinzhou, in Liaoning province, said on Monday that clubs, karaoke bars, internet cafes and any cultural venue “where people gather” could not reopen. Businesses that had opened their doors again were told to suspend operations immediately.Sichuan province abruptly ordered all entertainment venues to shut, interrupting karaoke bar patrons mid-song. One resident wrote online of the experience: “I was halfway through before I was told to stop immediately. At least I got to sing for a bit.”While officials say the virus has been beaten, not everyone appears to believe it. Last week, after authorities lifted restrictions in Hubei province, the centre of the outbreak, clashes broke out when residents were blocked from entering the neighbouring province of Jiangxi. Videos posted on social media showed crowds walking toward a line of riot police, overturning police cars and shouting: “Hubei, let’s go!”Throughout the outbreak, analysts have advised watching what Chinese authorities do in response to the outbreak rather than what top officials say. Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s visit to Wuhan in March, his first since the outbreak began in December, was seen as a major turning point.But officials have not yet rescheduled the country’s delayed annual parliamentary meeting, a key political event. While schools have begun to reopen, with middle and high school students in several provinces returning to class on Monday for the first time since January, the ministry of education on Tuesday said the national college entrance exam would be delayed by one month.Authorities say the country is on the right track but caution local governments not to let up their guard. In response to growing public concern over asymptomatic patients, which have not been counted among the official number of confirmed infections, China’s health commission said on Tuesday it would begin including those cases.While cities are loosening some restrictions, they are tightening others. City officials in Beijing ordered residents to cancel travel plans that might lead to them bringing infections back to the city. On Tuesday, China reported 48 new infections, all travellers entering the country from overseas, reversing four days of declines.In one compound in Shijingshan district, staff installed an “intelligent doorbell” on the home of a resident recently back from Hubei province to monitor his home quarantine. “It doesn’t mean we don’t trust him, it is just a requirement of ensuring strict supervision,” one of the community workers told the Global Times."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7200859fb487792e1336e456cb1a1b0c126614c/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=2703eda6c4eb79ac8c11ea9b07ca2183","title":"coronavirus symptoms should i call doctor covid 19","story":"What are the symptoms caused by the Covid-19 virus, how does it spread, and should you call a doctor?It is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has transferred to humans from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.No. In the UK, the NHS advice is now that anyone with symptoms should stay at home for at least 7 days. If you live with other people, they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home. This applies to everyone, regardless of whether they have travelled abroad.In the UK, you should look on the dedicated coronavirus NHS 111 website for information. If you get worse or your symptoms last longer than seven days, you should call NHS 111. People will no longer be tested for the virus unless they are in hospital.Many countries have imposed travel bans and lockdown conditions in order to try and halt the spread of the virus. You should check with your local authorities for the latest advice on seeking medical assistance.China’s national health commission confirmed human-to-human transmission in January.As of 31 March, more than 780,000 people have been infected in more than 170 countries, according to the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering.There have been over 37,800 deaths globally. Just over 3,000 of those deaths have occurred in mainland China, where the coronavirus was first recorded in the city of Wuhan. Italy has been hardest hit, though, with over 11,500 fatalities, and Spain has seen more than 7,700 deaths. The US now has more confirmed cases than any other country – over 160,000. Many of those who have died had underlying health conditions, which the coronavirus complicated.More than 166,000 people are recorded as having recovered from the coronavirus.Another key unknown is how contagious the coronavirus is. A crucial difference is that unlike flu, there is no vaccine for the new coronavirus, which means it is more difficult for vulnerable members of the population – elderly people or those with existing respiratory or immune problems – to protect themselves. Hand-washing and avoiding other people if you feel unwell are important."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6dee53ed3a9f5ab0dac3511d8dd5300f66faf65/0_0_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6545e252bfa8f09bf05d37da87ef68ec","title":"coronavirus uk how many confirmed cases in your area","story":"Latest figures from public health authorities on the spread of Covid-19 in the United Kingdom.

A five-member council of state would be selected, with two members chosen by the opposition, two by Maduro’s Socialist party, and the fifth member picked by the other four. The military high command would remain in place.“The hope is that this set-up promotes the selection of people who are very broadly respected and known as people who can work with the other side,” the US special representative for Venezuela, Elliott Abrams, told the Associated Press.The US and EU would then lift sanctions on the current leadership. Broader sanctions on the country’s oil business would be lifted after all foreign forces had left the country. All sanctions would be lifted after free elections, to be held within six to 12 months.The proposal comes five days after the US indicted Maduro and top members of his government and army for drug trafficking and money laundering, and as Venezuela faces blanket sanctions, a collapse in the price of oil, its main export, and the coronavirus pandemic, with a crippled health system.“The United States has long been committed to finding a solution to the manmade crisis in Venezuela,” the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, said. “The urgency for this has become all the more serious in light of the Maduro regime’s failure to adequately prepare for and address the global Covid-19 pandemic. This framework demonstrates our commitment to helping Venezuela fully recover and ensures that the voice of the Venezuelan people is respected and included.”Sceptics of the plan said it provided few incentives for the incumbent officials to give up power, days after they were charged with serious offences and multimillion-dollar rewards put on their heads.“The people of Venezuela cannot afford such a ham-handed approach. It’s time to get serious about our Venezuela policy,” Engel said.David Smilde, a senior fellow at the Washington Office on Latin America, said the deal was very similar to what was discussed by Maduro and Guaidó representatives in Oslo and Barbados last summer, with one major difference.“Coming less than a week after indicting all the main figures of the Maduro government it would seem the Trump administration is trying to hardwire in who they think should be part of a transition,” Smilde said on Twitter. “This was a main point of contention during last summer’s negotiations, with the US reluctant to endorse any transition plan that allowed Maduro to preside over new elections.”Briefing journalists on the new plan, a senior administration official said the US was prepared to negotiate with Maduro about the terms of his departure from office.But the official referred to the fate of Gen Manuel Noriega, the Panamanian dictator, who was indicted on drug smuggling charges in 1988 and then removed in a US invasion the next year.“History shows that those who do not cooperate with US law enforcement agencies do not fare well, “ the official said. “Maduro probably regrets not taking the offer six months ago. We urge Maduro not to regret not taking it now.”"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

The Government clarification comes after some confusion emerged around whether families and couples could exercise together under the stricter restrictions on social and commercial life brought in last week.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar announced on Friday that citizens must stay at home with limited exceptions and could only leave only to shop for food or to exercise within 2km of their homes. It was later clarified that people could travel beyond the 2km point to do their shopping. It initially appeared that people would only be able to leave their homes inidually creating real concern for families with children. However, a spokesman from the department of the Taoiseach has confirmed to The  that all people living in the same household may exercise together.“Once people are living in the same household they can take brief physical exercise together – once they stay within 2km of their home and always maintain 2 metres distance between themselves and other people,” he said. The current, more stringent restrictions are to remain in place until at least Easter Sunday, April 12th. All citizens must remain at home unless they need to travel to and from work where the work is in essential health, social care or another essential service that cannot be done from home.People may also leave their homes to attend medical appointments or collect medicines or for vital family reasons such as providing care to children, the elderly or vulnerable people. People may also leave their homes to shop for food or household goods or to collect a meal. People may also leave home for farming purposes involving food production and the care of animals. A system of ‘cocooning’ has also been introduced for people over the age of 70 or those who are medically vulnerable. People who fall into these categories are advised not to leave their homes at all, even if they feel fit and well.

Mr Martin is understood to have told his TDs that the next government will have to make unpleasant decisions. He said talks with Fine Gael are continuing on a government of “equal partnership” and a “clear majority” administration is needed.Carlow Kilkenny TD Jennifer Murnane O’Connor and Waterford TD Mary Butler are said to have called for party unity, interpreted as supporting efforts to form a government with Fine Gael.John McGuinness, also a Carlow Kilkenny TD, asked if Fianna Fáil had reached out to all parties and whether there was a response from Sinn Féin. He said a government should be formed and argued there is an obligation on Fianna Fáil to talk to all parties since progress with Fine Gael is slow. Mr Crowe expressed concerns about coalition with Fine Gael and said such a government would not be able to implement policies Fianna Fáil wanted due to the economic damage caused by Covid-19.

A further £278.6 million is to be allocated to the Department for Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs for farm support payments which replace the EU Common Agriculture Policy payments.Mr Murphy said an additional £70 million of central British funding would be allocated to departments while on the capital side some £1.6 billion would be spent in the coming year.Mr Murphy indicated that because of the crisis departments would have a degree of “flexibility” in terms of spending.“In difficult circumstances this budget delivers additional funding for our citizens, for our workers, and for our businesses,” he said.In relation to coronavirus, Mr Murphy said: “Personal Protection Equipment has been ordered, car parking fees have been removed and public transport has been made free for key health workers to help those leading the fight against Covid-19.“Funding has been made available to ensure the 97,000 children who are entitled to free school meals do not experience hardship as a result of schools closing. £370 million has been made available in grants to support some 30,000 businesses so they can continue to pay workers.”He added: “Development of this budget began before the onset of Covid-19 and has been overshadowed by the unprecedented public health crisis we face, a health crisis that impacts on every area of our lives. Protecting lives and livelihoods from the pandemic is now our number one priority.”The Sinn Féin Minister said that, in order “to ensure no additional burden on households during this difficult and uncertain time”, he was freezing domestic rates at current levels. Domestic rates, unlike in the Republic, are paid by householders in Northern Ireland. Mr Murphy said he was also reducing business rates which, effectively, would mean an 18 per cent reduction on the figures for last year “which will benefit all business ratepayers”.Under January’s New Decade, New Approach deal which restored the Northern Executive the British government pledged to provide a £2 billion financial package over five years to help the Executive and Assembly begin working on a “sustainable footing”.At the time and ahead of the Covid-19 crisis which prompted emergency funding for businesses and workers Mr Murphy described the promised funding as “woefully inadequate”.When delivering his budget in the Assembly on Tuesday Mr Murphy complained that “in real terms our block grant remains some £360 million below pre-austerity levels when comparing like for like funding”.“Over that time the pressure on vital public services has increased. Public expectations were raised considerably by the New Decade New Approach document. But the British Government did not provide the funding necessary to deliver these priorities,” he added.Mr Murphy said that nonetheless he was “able to deliver a budget that, compared to last year, provides real term increases to all departments”.During questioning about the budget, the DUP North Antrim MLA Paul Frew referred to companies which were making items to save lives during the crisis. He added that he was “deeply worried” to have been informed that some Sinn Féin “party activists” had been involved in “intimidating and harassing” a number of such firms to close down completely.Mr Murphy said that it was a matter of regret that Mr Frew made such allegations “without any substance”.He added: “Of course if you are aware of accusations which are essentially criminal behaviour you have an obligation to report those to the police and I hope you have, rather than simply bring them here for publicity purposes.”Traditional Unionist Voice leader Jim Allister asked that in light of the current crisis would the Minister agree that it would be “unconscionable” to spend money on Ulster Scots and the Irish language now, as promised in the New Decade, New Approach deal.Mr Murphy said he was “heartened” by the fact that it seemed that Mr Allister’s only concerns around budget spending should relate to these two matters.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4217250.1585681809!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"almost 600 000 for tds who lost seats or retired","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAll TDs who lost their seat or retired before the last general election were entitled to a termination lump sum of between €15,000 and some €17,500.More than €586,000 was paid out in termination pay and lump sums in January and February to TDs who retired or lost their seats at the general election.This included €28,055 in termination payments to ex-Fine Gael TD Dara Murphy, according to records released under Freedom of Information by the Oireachtas.Mr Murphy had stepped down as a Dáil deputy in December following controversy over his claims for travel and accommodation allowances at Leinster House despite having a full-time job in Europe.The former Fine Gael TD received a termination lump sum of €16,031.50 in January, according to the database of payments .

Photograph: The  After 24 hours of uncertainty, the Oireachtas has confirmed the Dáil has reversed its decision not to sit this week and will convene on Thursday afternoon.While other parties pressed for the change, the Labour Party criticised the reverse and said it will boycott the sitting on the basis it does not respect the national effort for people to stay at home for non-essential purposes.It has argued that because there is no legislation being discussed the sitting is not essential. The party says all its TDs will remain absent and will make a contribution by way of video statements from its spokespeople, which will then be laid before the Dáil. It was initially decided on Monday that no parliamentary sitting would take place this week. However, following complaints by Sinn Féin and People Before Profit on Monday, an incorporeal meeting of the Dáil’s all-party business committee on Tuesday decided proceedings would go ahead. The meeting took place by a series of inidual telephone calls by Oireachtas officials to party whips asking them their opinion on whether or not a sitting should go ahead and, if so, what should be discussed?The Oireachtas is not using teleconferencing facilities such as Zoom or Google Hangout for these meetings, which means no party whip was aware of the position of other parties. Oireachtas officials collated the opinions and decided to proceed on the basis of a majority favouring a sitting. Two Dáil sessions will take place on Thursday. The first will be statements on health, and then statements on social protection. The relevant Ministers will commence each session, which will last 90 minutes. In a statement, the Labour Party said it disagreed with the decision.“We agreed that our TDs would not attend the sitting of the Dáil for statements on Thursday as it is non-essential business and not legislation that was being proposed. “They will instead support the national effort to stay at home, and not place an unnecessary burden on the Oireachtas staff, and staff of those departments who are working heroically to deal with the Covid-19 outbreak and it’s social and economic impact,” the party said in a statement. “There is a provision for statements to be laid before the Dáil instead, and our health spokesman Alan Kelly and Employment Affairs and Social Protection spokesman Ged Nash will both avail of that opportunity (to make statements by video).”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4216843.1585658333!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"look on the bright side international space station visible in irish skies tonight","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA view of Earth from the International Space Station on March 20th.

The International Space Station will be visible at 8.45pm as it orbits the Earth and will be very bright. It will be visible for all of four minutes which is a long time for the station which travels at a speed of 27,600 kph. For those who don’t have a calculator to hand, that represents 460 kilometres per minute, or almost eight kilometres a second. It orbits the Earth every 92 minutes.The ISS will travel west to east across the southern horizon at an angle of 48 degrees so it should be high enough in the sky not to be obscured by houses or the landscape. The six members of the crew, three Russians and three Americans, departed Earth in February before the coronavirus pandemic was declared and will be returning to Earth next month. They are probably the safest human beings anywhere now as there is no chance of them catching coronavirus in space. Flight engineer Andrew Morgan, who is a medical doctor, tweeted on Monday: “As a medical doctor looking back on our planet on #NationalDoctorsDay, I think of the healthcare professionals \u0026amp volunteers that are risking their lives in this crisis. We’re at our best when we help each other. I’m in awe of your selfless service. Thank you from @Space_Station”. On St Patrick’s Day Dr Morgan posted a picture on his Twitter page that he had taken the previous autumn: He tweeted: “Happy #StPatricksDay! This past fall I captured this clear day over the southern end of the Emerald Isle: Limerick, Cork and Kerry counties.” He also shared a photo of the tricolour floating in one of the windows of the Cupola observatory the a dome-shaped module that the crew of Expedition 62, as it is called, can observe the Earth. Ireland has had a long association with the ISS as both Commander Chris Hadfield, who is a regular visitor to Ireland, and Astronaut Catherine Cady Coleman have both played traditional Irish music while on board the station. A few light showers may occur, mainly near north and northwest coasts.

Photograph: Oliver HosletReutersThe European Union released a draft of its hoped-for future relationship deal with Britain on Wednesday, setting out ambitions for a tight relationship on trade and security.The 440-page document crosses several of Britain’s red lines, spelling out the bloc’s ambitions for Britain to agree “uniform implementation” of state subsidy rules, with the European Court of Justice remaining the adjudicating authority.It also makes reference to the so-called “level playing field”, provisions to ensure fair competition by keeping rules aligned, which London has already rejected.“The Parties recognise that the establishment of conditions that ensure a level playing field between the Parties is necessary for trade and investment between the Union and the United Kingdom, ” the draft reads.The EU’s draft envisages reciprocal access to waters for fishing rights, with negotiations held each year by December 10th on fishing opportunities for the following year, another contentious point.The UK negotiating team said it had also sent a draft to the EU. This includes a free trade agreement with annexes, as well as agreements on aviation safety and air transport, and a civil nuclear agreement.“We are sharing ours in confidence as a negotiating document, as part of the ongoing negotiating process,” a government spokesman said.“Teams will now analyse each other’s texts and we expect further conversations between the teams next week.“We will keep under review which documents it is appropriate to publish during the course of negotiations and whether it is useful to make them availablle more widely.”Though Britain has left the EU it is is currently in a transition period, continuing to adhere to prior norms pending the agreement of a deal on the future relationship. If none can be agreed, it will automatically begin trading on World Trade Organisation terms from January 1st, 2021, with potentially severe effects on the Irish economy.The government of prime minister Boris Johnson has until July to request an extension to the transition period, but has insisted it will not do so even as the Coronavirus pandemic delayed talks this week.Both sides said they were examining options such as using video conferencing in place of face-to face talks.“The negotiations can still proceed given all of the logistical arrangements that have been put in place,” British foreign secretary Dominic Raab said on Tuesday.“We’re confident that we can get this done and, actually, I don’t think delaying Brexit negotiations would give anyone the certainty on either side of the Channel that they need.”Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/01/05/TELEMMGLPICT000082243805_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqI7wJNeDKpJpIaIPaAu_z8WjzuYjYSiM5IWsvbxbKQLk.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"bbc virus truce has already ended","story":"Yesterday morning on the Today programme, Nick Robinson was back doing what he loves best, trying to beat up a government ministerAt first, the BBC tried to be responsible under the shadow of Covid-19. After its long-running Brexit disgrace, it briefly returned to the straight and narrow, giving useful information calmly, as it always should, particularly in a crisis. As a result, the Government was forced to let ministers appear once more on the Today programme. Anything else would have looked petty. The BBC sensed the licence fee might be saved if it behaved.Now, however, the corporation is reverting to type. Its default position is a narrative in which the Government is failing to provide whatever it is that organised groups of public-sector iniduals – especially the NHS – demand. That is fair enough, but leaves out so much: the needs of other workers, the vital interconnection between public and private sectors, the urgent need to investigate conflicting scientific models.The BBC won’t touch wider questions, such as China’s responsibility for the catastrophe, although it attacks Donald Trump without scruple. Quickly it becomes coercively moralistic, just as it does about climate change.Yesterday morning on the Today programme, Nick Robinson was back doing what he loves best, trying to beat up a government minister. He succeeded, of course, against the decent but inexperienced Helen Whately. It was so sterile. Why didn’t the BBC look into how best to get tests to people faster, instead of scalping Ms Whately?A few minutes earlier, the news bulletin had announced that Boris Johnson, in a message to the nation, had said that “Margaret Thatcher was wrong that there is no such thing as society”. Yet all he actually said – just as David Cameron did a few years back – was: “There is such a thing as society”. Clearly Boris was making a deliberate reference to her famous sentence in order to present himself as a caring Prime Minister, a point that Chris Mason analysed fairly. But the news, as a matter of simple fact, was wrong, and wrong in the way the BBC usually is.In her famous interview, by the way, Mrs Thatcher was making almost exactly the opposite point to what we are told to think. She was trying to show that “society” is not an abstract, but made up by the obligations of each to all. She spoke of “a living tapestry of men and women” – not a bad description of our interconnectedness, which matters so much just now.Should the BBC TV licence fee be scrapped? POLLThere are certain virus phrases of which one can have too much. One is “People are dying…”, as in “People are dying, so how dare you visit your motherdrive to go on a country walksell an Easter egg”, and so on.Yes, people are dying, but you will not do much to stop them dying by self-righteous policing (by citizens or by the authorities) of the most marginal infringements of the rules. People are living, too. The more they are trusted to behave sensibly without snooping and lecturing, the likelier they are to maintain psychological balance and public-spiritedness when panic is a much more prevalent risk than death.Besides, people are not, so far, dying in unusual numbers. Roughly 50,000 people die in Britain each month. Roughly 1,500 have died with Covid-19 (not necessarily of it) this month. Since many of these deaths are of people who were already very ill for other reasons, the normal monthly statistical total has hardly altered. It is probable that the situation will get much worse, but the prevailing view is that the bad trend will not last very long.I spoke to a respected local undertaker recently. He told me that there has as yet been no rise in the number of funerals, but there is a shortage of coffins. In other words, there is what, in other contexts, people call “panic-buying”. Without coffins, body bags may have to be permitted. Unless properly informed, the public will assume the coffin shortage is because “people are dying” in unprecedented quantities. So far, it is not.It has been cheering, in the time of plague, to see pictures of the Queen granting Boris Johnson an audience down the telephone, and of the Duchess of Cambridge launching an initiative to assist mental health during the crisis, also on the phone.Both calls were made from home, of course, so one could see the pleasant backgrounds. The Queen had beside her or on the mantelpiece two statuettes of horses, two of corgis and one of a serviceman. The Duchess was seated at a desk furnished with an elegant uniform edition of hardback books (I couldn’t see the titles) and that nostalgic object, a blotter.One of those off-white numbers from the Seventies where the mouthpiece looks like a small vase for violetsBoth women spoke into telephones attached to wires, a rarity in the age of the mobile and the portable: no chance of either of them pacing up and down as they spoke. The Duchess’s instrument, admittedly, looked as if it might have been born in the 21st century. The Queen, however, was wielding one of those off-white numbers from the Seventies where the mouthpiece looks like a small vase for violets or forget-me-nots and the wire is always getting twisted up. The face of the phone was not visible in the picture, but I like to think it had a circular dial which you revolve, rather than buttons which you stab.Both scenes felt stable and cosy – effects which, in people’s idea of a successful monarchy, are even more important than pomp and circumstance.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

The logistics of getting them to people or people to them are very difficult - but would be good if some could be given away.Mr Don added that the way we will garden in the future is likely to change as a result of coronavirus. He explained:  The majority of composted plants will be annuals grown for spring sales and this virus might be the start of  a shift in what we grow in our gardens and how we do it. Growing more from seed and  more perrenials might not be such a bad thing.The HTA is calling for Government support of the ornamental crop sector, which grows bulbs, bedding plants, cut flowers and pot plants for garden centres, supermarkets, florists and DIY stores.The HTA says around 650 businesses across the UK produce ornamental crops, contributing £1.4 billion to the economy each year and employing more than 15,000 people directly and almost 30,000 indirectly.Sales have dwindled since the Mother\u0027s Day weekend, when demand would be normally high but people were already beginning to self-isolate, the trade body said.And the virus lockdown means there are unlikely to be any sales over Easter and through to the May bank holiday, the busiest time of year for the gardening sector, and when 70 per cent of bedding plants are sold, so growers will have to write off their stock.The value of lost plant sales in the UK will be £687 million by the end of June, the HTA suggests.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/family/2020/03/27/TELEMMGLPICT000228379234_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=4","title":"life lockdown chance rediscover lost virtue patience","story":"One of the major misapprehensions about working from home is that you have more time.As the shutters came down on businesses across the nation last week, and armies of employees were sent to makeshift desks in kitchens, bedrooms and living rooms, among the confusion came chatter about what a glorious opportunity this represented.Certainly, my social media feeds have been inundated with people opining about how they’ll finally be able to finish all those books, those TV box sets, or buy an Xbox, a Peloton, learn to cook, sew, garden, pick up a new language, and in one case, get back into Warhammer (you know who you are).But take it from someone who was working from home before it was cool — very little of this will happen, and actually, you may be grateful for that.The latest suggestions from the government are that even if the curve is flattened within three months, it could take six for the UK to return to normality. That means a lot longer than most people envisaged — it already feels like an age, but it’s been just 6 days since the prime minister went on TV to tell the nation that this moment of national emergency required such unprecedented steps.The responses have, obviously, been mixed, but the one constant is restlessness. People are either desperate to resume normal life or fall into the aforementioned category of optimists intent on doing a hundred things they say they wouldn’t otherwise be able to.Humanity has only reached its position by marching relentlessly forward. But the extent of this inability to sit and take stock — and in some cases, to go into meltdown at the idea of a period of stillness — is a worry. Prior to the emergence of Covid-19, the world went at a hundred miles an hour — the news cycle, especially, was a rollercoaster of drama. Social media drove our need to consume, progress, and compete frantically with our peers. Small wonder that many people responded to the gathering pace with diminished mental health — burnout, depression and anxiety seem almost reasonable responses by human minds in the over-stimulated pressure cooker of the 21st century. Now, this isn’t some weird Extinction Rebellion tract trying to say that Covid-19 is nature’s response to mankind’s thirst for progress. It was the government that made the decision to shut things down, not Gaia. But it does strike me that, for a population perpetually crying out for a break, even a slight respite from the barrage, this couldn’t have come at a more opportune moment.Yet, the response hasn’t been relief, but the anxious need to keep being stimulated. One can almost see this slow motion mental health car crash in action — a sea of minds, shut up inside, going into overdrive with worry simply because their neurons are so used to firing on all cylinders. That should concern all of us, as it means that we are heading into a period, as a nation, where supreme patience is required, at the exact moment when we are least capable of it. That poses as much of a risk to people flouting government guidelines as people being selfish or ignorant: How long will it be before people decide that the risk to their mental health far outweighs the danger the virus poses to them?That will only be exacerbated by a desire to keep being occupied — to pick up as many improving hobbies as possible. But it doesn’t work that way. Just because you’re working from home does not mean more free time — and the feeling of disappointment that comes from that realisation isn’t exactly comforting. Life in the digital sphere, meanwhile, is half of what made us so miserable in the first place — existing through the medium of Zoom seems like trying to batter a headache out of existence with a hammer.If this strange lockdown experience teaches us anything, it needs to be patience. For far too long, we have been denied this virtue, and the tolerance and rationality that comes with it. We see it in the lack of time we have for others, for their opinions and personalities. Many of the poorest decisions we make as iniduals and as a society stem from impatience, a need to do things for their own sake.After years of being overwhelmed by ever increasing demands on our time and our minds, being forced inside is a chance to rediscover patience and self-restraint. We should look upon this period as an opportunity not to do more, but to do less — a period of mental and physical respite from the rigours of the outside world.

But of course he did have a radio, and he heard our conversation yesterday morning discussing the potential increase in domestic abuse cases during this period that families are at home, and he just brought himself into the BBC. “He got up in his pyjamas, put his coat on, packed a bag and arrived on our doorstep… it’s heartbreakingly sad really, to see this sort of young, articulate, intelligent young man who just felt that life was so desperate, he just had to get up and walk away.”Mr Grinnell said that he comforted the boy in “the good old fashioned British way” with a cup of tea, and contacted Devon and Cornwall Police, whose support team arrived at the BBC within 20 minutes. The radio editor added that the schoolboy was “apologetic almost for bringing himself out on the streets at a time when he knew that people were supposed to stay at home, but he just didn’t feel that there was anywhere else he could go”.The BBC has launched a coronavirus helpline and dedicated campaign entitled, ‘Make a Difference’, which has seen more than 100,000 people contacting the service within two weeks.The campaign aims to link up those in need of help with those who can provide it, and marks the biggest ever response the BBC has had to a Local Radio campaign.Make a Difference was launched on all 39 BBC Local Radio stations on March 17 and  gives half hourly updates on how the coronavirus is affecting the local area, offers advice and puts people who need help in touch with volunteers.Mr Grinnell said that the service is not just reaching people who may feel isolated at the moment, but that it has also become “that parish pump and community service noticeboard” during the coronavirus pandemic. Over the weekend, the government published guidance for those who feel at risk of domestic abuse during the COVID-19 outbreak, which highlighted its collaboration with the police and charity sector in order to ensure that support services remain open. However it did not mention children. Emily Hilton, Senior Policy and Public Affairs Officer at the NSPCC, said: “Hundreds of thousands of children are currently living in homes where they experience domestic abuse.“The Government has acknowledged that measures need to be taken to keep vulnerable children safe during this national emergency by keeping them in school. “Yet it was disappointing that the Home Office failed to include children in their recently published domestic abuse COVID-19 Guidance. “As local areas adapt to the new challenges they are facing there must be resources available to them to ensure that professionals feel well equipped to spot the signs of domestic abuse and swiftly take appropriate action.“We can all play our part in this as well by checking in with families however we can and reaching out for support and advice from local authorities or the NSPCC Helpline if we have any concerns for a child’s wellbeing.”Nicole Jacobs, the Domestic Abuse Commissioner for England and Wales, said that Home Secretary Priti Patel has made clear that self-isolation should not come at the cost of peoples’ safety.However she added that charities and helplines are seeing a rise in the numbers of people looking for support, help and advice. “Our concern remains that the options are limited.”More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"watch can get coronavirus twice","story":"We\u0027re constantly learning about how Covid-19 affects the body, the disease which has swept across the world and changed life as we know it. Once you have overcome the disease and it symptoms though, even more questions arise: Am I still infectious?

Reversing the increase would deny a pay rise to hundreds of thousands of low paid workers, including many in sectors such as care, retail and cleaning, who are on the front line in the national effort to tackle the virus.”Polling by the institute found that 66 per cent of adults last October believed the level of the minimum wage to be too low.

The term it uses for the statutory wage floor for younger workers is the national minimum wage.The national minimum wage is £4.55 for 16-17 year olds in 202021, £6.45 for those aged 18-20 and £8.00 for 21-24 year olds.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The move follows similar increases recently made elsewhere in Europe.The British Retail Consortium and UK Finance, which represents the finance and payments industry, believe the change will make it easier for consumers to shop, giving a much-needed boost to retailers.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIt will reduce the number of occasions when people need to input their pin, speeding up queues – a change that will be particularly welcome in UK supermarkets which had their busiest month on record in march as shoppers stocked up on supplies.It will also mean more payments can be made without the need to handle cash, which should cut retailers\u0027 costs.When can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsWhich countries around the world has coronavirus spread to?Listen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus PodcastAn increased limit was already being considered but the process has been accelerated as part of the industry\u0027s response to Covid-19.However, the benefit will not be felt for most shops until the government eases current lockdown conditions. Only shops designated as essential by the government are open as the UK attempts to slow the spread of coronavirus.Consumers spent £80.5bn via contactless payments in 2019, up by 16 per cent on the previous year, according to UK Finance.Increasing the maximum value on contactless purchases may cause concerns about fraud but UK Finance\u0027s figures suggest the amount lost is relatively small.Fraud equates to just 2.5p in every £100 spent using contactless technology. UK Finance said contactless fraud on payment cards and devices represents just 3.3 per cent of overall card fraud losses.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The very violent game was denied a rating by the BBFC and was made to undergo substantial cuts before it could secure a British release.A landmark in video games, underwater sci-fi shooter Bioshock was still controversial when it was released, largely due to the gameplay aspect that let players murder beings that resembled young children – called the little sisters – to gain power-ups.1420 Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 (2009)Still shocking to this day, Modern Warfare 2 opens with a deeply upsetting sequence where the player massacres dozens of civilians at a Russian airport.

Reversing the increase would deny a pay rise to hundreds of thousands of low paid workers, including many in sectors such as care, retail and cleaning, who are on the front line in the national effort to tackle the virus.”Polling by the institute found that 66 per cent of adults last October believed the level of the minimum wage to be too low. Only 2 per cent said it was too high.Support for hiking the minimum wage was highest among young adults and low-income households.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The trait differentiates us from our closest living ape relatives: chimpanzees, gorillas and orangutans.But new research based on analysis of fossil leg bones, provides evidence that a hominin species believed to be either Paranthropus robustus – which lived between 1 and 3 million years ago – or early Homo sapiens, regularly adopted highly flexed hip joints, a posture that in other non-human apes is associated with climbing trees.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThese findings came from analysing and comparing the internal bone structures of two fossil leg bones from South Africa, discovered over 60 years ago.For both fossils, the external shape of the bones were very similar, showing a more human-like than ape-like hip joint, suggesting they were both walking on two legs.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.The 25 most remarkable animal pictures of the past decade Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.825 2010: A Marvel of Ants1125 2015: Tale of Two Foxes1425 2017: Pikin and Appolinaire1925 2017: Memorial to a Species2325 2018: Bed of Seals2425 2019: Land of the Eagle825 2010: A Marvel of Ants1125 2015: Tale of Two Foxes1425 2017: Pikin and Appolinaire1925 2017: Memorial to a Species2325 2018: Bed of Seals2425 2019: Land of the EagleThe researchers examined the internal bone structure because it remodels during life based on how iniduals use their limbs.\u0026nbspUnexpectedly, when the team analysed the inside of the spherical head of the femur, it showed that they were loading their hip joints in different ways.The research project was led by Dr Leoni Georgiou, Dr Matthew Skinner and Professor Tracy Kivell at the University of Kent‘s School of Anthropology and Conservation, and included a large international team of biomechanical engineers and palaeontologists.\u0026nbspThey said the results demonstrate how novel information about human evolution can be hidden within fossil bones and can alter our understanding of when, where and how we became the humans we are today.Ancient human ancestor homo erectus survived far longer than thoughtAlcohol tolerance ‘may have kept humanity’s ancestors from extinction’Scientists reveal the face of our oldest direct ancestor Tiny T rex: Ancestor to the king of the dinosaurs discoveredDr Georgiou said: “It is very exciting to be able to reconstruct the actual behaviour of these iniduals who lived millions of years ago and every time we CT scan a new fossil it is a chance to learn something new about our evolutionary history.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

People who previously struggled with universal credit continue to do so. Rough sleepers and sofa surfers continue to live without shelter. Services that once offered support have shuttered to protect workers, while people are burning through their kitchen cupboards faster than usual because they are stuck inside.\u0026nbspIn short, many of those who have needed to use food banks in the past, those who are not among the government’s 1.5 million most at-risk people and will not be able to call on its swelling volunteer service for support, still need help.\u0026nbspThe Independent’s Help The Hungry campaign aims to help give these people the support they need. Click here for ways you can help.And here are five things you might not have considered to help you to support your community’s food bank.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesA common misconception is that food banks exist to offer the bare minimum – but to do so would be to completely undermine what food can give us in our day to day lives. We don’t only eat for sustenance – we do it for pleasure, to access our cultures, to engage in tradition. Food is central to the human experience, and for millennia has been key to how we experience love and affection.How to support our campaignSo ultimately think about what is going to taste good. Of course you can pick up staples that will be warmly received, but you can also donate things that get you excited, and share that excitement with someone else.Take, for example, Easter eggs. They may not be a matter of life or death, but by donating them you can give a parent the chance to treat their child, and a child the ability to engage in a communal tradition they might have been left out of. You are not just handing out subsistence, but a moment of dignity and joy for a family – and all it took was a bit of chocolate.It’s not just foodFood banks have never been just about food. Poverty is about choices – do you buy something to eat, or put money on the meter to keep the electricity running? Do you really need the heating on, or can you hold out? Will you be hungry now, or hungry later?\u0026nbspAt their most fundamental level, food banks are about a community pulling together and trying to resolve those conflicts – so when you think of donating, empathy is key. On one side of the spectrum, this means not just dredging mystery tins from the back of your cupboard – if you didn’t want to eat it over the last two years, chances are no one else will either. On the other, it’s about thinking of the groceries you couldn’t live without – be that food or something else.In the early days of the UK epidemic, among the first things to be stockpiled were hygiene products – sanitary towels, hand wash, toilet roll. If you didn’t have the ability to bulk buy, or the spare funds to travel from shop to shop by car or public transport, you were stuck. Donating bathroom products means people who use the service don’t have to choose between hunger and hygiene.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailThe range of reasons people visit food banks is vast, reflecting many of the social issues seen across the country, from universal credit delays to limited post-prison rehabilitation systems, rising rents and jobs that simply do not pay enough to allow for survival.\u0026nbspBut helping rough sleepers and sofa surfers out represents a unique challenge for food banks – particularly those who do not have access to kitchens and so are less likely to feel the benefit of, say, the bag of dry pasta many would receive. While volunteers will build a parcel that helps as much as possible, you can go a step further by putting together boxes of much-needed items that can be handed straight over as is.\u0026nbspAsk if your local service is interested, then get a few shoeboxes and add things that might prove useful – like socks and underwear, first aid kits, compact waterproofs, or toothbrushes and paste. Once again as much as you are donating a small box of odds and ends, you are also handing over dignity, and the tools people need to look after themselves.\u0026nbspBags of bagsFood banks across the country have had to make drastic changes to how they operate due to the virus – while volunteers may have a few contingency plans up their sleeves to keep services running, readying for a global pandemic was not among them.What has followed has been a herculean effort to organise outright change in a matter of days. Entire delivery systems have been dreamt up out of thin air, while the elderly and at risk who make up much of the volunteer base have been sent home.\u0026nbspFood banks strained as volunteers isolate and demand surgesFood banks have never been more needed, or closer to collapseFood banks in crisis as coronvirus panic buying leaves families hungryFood banks are under threat – the government has to step inUnited and City make joint food bank donation to fight coronavirusOperations have also been streamlined to feed as many people as possible, as hygienically as can be achieved. And as every service user’s food is bagged up and handed over, a small mountain of plastic bags are being deployed.So, bizarrely enough, in this time of national crisis, that bag of shopping bags that you and every other UK resident has been keeping in the corner of their kitchen or under their sink for years might finally serve a purpose. After all that time of being stored and neglected after trips to the supermarket, they could be put to use in ensuring social distancing.\u0026nbspAsk your local food bank if they could use them – but if you can go a step further and also feel a little apprehensive about contributing to the impact of plastic on the planet, consider handing over canvas bags instead. There are so many feelings wrapped into asking for help – and when you’ve been let down by the world around you time and time again, one that’s likely to come up is shame.\u0026nbspVolunteers work hard to try to mitigate that – and make the experience about support and community, but it’s easy to feel self-conscious walking away from a food bank and onto the high street with an array of clearly worn and mismatched carrier bags in your hands. A canvas bag, while sturdier, is also more discreet.Possibly the most useful thing you can do for your local food bank is among the easiest – ask what they need. While the Trussell Trust, the nation’s largest food bank charity, helps to set up and support sites, the inidual operation in your region sets its own rules and runs its own show. Others run via other charities or completely independently.\u0026nbspSo check out their tweets to see what they are appealing for, or send them an email to check what they are after, or give them a call and offer up a few hours a week to stack some tins (particularly if you are young, physically fit and don’t mind lugging around crates of produce).\u0026nbspReaching out, at every level, is fundamental to what food banks are. In reaching out you will get the satisfaction that comes from rallying around your community at a time where we’ve perhaps never been more isolated. What the person who comes to ask for food will get, from your contribution combined with others in your area coming together, is help when it’s possible no one else can.Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It is now offering a delivery service to people having to self-isolate, and otherwise unable to get food.How to support our campaign“The big change is the financial hardship we’re seeing, and the huge level of demand,” said Rebecca Ireland, the operations manager at YMCA Bedfordshire.“We used to see 30 to 40 people a day, and on Friday it was at least double that number. Some of them have seen a drop in incomes, or they’re not sure when they’re going to be working again.”“We do have some money to buy more supplies, but we could do with wider agreement with the big supermarkets to let food charities register and buy supplies they need in bulk,” the operations manager added.“We also welcome the sharing of good ideas through the Help The Hungry campaign, as we have to let people across the country who might never have needed help before know what’s there for them.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But they were being very naughty.”The following day, Mr Stuart noted the goats were “back, and gathering in groups of more than two”.He continued to document the goats’ movements throughout the weekend, eventually writing a post echoed by many, declaring: “I, for one, welcome our new goat overlords.”“Growing up in Llandudno, I always knew the Great Orme mountain goats would be ones to take over in the event of any future apocalyptic dystopia,” said Jeanna Skinner, writing on Twitter.\u0026nbspAnother Twitter user wrote: “And so it came to pass that the Great Orme goats captured Llandudno and all who saw them did tremble at their might.”While the goats are fairly regular uninvited guests in the town,\u0026nbsphaving even faced a cull in the 1990s,\u0026nbspthere appears to be a general consensus that\u0026nbsplockdown\u0026nbsphas encouraged them to roam further\u0026nbspthan usual.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They usually only come down from the Great Orme when it’s windy, and only the backstreets at the top of Mostyn Street.

We have teamed up with The Felix Project – a start-up charity we helped launch in 2016 – to deliver produce to community hubs in London boroughs.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Independent is also asking food charities across Britain to contact helpthehungry@ to tell us about your project and help build a directory of ways that our readers can help the hungry in their area – through money, volunteering and food donations. Food banks, which were already struggling to meet the need for emergency food parcels, have seen a huge surge in demand in recent weeks, while at the same time coping with dwindling donations, supermarket rationing systems, and a loss of many volunteers to self-isolation – yet none of the government’s rescue money goes to them.British households have stored more than £1bn worth of goods in their homes in response to the pandemic, creating shortages for food banks as shoppers ignore assurances that supply chains are robust.How to support our campaignJess Phillips, the Labour MP who recently ran for party leader, has backed our campaign, saying: “Nobody should be in the position of not being able to get enough food. In my constituency, London and in places all around the UK the coronavirus pandemic is placing extra stress on a system that was already straining.“We should all do what we can to help food and other essentials get to those that need it. That is why I’m backing the Help the Hungry campaign – please give if you are able.”Pastor Obi Onyeabor, the manager at Barking Foodbank, part of The Trussell Trust’s national network, said his pool of around 50 volunteers has been reduced by a dozen or so people currently self-isolating at home. Yet he and his team have kept their two church hall food banks open, and are now making home deliveries on Tuesdays and Thursdays to make sure the most vulnerable get supplies.“We have been scrambling for the past couple of weeks, doing all that we can – but we’re appealing for more people to come and help,” he said. “Out of fear people have been buying for themselves and their families, but I’ve seen some real generosity too.“I hope that if we can get past the panic buying stage, more people will want to give money, food or some of their time too.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailIn London, charities like The Felix Project donate 10 tons of food – or 22,000 meals – to the needy every day. But funding has dropped since the outbreak of Covid-19, limiting their capacity to carry out vital work at a time when it is more important than ever. As part of the London Food Alliance, along with FareShare and City Harvest, The Felix Project will coordinate deliveries in London boroughs in order to distribute surplus food to the elderly, poor and vulnerable. The charities will deliver food to the hubs, where local volunteers will package up parcels and arrange “last-mile” deliveries to the homes of the vulnerable.Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, has backed our campaign to help in the capital in partnership with our sister title the Evening Standard. He said: “In a city as prosperous as London, everyone should have enough food to feed themselves and their families – but unfortunately the coronavirus outbreak means some Londoners are facing even greater difficulties. It’s commendable these organisations are joining forces to help ensure surplus food isn’t wasted and instead reaches those who need it most. I urge Londoners to support this crucial initiative.”Mark Curtin, CEO of The Felix Project, said: “Our role is to pick up large volumes of nutritious surplus food from the commercial sector and deliver it to community hubs to ensure there is enough food for vulnerable people for as long as this health crisis ensues. We will be working all hours doing our bit – and it would be wonderful if your readers can get behind us so we can do this job for London.”Emma Revie, chief executive of The Trussell Trust, which supports 1,200 food banks, appealed for help from the public to get vital food to people who cannot afford the basics, and to boost volunteer numbers in areas where they are needed.\u0026nbsp“Our main priority as coronavirus unfolds is ensuring the safety of everyone who comes to a food bank – whether it’s someone needing help, someone volunteering their time, or someone making a donation,” said Ms Revie. “Until we are confident that adequate government protection against poverty is in place, food banks provide an essential community service to people unable to afford food. But this should not fall to food banks.\u0026nbsp“Our benefits system could be the life raft people need now. That’s why it’s more important than ever that we end the five-week wait for universal credit. While incredible food bank volunteers continue to help people unable to afford the basics, we would ask our government to take this essential step and end the five-week wait now. It’s five weeks too long.”Sabine Goodwin, coordinator of the Independent Food Aid Network UK, which oversees 834 independent food banks, said the charitable services were “struggling to stay above water” in the current climate and accused the government of so far “failing to act” to prevent an ever-increasing number of people falling into poverty.“Food bank use was rising before the coronavirus outbreak and the impact of job losses can only make matters far worse. But this catastrophe in the making is avoidable,” she said. “We’re calling for an income-based solution to this crisis which would mean that the Herculean efforts by volunteers across the country wouldn’t be needed.“FareShare, the UK’s biggest food redistribution charity, is also calling for more volunteers to help with packing and making van deliveries. The organisation takes food from the food manufacturers that can’t be sold in shops, either because of packaging errors or overproduction, and gets it out to food banks, hospices, homeless hostels and other charities.Commercial director Alyson Walsh estimates around 1,200 people have got in touch over the past week. “We have quite a lot of older volunteers who have had to stay at home, but we are now seeing a wave of interest in new people willing to fill in.”Ms Walsh added: “We know we have the capacity to do more – we have the warehouse\u0026nbspspace and the chillers. But the government needs to help the food industry do more in terms of all the bagging and boxing and delivery of food that needs to be done.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

These would later be delivered to the doorsteps of poor, elderly and vulnerable residents of Haringey, as identified on the council’s database, as well as to the homes of local children eligible for free school meals.\u0026nbspSpurs chair\u0026nbspDaniel Levy said: “As a club, we have always been clear about our commitment to the wider community — and never has this been more important than it is now. We are immensely proud of the efforts of everybody involved in the fight against Covid-19 and see today as just the start of what we can do as a club to assist.”How to support our campaignA Haringey council spokesperson\u0026nbspsaid 150 of the borough’s most vulnerable families would have got food parcels delivered yesterday. Production will be ramped up from today to several thousand food parcels daily.\u0026nbspThe packers are council employees transferred from non-priority services and volunteers from Edible London, a local charity tackling food poverty.A second Haringey hub, located at Alexandra Palace,\u0026nbspalso became operational yesterday, and will be used to supply food to borough residents with severe underlying health problems in self-isolation as part of the government’s Covid-19 “shielded” category.Joseph Ejiofor, leader of Haringey council, said: “I’m inspired by the generosity of our community who have stepped up to help so quickly. We have staff and volunteers working tirelessly at our two food redistribution centres, Tottenham Hotspur Stadium and Alexandra Palace, alongside our voluntary sector partners, Edible London.“Working together we’re ensuring food gets to households who need it most.

About a quarter of the other customers out on Monday also wore masks. “I decided to do everything I possibly can to not get sick, because if I do, who is going to take care of him?” Bunyai tells The Independent, pointing to his son, who was born with Down’s syndrome.Outings to the grocery store have been stressful because of the risk of catching Covid-19, Bunyai says, but, starting Tuesday morning, he hopes to feel some relief.Across Austria, people\u0026nbspentering grocery stores and supermarkets will be required to wear surgical masks starting today, the government announced. The masks, it said, would be available free-of-charge at every grocery store in the country.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesSurgical masks will keep people who are unaware that they carry the virus – those who are showing only very mild symptoms or none at all – from spreading it to others unwittingly, Austria’s chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, and health minister, Rudolf Anschober, said\u0026nbspwhen they announced the measure.Experts confirm that masks covering both mouth and nose would help diminish the risk of infection – provided that everyone wears them.When can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsWhich countries around the world has coronavirus spread to?Listen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus PodcastAs of Tuesday, Austria has almost 10,000 cases of Covid-19, with more than 100 deaths. The country has been on lockdown since 16 March, with only essential stores allowed to remain open and police enforcing social-distancing measures.Inside stores, however, keeping a safe distance is often impossible. Most grocery stores have already marked the floors in front of their cashiers with lines 1.5 metres apart\u0026nbspand are asking customers to pay with cards, but these measures are not sufficient in protecting customers and staff.“To tell you the truth, we’ve been scared – scared of our customers – because you just don’t know who has it,” an employee of a major grocery store chain in Vienna tells The Independent. Like many of her co-workers, she worries about coming home to her family after a day of interacting with hundreds of people.“I’m really happy – relieved, actually – that they are making it mandatory,” she says.In addition to free masks, customers are required to shop on their own rather than with family members or in groups, and stores must disinfect shopping carts after each use.The employee, who was not authorised to speak to the media, says that she was not sure how her store would provide hundreds of masks each day, or whether staff could ensure that all carts are disinfected.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Just look around, how tight the aisles are,” says\u0026nbspReinhard Bohm, standing between crisps and the deli counter. Bohm says\u0026nbsphe tried to get a mask, but they were sold out at the pharmacy. “So tomorrow morning, I expect that I will get one here,” he says. “Otherwise, how can I get one?”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

After first announcing a “state of emergency for mass immigration” following the 2015 refugee crisis, his anti-immigrant party has repeatedly renewed the legislation, even as the number of asylum seekers arriving in Hungary has fallen.Timea Szabo, an opposition lawmaker from the Dialogue for Hungary Party, said that there was no trust in the government.“If you look at the past 10 years, they’ve used their power to curb democracy and the rule of law,” he said. “So we need some kind of guarantee that they’re not going to do that again.“If all the countries in Europe could introduce similar laws with a time limit, then I believe that a Hungarian government should do that as well.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It is what a government should do, but only when faced with a le-or-death situation. It is not a sane strategy for normal times.What the old dunce cannot grasp is that such gargantuan bailouts will need to be paid back by years of tax rises and further austerity. If he wants credit for the spending, will he also accept responsibility for that future hardship No, we didn’t think so.Corbyn will be remembered as Labour’s worst-ever leader, the architect of their most abject defeat in  years. He drew anti-Semites like flies to dung. He repelled decent Labour MPs and voters.Only leftie cranks and Tories will miss him.IN six weeks as Chancellor, Rishi Sunak has saved an estimated .million jobs and bailed out Britain.

That we’d all wake up and think: “Nah. My job’s not important at all. I’ve been wasting my le really, so I’ll stay in bed.”Everyone thinks their job is important, so everyone went to work, and this meant that in London especially, the public transport system was rammed full of commuters. This made everyone very angry.I don’t want to blame anyone for what’s going on. If you shut a country down overnight there are bound to be issues. It’s no one’s fault.I do, however, have a helpful suggestion for people who really do need to get to work. A suggestion that no one will have considered. It’s a means of transport that’s virus proof.You can’t be infected when you’re inside it and you can’t pass your infection on to anyone . It’s called the “motor car”.For years, successive leaders and politicians have done their best to squeeze it out of society.They’ve lowered the speed limits and raised the taxes and ­introduced congestion charging and even suggested, hilariously, thatyou ­absolutely must have one, it should have an electric motor. Like a milk float.Even the great libertarian Boris ­Johnson — a former motoring correspondent for GQ magazine — has been involved, handing half the road network over to wretched cyclists.Well, now’s the time to stop all that.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.During the Covid- outbreak, when it’s important we keep our distance, all ­parking restrictions should be lted.Cars should be allowed to use both bus and cycle lanes and all traffic cameras should be turned off. I know this flies in the face of what the eco-mentalists say is good for us but buses are petri dishes so park them at the depot.Trains and the Tube are no better, so turn off the power immediately. In the last three months of last year, million people in this country had jobs. And that’s handy because at the last count there were million cars registered for use on the road.This means that everyone can get to their place of work, safely, in a virus-proof cocoon. Strange isn’t it. For years we were told that cars would one day kill us all. But now it’s obvious that actually, they are our knights in shining armour.I only ask because the phone she was using looked like it was from about .Who was she calling  Dial-a-Disc WHILE scrolling through my phone the other day I was interested to read that I could increase my immunity to coronavirus by taking more vitamin C.Then I was told I would not catch itI stared for two hours every day at a picture of Charlize Theron.Later, I received news from someone whose neighbour’s aunt lives next door to a doctor’s cleaning lady that I should drink my own urine.But I was quickly distracted by someone  whose hairdresser had hacked the World Health Organisation and found that under no circumstances should I eat anything containing vitamin C. Or look at Ms Theron.And then I remembered something Important. Every single thing on the internet is b******s.But there’s one small problem.How do you reach anything on the shelves AS I write, the whole world is trying to work out why Germany is doing so much better with the coronavirus than everywhere .The bald figures are certainly intriguing. In Britain, . per cent of people who catch the disease go on to die. In Italy, it’s a terrying nine per cent. Whereas in Germany, it’s . percent.Experts have claimed that the epidemic started there in the Baian Alps, so the people it affected were young, fit skiing enthusiasts. Who barely noticed they had it.Others have pointed to the fact that Germany has many more beds for critically ill patients than Italy. And a HELL of a lot more than the UK.Then there’s testing. For months German medics have been testing the sort of numbers the rest of the world can only dream about. I wonder, however,anyone has considered this: The Germans do well . . .  because they are German.I was once told by a professor at Rome University that: “You can have as many laws as you like in Italy. Just so long as they are not enforced.”So, when the government there first told everyone to go home and stay there, they simply carried on riding around on their Vespas and kissing everyone.It’s the same story in Britain. We were told to stay at home but because the sun was out, we all hit the park for a picnic.The Germans are dferent. You tell Wolfgang that he must wash his hands every  minutes and he will wash his hands every  minutes. You tell him to go home and he will do so, immediately.It’s probably considered racist to talk about national characteristics these days. But in these troubled times I’m going to plough on regardless and say thatwe want to survive, we’ve got to be a bit more German. And for once, do as we are told.Which I’m told is an important ­ingredient in a building project.WE keep being told that the supermarkets will be able to keep up with our demand for food. But I seriously doubt that.I was told this week that the supplier providing my farm with veg seeds had closed. And because he had no delivery drivers, he was dumping his stock.I’ve now found a replacement and I will be getting them in the ground next week. But who will harvest them in three months, when the people who normally do this kind of thing are stuck in Latvia  Students  Fat chance.To make matters worse, a lot of peppers, tomatoes, cucumbers and courgettes you buy come from Spain.And who, right now, in this locked-down country, is planting them, and packing them and taking them to the docks or the airport  Still, there is some good news.Vegetarians will be forced to abandon their idiocy and start to eat meat. Lamb looks like a good bet. Because all the restaurants and pubs are shut, and exports are tricky, prices have more than halved in the past seven days.Bloody annoying for me as a sheep farmer.

The -year-old commander knows all too well what le is like on lockdown.He spent a year and a half living in a tiny tin can in close proximity to his crew.And he has some good tips for not going stir crazy.Obviously the space station astronauts had a lot of work and experiments to do, but that did not take up all of their time. And like the rest of us, they needed to keep busy.Scott has lots of common-sense advice for coping with being cooped up.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.First of all, we need to have a routine. We have to make sure we get up at the same time every morning and that we get washed and dressed and make our beds. We also need a regular bedtime.Scott says you have to get outside at least once a day — we can do that on earth — while also folowing the rules.You need to schedule times to talk to family and friends and have proper meal times.Exercise is vital. Our very own spaceman, Tim Peake, trained and completed a marathon on a running machine when he was part of the crew on the Space Station.Not all of us are fit enough to run -odd miles, but we can use this time to improve stamina and energy levels. I’m still doing my exercise classes with instructor Maxine Jones on her YouTube channel, and I will be starting virtual yoga with my daughter Rosie, who is in Singapore.I was surprised to learn Scott took actual books, not ebooks, into space.But he said holding a real book in his hands meant he could become completely absorbed, and concentration was not interrupted by messages pinging on his iPad.One of the most interesting things he said was to keep a journal of these strange times.It is more than just jotting down what you got up to that day. You need to go deeper and describe your hopes, fears and state of mind, and also what you hope to achieve when this is all over.One of the things Scott valued most during his long stint in space was video calls with family and friends. And he says one of the silver linings of this crisis is time to reconnect with loved ones.I know exactly what he means. I have been spending hours in WhatsApp chats with Rosie, my best friend Joyce, who is in lockdown in Spain, and my mum in East Kilbride.We chat about everythingand it lts my spirits. Scott’s other sensible advice is to get your information from the experts — and he advises against relying on the internet.He is right. Social media is stuffed with misinformed people and mad conspiracy ­theories.I was shocked to realise how some teens don’t watch any news outlets or read newspapers. They get their “news” from Facebook.They also think they are invincible, which is why we saw those packed beaches and parks this time last week.This was partly because they were unaware of the need for “social distancing” but also because they think it won’t happen to them.But Scott’s most important message to all of us is about working together.“All people are inescapably connected and the more we can come together to solve our problems, the better off we will be.“I’ve seen humans work together to prevail over the toughest challenges imaginable, and I know we can prevail over this one,we all do our part and work together as a team.”Well, I would urge you all to listen to Scott.If we can put a man on the moon then we can beat this awful virus. It won’t be easy but I have faith in science.And as long as we obey the rules, and make some sacrices, we WILL overcome.NO matter what you think of him, it would be churlish not to wish Boris Johnson a speedy recovery.But my sympathies are with Carrie Symonds, who is due to give birth in three months. She’s in isolation at a time when she needs his support.My thoughts are with all expectant parents now, bringing babies into a world we barely recognise and unable to be together in the delivery room. It will be bittersweet for all of them.ONE part of the world untouched by Covid- is my spiritual homeland of Antarctica.I visited the great white wilderness three years ago and cannot wait to .Aside from astronauts, the men and women who man the science bases in Antarctica – particularly the station at the South Pole – are well used to being in isolation while living on top of one another.Which is exactly what most of us are doing right now.Living space is limited at the Pole, and there’s no escaping the other  human beings holed up at the station for the full Antarctic winter.It’s virtually pitch black for six months and you can’t really go outside apart from short bursts of vital scientic work.Most are in danger of becoming “toasty”, which is their description of going stir-crazy.Being cramped, isolated and without proper personal boundaries and “me time” can make you cranky, short-tempered and irritated by the smallest things.In order for us all to avoid toastiness during these strange times, I’d recommend a few rules, some of which were given to me by a hardy survivor of winter at the extreme south.Have a sanctuary, evenit is just in the toilet reading your newspaper and doing the crossword.If you are feeling at the end of your tether, don’t bottle it up.Talk about your feelings and listen to what others in the house with you are saying.You might very well be annoying them as much as they are driving you up the wall.It’s early days, and this is a marathon and not a sprint.Unlike those at the Pole, at least we can still go outside and enjoy the sunshine and the heat as well as the light.I’VE got a Star Trek version of Monopoly and I’m wonderingit is too soon to bring it out from the back of the cupboard.I’ve never actually got to the end of a game of Monopoly and I reckon this might just be the only time that will ever happen.I’m also going to start watching Game Of Thrones for the first time, which should keep me going for a couple of weeks. Any other suggestions for box sets gratefully received.I’M sure all dog owners would agree that our fantastic, loyal, loveable pets are keeping us sane right now. I don’t know what I would doI couldn’t take Angus for a walk once a day.It’s not just a chance to get out in the fresh air and do some exercise, which is good for our physical and mental health, but it’s having something that takes your mind off the current state of the world.When I’m playing with Angus I can almost forget those feelings of anxiety that creep up on all of us and simply enjoy his energy and enthusiasm.He needs to be fed and watered and taken care of, and that gives me a much-needed sense of purpose.It’s a proven fact that just having a dog in the house to cuddle boosts your well-being and cuts stress levels.I don’t know what I would do without him.IT has never been more vital for all of us to receive clear-headed analysis and news we can trust.That’s why it’s so important you continue to buy your Sun every day.There’s a free delivery offer for those unable to get to the shops and of course there’s our splendid online version.We need to be well informed about the latest, fast-moving events and have all the facts to best protect ourselves and our families.Thank you for your loyalty and, as always, for your comments and feedback.

Then suddenly, since Monday, we are not.It’s not even been a week since the new normal for all of us is to stay put.I am guessing that for most of us, it feels like twice that. For many of us, being unable to roam freely is the stuff of nightmares.Still, although it’s been a hard week, I am feeling fortunate. Others I know are really struggling, but I’m very lucky to have a house, a job and the basics in my fridge. But my goodness, it’s boring staying at home all the time, isn’t it At the moment more or less every day is the same. I get up, do conference calls, watch the news and go to bed.But I have been trying to do a few things dferently. For fear of my muscles atrophyingI have started using an exercise video.That may sound normal to you but for me, this is staggering. It’s one from the s and is really quite funny and ­dficult at the same time.I’ve also been more studious than usual and have been doing online lectures for my master’s degree.I have put in the hours with a TV show called This Is Us.And I’ve been cooking up a storm — making increasingly inventive recipes with bits and bobs from the back of the store cupboard because the idea of getting a supermarket delivery slot feels like a fantasy so I have not even bothered to try. I cook whatever my corner shop has in stock, which sadly is not a lot.I know many supermarkets are prioritising elderly and vulnerable shoppers, which is right and proper. And I really hope that the people who are hoarding and stockpiling out of fear soon realise that they don’t need to do that.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.Friends who work in the food ­industry have repeatedly told me there is no issue with supply.Especiallypeople continue to go to their local shops, which should still be stocked — and which need their custom.I am nine days into my -day self-isolating as I am still waiting to see my dad, who is recovering from cancer.And, like many others, I’m focused on the importance of being absolutely certain I am ­infection-free before I even think of going to see him and my mum.So really, I’m just sitting it out. But gosh, it’s tedious.One of the biggest changes for me is not being able to go out or see my friends. But on Friday night we had a Skype party. We all got out a bottle of wine, and I even washed my hair before we had a laugh.We are also playing the game Psych — which is great fun and played on your mobile with your mates.It’s made me realise how many of the things I blithely took for granted as being my inalienable right have changed — literally overnight.And I don’t know whether it’s a good or bad thing that my kids aren’t home with me. I’m pretty sure my daughter has already had coronavirus but happily she seems fine now.But I obviously can’t see her other than on video phone as I am isolating. And boy, do I miss her.My son, meanwhile, is with his housemates in Buckingham. They seem fine — working out in their garden gym, making meals together and playing Xbox. In fact, it’s just another day for him.I know there are people reading this who are genuinely struggling and having a seriously hard time with being isolated, who are worried about loss of income, about elderly or vulnerable relatives, or who are stuck at home with ­dficult or even violent people.It is hard to reflect on anything when we are in the middle of it.We have to focus on getting through a day at a time knowing there will be plenty of time to learn lessons when this has passed.We’ll no doubt start from the basics, like being hyper-vigilant about which animals enter the food chain, scrupulous hand-washing and reassessing our attitude towards travel — something we’ve all taken for granted for so long.We will also focus on building the NHS back up. Just as we built nuclear deterrents to protect ourselves against war, we have to protect ourselves from the ious viruses that we now know are, increasingly, out there.Yes, the important thing is the here and now. We’ve seen unprecedented events this week alone, with the PM Boris Johnson,Health Secretary Matt Hancock and Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty all self-isolating after either testing positive or showing symptoms of the virus.But what is vital is the long-term strategy to fight another attack like this in the future.And in the meantime, apart from feeling a bit cooped up, all in all I am pretty much doing OK with self-isolating.Apart from one thing — I can’t find any hair dye to cover my grey hair, for love nor money. Now that really is a nightmare.ASbeing stuck at home wasn’t hard enough, sports fans are having to get through this time without any football.Now that’s what I call adding insult to injury.As fans will already know, all football has been postponed until April . But behind the scenes, all football clubs, including mine, are doing whatever it takes to ensure the season finishes.I think everyone understands that our priority has to be the safety and good health of our players and the fans. So, while matches are not being played, players are doing all they can to stay fit and well so they are ready whenever it’s time to resume games.Meanwhile, the stadiums, training grounds and offices are all shut.Then, after April , we hope matches can recommence, behind closed doorsrequired.In the meantime, it’s a waiting game. So here’s hoping you’ve got some old Match Of The Day shows lined up to while away your time.ONE thing about us all having to stay at home is that it’s giving celebrities nowhere to hide in terms of what they have got to offer the world.They are on their own at home, with nothing much to do, just like us.Some – Joe Wicks teaching PE to the nation’s primary school kids every morning, Carol Vorderman holding online maths classes or Richard E Grant reading from the script of Withnail And I – are trying hard to provide the nation with useful entertainment.And then there are others. Instagram is also peppered with images of reality TV and soap stars in extremely scanty underwear.Without the props of stylists, red carpets and paparazzi shots, we see them for what they really are.Human beings, just like us.AS a week of firsts comes to a close, athletes and sports fans alike were further disappointed by the announcement that the Olympics have been postponed.Something that only a few weeks ago would have seemed unimaginable now feels, clearly, like the only sensible thing to do.Apart from the logistics involved with quarantine and uncertainty about travel restrictions, some athletes cannot train while some can, which, when the integrity of the sport is at stake, is fundamentally unfair.ANYONE  bored  With This Is Us my current favourite thing to watch, I’ve compiled a list of some other fab shows, just in case you’ve finished Succession and need some inspiration.Here goes – The Crown, Ozark, Luther, Line Of Duty, Sense, Grace And Frankie, Schitt’s Creek, Sex Education, Messiah, Spinning Out, Unbelievable and Mum.I WAS so moved by the nation overriding the old stf upper lip mentality to stand on their doorsteps to give NHS workers a round of applause on Thursday night.And then I read a tweet from a nurse saying that literally as the nation were clapping, she had received an email from her employers advising her not to travel to work in unorm or display her work ID.This is because some people have been mugged for these items and the very scant privilege – like an early supermarket slot – that they bring.Come on, people – sort it out. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

People think mice are a lot better, but in some ways mice are more dangerous. If you develop a flu-like illness seven to  days after contact with fresh surface water or with rats, visit your GP and explain you may have been exposed to the disease.And its not just Weils disease that vermin can bring into your homes.Mice also carry a virus which a man in China just died of called hantavirus, which is primarily an American virus but it’s a new virus in the UK, Peter explains. Mice in the UK have been found to have that virus.People infected with hantavirus will show symptoms including fever, bleeding and kidney damage, according to experts from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention.Early symptoms can also include exhaustion, vomiting and reddish cheeks.“On top of what’s going around at the moment, it’s even more important to eliminate rodents and not let them run riot, Peter says. If you get coronavirus and then get something from rats as well, it might be trickier to cure.Stockpiling throughout the lockdown has another problem for attracting pests — were all creating more household waste because people have been buying more fresh food than they can eat.And the problem of rubbish piling up outside our homes is made even worse by councils cutting back on bin collection services during the pandemic.We will accumulate more household rubbish, which might invite many dferent pests, says Jordan Foster, a pest control technician with Fantastic Services.We will eventually leave more crumbs and other food products all around the house. Mostly because we are binge-watching TV and are having snacks on the sofa and so on.So, be safe, but most of all, be smart and keep your property in neat condition because for now, it is your fortress.But its not just rats and mice that you need to keep an eye out foryoure stockpiling.Armies of ants will be drawn to the food and theres a particularly high chance of that happening as the weather gets warmer.Surplus food can attract ants as well, while it’s also likely that warmer weather is creating favourable conditions for insects, says Paul Blackhurst, Head of the Technical Academy at Rentokil Pest Control.Most garden ants are content living outside, where their main food source is sugary secretions from sap-sucking insects like aphids.However, some may enter houses in search of sugary deposits from fruit or food.This is particularly common in urban areas, where ants tend to build their nests outside buildings.Paul recommends finding out where the insects are emerging and then tackling them with poisonyou have a problem.Most patios are laid on sand, and ants will often emerge between the cracks to find and carry food, he says.By watching where the ants disappear into the crack, you’ll be able to locate the nest — and have a place to aim that ant killer powder before the problem escalates any further.To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.If youve already stocked up on large amounts of food, there are simple things you can do to keep the pests at bay.Make sure to plug any holes on the outside of your house which pests could exploit to get inside.And take care so that the food you do have is kept securely.“Keep it in metal containers or plastic containers and keep an eye on it regularly to make sure nothing’s got into it, Peter says.Don’t just leave it out of sight.

But I went above and beyond with the coronavirus, not just washing my hands  or  times a day until they were red raw but boiling my gloves as well.I took them off first, obviously, and even photographed the act, as I was aware this behaviour was a little “out there”.But, like the committed hypochondriac I am, I figured the ridicule was worth enduring so long as it provided one further line of defence against the invisible enemy which has us all surrounded.The glove thing seemed to be working as well, right up until the time it wasn’t. And, on Sunday, March , I very suddenly became one of those symptom lists you read about.Head in a “vice-like grip”  Check. Whole body feeling like it’s been in a car crash  Yes, and the bag didn’t inflate. Feverish  Oh boy, yes.  Chills  They’re multiplying.There was the cough as well. A textbook dry, intermittent hack that’s had its moments but never really amounted to much and has left me in a grey area, medically speaking.Testing has been out of the question, so to this day I still don’t knowI’ve had coronavirus or just something  horrible. The advice from Jake at  was unequivocal, though — “self-isolation” — and the response from everyone  was almost exactly the same.“Ha ha. Not much dferent for you then.”Ha ha. Indeed not.They mean no harm, bless them. It’s the classic British response to bad medical news. They’re reassuring themselves, as you need to do with this thing.If you think I’ve spent the past fortnight sat monitoring EastEnders for minor continuity errors, though, you haven’t had coronavirus, or anything like it.The thing does not lend itself to watching television as easily as you might think. Especially not during its first week when I was sleeping for anything up to  hours a day.The time you are awake you’re in a lot of discomfort and unwilling to be reminded of your condition, which is what television is now doing incessantly, while trying to take moral ownership of the illness as well.With endless spare time on my hands, I didn’t give up on the medium, though. I thought, in fact, it might be a good opportunity to watch some of those films I’d never got round to watching, like Get Carter, Lost In Translation and The Big Lebowski. It wasn’t.I hated all three of them, especially The Big Lebowski— not because they were without merit but because I had no appetite, zero energy and was unable to stand upright without losing my breath, while watching them.I shall now associate all three movies with misery, pain and paracetamol, for ever. About the same time I gave up on films, Sky’s Football HD channel played an even crueller trick on me, on Monday.Start to finish, it re-ran Scotland’s abortive Euro  campaign. The full chronological nightmare, starting with the - defeat in Kazakhstan, which I’d witnessed first-hand.A bullet to be dodged, surely  Reader, I watched the lot and, must confess, I found it strangely cathartic and quite funny, as well as sad.Because it reminded me of a time when there was a le that stretched so far beyond the walls of my own little home isolation unit.It provided a salutary lesson as well. Television is a fickle, uncaring beast and, with some honourable exceptions, like The Repair Shop, pretty useless at cheering you up in times of personal distress.People, on the other hand, are amazing and came up trumps during my illness.I’ve been particularly blessed with my amazing and generous East London neighbours, Fatima, Richard and David, who became aware, early on, what was happeningand reacted accordingly.Every day the buzzer would go, I’d hear footsteps beating a fairly quick retreat and by the time I’d shuffled my way to the front door, dinner would be sitting by my feet. They phoned regularly as well, to check on me.Until, on Day , after a couple of  dawns , the fever had lted, I’d had my last night-sweat, could think straight again and even a hint of an appetite ed.If this is being done for one miserable, solitary, middle-aged git who boils his gloves, I have not the slightest doubt that even more noble things are being done for all those in far greater need, and humanity will triumph over this illness, with something to spare.In the meantime, my isolation continues for now and —it so pleases the British comedy gods — no, it’s really not much dferent for me.To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

as they currently do not meet current criteria for testing or self isolation.British Rhinological Society President Claire Hopkins said: I have personally seen four patients this week, all under , and otherwise asymptomatic except for the recent onset of anosmia — I usually see roughly no more than one a month.I think these patients may be some of the hitherto hidden carriers that have facilitated the rapid spread of Covid-.Unfortunately, these patients do not meet current criteria for testing or self isolation.A study of international cases by the British Rhinological Society Profession and the British Association of Otorhinolaryngologyfound a signicant proportion of coronavirus patients reported losing their sense of smell, taste or both.In Germany, two out of every three cases had anosmia while in South Korea, where testing has been more widespread, thirty per cent of patients who tested positive reported anosmia as their major presenting symptom.Ms Hopkins added: There is already good evidence from South Korea, China and Italy that signicant numbers of patients with proven Covid- infection have developed anosmia hyposmia.In addition, there have been a rapidly growing number of reports of a signicant increase in the number of patients presenting with anosmia in the absence of other symptoms – this has been widely shared on medical discussion boards by surgeons from all regions managing a high incidence of cases.Iran has reported a sudden increase in cases of isolated anosmia, and many colleagues from the US, France and Northern Italy have the same experience.ENT UK — the umbrella body representing ear, nose and throat specialists — says anyone who develops anosmia should immediately self-isolate, eventhey have no other signs of the disease.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.Professor Nirmal Kumar, president of ENT, told Sky News: In young patients, they do not have any signicant symptoms such as the cough and fever, but they may have just the loss of sense of smell and taste, which suggests that these viruses are lodging in the nose.ENT has urged ministers to recognise loss of smell and taste as an official sign of the deadly illness and say they have told Public Health England about the apparent link.Meanwhile, the World Health Organisationalso said it is investigating the link between loss of smell and taste and Covid-.Last night, the countrys top scientist, Sir Patrick Vallance said loss of smell or taste was a feature of coronavirus.However, he followed it up by saying that it was up to the Chief Medical Officer, Professor Chris Whitty - who himself is currently self-isolating after showing symptoms - to change the official diagnostics list.Chief Scientic Adviser, Sir Patrick, said: The symptoms that the Chief Medical Officer has outlined - and the ones that you should self-isolate on - are a persistent new cough or fever.Loss of taste and smell is something that can happen with other respiratory viruses.It does seem to be a feature of this from what people are reporting and it is something that people should take into account as they think about their symptoms.I think it’s for the Chief Medical Officer to decide at what point,any, diagnostic change takes place in terms of self-isolation.Those symptoms we are learning about for this disease are the ones that will get more information on over time but a new cough or fever captures the vast majority of people with this illness.Its thought that losing the ability to smell or taste could be due to the virus destroying cells in the nose and throat.Experts say its something people can commonly experience after having other types of coronaviruses - such as the common cold.Prof Carl Philpott, of the Norwich Medical School at UEA, said: Coronaviruses have previously been associated with what we refer to as post-viral olfactory loss– this is smell loss that persists after a cold.There are many respiratory viruses that can potentially cause problems with the smell receptors.So far with Covid-, the smell loss appears to be transient but only as time elapses will we know how many people have a more permanent loss.US scientists also recently claimed that those with Covid- might also experience a tummy ache when they have the deadly bug.A new study, published in the American Journal of Gastroenterology, suggests people might experience digestive issues, such as diarrhoea, when they are infected with coronavirus.Despite this revelation, people should still be vigilant in looking out for the primary symptoms of coronavirus including a dry cough and high temperature - as Covid- primarily attacks the lungs and respiratory system.Some patients may also have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose or a sore throat - but these are usually mild and begin gradually.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

St John Ambulance, which is now solely focused on supporting the NHS in fighting coronavirus - only has enough cash to keep operating until August. More than  volunteers from the organisation have offered to help staff the new NHS Nightingale hospital set up in Londonaposs Excel centre to treat Covid-. The situation is drastically worse than it was after the financial crash of  - when the government arranged a £ million bailout for the voluntary sector. Karl Wilding, chair of the National Council for Voluntary Organisations , told a committee of MPs the charitable sector was predicted to raise £. billion in the next quarter. Instead, organisations are expected lose £ billion - with many unable to cut costs by sending staff home because they are delivering vital public services, such as staffing hospices to take pressure off the NHS. Mr Wilding said: Mothballing staff when demand is increasing is the opposite of what you want to do. He said organisations face losing most or all of their normal income because fundraising events have been cancelled and charity shops have been forced to close.He called on the government to urgently step, but despite promises from Boris Johnson, he had not seen details of a rescue package.I have no details on what that package will look like, he said. The Prime Minister’s official spokesman, speaking at a press briefing this morning, said: “The Chancellor has said that weaposre very alive to the issues which are faced by charities and itaposs something that we are actively looking at.  Martin Houghton-Brown, Chief Executive of St John Ambulance said all charities delivering services to help fight coronavirus should be directly funded by the government to do so. He said: St John had a sustainable income model, like a lot of independent charities that donapost depend on government. “We receive from our training business and our event business £. million a week and that helps us to subsidise our support for the nation both in terms of how we deliver to communities and to homeless services and the nighttime economy and so on. The cost of delivering for Covid- operations is £. million a week. So weaposve had £. million turned off, and £. million turned on. And whilst the NHS have been superb in their cooperation and support for us, they canapost lt this on their own. We need the Treasury to step up...to support organisations. He added: “Our entire organisation is now delivering for Covid-. And quite franklythe support doesnapost come we will run out of money.” If the charity run out of money, he said, trustees would have to make “very dficult judgements about the future of St John Ambulance.” St John Ambulance is currently undertaking its biggest deployment in peacetime, with up to , volunteers supporting the NHS and communities across the country, including crewing ambulances, working in casualty departments and supporting nurses at the new Nightingale Hospital in London. The organisation is now the only national provider of first aid to events and football matches. Mr Houghton-Brown said: It would be impossible to turn the Premiership back onSt John was unable to step back into that role. And he said the charity needs an extra £, a week to keep operating. “With the NHS money thataposs been deployed so far we think that we can keep going until August, Mr Houghton-Brown said. Operating beyond that would require heavy borrowing.  Mr Houghton-Brown said a Treasury official had asked whether or not I thought it would be a good ideawe just ran our reserves dry until July and then just knock on the door of the Treasury at that moment in time.” “I said I didnapost think my trustees would think that was a great idea. And he said many local YMCA organisations - which get most of their funding from gymnasiums - will be insolvent in a matter of weeks. Other charities which struggle to fundraise in normal times, but which provide vital services to support the public sector, will be hit particularly hard. There are large swathes of our sector who have always found it dficult to fundraise and they will carry on finding it dficult to fundraise,” Mr Wilding said. He added womenaposs charities working with domestic violence and rape crisis would struggle. Mr Wilding said his organisation, which represents the voluntary sector, had been providing evidence the sector needed help every day for two weeks. He said: “I feel at times that we are informed but not involved.

Medical abortion involves taking two sets of pills - mepristone and misoprostol -  to end a pregnancy in the early stages, but previously women have been required to visit a clinic in person to access the procedure. New home use rules will protect women by cutting down on unnecessary travel during the coronavirus pandemic but it will also protect the doctors and midwives who can also carry out the work from home. Charities had been worried that women who want an abortion but have underlying health conditions would put themselves at risk to have the procedure or turn to dangerous alternatives. Can everyone use the new system  For women who already have an appointment booked in the next week or so they are being advised to still attend as normal because the new system may take some time to set up. For the majority of women who are ending a pregnancy of under  weeks gestation, they will be able to have pills prescribed to them during a virtual face-to-face. Butit is over  weeks gestation or they are unsurethey are over the gestational limit then they will have to go to a clinic. Some womenaposs health conditions may also mean they should attend in person. Who will this benefit     As well as benefiting all patients by reducing their exposure to Covid-, there are some for whom this could be essential. It is especially important for women who have particular issues like underlying health conditions or caring for children with underlying health conditions which means they are more at risk from coronavirus. It could also help women in abusive situations who find it hard to leave the house under normal circumstances but for whom that has become almost impossible under lockdown. Domestic abuse charities are already reporting an increase in abuse under the current travel restrictions. Young women have also contacted the UKaposs main abortion provider BPAS concerned that they canapost leave the house without telling parents where they are going. Rather than resorting to illegally buying abortion pills online, the change in the rules allows women to have safe abortions with the support of medical professionals.   BPAS say it means that members of their clinical workforce who are having to self-isolate but do not feel unwell can continue to work. What should you doyou need an abortion  Contact either Marie Stopes or BPAS who are the two main abortion providers for the NHS and can advise you of your local service. They will then make an appointment for you and you will either be seen in person or over teleconferencing depending on your inidual circumstances.  If they prescribe a home abortion the pills will be sent to your address. What normally happens  Women ending a pregnancy in its first  weeks in the UK must taking two sets of pills  to  hours apart. Bleeding will begin shortly after taking the second set of pills. In  the rules were changed so that a woman did not have take the second pill in a clinic to avoid women miscarrying on the journey home from the clinic. Why did the government change the position     Campaigners and doctors have been pushing for home use of abortion pills for some time in response to an increase in the number of people in the UK illegally buying them online as a result of dficulty accessing clinic-based services, but the government has repeatedly refused to alter the rules.Last week there was an announcement that the rules would be relaxed while the country grappled with coronavirus. It stayed on the official website for four hours before being deleted with an explanation saying: “There will be no changes to abortion regulations”. But the Department for Health has now reverted to the original policy to help women who need an abortion, but cannot access a clinic due to the national lockdown.  They finally announced that the change would take place on Monday  March.A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “Public safety and continued access to key services is our priority during this dficult period. “From today, women who need an abortion up to ten weeks and can’t access a clinic can use abortion pills at home.“This measure will be on a temporary basis and must follow a telephone or e-consultation with a clinician.” Will this change last beyond coronavirus  "},{"url":null,"title":"brit sitting unclaimed lottery ticket","story":"NewsBrit sitting on unclaimed lottery ticket worth £m during lockdownEuroMillions bosses have urged people to check their tickets following the draw on Tuesday March  - and have warned the winner they have until September  to claims the sumShareCommentsByNeil Murphy:,  MAR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video national-lottery-euromillions-draw-results-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,mvtTests:[ UJ- ],webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,mvtTests:[ UJ- ],webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news brit-sitting-unclaimed-lottery-ticket-\"\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWe will use your email address to send you newsletters.

Itaposs understood around  UK citizens are thought to be trying to get out of the south-east Asian country.Laos has has gone into lockdown despite relatively few cases of coronavirus having been diagnosed there so far.On Tuesday, Britons were contacted by the embassy in the Lao capital Vientiane to let them know they had organised passage back to the UK, via South Korea, with a flight on April  via Lao Airlines and charter flight company Ticket Lao. But with tickets costing around £, - and some claiming to have been quoted a price closer to £, because of credit card fees - not everybody there can afford it. One UK citizen in Laos, Sam Jermy, told the PA news agency: We almost feel like weaposve got a take-it-or-leave-it offer of nearly £,, which is an astronomical amount of money. This is going to create a lot of heartbreaking moments for people out here because people donapost know what to do for the best.Follow all coronavirus updates on our live blog hereDo you put yourself in considerable debt for months afterwards but youaposre home in the UK where you expect to be safe, or do you try and wait for a better option and ride it out in a country that you arenapost familiar with at the risk of things deteriorating  Although a number of airlines have stopped operating out of Laos, with some still flying and relatively few UK citizens in the country, it is not seen as high priority by the UK Government for repatriation. A spokesman for the UK embassy in Vientiane said: Unfortunately we donapost have control over how much they charge for that flight. They are a commercial airline, they have rights to charge whatever price they see fit. On Friday a number of UK citizens in Laos were denied entry to flights they had booked to China and Thailand.  Any passengers wishing to travel home on the April  flight are being asked by the embassy to acknowledge that the British embassy cannot accept responsibility for decisions taken by the airline and that changes by the Lao or Korean government may affect the status of this flight. It has left some sceptical about paying for another flight which they fear may not happen. The embassy spokesman said they were disappointed with airlines who had denied boarding to UK citizens, and added: Itaposs a horrible situation to be in and thataposs why weaposre trying desperately to get them out. We understand that itaposs horrible and weaposve been trying to talk to them, understand how theyaposre feeling and give them advice and try and explore options, but because repatriation isnapost an option, we have to go with the commercial flights available.

When an inidual tests positive for Covid-, the app can then be used to noty anyone who has been near them anonymously and advise them to go home and self-isolate as a precaution against further spread. The Government and NHSX - the national unit tasked with driving forward a digital transformation of the UKaposs health and social care - are thought to be assessing whether such an idea could work.Follow all coronavirus updates on our live blog hereWe need a mobile contact tracing app to urgently support health services to control coronavirus transmission, target interventions and keep people safe, Professor Christophe Fraser, from Oxford Universityaposs Big Data Institute, said. Our analysis suggests that about half of transmissions occur in the early phase of the infection, before you show any symptoms of infection. Our mathematical models also highlight that traditional public health contact tracing approaches provide incomplete data and cannot keep up with the pace of this pandemic. However, scientists behind the project say any such app should be opt-in and provide secure data storage and privacy protection.

But do we need to be taking any precautions with the food we buy when we take it into our homes Itaposs a concern many of us have questioned - with one woman even sharing a photo on Twitter of her mum soaking her entire Tesco food shop in the bath. Both the NHS and the World Health Organisationhave spoken out to reassure shoppers that itaposs aposunlikelyapos shoppers can be infected with the virus through groceries, or its packaging. The NHS has said: Itaposs very unlikely [coronavirus] can be spread through things like packages or food - with the governmentaposs own guidance stating: COVID- is a respiratory illness. It is not known to be transmitted by exposure to food or food packaging.WHO echoed this when talking about commercial products, saying: The likelihood of an infected person contaminating commercial goods is low and the risk of catching the virus that causes COVID- from a package that has been moved, travelled, and exposed to dferent conditions and temperature is also low. Stephen Baker, from the Department of Medicine at the University of Cambridge, said viruses - unlike bacteria - do not survive well outside the body, and described the risk when it comes to supermarket food and home deliveries as aposnot zeroapos but aposreally lowapos. He advised washing fruit and vegetables as normal, and said although food in packages would be unlikely to make anyone ill, the packages themselves can be wiped downthere are any concerns.NHS guidelines for washing fruit and veg can be found here. Being in shops themselves may carry a higher risk, however, with Dr Baker adding thatyou touch the same surface as someone who has sneezed on to their hands then aposthataposs going to be a bigger problemapos. Handles of trolleys, baskets and self-checkout machines are all commonly used by other shoppers, so itaposs vital you follow guidelines to properly wash your hands when youfrom the shop and after putting your groceries away.

We understand their desire to take a dferent approach, but these are complicated issues that will take time to work through. In the following days she summoned Harry, Charles and William to Sandringham for a crisis summit to work out what was going to happen next. She chaired the meeting, in which the family worked out six points that needed to be sorted before progress was made. After the discussions were over, the Queen released another statement on the issue in which she referred to the couple as Meghan and Harry rather than using their HRH titles.  She said: Today my family had very constructive discussions on the future of my grandson and his family. My family and I are entirely supportive of Harry and Meghan’s desire to create a new le as a young family.

Senior royals are alarmed at the couple’s urgency to press ahead with their global business plans, set to net them millions, after officially quitting The Firm yesterday. Sources have revealed Harry is “desperate to stop moving around” while Meghan is “pursuing many dferent avenues” with “increasing intensity”. They have set up home in another rented mansion in Los Angeles, after previously renting a £million pad on Vancouver Island, Canada. The couple are forging their new path with the help of US advisers Sunshine Sachs, who Meghan recruited months ago as she planned Megxit. Meghan has landed a job narrating a Disney movie after Harry made a personal plea to studio boss Bob Iger on her behalf last summer. In February the pair attended an event hosted by banking giant JP Morgan, which PR experts said could have earned them £,. A Palace source said: “Everyone around them, both in the family and anyone who worked for them, is of the view they would do well to take some time out, perhaps six months will do them well right now. “They haven’t listened to anyone but themselves and we are where we are. “Hollywood is a shark tank andthey are not careful it could all end in tears.There’s no protection for them apart from those who are out to make money from them. They have entered a very dferent world – one Meghan was on the periphery of in her previous le and that Harry has never once been involved in.”  Harry,  and Meghan, , will be subject to a review of their new lestyle after  months. They will have to prove to the Queen, Prince Charles and Prince William that their new ventures –and lestyle – are not sullying the royal brand. Charles will also continue to pay for the upkeep of his son and daughter-in-law and their -month-old son Archie for the first year, to the tune of around £.million. Despite their claims that they have made “privately funded security arrangements” the couple still currently have their protection officers funded by the British taxpayer. Sources suggest private security would cost between £million and £million per year, with a team of  guards costing £ to £, a day each.  There would also be some overtime and travel costs to pay. Home Secretary Priti Patel has still not decided whether the Sussexes will be afforded taxpayer-funded protection in the long term.

The bodies of mum Kelly Fitzgibbons, , partner Robert, and their two children Ava, five, and Lexi, three, were found upstairs at their home, according to Robertaposs grandmother, Maureen Needham. Maureen,, had posted a picture to Facebook of her -year-old builder son with his two daughters just days ago.  This morning she commented under the picture and told friends and family: It was Robert, Kelly and my lovely grandchildren that all died upstairs. Police launched a murder investigation after finding the bodies of the family and their dog inside their home on Duffield Lane, Woodmancote, West Sussex, on Sunday evening. Detectives said it was an isolated incident and they were not seeking anyone  in connection with it.  Kelly shared photos of the family and their Staffie dog out on their one walk a day last Thursday. She captioned the sweet set of photographs: Our walk for the day alongside a heart emoji. They show dad Robert walking the dog whilst the coupleaposs young daughters are both wearing pink sunglasses and carrying easter baskets. One friend wrote underneath: So cute, wish we could see you.  In a nod to her daughters, Kellyaposs bio states: Totally in love with my baby girls. One neighbour who lives less than  yards from the house, said: On Sunday night we were aware a lot of activity outside. The activity started about .pm but by .pm or .pm when I looked out there were upwards of eight or  police cars and a couple of paramedics vehicles with both marked and unmarked police cars - a lot of activity around one particular house in the lane and from there it just emerged that there had been a major incident at the house.  “Its been mentioned that it’s a murder. I don’t want to speculate but it’s just surprising that there has been an incident of this kind in this lane. The family are, as I understand it, a close family. The house is owned by the grandmother. after her husband died some years ago the son moved back in with his partner and they, between them, had two children.  “Recently they had been building a very large extension on the house and a brick wall outside on the frontage to replace an old hedge. “The owner of the house, I sometimes would take to the doctors or to the hospital because she is somewhat disabled, she has had joint replacements and suffers somewhat with rheumatism.  He added: “What is sad is that we don’t know who is dead over there. I get on OK with the owner of the house and I don’t knowshe’s one of the deceased or not although I suspect at this point that she is not. “There were three adults living in the house which means there is one not accounted for. We don’t know which one. “I didn’t know the younger ones that well but the son he always seemed quite calm, collected, laid back, I would say.  But his partner, I think is not quite as laid back but other than that I don’t really know and of course there are two young children they are about five and three and there is also a dog who is a Staffie. “The mother, whenever I took her out she would say, ‘he’s done this, he’s done that’ she was quite proud of the fact that he’s got on and done the building work over there.  You can never tell whataposs going on behind doors. Iaposve never heard any sound of argument coming from the house.” Another neighbour, who did not want to be named, described the small rural neighbourhood as “close knit.” She said: “There are very few of us and we stick very closely together.” On Monday, Chief Superintendent Jerry Westerman said: This is believed to be an isolated incident contained to one property and in these early stages of the investigation we are not seeking anyone  in connection with the incident.  Local residents can expect to see an increased police presence in the area as our enquiries continue.

Meghan Markle and Prince Harry are no longer senior members of the Royal Family, and are no longer allowed to use their HRH Duke and Duchess of Sussex titles. Everything will change for the couple, who have already moved to Canada and then onto LA,, including their working le, their security and even their names. But the adjustment will be much bigger for Harry who has been royal his entire le, compared to Meghan who donned her first tiara less than two years ago. Harryaposs years in the royal spotlight have been filled with ups and downs, with many proud moments and several he would probably rather forget. Weaposve taken a look back through Harryaposs royal le as he says goodbye to it. The highs There are many reasons that Harry is most peopleaposs favourite member of the royal family, and his relaxed and funny approach to engagements is always a hit with fans. He was the first to get involved in games and activities, and always seemed to really care about the work he was doing and the people he was meeting.  His brother Prince Williamaposs wedding to Kate Middleton Harry took up the role of best man when his brother tied the knot at Westminster Abbey, standing at his side as he said his vows. Heaposs always had a very special relationship with his sister-in-law Kate, so welcoming her officially into their unusual family was a huge moment. After the guests tucked into a three-course meal at the evening reception at Buckingham Palace, Harry got to his feet to make his best man speech. In her book Harry: Le, Loss, and Love, royal author Katie Nicholl writes: It was affectionate, warm and funny and touched William deeply.  The speech was peppered with Harryaposs classic sense of humour, and he ribbed his brother: aposWilliam didnapost have a romantic bone in his body before he met Kate, so I knew it was serious when William suddenly started cooing down the phone at Kateapos. Famous for his mimicry, Harry then impersonated his brother calling Kate aposBabykinsapos, to much laughter from the guests. When he said the couple’s decade-long romance was his inspiration, there was a shy smile from Chelsy, while Kate shed a tear. Becoming an uncle Harry became an uncle for the first time when Kate and Wills welcomed Prince George in July . He said it was fantastic to have another addition to the family, and that the newborn was crying his eyes out when he met him.  He told a reporter his mission as an uncle was to make sure he has a good upbringing, and keep him out of harmaposs way and to make sure he has fun, before adding: the rest Iaposll leave to the parents. Launching The Invictus Games In  Harry attended the Warrior Games in America and saw first hand how sport can help injured people physically, psychologically and socially. He was so inspired by what he saw he started planning his own version, and in  Invictus was born. The international games sees wounded, injured or sick armed military personnel go head to head for their country in a number of sports including  wheelchair basketball, sitting volleyball, and indoor rowing.  The games are Harryaposs great passion, and it was at one of the events that he officially stepped out with Meghan for the first time after announcing their relationship. The website states: The Invictus Games is about much more than just sport – it captures hearts, challenges minds and changes lives. The fth games were due to be held in The Hague, The Netherlands, in May this year but have been cancelled due to coronavirus Covid-.      Marrying Meghan Markle Harry got down on one knee and asked his American girlfriend Meghan Markle to be his we at their two-bedroom Kensington Palace home Nottingham Cottage. The couple were trying to cook a roast chicken at the time during what Meghan described as a standard typical night in, saying it was sweet, natural and very romantic. They tied the knot six months later in a stunning service at St Georgeaposs Chapel in Windsor Castle.  Hollywood met royalty as the couple said their vows, with the guestlist packed with Meghanaposs celebrity friends as well as the Queen, Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, Prince Charles and the rest of the Firm. Harry couldnapost have looked happier as he kissed his new bride on the chapel steps, with the evening celebrations continuing into the early hours. Becoming a dad Just a few months after their wedding, Meghan and Harry shared the happy news that they were expecting their first child. On the eve of their royal tour of Australia and New Zealand, the Kensington Palace account tweeted: Their Royal Highnesses The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are very pleased to announce that The Duchess of Sussex is expecting a baby in the Spring of .  Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor arrived at .am on May . Meghan gave birth to Archie at the private Portland Hospital in Westminster - which costs about £,. As is traditional with royal babies, the birth was officially announced with a notice placed on an easel outside Buckingham Palace. Hundreds of onlookers also watched from outside the gates as the framed message was put in place, describing the Queen and the Royal Family as being delighted at the babyaposs arrival.  Speaking hours after the birth, proud dad Harry said his son is absolutely to die for and he was over the moon. The couple broke tradition and didnapost pose on the hospital steps, instead introducing their son to the world at a photocall a few days later. On the certicate, Meghanaposs job title is listed as aposPrincess of the United Kingdomapos. The lows However there have also been some bad moments for Harry, and on occasion he has had to issue public apologies. Prince Dianaaposs death The most heartbreaking moment that sticks in most peopleaposs minds is when we saw a young Harry walking behind his mum Princess Dianaaposs coffin at her funeral in . He stood shoulder to shoulder with Princes Philip, Charles and William and Dianaaposs brother.  He was just  when she died in a car crash in Paris, and his hand written note rested on top of her coffin during the procession. He has since said that no child should be asked to do what he was that day, but heaposs also said heaposs glad he was part of the day. Nazi unorm fancy dress In  Prince Harry left people outraged when he dressed up as a Nazi for his friendaposs fancy dress birthday party. He was heavily criticised by politicians, religious leaders and charities after the photos were leaked. Pictures on the front page of the Sun under the headline Harry the Nazi showed the royal in a shirt with an eagle insignia on the front and a Swastika armband.  It was claimed it was the unorm of Rommelaposs Afrika Korps. He was holding a drink and a cigarette in the shot. The Prince was third in line to the throne at the time, and Clarence House quickly issued a statement saying he was sorryhe had caused any offence. The scandal came just two weeks before the th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz. The infamous Las Vegas trip Harry said I let myself down, I let my family down after being pictured frolicking naked in Las Vegas in .  The Royal spoke openly of his remorse over his wild partying, and revealed he struggles to balance his position as third-in-line to the throne while trying to have a “normal” army and social le. Pictures showed Harry cupping his privates next to an unnamed naked woman and exposing his bottom during an August trip to Sin City, when he stayed at the £,-per-night Wynn Hotel.  British-born Carrie Reichert, then , ­revealed she spent  minutes alone with the prince in his hotel bedroom. She was handpicked with nine other girls to join Harry in his penthouse suite but soon the royal heart-throb led her away so they could be together.

It has made its payment service free for person to person usage for the duration of the UKaposs social distancing and self-isolation period. This makes payments simpler and safer for those in need of help, or assisting others, during this dficult time. The Ordo NeighbourNeighbour scheme allows those helping others by collecting or paying for prescriptions, shopping or other essentials, to use it to pay using their bankaposs mobile or online service in a simple, swt and secure way. Ordoaposs FCA regulated secure mobile and online payment service makes it easier for people to control and keep on top of their finances. People shopping for others sign into the Ordo app or web service, which forwards a pay back smart request to the recipient - all you need is their mobile number or email. The beneficiary gets an email or text message about the smart request which gives them all the details of how much they need to pay - you can even attach a photo of the supermarket receiptthat helps.  You choose the account you want to be repaid and Ordo does the rest and never shares these details with the payer. To make the payment back to you, the payer follows the secure link in the Ordo message and is taken directly to their own bankaposs mobile or online service to approve the payment from their bank account to yours. You get the money straight away.  If the payer doesnapost have mobile or online banking they can pass the smart request from Ordo to someone  in their household or a close family member who can make the payment on their behalf. Ordo also gives the payer the official bank account name of the person asking for money, so they can be certain theyaposre paying the right person. Payments are direct to and from your bank account, so just as secure, and quicker, cheaper and easier to manage than traditional methods of payment.  Craig Tillotson, CEO and co-founder of Ordo, said: Every day, more and more people are offering their support to help members of the community - whether it be NHS staff or other key workers, the elderly or those with medical conditions. In the current climate, many are unable to make cash or contactless payments themselves in store and are looking for safe ways to settle up with the people helping them. Often these volunteers are supporting several people in the same street, and using Ordo not only makes simple work of processing inidual transactions.  It makes it easy for the person helping to keep track of the money they need to collect and know when theyaposve been paid without asking or having to look in their bank account. NHS worker Jo Robinson said: During this time, it has become more dficult to do those normal weekly chores like the family shop and we rely heavily on the support of our neighbours and friends to run errands for us. Having a payments service like Ordo available, makes it so much easier and hassle free to transfer money instantly to those that are helping us out.

Top boffins at University College London have released the findings of study, which had been commissioned prior to the outbreak of COVID-. Across five years, the researchers tracked three other strains of coronavirus similar to that which causes Covid-, and found cases peaking in winter and broadly at the same time as the flu, reports the . The study, published by Wellcome, states in its aposDiscussionapos section, that Our results support existing evidence for seasonality of HCoV in England with reduced transmission during summer months. HCoV, or Human coronavirus NL, is a species of coronavirus that was identied in late . The study suggests that warmer weather, sunlight and humidity may help lower transmission of the virus - but warns that winter could see a reversal of this trend. Our findings support the idea that, in the UK, we could see continued but lower levels of coronavirus transmission in the summer, but this may reverse in the winterthere is still a large susceptible population at that point,  Dr Rob Aldridge, of the UCL Institute of Health Informatics, said.  The study tracked cases of influenza and coronaviruses between  and . Covid- is caused by the new coronavirus SARS-CoV but similar coronaviruses, albeit less fatal, have been circulating for years in Britain.  Ellen Fragaszy, of UCL Institute of Health Informatics and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said: In temperate regions, many respiratory viruses follow a seasonal pattern, with winter peaks during the aposcold and flu seasonapos.  We believe this seasonality is driven in part by environmental factors such as temperature, humidity and sunlight which affect both virus survival and how well our immune systems can respond to these infections. Seasonality is also likely to be driven by our own behaviours, such as our tendency, when itaposs cold, to spend more time indoors with the windows shut and in close contact with other people.

Scientists stumbled over the development when growing human muscle tissue for grafting with no intention of adapting the technique to fast food. But Professor Shulamit Levenberg, from the Israel Institute of Technology, said she was persuaded to adapt the science to food production by a PHd student who wanted to do his thesis on it. The scientists used a scaffolding made out of soy protein to train bovine cells to develop into a three-dimensional structure similar to meat. For environmental and ethical reasons, scientists have long sought ways to grow real meat without the need for animals however it has not proved easy. It is possible to culture real muscle cells, but dficult to do so for mass production. Without a blood supply, each strip of meat has to be very thin, and with only one cell type the burgers haven’t tasted like beef. The new technique is more sophisticated, because it was designed not for saving cows but for humans. “We had developed a medical application,” said Shulamit Levenberg.

Do you keep the players ticking over on their own or rest “The most important thing, though, is the health of everybody – as a club we are doing everything to look after our players and our staff, that’s paramount.“There’s not many times when I’ll say football isn’t important but it isn’t right now.”The Dundee players have been given inidual training programmes to work on at home but, with government advice to stay indoors as much as possible, it’s not easy for some.“As a club we have set up inidual programmes for the players but the trouble with that is a lot of the work is on treadmills or exercise bikes and not everyone has access to them,” added the Dens boss.“Otherwise you’re asking them to go out and do bits in the park and the advice is now not really to do that.

Bottom of the second tier got £,.Could they not pay out the minimum to everybody right now and decide the rest later Welcome to lockdown everybody!

Of course, all clubs have dferent worries financially because they’re all in dferent situations.The least they deserve is clarity.Even in the summer it doesn’t take long for players to be itching to get back to football.The current situation with the coronavirus shutdown is a dferent kettle of fish entirely, though, and poses heightened mental health risks.For that reason, I was delighted to hear Tony Asghar say Dundee United are using a sport psychologist to help players stay positive.Clubs are far more equipped to deal with these things than when I started  years ago.My son Jack and I have been out on our bikes to try to break the boredom of lockdown this week.He’s been doing a lot of running as part of his training programme from Dundee but somehow I think I’ll stick to the pedals!"},{"url":null,"title":"managing the coronavirus shut down has been my toughest test as dundee boss says james mcpake","story":"The first year as a manager brings all sorts of challenges but James McPake admits dealing with the coronavirus from a football point of view takes the biscuit.The Dundee boss has had plenty to deal with during his debut campaign, including heavy derby defeats, issues with the law and a restless home support.Pressure has always been a major part of the role and it was ramped up during poor spells in the first half of the Championship campaign.McPake has always had more experienced heads to turn to for advice throughout his time in charge, whether assistant manager Jimmy Nicholl, technical director Gordon Strachan or someone outside the club.The current complete shutdown of Scottish football, however, is completely unprecedented.“This is one I can’t go to anyone for advice,” admits Dens gaffer McPake.“Nobody has faced anything like this.

for the dundee clubs","story":"Ayr United captain Ross Docherty insists he’s not been surprised by how well his former team-mates have fared at Dundee and Dundee United.Declan McDaid joined the Dark Blues from the Honest Men last summer, with Lawrence Shankland and Liam Smith swapping Somerset Park for Tannadice.Shankland has notched  goals in  games for the Terrors and Scotland, while Smith and McDaid have been standouts for their clubs.Goal machine Shankland has particularly impressed Docherty.“It’s not been a surprise to me at all how well he’s done,” the -year-old midfielder said.“I had every confidence in him going up there at the start of the season because he’d done it for Ayr.“We were a decent team last season but he’s gone to Dundee United and they’re dominating the league.“If he gets a chance, he’s going to score and he’s maybe been getting a bit more service up there.“He’d dried up before the league stopped but they’d been struggling as a team.“His form has seen him get caps and a goal for Scotland which is amazing.“He knowshe performs he’s going to get an opportunity.“There’s been a shortage of strikers, obviously, but you can’t take it away from Lawrence.“Boys can look at him and take confidence and encouragement, even though they might not get a Scotland cap playing in the Championship.“It’s unexpected and a bit out there but,you’re going to perform well over a period of time, there’s chances out there to better yourself.”And Doc puts a large portion of Shankland’s improvement down to the -year-old getting himself into shape mentally as well as physically after joining Ayr.The former Livingston and Airdrie man added: “With any striker when they’re going through a period of good form then it’s got to be about having confidence.“That comes from doing well and what started that off was when he came in at Ayr.“He was maybe a wee bit unfit having not done much over the summer before signing for us and he was unfit the season before – he’d be the first to admit that.“His head wasn’t right so it was a number of things but he come in, got as fit as he could and he’s just in a better space.“He was like a dferent guy to the one I played against before and, once you get that, the confidence and the ability he has makes him unstoppable in the league at times.“I’m fairly close to him and he’s a bubbly character but it’s a quiet confidence.“He wouldn’t be bragging to anyone about anything or in anyone’s face.“He knows he’s good enough and that’s probably what a lot of good players miss in this league.“He’s one where,he misses a chance, he knows he’s going to go and score the next one.”Although a dferent character, Docherty believes Smith is almost as important to the Tangerines as Shankland.“I’m not surprised he’s been one of United’s

So how did Britain look before human interventions  Dense forest  or open woodland Research now favours the latter.Plants and animals evolved in equilibrium for thousands of years before humans impacted the landscape. Essential to this balance were ‘keynote species’ including aurochs , bison and tarpan . By grazing, these animals trampled and eroded soils, dispersed seeds and redistributed nutrients, thereby keeping the forest open. This in turn encouraged growth of large trees while also creating numerous habitats and microenvironments for a wonderful ersity of plants and smaller animals.Now this bioersity is severely threatened by modern monocultures , and massive quantities of pesticides, fungicides, fertilisers and #weed# killers. It is no wonder that insect numbers have plummeted, many bird species are endangered and wild-flower meadows have virtually vanished. So could we recreate this natural order on unproductive land and save our wildle For Isabella Tree and her husband Charlie Burrell the answer is a resounding #yes#. In her book #Wilding#, Tree describes #wilding# their , acre farm at Knepp, West Sussex, that had been unproductive for years.They introduced longhorn cattle, Exmore ponies, deer and pigs but otherwise left well alone. Within months they saw a dference # most scrub was cleared, producing an explosion of plant and animal species. And where grazers were deterred by spiny or unpalatable plants, oaks emerged that will eventually form an open woodland.But Knepp is isolated. More rewilding sites are needed with wildle corridors between them to support the populations and genetic ersity essential for long-term survival.Surely parts of Argyll are ideal for rewilding.

Based on a hillside, looking down towards Kilchurn Castle, the Tigh Mor project has been developed over several years and has included many volunteers, including primary school pupils.The project has shown evidence of rural le in the th and th-centuries and has clearly demonstrated how archaeology can bring people of all ages together to help develop a site and create a wider interest in their local heritage.The next meeting will be held at .pm on Tuesday March , in the Nicoll Hall.

As we stood about on deck while the dishes were being washed a boy from one of the motor boats passed in his dinghy. He was wearing blue shorts and red stockings which brought from the Pilot the remark: #In Brodickyou don’t wear red stockings you might just as well be in Lamlash.#All but the Skipper and Mate went ashore on Centre Island for a stroll. The Major was still completely paralysed in his hind quarters but he was full of spirit and when the Bosun held up his hind legshe galloped along. It was a quiet peaceful evening with a very light northerly breeze but it was distinctly chilly and there was a magnicentsomewhat lurid sunset. The shore party back aboard the Bosun took the Tar off in the dinghy and they landed on Eilean na Beithe and while the former explored the island the latter played on a shingly shore – it was long after dark when they ed.At half past ten we began to turn in and, as always on the first evening, this was a longer business then usual as pillows and blankets had to be allocated and pillowslips put on but by a quarter past eleven we were all in bed and shortly after that a light shower pattered on the deck. The problem of what to do with the Doctor’s mattress was solved by the Pilot double banking his bunk. We were all very glad to have had such a good day for the start.It was noticed that voices were still coming from the ladies’ cabin when the last of us in the main cabin fell asleep.The Tanky brought an innovation to the Fulmar # #Quickies# # a patent washing gadget that saved precious water.We had a dead quiet night with, as far as any of us knew, no rain but the forecast was not good, promising north to north-east winds, force  to  with frequent heavy showers. The glass had continued its steady drop. When we turned out, a light but cold north wind was blowing from a well broken up sky.We had a breakfast of bacon and eggs then the Bosun took the Major ashore for his walk. The latter was possibly a little better and was able to take a few steps on the deck, but ashore on the rough ground could do nothing. While they were ashore the big motor boat with the red-stockinged boy left after very nearly going ashore on Seil Island while getting his anchor aboard.At twenty past ten we were away under engine, but as soon as we were outside the sails went up to the north-easterly breeze and we set off for the Sound of Mull. There was no sign of the swell that is usually met south of Kerrera and we got along quite well, but we could not point any higher than a mile or so south of Loch Don. The Pilot went below and brewed a welcome cup of tea which warmed us up, then we took a tack right up to the south coast of Kerrera and had a close up view of Gylen Castle and the Skipper waxed historical.Putting about again we passed close south of the Potlid Island, but when we were about halfway across to Loch Don the wind died and the strong ebb began to force us south and about the same time the rain came on.The engine was started and we headed up for Duart, but our progress was pitully slow, and indeed at one period we but barely held our ground. The Lady Rock and Lismore Lighthouse seemed never to get any nearer closing. When the engine had run an hour we waited for the first sign of the old familiar falter but none came and we began to hope a cure for its stopping had been effected by replacing the HT coil.This change was a despairing effort made because it was the only thing we had not tried, though all the pundits declare it could not possibly be the cause. The engine would either go or not go, they said, and it would never startthe coil was defective. We got one scare when it staggered for a moment, but the Bosun, who was at the tiller at the time, said we had just passed though a big mass of floating seaweed and may have got some round our propeller.As we were to prove later the cure had been found and the engine ran impeccably all the cruise and the Skipper had a lot of unkind thoughts about all the many professional motor experts who had caused him a great deal of trouble, not a little acute anxiety and more than considerable expense through their failure to diagnose a not very obscure disease.As we came up to the Black Memorial Tower Leonora crossed our bows making for Oban and another yachtpassed close by south bound under engine though by this time quite a reasonable and, for then, favourable breeze was blowing from the north-east and our sails were drawing.We learnt later that the owner’s we would not allow a sail to be set under any conditions as long as she was aboard – a pity, we thought, as she certainly was a lovely job and we felt it would have been betterthe we had decided to stay ashore.At Duart we stopped the engine and were able to make good progress, but the rain got heavier and heavier and our sandwich lunch was taken below in relays. Then at about three with the turn of the tide the wind died completely and the engine was started again. Near the Grey Rocks we saw St Roma coming south under power so we altered course to intercept her then at slow speed turned back the way we had come for a few hundred yards while we exchanged news.We heard a thoroughly bad forecast at mid-day, the wind had gone, the rain was stotting in the glassy sea, and, though the glass had come back only a fraction, we decided to call it a day so, with the Bosun the only dissentient, made for Loch Aline. As we turned inshore at Ardtornish we saw Seewolf to the north of us, becalmed but heading south, and guessed she would be joining us later. Coming in, when between Morven Pier and the Ferry Pier, the Skipper held too close to the west shore and the bottom showed up suddenly far too clearly for our peace of mind and a quick sheer out was necessary.Through the narrows we turned to starboard and anchored at half past four in Kyle Bay in a flat calm and the rain coming down heavier than ever. Gratefully we realised that it was not quite as bitterly cold as it had been out in the Sound.Seewolf came in shortly after going very slowly and Hamish Lawrence called over that he had run a big end and was on his way to Oban for repairs and to hand over to brother Alec and his family. Soon after that we were joined by a small motor boat, Saguenay, flying a blue ensign which, in view of her size, the Skipper was sure she was not entitled to do and then a little later, while we were warming up with some coffee, Lindisfarne arrived and anchored close beside us with Guy Clephane in his usual tremendousform – he’s a proper marvel is Guy.Hamish Lawrence came across in his dinghy and came aboard for a gin and while he was there Guy called over inviting Tanky and the Pilot across to Lindisfarne then sent the Pilot back to Fulmar to fetch the Bosun. Hamish gone, the Skipper began to put nine inch tacklines into our line of flags as we had discovered at Rothesay at the Royal Clyde Centenary Regatta that without them our line was about fteen feet too short and we wanted them to be right for the Queen’s visit to Tobermory.When the Pilot came back he and the Bosun got the tents up as the rain was by then torrential.We had a supper of sausages and beans and while the dishes were being done the Bosun took the Major ashore. He was walking a little bettervery slowly, but there was, unfortunately, no concrete results from his exercise.At nine o’clock we went in two loads across to Seewolf and were offered drinks OR tea, but the Skipper insisted on both. We were, however, not allowed any biscuits with our tea as to have them would have meant opening a new box and broaching Alec Lawrence’s stores. The Tanky had not wanted anything but tea, but Hamish had given her a good strong gin which she tried to hide on a shelf behind her and it was only got rid of when the Pilot took it off her hands and quickly put it to its proper use. The Bosun was drinking beer and when he opened up the tin a goodly portion of it bubbled onto the fitted carpet in the cabin.On board Seewolf were, besides the two paid hands, Hamish’s mother and his two sisters. The old lady, well over eighty, was in grand form and waxed eloquent on #The old days# and the greatness of #Belshaft#. Also on board was a great big collie who was obviously petted and spoilt beyond measure and he behaved more like a lap dog than the great big clumsy creature he was.It was half past eleven before we went back to Fulmar all in one load with little enough freeboard for the dinghy considering the conditions. There was a nasty little lop on the water, the northerly wind was bitterly cold, and the rain was as heavy as ever. As quickly as possible we got below and into our warm bunks, not even the Bosun wasting any time about it, though he did read for some time after all the rest were sound asleep."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast podcast episode 10 nessie and the lost golf balls","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWelcome to Episode  of the Oban Time#s BOBcast.Charting Bob#s progress  and discussing lots of things golfare  presenters Stephen Day, George Graham, Martin Laing and Keith McIntyre.

As part of this project the fund provided MACPool with seven aqua cycles and training from Hydrorider.Arriving early to take photogaphs of the others giving these bikes a go, any sense of nervousness was set aside as I watched healthcare professionals and fitness and well-being enthusiasts laugh and chat through their shot.After some quick adjustments to the bikes June, from our advertising department, and I were raring to go.Partially submerged, the feeling of being weightless combined with the resistance of the water as we began peddling was initially a bit odd. As we got used to the feeling, we started to speed things up, pretending we were racing the rest of our group to The Cairnbaan for a gin and tonic.Finding our rhythm, instructor Kathryn Craig began to lead us through arm exercises. Our co-ordination was put to the test as we carried on cycling while doing simple arm movements that felt more impactive due to the water resistance. Then for the real challenge # floating off the back of the bike while continuing to pedal – not an easy taskyou are short-legged but a workout that feels like it is doing you the power of good.For me aqua cycling is everything I hoped it would be – a fun, impactiveand enjoyable way of exercising. And I could still walk after it!With no aches and pains the next day and still smiling, I signed up for some of the classes.Classes y in intensity and are currently running on Tuesdays from .-.pm, Wednesday evenings from .-.pm and Saturdays from  .-.am.

Included in this is the Isle of Jura.This is as shockingly reckless as it is offensive.The Isle of Jura is not a #bolthole# as the Daily Mail has chosen to state but a very beautul island steeped in culture and rich history.On both Jura and Islay we, like so many rural areas, are struggling to deal with all of the challenges related to the Corona virus out break. Our local health services have very limited resources as it is, along side a population that has many elderly residents who are more at risk to the virus.We have seen a local uptick in people traveling to Islay in camper vans and this is happening at a time when the UK government is advising against non essential travel.Those who are choosing to travel to our islands of Islay, Jura and the many other islands in Argyll and Bute in order to avoid the coronavirus may end up inadvertently spreading it to islands who arenot as much affected in the same way as so many built up urban areas are. Such actions are as reckless as they are selfish and I would implore people who do not need to travel to our rural constituency to avoid doing so until this global pandemic has passed.Jura, Islay and the rest of Argyll are some of the most beautul places you will ever visit and you won#t find an area where the people are more hospitable and friendly but while this crisis is ongoing I would ask everyone who is not currently living here to avoid traveling here for the time being.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands ward.To the Scottish public,During this time of unprecedented uncertainty, we are all concerned about the safety and wellbeing of our families, friends and colleagues.Our hearts go out to those who have been affected personally by the outbreak of coronavirus , as well as the many communities around the world that are facing extreme measures in an attempt to slow its spread.We appreciate and are mindful of the challenges iniduals are currently facing as well as the impact this pandemic has had on our vital emergency services as well as the grocery retail sector, supply chain and producers.Like our retail partners, we want to take this opportunity to assure you that Scottish farmers, auctioneers, hauliers, processors and butchers are doing everything they can to maintain the ongoing availability of fresh, locally sourced Scotch Beef PGI, Scotch Lamb PGI and Specially Selected Pork.We would like to thank all those who work in the Scottish red meat industry and their families for their ongoing and unwavering efforts to keep our supermarket shelves and butcher shops stocked, fuelling Scotland with top-quality red meat during this challenging time.As bodies supporting the Scottish agricultural and red meat industry, we are constantly reviewing the developing situation and are doing all we can to support everyone involved in putting nutritious food on your plates.Alan Clarke, chief executive, Quality Meat ScotlandMartin Morgan, executive manager, Scottish Association of Meat Wholesalers Duncan Todd, secretary, Scottish Beef Association Jen Craig, president, National Sheep Association Scotland Penny Montgomerie, chief executive, Scottish Association of Young Farmers Clubs and Gordon King, executive manager, Scottish Craft Butchers.What on earth is going on  It was banal enough when Ben Goldsmith # English financier and environmentalist # tweeted that #overgrazing# by upland sheep farmers, was responsible for the devastating floods in South Wales, rather than record-breaking torrential rainfall.Unbelievably we now have a government official, Dr Tim Leunig, suggesting the whole of the UK does not need farming, and his comparison of the UK to Singapore in this context is absolutely ludicrous. You truly have to wonderthere is something in the water that he is drinking – could it be flood contamination Surely, every person having a full and ing set of neurons and synapses, the complete opposite is the truth, as we dearly need our hard working farming community.The UK Government should be fully supporting the farming industry and indeed, good land management. The Welsh Assembly has totally lost its way with its mindless policy of devastating Welsh forests with thousands and thousands # an understatement # of trees being felled for wind farms, and compounding the felony by covering acres of land with very limited electricity generating solar parks # Wales is not the Sahara and the sun disappears at night! Solar  will generate about  per cent of their maximum capacity in the UK.Returning to farming perhaps some kind person should tell Dr Tim Leunig that the answer lies in the soil and then lead him to a darkened and quiet room so he can lie down and contemplate the truth # wise men recognise that truth is the daughter of time, not of authority.Dave Haskell, Cardigan."},{"url":null,"title":"man-went-joyriding-borders-bus-gets-ban","story":"A MAN who stole a bus and went joyriding has been banned from driving.Josh Nordon, , of Hawick, took the vehicle from the Borders Buses Depot in Burnfoot Road, Hawick, and was spotted driving it dangerously in Mart Street.He travelled at excessive speed, ignored road signs and drovein the opposite carriageway on the night of March , .Jedburgh Sherf Court was told that Nordons father worked for Borders Buses and that he had taken the bus to \"show off\" to a friend.He also admitted taking a car without the consent of the owner from Bourtree Place and had no insurance.Nordon pleaded guilty to wasting police time by alleging his neighbour in Hamilton Road, Hawick, was arguing with his we and was in possession of a firearm - a claim that was untrue.Procurator fiscal Fraser Matheson said a \"signicant amount of resources\" had been allocated to deal with the incident due to the firearms claim.Defence lawyer Ed Hulme said his client had said in his words he had been a \"stupid idiot.\"As an alternative to custody Nordon was given a Community Pay Back Order with a night time home curfew.He was disqualied from driving for  months and fined pound."},{"url":null,"title":"hunt-master-accused-making-false-statement-application","story":"THE master of one of Scotlands leading hunts has been accused of making a  statement in support of a firearms application.David Lee Peters, , is charged with failing to disclose medical information.The offence is alleged to have happened at the Jedforest Hunt Kennels near Bonchester Bridge on April .He pleaded not guilty to the charge under section  of the Firearms Act  and a trial date has been set for March  at Jedburgh Sherf Court."},{"url":null,"title":"schools-stay-open-certain-children-borders","story":"Some children will be able to attend school on Mondayand Tuesday, Scottish Borders Council has confirmed.Among nursery and primary-aged children, vulnerable youngsterscan attend ndashas can the childrenof key workers.But the council has said thatit is possible for a child to remain at home, then they should.The local authorityhas defined keyworkersas follows:bull NHS staff engaged in the national response to COVID- bull Health and social care staffbull Emergency servicesbull Staff working in schools and early years provisionsbull Scottish Borders Councilemployees delivering key services directly in response to COVID-.School transport will run as normal,packed lunches will be provided and children can wear their own clothes.Secondary-agedstudents will learn from home, but S students may attend schooltheir key worker parents would not like them to remain at home alone.Full details on the plans can be accessed on the councils website here."},{"url":null,"title":"cinema-pub-galashiels-ask-help-shutdown","story":"The cinema in Galashiels has teamed up with a pub to ask for help during the coronavirus shutdown.The Pavilion, on Market Street,and Bank Streets Salmon Inn are calling on people to buy gt vouchers that can be used when the premises re-open.Cinema manager Andrew Poole said: \"Itrsquos vital we are in a strong position and lsquobusiness readyrsquo when the time comes to re-open, and by supporting your local business now by buying gt vouchers or gt cards this can make a massive dference to the survivability of that business.\"Partner of the Salmon Inn Michelle Douglas said the pub was going through an \"extremely dficult time\".She said: \"Buying a gt voucher will help us to keep operating as a business while the shutdown is in place.

Editor Andrew McQuarrie grabbed a torch, pulled on his big-boy trousers and joined the funhellipIt was .pm on a Saturday night and I was trying to communicate with a supernatural beingusing a pair of copper rods.Having done as instructed and asked the tools a simple lsquoYes Norsquo question, I was slightly dismayed to see the rods stubbornly remaining still, the spirit apparently refusing to play ball.Sheila, an employee of UK Ghost Nights, appeared quite perplexed as her eyes darted between me and the rods.ldquoAre you a sceptic  she asked, a faint edge of suspicion laced in her voice.I admitted that I was indeed a sceptic, but one who was more than willing to be converted into a true believer.Happy with this answer, Sheila ushered me into a corner that was, she said, known to be particularly popular with spirits.ldquoAre we in Melrose  I asked the rods, willing them to show even the smallest hint of movement.But after a full minute of tense observation, it was plain to see the equipment would not co-operate.An hour earlier, when the ghost experts were delivering their briefing, they had promised the  paying customers that ldquonothing is fabricated on the tours.The insinuation, it seemed to me, was that this would likely not be a night of high drama and theatrics.Nevertheless, I couldnrsquot help but feel a bit disappointed that my opening bid to converse with the dead had fallen distinctly flat.And over the next four hours, so it would prove, my luck would not change much.Yet, as I wandered the portrait-lined corridors of the George  Abbotsford Hotel, trying to channel my inner Bill Murray, some of the people to whom I spoke offered compelling tales.Few were as gripping as those delivered by Dawn Barrett - owner of the hotel for the last  months - and her cooking team.Among the unusual goings-on noted by Mrs Barrett, for instance, were lights turning on and off on their own, furniture moving around, footsteps at all hours and even the feeling of her hair being brushed.Asked for her views on the supernatural, Mrs Barrett said: ldquoI definitely believe - Irsquove seen and heard too much now.It was Mrs Barrett herself who contacted UK Ghost Nights in the first place, with the aim of getting to the root of what makes the hotel tick.ldquoI want to know why they [spirits] are here. I donrsquot understand how they can put lights on and off. I just want to understand it more, she said.Head chef Kailee Reidie, , spoke of an alarming encounter with a spirit who has come to be known as John, supposedly a grouchy ex-chef.As Kailee turned on the fryer one evening, while she was alone in the kitchen, her hair was pulled back so sharply that she was thrown into the table behind her, banging her head.ldquoAs soon as I turned my back on him [John], thatrsquos when it happened, recalled Kailee, going on to explain her emotions at the time.ldquoI was in shock because I knew he [John] was there, but Irsquom not a big believer in ghostshellip Irsquove never seen John - itrsquos just a feeling.Just a feeling. Well, there was certainly a sense of foreboding in some areas of the building - not least the cellar and the attic.In one of the attic rooms, we indulged in an activity called the lsquohuman pendulumrsquo. This entails three people standing in a row, with the person in the middle acting as the spiritrsquos means of communication.When the spirit is asked a Yes No question, the piggy in the middle is expected to rock forwards for a lsquoYesrsquo and backwards for a lsquoNorsquo - a movement being directed by the answering spirit.One by one, the customers lined up to participate in this creepy experiment, watched by the rest of the room with a mixture of excitement and dread.Time and again, the spiritrsquos presence was well felt. In fact, there turned out to be a number of obliging spirits, each surprisingly keen to answer questions including, lsquoDo you have childrenrsquo  and lsquoAre you happy with us being herersquo As I watched this circus unfold, I was praying Irsquod be able to endure the entire episode as an observer, a witness to the craziness.Not so much because I was scared - although I was a little, I must admit - but more because I knew what would happen.,params: .pushldquoAndrew, would you like to have a shot in the middle What followed was several minutes of embarrassment for everyone.Because of course I didnrsquot move. Not even an inch. And the change in atmosphere was so marked that I genuinely wonderedmy trousers had somehow dropped to my ankles without my noticing.Thankfully, my clothes had remained bound to my body, but any faith I might have had in the ghost-hunting process was sliding away fast.As the tour continued, taking in several other locations promising ldquohigh activity, it became increasingly dficult to muster the energy to stay alert, with the clock ticking into the wee small hours.That said, there was one incident which aroused a certain degree of puzzlement - a maglite which appeared to flash when certain questions were posed.Admittedly, that was a curious development. But still not enough to push me into the camp of believers.The more I dwelt on the nightrsquos events, however, the more I came to realise the deeper signicance of it all.Before the tour, UK Ghost Nights founder Lisa Tedstill had made sure I was aware of the crucial equipment to bring.ldquoAll you need is a torch and a sense of humour, she said, going on to lay her finger on the true essence of the affair.ldquoWe donrsquot guarantee there will be any paranormal activity - anyone who does that is a charlatan.ldquoBut we can guarantee everybody will have a very fun experience.And, indeed, while I may have left the George  Abbotsford that night without a firmer belief in ghosts, I certainly ed home with a smile."},{"url":null,"title":"council-powers-handed-chief-meetings-scrapped","story":"PLANS to hand Scottish Borders Councilchief Tracey Logan delegated control of decision-making are expected to be rubber-stamped this week.It comes hot on the heels of Prime Minister Boris Johnsonrsquos instruction that everyone in the UK should spend most of their time at home in order to counter the coronavirus outbreak.But on Thursday , in an unprecedented move, proposals to temporarily delegate the local authorityrsquos decision-making responsibility to the Chief Executive will be passed.Council meetings in Newtown St Boswells will be cancelled until September , with the exception of vital committee meetings which will be done through video-conferencing.SBC chief legal officer Nuala McKinlay stated: ldquoAs the virus makes a wider impact on public le, Scottish Borders Council must consider how to respond.\"In taking any decision to protect health by limiting social contact, it must also ensure processes are in place to enable it to continue to make urgent decisions.ldquoIn order to allow decisions to be made, it is proposed that all those decision-making s of council which can lawfully be delegated, be delegated to the chief executive to be made in consultation with members and relevant senior officers.It is also proposed that any committee meetings which do need to take place between now and October will be held via remote video links.Ms McKinlay added: ldquoThe Local Government in Scotland Act  allows a local authority to y that process and conduct a meeting by other ways.

To use it, you have to prick your finger to produce a drop of blood, which is analysed on the device.The test detects the presence of IGM, an antibody that appears in your body early on in the infection, and IGG, which increases when the body responds to the virus.It takes just  to  minutes to complete the test.The results of some of the tests on order can be read by anyone, but others would need to be interpreted by healthcare professionals.How will the test help fight coronavirus In a previous briefing, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said that these types of tests could be a ldquogame changer in regards to the ongoing pandemic.Speaking to the Huffington Post, Professor Trudie Lang, director of the Global Health Network, University of Oxford, said that these types of tests would be ldquotransformational in the fight against the virus.She said: ldquoWe can make sure wersquove got doctors or nurses who can work safely in hospitals.

It was so strange not being able to give each other a hug, as we have always done over the past  years of our friendship.I chose a walk in which I hoped we would meet nobody , and we walked two metres apart. Despite our plan not to talk about the virus, we inevitably ended up doing just that, although not all the time.The walk took us to the site of the old Byres Kirk, just beyond Ormiston. As hoped, it was deserted, and so we entered.The eeriness of current events affected my behaviour. I walked around with my friend, carefully ensuring I touched nothing. The original kirk built here in  is long gone. It replaced an even older kirk, the remains of which are hidden in private woodland next to nearby Ormiston Hall not far from this site.The first kirk at Byres was eventually demolished and replaced by a neo-gothic building in the s. But after the opening of a new church in Ormiston in the s, Byres Kirk was finally abandoned and eventually demolished in the s.But the graves remain, including war graves, and there is also a headstone erected by Isabella Burns, sister of the famous poet, to the memory of her children.It was this headstone I had come to see. Isabella was the youngest sister of Robert Burns and she lived in Ormiston and Tranent for a while. In  she was widowed, with nine children, three girls and six boys. She set up a village school to help make ends meet.Itrsquos dficult to imagine what her le must have been like, but I think the fact she was part of Robert Burnsrsquo immediate family may have given her a status and a degree of respect most women were denied.I found the stone and was intrigued by it. Two of Isabellarsquos children are mentioned one of them, Edward, died at the age of  in China.ldquoChina  I said out loud to myself, wondering what he was doing there. I saw the date of his death: November , .Then it dawned on me: the Opium Wars! He must have been a soldier. I quickly Googled it on my phone and sure enough he was serving in a regiment there.I stood for a moment, thinking about the story behind this scant piece of information. The Opium Wars are not usually a prominent part of our history curriculum, although they should be. The British state went to war with China to safeguard the ability of British traders to sell opium to the Chinese, which resulted in  million addicts there. Itrsquos a dark part of our imperial history, and the fact that a nephew of Robert Burns ended up dead in China defending state-sponsored drug smuggling by Britain seemed horribly ironic and sad. But it also gave me a sense of the connectedness we all have. The decisions people make, especially those in power, affect the lives of others in ways we will never know or predict.The memorial headstone also had a later inscription which recorded the death of Isabella herself. She lived until she was  and died in . She isnrsquot buried in this graveyard, however, as she spent the last years of her le in Ayrshire and was laid to rest in Alloway Kirkyard.Such a web of le and connection, now mostly long forgotten, revealed by this one memorial stone.As I left, I noticed the trees: oak, sycamore, beech and yew. They seemed to grow out of lost human memory, asthey were now s of forgotten stories.On ourjourney to the car, we passed another memorial stone, this time to the Polish soldiers who had been based in Ormiston Hall in the s during the war. This too is now a time of memory fading, but not forgotten, as the flowers someone left revealed.We had succeeded in a walk seeing almost nobody, except a passing cyclist at the end. Next time we go on such a walk, spring will have arrived undisturbed by human footprints. Keeping people safe must be the priority.Although it was an unusually sombre walk, we found time to laugh and see the funny side of things too. We have to live le, make the best of our time, and the times, we have.And when we can once again regularly venture into naturersquos wonders, what an extra special gt it will seem."},{"url":null,"title":"sleep-boost-prestonpans-youngster-charity-dad-supported-lends-hand","story":"Murray Scott, , liveswith broadcaster dad Mark,  mum Laura, , a supply classroom assistant at The Hub at Sandersonrsquos Wynd Primary School and sister Sophie, seven, a pupil at Prestonpans Primary School.Murray, who attends The Hub in Tranent, has a partially deleted chromosome which affects his development and brain.The condition also affects Murrayrsquos spine and hips he is unable to walk or talk, is doubly incontinent and is tube fed.Murray also has epilepsy and reduced vision, and for the first eight years of his le was unable to sleep through the night.Mark said: ldquoHe was born with it ndash itrsquos a chromosome disorder which neither of us [mum and dad] carries.ldquoHe would have been  months when we got the diagnosis ndash at that point he was one of  [sufferers] in the world.Murray is described by his family as a ldquoreally happy, content wee boy, and ldquoreally good natured.

support developers are already seeing applications for public meetings lodged without a date or venue for exhibiting future proposals.And Tony Thomas, director of APT Planning  Development in East Linton, says ensuring the building industry is ready to resume as soon as possible may mean future consultations have to be carried out on websites.Mr Thomas revealed that one consultation had already begun online as Queensberry Properties launched a website inviting feedback on its proposals for Finance House in Edinburgh.The website was launched after a planned second public consultation this month had to be cancelled and gives people a chance to view the plans to turn the former office building into residential accommodation with associated commercial and leisure facilities.And it could be the way people are consulted in the future as more companies look at ways to engage with the public without face-to-face gatherings.The first public stage of planning applications for large developments is lodging a pre-application noticewith a council informing them that public consultation meetings are being held.The meetings, which usually take place in town halls or community centres, give local residents a chance to see the proposals for the first time, talk to developers and give their views.However, that crucial stage is on hold for some developments after the lockdown, which prohibits gatherings of more than two people.At Millerhill, Midlothian, a pre-application notice for housing at Wellington Farm on land known as Dukersquos Field has been lodged with no date or venue for the public exhibition.In a note to the council, the developers have said: ldquoIn light of Governmentadvice which seeks to minimise the spread of coronavirus, non-essential contact is limited at his time.ldquoWe are therefore awaiting the advice of the Scottish Government before making any formal arrangements for pre-application public engagement.Mr Thomas said it was vital for the industry that companies were ready to resume work as soon as possible.He said: ldquoThe approach to all aspects of the planning process is very much an emerging issue.ldquoThe authorities are working hard to continue lsquoas normalrsquo whilst working remotely and this is hugely appreciated.ldquoIt will be important that as and when restrictions are lted the development industry is ready to respond quickly.ldquoFrom a workload perspective, most clients are looking to progress with projects that are already in the pipeline and to be fair the alternative would be catastrophic for a sector that feels peaks and troughs very quickly.ldquoWhere public consultation is still proposed programmed, the only way to achieve this will be to set up a dedicated website with the ability to post

At a crucial time in the survival of the language, graduates have helped create a Gaelic speaking workforce that now holds key posts across a wide range of sectors in Scotland.Sabhal Mograver Ostaig is one of the key partners in fulfilling the governmentrsquos objectives in the National Gaelic Plan, which aims to increase the number of people speaking the language and accelerate the growth of Gaelic.Many people are keen to learn more about the language because of its rich culture and the college provides a wide range of short courses in Gaelic language, song and traditional music. Ceilidhs, workshops, conversation circles and music sessions all create an encouraging atmosphere that bring together students from  countries across five continents.As a modern, innovative college, Sabhal Mograver Ostaig has excellent learning resources on campus including an exceptional library collection, residential student accommodation, broadcast and recording facilities and a Gaelic medium childcare facility on site. It also has a growing international reputation for academic research.The college was founded on the principle of being part of the local and wider community and its activities are greatly enhanced by co-operative links, being home to a number of signicant national creative and cultural projects such as Tobar an Dualchais, Ainmean Agraveite na h-Alba and Cagravenan Graphics Studio. It plays a leading role in the promotion of the Gaelic arts and culture and also offers an international exchange programme with universities in Canada and Ireland.The collegersquos graduates include Seumas Greumach , Chief Executive of An Comunn Gaidhealach, which runs the Royal National Mod, who studied the Cugraversa Comais in  and then ed for another year to study Cagravenan is Cultar na Gagraveidhlig.

Those who commit themselves to months alone at sea in the name of le-changing moments, philanthropy and legacies.It was in  that The Sunday Times announced the award of a trophy, The Golden Globe, for the first person to sail single-handed and non-stop around the world. The event was the first organised, non-stop race around the world for iniduals. Those attempting to make the journey had little understanding of how the experience would pan out or how their minds would cope with a year in isolation.The only sailor to complete and therefore win this first feat was Sir Robin Knox-Johnston, who crossed the finish line after  days alone at sea. Knox-Johnston once said: ldquoYou donrsquot really knowyour brain will stay sane. Your sense of humour is absolutely essential.Now a sailing legend, Knox-Johnston founded the famed Clipper Yacht Race, an event he started so that everyone who wanted it ldquocould have the opportunity to experience the challenge and sheer exhilaration of ocean racing.Sir Robin spoke on the current pandemic on his Twitter feed stating: ldquoBack from the Philippines, the crews now home and the boats sitting for the next - months by which time we hope this virus will be history.\"Now in self-imposed isolation for which my past has trained me perfectly. Look after yourselves everyone.A physical challenge on the surface, ocean racing is fundamentally a mental marathon. An endurance test for the mind to adapt in an ever-changing and high-risk environment.As the power and effect of the pandemic takes hold of the world, the constant change of climate and influx of data leads for new adaptions every day. This is an environment not dissimilar to the challenges faced by iniduals who take on these solo excursions.As a marine marketing agency, Gordon Ritchie, director of GRM Marketing, continues: ldquoDealing with offshore yacht racing and rowing can bring out the best in you. All of the small teams or iniduals are normal people doing extraordinary things.\"They are all well planned and determined. They all have a complete resolve to overcome any challenge placed in front of them and are determined to get to the start line ... that can be just as dficult as getting to the finish line where the risk lies mainly with the team or inidual.GRM is no stranger to supporting sailors and rowers making their way to the start line ready to embark on psychological journeys of self-isolation out at sea.The Talisker Whisky Atlantic Challenge is a -mile rowing race beginning in La Gomera in the Canary Islands and ending in Nelsonrsquos Harbour, Antigua. The race can take anything from a record-breaking  days to four, back-breaking months.This year, GRM supported two teams in this race named \"The Worldrsquos Toughest Row\", BROAR as they made their way to the start line and HMS Oardacious in PR during their final stages. In December, team HMS Oardacious became the fastest serving military team to cross the Atlantic and raised nearly pound, to provide mental health and wellbeing support to their submarine community for The Royal Navy and Royal Marines Charity. The charity aims to support personnel, veterans and families as they overcome challenges faced during and after service.Following the impact of the pandemic, mental health has arrived back at the forefront of many online and government discussions. With businesses facing collapse, iniduals facing job losses and with millions now confined to their homes, this pandemic is predicted to move from a physical crisis to a mental one.The anticipation of lockdown and self-isolation has been the anxiety-inducing issue facing iniduals worldwide as we adapt to this new normal. It will take a period of adjustment, but as in all situations and challenges we adapt, and can in time prosper.As serving submariners in the Royal Navy, HMS Oardacious shared their unique insight on self-isolation when embarking on the Talisker Atlantic Challenge.Lieutenant Hugo Mitchell-Heggs explained: ldquoAs a Royal Navy submariner we are well versed with spending extended periods of time deployed, isolated from society, our loved ones and what most would consider home comforts.He continued: ldquoSettling into a routine and being creative is fundamental to onersquos own wellbeing. Itrsquos never easy settling into a new pattern, and even for submariners, the first week at sea is often the most challenging.\"We also observed this on our ocean row, adapting to each other and our teamrsquos dynamic, to our new diet, safety culture and challenging environment. Twenty-foot waves and gale-force winds from day one was challenging, but with the right mindset we adapted and found ways to not just survive but also thrive.\"The benefits of a routine, and building things to look forward to in your day are a fundamental tactic for maintaining motivation and positivity while self-isolating.\"He said the value of a routine was that it \"provides structure to the working day, to the week and to the whole deployment patrol which can often go on for months on end\".\"Nutrition, exercise and mental stimulation are fundamental to thriving. During the ocean crossing, physical stimulation was aplentybut keeping our mental stimulation took being both creative and adaptable: audiobooks, podcasts, Christmas day karaokeand most importantly, conversation with our crew mates ndash whether it was jokes, banter or a lsquodeep and meaningfulrsquo while rowing under a moonlit sky.Upon speaking to Mitchell-Heggs and taking time to reflect, it becomes clear that in this period of crisis, we as a society have found great dficulty in the removal of the freedom to see those that we look forward to seeing, or the cancellation of events we look forward to experiencing. Holidays were the first to go, then events and gigs, now seeing friends and loved ones. What we now need to do is to find things in a simple day routine to look forward to.Your evening meal, your FaceTime to a friend, your weekly trip to the grocery store. Like the submariners who look forward to their short slot in the gym, or their two-minute shower, happiness, contentment and in the extreme, sanity, are found in the simplest of tasks. The tasks we, on a day-to-day, take advantage of being able to do.Nicola Sturgeon explains of these unprecedented restrictions ldquole shouldnrsquot feel normal right now. Soyour le still feels entirely normal, ask yourselfyou are doing the right things. Every time you think about meeting up with, or coming into physical contact with other people, ask yourselfit is entirely necessary\".What also becomes apparent when discussing isolation and its mental challenges are the importance of the snippets of communication and information that keep spirits up when iniduals are miles from the coast or deep beneath the sea.Finding a source of creativity, communicating, staying active is key to survival, as is remaining positive and having a laugh.Though being at sea adds in a whole number of dangers, the general population today faces saying goodbye to their loved ones with no foreseeable end in sight. The concept of self-isolation, a once-unfamiliar term to the masses, has now become every inidualrsquos reality.In the coming months, we will see the effects of this new \"self-isolation\" and begin to understand the trials that sailors, rowers and explorers endure when taking on challenges that disconnect them physically from the outside world.Gordon Ritchie continues: ldquoIn the light of the Covid- outbreak we should consider that we are now at the start line and all we have to do is complete the challenge and get to the finish line.\"The common outcome is that everyone will have gained a lot from the journey, and be in a much better place when the champagne is uncorked.In this time, it is worthwhile to challenge yourself, try something new, learn something, donrsquot stagnate.\"If we can do it isolated in the middle of an ocean, anyone can do it from the luxurious comfort of their homes and with that constant connectivity, muses Lieutenant Mitchell-Heggs.How to beat isolation, by Sir Robin Knox-Johnston\"Isolation can be incredibly frustrating. But it does not have to be.\"People ask how did I manage  days alone at sea, but the answer is that I was constantly busy. I had a boat to sail, navigate , maintain, steer, plus feed myself. But in that lies the answer, create a project to focus the mind and pass the time.\"If you are a yachtsman, you can learn and practice your knots, or how to throw a line ashore. If you are a landsman, well those knots are always useful.\"Bear in mind I had no one to talk with. No communications at all for most of the time, so I had to think of things that would keep me mentally stimulated. I took to learning poetry. We have wonderful poetry in the English language, but anything that makes the mind work is good.\"Now many of us are staying at home with time on our hands, we could put the time to good use. It might amuse children as well.\"Knots are something many of us use daily so why not practice them, and learn a few new ones  It will keep those skills you have learned fresh for when you can get outside and for my Clipper Race Crew ndash when you re-join your boats next year.\"You have probably seen lines thrown from a boat that donrsquot cover the distance, or get tangled on their way. I suggest you go out into the garden with a rope and practice to develop this skill. A quick tip is to make two coils, not too large, and throw the smaller one allowing the larger one to unravel as the first one extends.\"Isolation is something we are going to have to get used to for the next few weeks. I had  days of it, but I had plenty to do during that period which made the time pass reasonably quickly. So there is the answer. Create a project to fill the time.\"I cannot get over to my boats where there is always something to do, so the garden furniture is getting sanded and re-painted and then I will have to face up to the long put-off job of sorting out everything in my Man Cave, apart from sorting out our new Clipper Race schedule, of course.\""},{"url":null,"title":"Rosemary Goring  39 s Country Life  the wonders of a walk on the wild side","story":"A friend who moved from London to Edinburgh before finally settling in a village in the Highlands, was quick to disabuse me of my perambulating dreams. In the city itrsquos easy to clock up miles on foot without even noticing, simply going about daily le. In the country, much of what you do requires a car or bus. Unless you have a dog ndash and a great many people round here do ndash it would be possible to live in the lap of hills, heath and woodlands without stepping beyond the garden gate in good weather and the front door in bad. This friend can go for months without getting her crampons on.Yet it is hard resist the call of the wild. On fine weekdays, as I sit at my desk, I hear the villagersquos retirees clumping past in their hiking boots, leaving base for an attempt on the nearby peaks, or merely a gentle stroll along the riverbank. Hoolet has more than its fair share of Munro-baggers, lean folk with the legs of grasshoppers and enough puff to inflate a hot-air balloon. There are so many dedicated walkers, in fact, that it probably partly explains why theyrsquove chosen to live here. Whatever the starting point, there are enough paths and trails to carry you across the borderlands and deep into Northumberland without using a drop of petrol.Another of my northern chums ndash she works on farms but still has the face of an English rose ndash has been planning a visit with her pony. She hopes to ride through Roxburghshire to Lindisfarne, a journey of  or  miles. As she BBs her way south, she requires not just bed, bacon and scrambled eggs but a basket for her sheep dog and grazing for her packhorse.Few things are more frustrating than not being able to stretch your legs because yoursquore working, knowing that others are out there having fun. My husband is often one of them, ing bright-eyed, invigorated, and caked in mud. He could feature in a detergent ad, though moleskins and scratchy socks coated in a rich chocolatey goo are not as photogenic as grubby football strips or toddlers drenched in spaghetti sauce.When I do get out, however, there is nothing quite like it. I can either walk up the back garden and out of the gate through the sheep field towards the lower slopes of the hills, or head into the village until I reach the woods. The first route takes me past cherry trees that in summer are laden with fruit, dangling from every branch assomeone has gone overboard decorating the Christmas tree. Itrsquos no wonder the place is alive with birds, who can gorge themselves on a daily replenished source of fruit, nuts, seeds, and the insects that nibble among them. With the squirrels getting back up to speed after winter, competition will soon heat up.One of our bird feeders fell out of the apple tree last week, thanks, I suspect, to a swinging squirrel that chases off the finches and blue tits whenever it swarms up the tree trunk. I watched the other morning as it dangled upside down from the summerhouse roof, desperate to find a way into the new feeder wersquove hung there, specially designed to keep it out. So far itrsquos showing far more interest than the birds. Who knows, maybe it willwith wire-cutters Up in the woods I once followed a squirrel that ran ahead of me for half a mile, turning to peer over its shoulder every few seconds asto make sure I was keeping up. Occasionally Irsquove come across roe deer, who take a startled look before leaping away like show jumpers. These woods are my favourite part of the walk, beech masts crunching underfoot, and thick drts of leaves hiding treacherous roots and holes. Thanks to the abundance of larches and pines, I sometimes catch the scent of the aftershave my father used to wear. And, even when rain is thundering, the canopy is so dense that in here it is dry.Itrsquos another world when you emerge from cover and start climbing. Leaf mould gives way to gorse and heather and a rutted track. We once met a man leading his horse as he bent double poring over the ground. He was retracing the route where, at some point, he had dropped his car keys. We took his number in case we came upon them, but yoursquod need a metal detector out here to have any chance. Scree and boulders, waist-high bracken and swamps of moss could swallow anything pocket-sized for the rest of eternity.By this point itrsquos high enough to catch a breeze, even on virtually windless days. Out on the hilltops themselves it can blow so hard that not just untethered hats are in danger but even sunglasses can go flying. Yet blustery or calm, sodden or sunny, the view from the summit stops time in its tracks.Spread out below is a peaceful landscape of fields and trees, sheep and cattle, and the occasional dawdling car. The hazy blue Cheviot hills fade into the distance, snow still clinging. In one direction lies the nearest town, dinky as Lego. In the other the horizon disappears much as it has for centuries. On my favourite peak, in fact, there is evidence of bronze age settlement, the trace of ancient forebears right beneath our feet.Itrsquos a reminder that, geology apart, what you see from up here is a largely manmade picture, the product of aeons of habitation and cultivation. Despite, or perhaps because of, that, getting a larkrsquos eye view is a great leveller. This vantage point invites you to think of those who came before, and those who are to follow. It also heightens respect for those creatures working ceaselessly to survive, never knowing what tomorrow holds.

However, it is still important to try to make healthier choices, even during this challenging situation.She saysthe fresh fruit and vegetables have been decimated by rampaging hordes, frozen and tinned versions are just as good and will help us hit the important ldquofive a day target.Andour normal favourite foods have been plundered, she reckons now is a good time to try new ones.ldquoTurkey or pork mince will do a similar job as beef mince in a recipe, she says. ldquoSmilarly, you can swap beans and vegetablesyou canrsquot get meat. And green lentils and other pulses work just as well as red lentils in soups and sauces.She suggests digging out the soup pot to make the most of what vegetables are left ndash frozen will work too ndash while eggs are a good alternative source of protein to meat.Barry Gunn, chef lecturer at Glasgow Clyde College who often works with students who have limited experience of cooking with fresh food, says the trick is to make every ingredient count. Waste nothing, he adds.He also believes the current crisis could end up making better and less wasteful cooks out of us all.ldquoI watched my granny make use of everything she had when I was growing up, he says. ldquoDuring this isolation wersquoll see many families become masters of the leftovers.He says even the most basic ingredients ndash such as baked beans and Pot Noodles ndash can form the basis of a decent meal, he adds.ldquoWhile not everyone has Gordon Ramsay or Jamie Oliverrsquos larder, most of us have the basics at home to work with.ldquoA tin of baked beans can become beanburgers, bean lasagne, bean wraps and bean curry.For a change from beans ndash which the entire family may be grateful for ndash Pot Noodles can form the base for Pad Thai and noodle soup.Andyou buy one thing this weekend, he recommends that it should be a tin of tomatoes: ldquoSo versatile and endless possibilities ndash from soups to sauce, curries to pasta, never leave the supermarket without it.For those whose approach to food over the past week has been to crack open a bottle of Echo Falls and polish off the Christmas leftover chocolates on the basis thatwersquore going down to coronavirus we may as well enjoy ourselves first, therersquos even more bad news.ldquoIn times of stress, people will comfort eat and drink alcohol. Thatrsquos a real concern, says registered nutritionist Suzanne Fletcher of Nutrition Scotland, a social enterprise which delivers nutrition education to schools and community groups.ldquoWhen wersquore in the house working, there might be a tendency to go for a cup of tea, grab a biscuit. We donrsquot have workmates watching, so we might have a few more biscuits than normal.ldquoBut we still have to be mindful of how that impacts our health. The bottom line is itrsquos not healthy to be sitting in the house all day long.ldquoWe should all be checking portion sizes anyway, but even more so now wersquore not as active, wersquore not cycling or walking to work, and not burning energy as we usually do.Therersquos no eating our way out of this crisis either, she warns. ldquoThere is information on social media saying that certain foods are virus-busting foods.ldquoWhile certain foods can support the immune system, there arenrsquot any particular foods that will destroy coronavirus.ldquoAnd in some cases, taking extra supplements thinking they can help fight the virus could actually cause health problems.Reaching for snacks while devouring a Netflix box set, drowning fears with booze and treating the blues with slab of cake may not be the best movewersquore to emerge from coronavirus without Type  diabetes and an expanded waistline.Registered nutritional therapist Amanda Hamilton warns the current health crisis is a recipe for danger when it comes to expanding waistlines and poor diet.ldquoThere is nothing natural about this situation, she says. ldquoA lot of people are doing things they might not normally, like drinking a bit more in the house, comfort eating.ldquoOur regular structure has disappeared, and we have to put in place new habits.ldquoItrsquos a good idea to look at putting in place a form of lsquotime restrictive feedingrsquo and have a cut-off point ndash say pm or pm ndash after which we stop eating and drinking.ldquoThat will prevent nibbling on the types of foods that arenrsquot good for us, it will help us sleep better because the body isnrsquot digesting complicated food, and improve insulin sensitivity.ldquoOur immune system will be impacted by what we eat now.

Yoursquoll know him: Alan Bissett. Hersquos a novelist, performer, and famous Falkirkian, and he was one of the leading figures of the  campaign and one of its most passionate agitators. Alan and I were talking to each other because of the plansto mark the th anniversary of the Declaration of Arbroath, but the turn the conversation took was surprising. It didnrsquot go how you would expect.The thing is that, for a while now, a lot of Scots who lean towards the Union have felt like wersquore living in an age of conflict, and that the  referendum was partly ndash no, largely ndash to blame for that. But evenyou disagree with that premise, or the cause, you might still agree about where we are now: Yes versus No, Leave versus Remain, Salmond versus Sturgeon, the human race versus Covid-. Even the attempt to control the coronavirus is described in terms of conflict ndash we are at war, they say we are fighting an invisible enemy.But whattherersquos a dferent way of framing this and a new way forward  When we had our chat, Alan Bissett told me he was just as much a supporter of Yes in  as he was in . The No vote was a disaster, he said, and Scots find themselves trapped and buffeted without any control of their political destiny. Independence needs to happen sooner rather than later, he said. Itrsquos an emergency.But itrsquos what Alan told me next that was really interesting because I think lots of Scots feel the same way, eventheir actual views havenrsquot shted much. What Alan said was that, for him, a lot of the heat had gone out of the argument since . In the old days, he said, he wouldrsquove gone on the attack, but hersquos better now at listening to people with dferent views, and has more respect for them. He still argues the case for Yes, but he does it with less of an edge in his voice.Why has this happened  Itrsquos because Alanrsquos been mixing with dferent people. In , he was living in Glasgow and working in the arts and most of the people he socialised with were Yes supporters. But he has since moved to the country and lives in a small village where he comes into contact with a more erse range of opinion. Down the pubthere are going to be lots of unionists and this fact has changed the way Alan approaches things.The lessons hehas taken away from it all are interesting. Herersquos what he said to me: ldquoIrsquom talking to guys who might have very dferent opinions to me andyou start being too forthright about it, theyrsquore going to tell you to f*** off. Theyrsquoll probably see you as some a******* who comes into the pub and spouts off about Scottish independence. I canrsquot be that person. It doesnrsquot work. So itrsquos made me a better communicator and more reflective when it comes to politics. Irsquove got better at listening.Of course this doesnrsquot apply to everyone ndash just look at Twitter. The opinion poll at the weekend suggesting a big election win for the SNP next year also makes another independence referendum more likely, which will surely get the blood boiling just as much as it did in . But even so, for a lot of people, the passage of time, or a change of scene in Alanrsquos case, or the spread of an invisible virus, has made the debate feel much less aggressive than it was, and we should try to go with that. We should try to learn something from the moment of calm that some of us are feeling.I think Alan has already, and I hope I have too. One of the subjects we talked about was identity and how important it is to both sides of the argument over the constitution in Scotland. Alan said he was more aware, and respectful, of the fact that many Scots feel British and want to remain British. Itrsquos their identity, and the same works the other way round for Scottish nationalists: they feel attached to their identity and, letrsquos face it, even those who decry identity politics have an identity. We should all recognise and respect those facts.We can also do what Alan has done and pull back a little from the swing and punch of Yes and No. A good first step would be to come off Twitter, which Alan has already done ndash Twitter is merely fuel to the fury and is not the place for nuance or respect. We could also ndash when wersquore allowed to ndash socialise with a much more erse range of people, which Alan has also done. If yoursquore a Yes voter, make sure that your first post-Covid coffee is with a No voter and vice versa for unionists. And donrsquot just wait for them to stop talking so you can make your point. Listen.I appreciate some people will think all of this is naiumlve, but a more respectful conversation is more likely to produce a settled will that we can all go along with in the end and thatrsquos what we need. Obviously, Alan Bissett hopes the settled will is going to be for independence I hope itrsquos for the Union. But itrsquos more likely to be a broad agreement or a settled consensusit comes from a long, respectful, reflective conversation rather than a political punch-up. If we listen to each other and slowly move in one direction, itrsquos more likely to last. If we respect each other, we will respect the result. Irsquom going to try to remember that when I come out of isolation."},{"url":null,"title":"Marianne Taylor  How Coronavirus is exposing America   s weaknesses","story":"How could it not be with Donald Trump leading the coronavirus response  This is, after all, the man who only a few short weeks ago was playing the virus down iously as a hoax invented by his political enemies, a problem his government had ldquoclosed down and something that would ldquodisappear...like a miracle.This is also a man who stands on a  of hating science and experts, and whose utterances are weighed down by re-election. Over the last couple of days he talked of getting people back to work after Easter - a ldquobeautul timeline - at the same time as threatening to put New York, currently the worst affected state, into complete quarantine.Donrsquot get me wrong, I was relieved when the  trillion government support package his administration drew up was finally signed off. But based on what family and friends are telling us on daily calls, itrsquos going to take more than a one-off , cheque for low and middle earners for this to be anything other than a catastrophe for the worldrsquos richest country.The coronavirus trajectory is looking particularly ominous in the US, with its case rate the highest in the worldand a death rate that is already on course to outpace Italy.No country can escape the devastating effects of this virus, of course, no health service is not at risk of being overwhelmed. But as anyone who has spent signicant time there will know and understand, the US is a nation spectacularly ill-suited to a pandemic of this nature and magnitude. Even without the addition of Donald Trump.Indeed, the virus is already exposing many of US societyrsquos in-built weaknesses. Most fundamentally, the non-universal healthcare system that means millions of Americans have no way to pay for treatment should they become ill. Even those who do have medical insurance could find themselves with huge, le-ruining bills, depending on their medical history and policy exclusions. At a time like this, a complex, profit-drivensystem which links healthcare with employment status is particularly likely to fail.The notoriously ungenerous welfare system only compounds this. Many people will feel compelled to keep working rather than following instructions to stay at home. The additions to unemployment benefit announced in the support package are unlikely to provide much reassurance for those in this situation.Demographics is also key. Much of the interior of this vast country, including many of the southern states and rural areas, are poor and poorly resourced to a level that would astound many Europeans. If they are short of ventilators and hospital beds in New York, I dread to think what it will be like in rural Arkansas and Mississippi, where higher proportions of the population are elderly, infirm, unemployed and uninsured.But, as Mr Trumprsquos popularity in some of these places affirms, there are other fundamental issues at play. Many Americans distrust the very idea of the state, and their in-built inidualism may make them balk at the idea of having freedoms curtailed. They have no experience of the state having this much direct control over their lives, no experience in living memory of sacricing personal freedoms, as Europeans did during the Second World War. I note with concern that in some parts of the US there has been a rush on guns as well as toilet paper.This is also the most ided of nations, along political, geographical, economic and religious lines, which plays into a narrative of suspicion and rage. Only two weeks ago, while visiting the southern states, I spoke to people who believed coronavirus had been created by China in retaliation for US trade tarfs. Others talked of it being a plague sent by God to punish sinners.Even a well-run administration would have been up against it. As it stands, Mr Trumprsquos response, strewn with delay, contrary messages and personal insults, may already have cost lives.Despite the worry I feel for my American family, I want to end on a positive. I have no doubt the ingenuity, tenaciousness and \"can do\" attitude of people there, that other strand of the inidualism mentioned earlier, will play an important role in how the world tackles this crisis in the months ahead. On this front, I hope America continues to be the home of the brave."},{"url":null,"title":"steph-show-series-one-episode-one","story":"Channel , noonALL hail television.

If, as other experts have suggested, we could be confined to some degree or another for six months, there are going to be an awful lot of cases of cabin fever.I speak from some experience since, for a iety of reasons, not all directly a result of the coronavirus outbreak, Irsquove been confined to quarters for more than five weeks now. I havenrsquot quite reached the stage of cooking and eating my own shoes, like Chaplin in The Gold Rush, but things have definitely become a little weird.Thatrsquos the more peculiar since, for the most part, my normal routine hasnrsquot actually altered very much.Like a lot of freelancers, I hardly ever left the house anyway, even before all this started. I canrsquot remember who it waswho claimed that a writerrsquos aim should be not to go out, and real success was not having to leave your bed. But even for those of us with Proustian or ndash letrsquos be honest ndash bone-idle tendencies, therersquos a marked psychological dference, somehow, when yoursquore not allowed to.This is trivial, of course, when measured against the problems of those who are actually unwell, those who are working flat out tending to them, or those who are experiencing anxieties about work or money as a result of the lockdown.But the mental health aspect of isolating huge swathes of the population is a potentially serious issue, as will become apparent the longer these restrictions apply. And there are, naturally, implications for those with strained domestic arrangements or, worse, where there is the threat of abuse.The questions that have been asked, sometimes jocularly, about the lockdownrsquos effect on the orce and birth rates will probably turn out to have real, and perhaps worrying, demographic effects.The mathematician and philosopher Blaise Pascal declared in  that ldquoAll humanityrsquos problemrsquos stem from manrsquos inability to sit quietly in a room alone. As is often the case with the best-known apercus, Pascalrsquos broader point wasnrsquot quite as blunt as that . It turns out, however, that there is a scientic basis for the claim.Researchers at the University of Virginia, in a trial conducted  years after Pascalrsquos insight, asked volunteers to sit quietly in a room for  minutes with only their own thoughts to occupy them. The only rules were that they couldnrsquot getout of their chair or fall asleep. The room also contained a button that would give them an unpleasant electric shock ndash which they tried out at the beginning of the experiment.Faced with the prospect of doing nothing but think pleasant thoughts for under a quarter of an hour,  per cent of the men in the study chose instead to give themselves another electric shock. At the moment, the vast majority of the population appears to be complying with the restrictions placed upon them with remarkable good cheer, but the real test will come when they begin to chafe at their constraints the danger is that that moment may come before it is safe to start ing to something like normal le. That, one assumes,was the thinking behind holding off on a general quarantine until the point when it would be most effective.But notions of what constitutes normal le may sht I now find myself mildly surprised when a film or television programme shows more than a couple of people in a scene, asphysical proximity, or the concept of a dinner party, had been relegated to the realms of the fantastic.A visit to the supermarketis already a distinctly surreal experience, evenyoursquore lucky enough to locate eggs or toilet roll.Even with plenty to read, watch or listen to, and even though many of us are still able to work, more or less as usual, from home, it turns out to be surprisingly dficult to do nothing.A few motivated souls, like the Abbeacute Faria in Monte Cristo, may be galvanised by their confinement into self-improvement, but I think that most of us,wersquore honest, know in our heart of hearts that wersquore not actually going to spend the next couple of months productively, learning a language or a musical instrument, and probably not even clearing out the cupboard underneath the stairs.Indeed, we should all be praying that some projects never get off the ground, or wersquore going to get, for one thing, lots of very bad novels with titles like Love in the Time of Coronavirus.Itrsquos possible that people might get better at cooking, since being cooped up tends to make you start thinking about what to have for dinner shortly after breakfast. The dficulty is that you wonrsquot have the ingredients, since a large part of effective cookery is daily shopping, which we canrsquot do any more. About the best we can hope for is that someone comes up with an exciting new recipe involving dried pulses.We constantly seek ersion and activity, though part of us knows that they make us wretched we know that happiness is found in rest and not excitement, but we remain restless.

But in these unprecedented times, there is a need to ensure we can continue with the most essential operations with a limited workforce during the weeks and months ahead.“We ask all businesses and householders to be considerate during this time and to make every effort to minimise the waste that is put out for collection, bearing in mind that higher than normal volumes can cause delays and missed collections for other households and businesses.“We are extremely grateful for your co-operation during this dficult period and also for the efforts of our office and depot staff, crews and drivers, who are already going above and beyond in providing vital waste collection services under extremely challenging conditions.”Any further changes will be announced through local media, on the Council website and using OIC’s social media channels.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Orkney Islands Council agreed to name the development #Liberator Drive# to remember the event.Due to current restrictions it was impossible to hold a formal commemoration at the site today, but Norwegian Consul Leslie Burgher placed flowers there today to mark the anniversary, saying that it is hoped to mark the event again on a future date.You canabout the story at http:crashsiteorkney b-h---walliwall or in Dave Earl’s book, ‘Almost Home’ which is available from William Shearer in Kirkwall amongst other outlets. vw, px\"  copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This is actively being considered at a regional level.Although there has been considerable modelling done within the Trust to look at how we might maximise available critical care capacity within our own hospitals, it would be premature for us to say anything more at this point given that things could change very quickly.”The Trust is also prioritising its resources to support the most vulnerable in the community. This has involved reviewing all Domiciliary Provision with families to identy what care they are able to provide for their relatives in these exceptional and very challenging times. This should free up domiciliary capacity to focus on those who require critical care which cannot be met by any other means during this COVID- period.Commenting, Phil Hughes, the Trust’s Director of Community Care said:“We will work with families to arrange for contingency placements in care homes on a temporary basis for iniduals where there is concern that the level of frailty and risk would indicate that this is the most appropriate way to provide care during this period or where the current care arrangements are unable to be sustained.We are also working to increase capacity in the community or care placements within our own community hospitals and residential units, in addition to working with the care home sector.The stepping down of non-critical interventions is allowing us to free up capacity of community nurses, social workers, care staff and Allied Health Professionals.”The Trust has also been working in partnership with GPs in primary care to set up COVID- Centres as part of a network across the region to manage the increased incidence of Coronavirus cases in the community. New centres will open in Antrim, Ballymena and Coleraine and the emphasis will be on patient safety, staff safety and the provision of a sustainable primary care service.The new centres will not be testing facilities and will only be for patients who are very unwell, are suspected of having COVID- and require medical attention.Patients will not be able to report directly to these centres without being referred by their GP or Out of Hours provider.The Centres will help to free up GP services to deal with the COVID- pandemic, whilst balancing the need for primary care services to continue with the minimum of disruption.

Its absolutely ridiculous. Nobody goes to a graveyard in large groups to have social gatherings!People go to have a quiet moment with a loved one and are then on their way again!

However, instead of finding fault, I will accept this new ruling as a neccessary action for our continued safety.Many of you dont seem to have thought about those people who have died of the virus and the need to bury them as well. Remember we had the comfort of being present when our loved ones were buried or cremated - the families of those dying with Covid- will not get this andthe council need to keep the public out for safety then respect this request.They are not asking to upset you or infringe on your actions.

It’s time, she said, for the people to “embrace the spirit of Northern Ireland”.Just what the “spirit of Northern Ireland” is Squinter’s not sure. So let’s see , with the benefit of close-on  years of experience, we can see how the spirit of Are Wee Country might be redeployed in the time of coronavirus.HYGIENE vw, px\"  Troubles washing protocols for handling weapons and explosives should be resumed. A y bath and hair wash are not necessary because while gunpowder residue in your hair was always a problem, coronavirus in your hair is not. Scrub the hands thoroughly with hot soap and water, but remember, it is no longer necessary to pay particular attention to your shooting arm and hand. Both require equal attention. If you’ve kept your balaclava it could be the best decision you’ve made since you said yes to the Northern Bank job. Since hand-to-face contamination is a principle spreader of the virus, your balaclava will go a long way to keep you safe. And as face masks are dficult to access, the thick wool of the balaclava makes an excellent makesht virus filter.SOCIAL DISTANCINGIt’s reported that the car parks at Tyrella beach, Helen’s Bay and Murlough Bay were packed to overflowing at the weekend, with some tourist attractions experiencing record footfall. Although the advice is that people should remain two metres apart, crowds have been assembling in the face of the growing Covid- threat. Retired senior RUC and British army figures with long experience of, ah, public order have been employed as consultants to advise the forces of law and order on how best to deploy the Spirit of Northern Ireland during times of public non-compliance. Water cannon deployed most recently at Woodvale during the Camp Twaddell national emergency are available and ready to go with a : water-bleach ratio. Baton charges are being rehearsed at the PSNI training centre at Garnerville with officers wearing hazmat suits instead of riot gear and with temperature gauges on the end of their batons. Plastic bullets are an option but will only be used as a final resort in order not to put to too much pressure on morgues and paediatric intensive care units.STOP AND QUESTION vw, px\"  Is this your car, sir  The glory days of #Northern Ireland#If you’re on your way to the shop, out for your one walk per day, oryou’re an essential worker en route to or from your job you may be stopped and questioned by the police – or even later by the British army, depending on how the crisis pans out. If you are under the age of  and you are in your car and you are asked ‘Is this your car, sir madam ’ do not be surprised. Do not offer a humorous response . Comply with all requests and be sure to keep your hands in sight at all time.

Those out walking or driving while Irish should be aware that some names may lead to certain complications in your dealings with the RUC – sorry, PSNI – and the British army. Again, younger people should consult with parents grandparents on how to address this tricky problem, butthey advise you to pretend you’re called Norman or Pamela, be aware that society has changed considerably in the quarter of a century-plus since the ceasefires and you are probably best placed to pick your own non-Irish name.

Dr Scally called for the island of Ireland to work as one unit in the fight against the virus in light of dferent health policies being taken on both sides of the border, a problem he describes as potentially very serious. The advice to someone in Lford with symptoms of the disease is to self-isolate for a minimum of  days – a stone’s throw away in Strabane the advice is isolation for seven days, he said, writing in Theon Tuesday. The Belfast-born doctor, who conducted the Scoping Inquiry into the CervicalCheck Screening Programme in the Republic, said a major dference which stands out is that the Republic is using widespread community testing, while in Northern Ireland and across the UK, testing is largely reserved for hospital inpatients and health service staff. He wrote: In the Republic with its network of over  community testing facilities, the aim is to reach , tests per week by the end of April, whereas the North has set a goal of performing just under , tests per week.It comes as Tanaiste Simon Coveney is expected to hold a teleconference at midday on Tuesday with the Northern Ireland Secretary of State and Stormont’s leaders Arlene Foster and Michelle O#Neill to discuss ongoing cooperation to deal with coronavirus.It will be the first time Mr Lewis will be involved in cross-border cooperation discussions.Dr Scally criticised the approach of Whitehall, which he said does not want people learning about the views of WHO and the successful efforts to control the virus in other countries. The public health expert accused the UK of having ignored the experience of other countries while the Republic has watched and learned from the experiences of South Korea and China in controlling the disease. He expressed disappointment that Northern Ireland had followed the advice from Whitehall, along with devolved government in Scotland. The unied approach held firm even when it was revealed by the small coterie of senior officials guiding policy that their actual aim was for the population to actively develop “herd immunity”.It is an approach that is regarded by many senior public health physicians as dangerously flawed, he said, saying the key aim of the battle against the virus is to gain time to develop a vaccine and allow the summer weather to mitigate the spread, he said. Calling for Northern Ireland to decouple themselves from the Whitehall approach, he saidthis does not happen, a larger percentage of the population here may be infected earlier and due to pressure on the health service, deaths may be higher. He saidtravel, education and work restrictions are lted at dferent times in dferent parts of the island, there could be another mass outbreak. It is a big ask, but now is not the time to be captives of our histories. Lives can and should be saved, he said.

However that earned a rebuke from Environment Minister Edwin Poots who said the council had a legal responsibility to collect the bins.On Sunday the council rowed back saying it would collect brown bins for food and garden waste and on Tuesday announced all bins would be collected.A spokesperson said the matter was at all times under review and new measures had been put in place to allow the council to offer as near a normal waste collection service as possible in the current unprecedented circumstances.Belfast Lord Mayor Councillor Daniel Baker paid tribute to frontline staff who have been working to overcome operational challenges to ensure delivery of a waste collection service for residents.Councillor Baker added: “We continue to review our service delivery daily and following the introduction of additional measures to enhance the protection of our refuse collectors, we are now in a position to deliver as near a normal waste collection service as possible in the current unprecedented circumstances. From Wednesday, April , normal collections will resume for black, brown and blue bins across the city.“We must emphasise, however, that given the size and scale of Belfast’s waste collection service, the situation remains challenging, and our entire operation remains under daily review and is dependent on the ongoing impact of Covid on our own employees.”Belfast City Council serves the largest geographical area out of all the  councils in Northern Ireland and has the largest population.Councillor Baker added: “Delivering our waste collection service has been possible due to staff from across the organisation being trained and redeployed to our frontline services. We have also fitted special screens in our bin lorry cabs to allow staff to practice social distancing, as directed by the government guidelines.“We would like to thank residents for their continued support and patience as we try to minimise service disruption in these most challenging of circumstances.“We would also ask thatpossible, please share this update with neighbours who may not be online, either by text or phonecall – particularly those who are older or more vulnerable.”Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Linda Stewart speaks to three frontline staff who are staying away from their dwellings to protect their loved ones.The AE nurseAE nurse Ruth McGreevy , from Newtownards, has moved into an Airbnb accommodation in Bangor in order to protect her mum and siblings who fall under the high risk category. Her boyfriend is Philip , a computer technicianAE nurse Ruth McGreevy has had fond memories of the Ulster Hospital since childhood when she was a frequent visitor due to her asthma.Now on the frontline in the fight against coronavirus, the -year-old from Newtownards is poised for the toughest battle of her le as the hospital prepares for a flood of patients hit by coronavirus.Although patients infected with Covid- have already started to appear at the Ulster Hospital - and there have been some deaths - there is still a sense that it is the calm before the storm.We shut down a bit of the AE to cater for people coming in, where we could call people in and treat them, send them to the ward or send them home. And then the past couple of weeks we#ve been closing off more and more of the AE, Ruth says.We#re all very nervous. I don#t even think it#s about the people coming in - people are worried about taking it home Ruth McGreevy, nurseObviously, the doctors and the managers are concerned that it#s coming because they#re shutting it down and we#re getting more in-depth training on how to deal with the really sick patients that come in. So it#s a bit scarier now that all this is taking place - everyone#s on tenterhooks just waiting for this to hit.All the wards have been emptied out to deal with this when it arrives and it#s quite bizarre lately going to the ward and seeing lots of empty beds, because that hasn#t happened in years.The staff have been getting special training in the personal protection they will wear, including masks, aprons and gloves.And then there are things like infection control, how to stop the spread. We#re learning how to work ventilators and respiratory equipment, Ruth says.That#s quite daunting - nurses generally wouldn#t really be doing much of that, but now we#re being taught it just in case we get into the circumstances where we might have to use them.We#re all very nervous. I don#t even think it#s about the people coming in - people are worried about taking it home.We all have families at home and sick people and children and things. You#re so scared of walking it back into your house, because you never know what will happen. You hear of people getting younger and younger with no medical history who are dying from this, so it#s scary.Ruth has a long association with the Ulster Hospital - she was born prematurely and had bad asthma when she was young, and spent a lot of time in the hospital.I just had lots of admissions with my chest as I had quite a lot of asthma attacks, so I was just in and out with that into Maynard Ward. They were always so nice and kind and my sister Eleanor was quite unwell as a child, so we spent a lot of time visiting her when I was little - I was just always around hospitals.It was this early experience that spurred her to become a nurse.I was struck with just how much a bit of kindness can do for someone, Ruth says.You can be so unwell and someone just giving you a nice smile or being kind - the smallest gesture can go a long way. Making someone a cup of tea sometimes goes a lot further than any other medication you can give them. with her mum and sisters\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph le features ab .ece AUTOCROP w --_l__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph le features ab .ece AUTOCROP w --_l__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph le features ab .ece AUTOCROP w --_l__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph le features ab .ece AUTOCROP w --_l__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph le features ab .ece AUTOCROP w --_l__I.JPG w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   with her mum and sisters\"Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClose with her mum and sisters\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph le features ab .ece AUTOCROP w --_l__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph le features ab .ece AUTOCROP w --_l__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph le features ab .ece AUTOCROP w --_l__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph le features ab .ece AUTOCROP w --_l__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph le features ab .ece AUTOCROP w --_l__I.JPG w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   with her mum and sisters\"Close family: Ruthwith her mum and sisters FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappClose family: Ruthwith her mum and sistersAfter leaving school, Ruth went to Queen#s University Belfast and worked as a healthcare assistant while studying to be a nurse. She is now an adult-trained AE nurse in the Ulster Hospital.Basically, it#s people walking in unwell, so it#s like doing bloods and ECGs, trying to figure out what#s wrong with people. Lately, I#ve been dealing with cardiac arrests and things like that, dealing with car accidents.Ruth lives with her mum Belleand sisters Sarah , Eleanorand Kirsty .In the past week she has been forced to make the dficult decision to move away from her family in order to protect them from the danger of infection.I#m the youngest, and I didn#t want to do it but my mum is , and she#s diabetic and has high blood pressure, Ruth says.My oldest brother Alex recently had four strokes and he was on chemotherapy treatment with quite an unusual disease that he has - nobody#s really heard of it. So he#s on chemotherapy and he would have quite a low immune system. My sister Eleanor has MS and my sister Kirsty is on immunosuppressant drugs for a stomach problem. I feel like a walking super-virus going into my house.I was thinking about it for a few weeks but I hadn#t really talked to my mum about it - I didn#t want to bring it up until I thought it was really necessary.But in the last week especially I noticed that a lot of the patients I#ve been looking after had been going off to the ward and were taken very unwell or there were people passing away. So, in my eyes I could see it escalating quite a lot and I felt like it was time to go. Ruth says her family was very upset that she had to move out. She was the youngest and had never been away from home for a long period of time.I#m only moving to Bangor - it#s not far but it#s more that I can#t come into the house and have a proper conversation with them, she says.My mum was very upset about it - she#s just worried. She keeps saying she might not see me again.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseRuth with boyfriend Philip Ferguson FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappRuth with boyfriend Philip FergusonRuth keeps in touch with her family and her boyfriend Philip , a computer technician, using video chat.I haven#t seen him in a month, she says.Along with another nursing colleague, Ruth has moved into an Airbnb accommodation at Gray#s Hill in Bangor thanks to the generosity of the couple who own it.They#ve given us the use of their house completely rent-free which is amazing - it#s so kind, she says.The kindness we#ve been shown at the moment is immense - like every day there#s more things being sent off to us. We#ll keep laughing, saying we#ll be rolling out of here after coronavirus because people are feeding us so much.We#re getting pizzas and doughnuts, and a big coffee van was up the other day giving everyone free coffee and sandwiches and everything. People are donating hand creams because we#ve washed our hands until they#re cracking and bleeding - people are giving us everything.The toughest thing just at the moment is all the new training, Ruth says.They#re saying things are going to get a lot harder for us because obviously this disease is airborne, so it#s when we go into the big proper masks that it will be scary.You#re just aware that you can#t take them off, she says.It#s just the fear in people#s eyes because they#re not allowed any visitors. So it#s trying to comfort those people - they#re so unwell and scared, and they can#t have anyone in their family with them.All you can do is just try and be as kind and caring as you can, staying with them, explaining why it#s happening, why their family can#t come in, we#ll look after them the best we can. It#s just being there to hold their hands when they need it.Ruth pays tribute to all the staff who are doing their bit to combat the disease.It takes an army in here, she says.To move a single patient to the ward, the whole corridor has to close because obviously people can#t walk into the corridor when you#re moving - so the amount of porters it takes and then the whole area has to be cleaned after one patient moves. The amount of people it takes to move one person is crazy. And you couldn#t do it without everybody - the teamwork going on at the minute is amazing.I know the Down AE has closed, so the staff from the Down AE have just come up today to the Ulster. So that#s extra doctors and extra nurses coming up, which is great.Ruth says the whole thing is very scary but the key thing is to try to keep positive.It#s all going to be over soon hopefully andwe all just do as we#re told it will be over sooner rather than later, hopefully, and we#ll come out the other side, she says.It really does prove how great everybody is that works for the NHS, not just nurses. We#re being supported at the minute, but it really isn#t just us - it#s everybody.

Each one of those would have put him in the at-risk category but the two together complicate things a bit more.Over the weekend the couple discussed the risk and made the dficult decision that Maria should move out.Because I#m still working and I#m out and about in contact with people, we decided the risk was too high, she says.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseForced separation: Maria McNamee and partner Gareth FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappForced separation: Maria McNamee and partner GarethEven before I moved out we were practising a bit of social distancing at home - we had moved into separate rooms and we stayed in separate parts of the house.I really thought we could just continue to do that - we didn#t go out with friends, we didn#t have people calling.We genuinely thought this would have been OK but the more we learned about the virus and how it is transmitted, it was like a bang at the weekend.The dficult thing is not knowing how long it#s going to be for -someone said it would be for #X# amounts of weeks it would be easier, but it#s not knowing when I#m going back to my own environment Maria McNamee, social workerIt was a really tough thing to do and we just felt it had to be done.We made the decision over the weekend and I packed my bags and left for work on Monday morning, not toreally.

I am so lucky with what I have here - for others out there, it must be so hard for them.The paramedicParamedic Rab McCoy , from Coleraine, has moved into a BB to protect vulnerable family members from infection.

Consequently, the media are also in his thoughts. Now, however, the Covid- survivor has become a medium himself. His live Facebook broadcast, during which he begged the Lord to heal our land of coronavirus, began on Monday evening at .pm - with the precise timing inspired by the Bible .I want to send out a message of hope, encouragement and thanks, he said. And I wanted to offer up prayers for the NHS, the doctors and nurses on the frontline, as well as other key workers including retail staff, for providing us with food, and pharmacies for ensuring we have medicine.I also prayed for teachers because they#re allowing NHS staff to go to work, and for the media for getting vital news about this virus out to the public.I want to unite Northern Ireland with a message of hopeEqually, I prayed for those who are self-isolating because they are on their own.It#s based on this verse from the Bible: #If my people who are called by my name humble themselves, and pray and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from Heaven and will forgive their sin and heal their land#.Pastor McClurg, who preaches at the Elim Church in Newtownards, where he lives with his family, said he intends to have a prayer broadcast all week.Every night on Facebook I#ll be praying and anyone who wants to can join in, he said.I want to unite Northern Ireland with a message of hope.But the father-of-three is not technically #working at home#.Since he left hospital, after a -day period during which he was critically ill, he has been self-isolating from his family at a friend#s house to protect his -year-old we and their three children - Liliannaand twin boys Josiah and Judah .Claire and I made the dficult decision that I would stay away for seven days, he said.

I#m alive and I#m one of the blessed ones.Some people who get coronavirus have mild symptoms - like a cough, headache and pains - but I was critical. I couldn#t breathe. I thought I was going to die a couple of times. I understand why people with underlying health conditions may struggle more with this disease. I#m ft  tall, a big, strong, fit and healthy strapping man who doesn#t drink or smoke and I ended up in ICU because it was dficult for me to breathe.Pastor Mark revealed that doctors and nurses from all over the UK have been in touch with him privately in recent days.They have been privately contacting me to thank me for reinforcing the message about social distancing and also for the gratitude and recognition I#ve given them for the work they#ve been doing for me and all the other coronavirus patients, he said.People in the Ulster Hospital have been in touch to say they looked after me while I was in the ward and I#ve been able to thank them personally for saving my le.

At first it may have seemed a bit like we needed to plan for the kids asit were a school holiday, but the level of social distancing required has meant that few of the things we normally do during holiday times are feasible. The fact that we must currently forbid social gatherings for our children may also be provoking some nervousness for parents, as we worry that all of this isolation may impact on our children#s sociability and the social and emotional development that is usually promoted by hanging out with, and playing with, their friends.Evenwe arrange to go for walks and come across other families we know, we have to keep at a distance that prevents the usual running around, hugging, tumbling, or horseplay that might occur in their play together. So, in their play, they won#t have any of the usual physical closeness that they might have enjoyed with friends.There is no doubt that the next whilewill be testing for children as they will miss out on lots of social interaction with their peers that they would normally have had. No birthday parties, no sleepovers, no playdates, no knocking for friends, no organised sports. It feels like a very signicant loss.I never thought I#d see myself write this, but suddenly technology and social media has real value for our social communication. While it is a dferent form of social connection, it does now play an increasingly important role in allowing our children and teenagers to stay in touch with friends, while maintaining the social distance needed to slow the spread of Covid-.While there is no doubt that this new social etiquette will impact on how we and our children can physically connect with our friends and extended family, the social distancing that we must practise, doesn#t have to lead to an emotional distancing or disrupt children#s emotional development.It is still really important, unless you are feeling unwell or need to socially isolate , that we maintain physical closeness in our families. Our children still need a loving touch from their parents. They need hugs, foot rubs and cuddles. Touch is such an important part of our social experience that our children cannot do without it for months. While our children may not be able to play with their friends, we can still promote their emotional development. In fact,we are all thrown together at home for extended periods there is more opportunity than ever to help children to learn about their feelings, to express those feelings and to process them healthily.Empathy is the mechanism by which we help children to develop emotionally. Le will provide children with the experiences that will provoke emotions. Our job is to help them to make sense of those emotions. The best way to understand what I am talking about might be for me to explain using an example. Let#s imagine you have a nine-year-old son, who is, by now, bored with being at home, restless, and perhaps cross that he can#t meet his friends. If he comes to you pleading, again, to be allowed to at least meet his friend just for a few minutes, many of us may have lost patience and may end snapping back at him, that he just can#t and to stop moaning, stop asking, let it go. While this is a natural response to our own frustration and stress of trying to manage the strange circumstances we find ourselves in, it does little to help our son deal with his feelings.If we can manage to regulate our frustration, a better response is to say something like: You sound really desperate to be able to see your friend. I#m guessing it is really disappointing that we have to keep apart from people we want to spend time with. You may be really cross that this virus seems to be spoiling our lives.There are a few things to notice about this response. The first is that we haven#t asked any questions about his feelings. This is because he is only nine and so he may feel put on the spotwe ask questions. If he doesn#t know how he feels, he may actually get more frustrated by being probed, since he will experience the social expectation that he should reply.Secondly, we don#t assume to know how our son is feeling. We are just guessing how he feels. So the you sound desperate... and you may be really cross... are phrased as statements and, importantly, they leave room for us to be wrong.A third thing to notice is that the statements don#t try to fix the problem created by social distancing, they simply recognise and help the child to identy, more accurately, the feelings it may create. A fourth thing you may have spotted is that the phrasing not only tries to guess at his feelings, but it also tries to guess at what may be generating those feelings . Sometimes we can be reluctant to do this, fearing that we may put ideas in their heads. However, we usually are very attuned to our children andthe thoughts are likely to be there already then it is very helpful for us, adults, to name those thoughts and feelings. If we are wrong, children still value the fact that we are trying to understand and may then be able to verbalise their actual feelings or thoughts, knowing that we have opened the door to these kinds of important conversations.There are no easy solutions to the problems or frustrations that our new way of interacting creates. But helping children to understand and voice their feelings will also help them to develop socially and emotionally.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Ulster Carpets said it had been very disappointed by some of the ill-informed commentary used against the company.We would request that this would cease as it has created an atmosphere in which abuse and threats have been issued against many of our employees, a company spokesman said.Mr Murphy said the claims of Sinn Fein activists targeting businesses were without substance.Of courseyou#re aware of accusations which are essentially of criminal behaviour, you have an obligation to report those to the police and I hope you have rather than simply bring them here for publicity purposes, he said.

In the s, she was scouted by one of Americas biggest record labels and asked to name her price.She shared the stage with the likes of Stevie Nicks, Sheryl Crow and the Dixie Chicks, and rubbedshoulders with A-list actors.Noella is great at telling stories, and she has hundreds - living round the corner from Ben Affleck, hanging out with with Winona Ryder, and partying with Hugh Heffner at the Playboy MansionHer le in America was the stuff dreams were made of, with a critically acclaimed album, sold out gigs, luxury hotels and chauffeurs.But why didnt we know about about all this I didnt tell anyone, she shrugs.Probably because she didnt care you can see why the A-list fell for her, the beautul Irish girl who was deeply unimpressed by fame.The signs were there from an early age that Noella liked to do things her own way.She was asked to leave her local folk group aged  over creative dferences.I forgot my song book, but I didnt need it. I knew every song, she laughs, taking a drag of her vape.The teacher told me to go and get my book. I said, I dont need it and she said, Go and get your book and I said, Shove it up your arse.She came back looking for me, but I never went back.Derry was always going to be too small for Noella and at  she headed to London with her guitar on her back and gigs with the likes of Van Morrison already under her belt.There was nothing here in , she says.I would have done anything to escape.Not long after she arrived, The NoellaHuttonBand landed a residency at Madame JoJos, a legendary Soho strip club frequented by actors and popstars.Youd have people like Robbie Williams, theyd all come in there mincing about, says Noella.Before we went on wed be sitting in the green room with two totally naked strippers.But it was just normal. It wasnt a big deal. It was just work and they were so professional.Mariah Carey came in one night and she tried to move my friends from the front seats and I said, Naw, thats my friends there.She asked meI had a demo and I said naw. Honestly, I just didnt want to give her anything, she smiles.Boy George was another regular and after watching her play, he asked her to sign to his label More Protein.He said to me, No one has ever scared me before, but you scare me, she recalls.So, you signed with Boy George Naw.One of things he said to me was, So, youre a big dyke then That got my back up right away. I said George, my sexuality has got f**k all to do with what I am.Its such a small, small part of who I am.And its really nobodys business. It wasnt because I was ashamed, I just thought, Im not going to ride on the back of that honey.If he hadnthave said that, who knows  But it just wasnt meant for me.The pair still hit it off and Noella sang with Boy George at a string of gigs in Shepherds Bush Empire, dueting on a punk version of Karma Chameleon.They also enjoyed wild nights out together, where people used to confuse them for brother and sister.He was a good guy - very intelligent.And he loved me and he was so proud of me.Noella was having the time of her le, singing at Paul OGradys thbut still working at Camden Market on the weekends to make ends meet.She was hanging out with the likes of Oasis, Paula Yates and Michael Hutchence and the buzz around her was starting to grow.Then she got the call that would change her le.It was from the head of Radioactive Records who had signed the likes of Garbage and Debbie Harry.He asked me how much I wanted, I could barely afford to make it to the bus stop, she laughs.Radioactive asked Noella who she wanted to produce her album and she chooseJerry Harrison of Talking Heads, who had just produced for the American rock band Lives album Throwing Copper.The label flew her to LA to record it and soon she was living the American dream with a substantial advance and her own cab driver who was on call around the clock.I was just happy to be able to do stuff for people, she says.Sure whats the point of having money  You cant take it with you.Noella released her self titled album NoellaHutton in , toured extensively in the States and was put up in the likes of New Yorks Cha Hotel.I slept the best I ever have in my le when I was in New York, she says.It was just the characters. Everything.I felt at home there.Her husky, soulful voice was also in hot demand commercially and featured in ads for Lexus, Nike, Coca-Cola and Toyota.In  Noella played to , people at Canadian singer Sarah McLachlans Lilith Fair where she shared the stage with Nelly Furtado and Christina Aguilera.We had to do a press conference with Sky News, I just kept thinking Im a wee girl from Derry.Despite reaching such dizzying heights, very few back home knew was happening.I never told anybody, I just didnt think it was important, she says candidly.I dont think Im anything special, do you know what I mean I was just writing and playing and having a wee laugh. Thats very important. Youre only here for a wee while.Fame never interested me. It was terrying.I knew too many people who were miserable and had no le.I had too much badness to get up to.And what a le Noella was having. She was dating Taryn Manningand her album was No  on the playlist of the Virgin record store in Hollywood.She was living the kind of le most of us can only dream of, but her mental health was suffering and in  Noella suffered a complete nervous breakdown.Everything just crashed in my head at the one time, she says with characteristic frankness.It all closed in at the one time.I had just been putting it off my whole le.Everything that had went on reared its head.Id had a breakdown in London too, but this was on a dferent scale.It was just trauma. You think youve dealt with certain things. But naw, you havent.Im amazed that Im still here to be honest.Noellas sister, JeanetteHutton, brought her back to Derry, where she worked very hard to get better with the help of Gransha Hospital and the support of her family.A couple of years later she met American singer songwriter and producer Justin Black, who had her album as a teenager growing up in Arkansas.He said my album inspired him to play the guitar, she laughs.He didnt even know I was Irish.She also formed the band Blood with her sister Jeanette and brother-in-law Ruairi ODoherty and two years ago they released an album of the same name.Shes the eldest girl in the family and Im the youngest and all we do is laugh at stupid sh***, said Noella.Shes so loved. Shes brilliant. Shes my hero.In recent years Noella has also channelled her energy into animal rescue charity Friends of Rescue founded by her best friend Suzanne Fleming.Together with Suzanne, Keith Rutherford and Carly Russell, Noella helps rescue and rehome neglected and abused animals.The day before yesterday we rescued  dogs, she said.Its the most rewarding, heartbreaking, devastating, incredible all-encompassing thing.Im fearless when it comes to the well being of animals, children or old people.Noella is now sponsored by world-renowned bespoke guitar makers Emerald Guitars, who are based in St Johnston.Justin persuaded her to record her recently released solo album Love and Liars which deserves to be heard on the world stage, but Noella has no plans for a big tour.Ive honestly never made a plan in my le, she says.I dont believe in forcing squaresinto circles, do you know what I mean Its something that has to happenorganically, naturally.And this feels right at the minute.To find out more about Noella, visit her Facebook page The First Noella.Her music is available at noellahutton.bandcampA documentary about Noellas le, The First Noella, made by Justin Black is now available on YouTube.If you would like to support Friends of Rescue you can find them at Friends of Rescue Ireland on Facebook.For more information on Emerald Guitars visitwww.emeraldguitars googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

He says: Journalists have played a vital role in recent weeks providing the public with factual information needed now more than ever.It is a sad irony that the threat to jobs in journalism is higher now than ever.The steep fall in demand for products of all sorts has seen advertising revenue plummet. Widespread lay-offs are threatened.This comes on top of a series of blows in the past few years. The NUJ has fought hard to protect members. But against a bleak economic background, it hasn’t been possible to prevent redundancies.The hammer-blow of the coronavirus pandemic has now put a question mark against the very future of a number of titles in Derry and Donegal, as well as across the rest of island. Journalists fear further loss of valued colleagues.Journalism dfers from many other industries in that workers tend to have a close relationship with the communities around them as well as with those they work alongside.Many people can be sharply critical of the local media, but at the same time value what they do. A community which loses a local ‘paper will be poorer as a result. googletag.cmd.push Some of our local papers are strong and will survive. But others are at real risk. It is for these reasons that the wider public, not just those who work in the media, should support journalists in striving to keep titles alive and save jobs in journalism for the next generation.Journalists are no more entitled to their jobs than anyone . But we do play a vital role, which has been highlighted as never before over the course of the coronavirus disaster.The NUJ is in talks with government in both Dublin and London about the need for support to see newspapers survive. It is reasonable to ask citizens in general, and their political and other representatives, to voice their support for the union as it tries to save valuable jobs and the valuable role which NUJ members play. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Schools are only open to allow staff to organise remote learning for pupils and to make provision for supervised learning for children up to Year . Education Minister Peter Weir said: Schools are only open as a last resort option for vulnerable children and the children of key workers who cannot be accommodated where during the day. I am aware of a small number of cases where key workers’ children have not been able to access school premises. We must all play our part in supporting those people who are at the frontline of dealing with this current crisis. googletag.cmd.push I must stress that only one parent carer needs to be a key worker for the child. Where possible, we would encourage schools to continue to look after critical workers’ children and vulnerable children throughout the Easter holidays and consider whether weekend provision can be facilitated. This will be kept under review. The Education Authorityhas also published a school placement request form, which key workers can use to request supervised learning in an available school,their normal school is closed. Mr Weir added: For those key workers who have been unable to access a school premises, I would ask them to use this information to identy a school which will be able to accommodate their child. googletag.cmd.push I greatly appreciate all those schools and their staff who have opened their doors to support these critical workers in what is a worldwide crisis.

Now, as the Easter break approaches it is important that we all take some much-needed rest and allow ourselves to recharge and recuperate after such an intense period.

[ Ghanaian Cedi equals . Euro.]“We also paid for Precious to have her hair re-braided. Precious is the only girl in the orphanage to have long hair as she originally came from South Africa. “We then used the rest of the money to buy ice cream, crackers, pineapple and other treats for the children from day to day.”Acknowledging everyone who helped in her mammoth fundraising effort, Lauren thanked her family and friends especially.She added: “I would also like to thank Fr Mailey in Drung Quigleys Point Community Centre Sainsbury’s in Derry and Debbie, who is the manager of Lidl in Buncrana. “That is not forgetting anyone who helped out in any way at fundraisers, by donating prizes or coming along to events. Thank you all from the bottom of my heart. Even the smallest donation made a huge dference in Ghana.”An average day in Ghana for Lauren began at .am.She reaclled: “We usually arrived at Beckys Orphanage at .pm r .pm, depending on the taxis. We stayed about a  minute drive away from the orphanage.“When we arrived, we helped to get the children ready for school and had morning cuddles with the younger children. We went on the school bus with the children. “There were about  children, four volunteers and our the driver squashed on a  seater bus but we made it work.“When we dropped the children off, we went back for breakfast, then back to the school, where could had the choice of watching the children in the daycare or teaching a class,we wanted. At .pm, we went back for lunch and rested until pm. “Then it was back to school to get the children onto the bus and back to the home. Because their own bus was broken down, we had to rely on taxi buses from the village, which were not always readily available when we needed them. For a few days, we had to wait to pm for one to arrive.”But it did not stop there. Back at the orphanage, it was homework, with the younger children playing or watching TV.Lauren said: “The older children usually helped with cooking dinner. I tried to help one day but it was the hardest thing. They cook in an outside hut. “They light a fire in an old wheel alloy and cook in a huge pot. If the heat doesn’t get to you, the smoke in your eyes will. It wasn’t the easiest dinner I ever helped cook.“We usually left the orphanage around .pm but a few evenings we were lucky and the taxi was late so we could stay longer.“Volunteer safety was paramount at Becky’s, so when the mosquitos came out, we went in. Back at the volunteer house, we could have dinner, get cleaned up and then the night was our own.“We never ventured out much at night because of the mosquitos as well as the power cuts. The whole village would be in darkness. It would be very dficult to navigate your way.”Lauren described her trip to Ghana as the most amazing experience. googletag.cmd.push She said: “At first it was dficult, seeing some sights was hard. “What people live in, children on the street in rags, being sent to school with no breakfast or lunch. The children from Becky’s Orphanage are lucky as they will at least get their three meals a day.“People with no running water and power that would often go off also took a bit of getting used to. Although, washing from a bucket of cold water did become something I looked forward to and was quite refreshing.“Being able to see the joy from the children when you came to see them at the school and orphanage, how a small piece of pineapple brightened their day and even just the enjoyment they would get from sitting beside you, would melt your heart.“Of course, with the money we raised, we were able to do a lot for the children, but what we left with was so much more.“We have learned how to appreciate the simple things in le to be grateful for everything we have here at home and to never take anything for granted here,” added Lauren. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Trust would like members of the public to snap images of a tree or flower in bloom from their window, in their garden or during their daily permitted exercise and to share their images on social media.The move is part of the Trust’s campaign to help people of all ages to become more connected with everyday nature. The charity said that blossom sweeping the country is one of nature’s key moments that could help lt the spirits during these uncertain times and enable people to celebrate nature and history together. It is asking those with trees and flowers in bloom in their gardens and on their streets to share pictures on social media using #BlossomWatch and tagging their location, so everyone can enjoy this year’s blossom season. And next year there are plans to develop a #BlossomWatch map.The move follows the launch of the Trust’s Noticing Nature report last month, which demonstrated that for people to do more to protect nature, they need to have a closer everyday connection to it. Only six per cent of adults and seven per cent of children celebrate natural events such as the first day of spring, solstice or harvest, according to the Trust’s recent research.Andy Beer, nature expert at the National Trust says: “It’s really easy to take this moment in nature for granted. Celebrating blossom is a pivotal, seasonal moment that can often be all too fleeting and we want to do all we can to help people and families at home to enjoy and take stock of a special moment in the calendar.“At a time when people are being asked not to travel, we want people to notice the blossom on their doorstep – in their garden, on city streets or in public parks when taking the permitted daily walk, cycle or run. We’re asking them to take pictures of the blossom as it blooms and share the joy with others who can’t see blossom for themselves right now.“The success of blossom and the subsequent fruiting is highly dependent on the weather, which could be affected in future years by the warming climate.”The Trust will be encouraging those who’d like to get involved to share and tag their images via @NationalTrustNI on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter using the #BlossomWatch and also inserting the name of the place where they live.

cook everything, not just heating beans in a microwave or a boiling an egg but proper gravy with stock and cornflour.So wondering what to do with your children this week. … there’s your answer.Mum also said that meal times were much more family times, when everyone would come together, sit together and talk, sounds great to me.We are all so busy now that I wonder, when did you last sit at the table together and talk - so another good point.What about home grown food too - we used to eat a lot of this but as le has got busier this skill seems to have faded away, is this the perfect time to order seeds or shoots to plant and grow potatoes, peas, beetroot, onions, peppers or tomatoes  I remember my mum teaching me the games she used to play, so why not teach your children too - great excuse to turn the TV or computer off and play.What about Pick Up Sticks, Cat’s Cradle, Marbles, Jacks, Dominos and Cascading Dominos, or card games such as Chase The Ace, Cheat or the Matching Memory Game or even building with the cards.For outside, what about Hop Scotch, skipping rhymes and games with a skipping rope or two tennis balls against a wall - A Sailor Went To See See See, To See What He Could See, See See .. the song went on and you had to do the actions whilst still throwing and catching the two balls.Or another, sing “Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, next door neighbour carry on” and your friend would move in catching and throwing the balls without breaking the rhythm.Or try clapping games together like Say Say My Playmate.Or making obstacle courses or dens - children of any age love dens especiallythey can have lunch in there too.And do you remember making perfume from flower petals or paper mache Or on wet days what about learning to knit, or do knitting dolly, sew, crochet or even try tongue twisters, Betty Botter bought some butter but she said this butters bitter,I put it in my batter it will make my batter bitter, so she bought a bit of butter better than the bitter butter and she put it in her batter and her batter was not bitter, so twas better Betty Botter bought a bit of better butter .Don’t forget the board games too like Cludo or Mouse Trap, Ludo or Snakes And Ladders - maybe you could make the boards yourselves too!In the olden days we used to write to each other too - not email, text, Facebook, Snapchat or Instagram!So why not encourage, or help, your child to discover the enjoyment of writing and receiving letters They could write about the fun you’ve been having whilst you are offand maybe include a picture they’ve done, then pop it in the post to their friends, grandparents or other family members We used to get pocket money for ‘jobs’ we did too - not just pocket money for the sake of it!Maybe your children could earn pocket moneyby washing the car, fence painting or weeding .So the ‘olden days’ sound like they had a lot to offer, they’ve also got your history too, why not investigate and create a family tree or look up what used to be in your area - what did it look like a  years ago, what did schools and homes look like and transport too, what did people do for fun, apart from the above of course.In doing and enjoying all these ‘olden day’ activities maybe you’ll inspire your child with a love of history, a love of finding out, a love of baking, cooking, gardening and maybe, most importantly of all, a love of being in a family where people talk and play and enjoying being together.P.S. in the olden days many people would have just put baby in a pram in the garden -

In addition to Colum Cille’s own foundations at Derry and Durrow, these monasteries all looked to Iona as their leader.They adhered to the traditions of the Irish church.These Columban monasteries played a leading role in the expansion of Christianity they converted the Picts and restored Christianity to Anglo-Saxon Northumbria in the th century.In the second half of the th century Iona was at the height of its prestige – the laws of Colum Cille held sway in Ireland, with the abbots of Iona making frequent trips there.This period of Columban expansion resulted in the appearance of two art forms to Irish monasteries namely, high crosses and illuminated manuscripts.The fusion of Irish techniques of timber construction and Northumbrian skills in stone carving resulted in the appearance of highly decorated standing crosses in Irish monasteries from the second half of the th century.These elaborate high crosses with the wheel head design, in which a circle surrounded the point of intersection, developed from the earlier simple pillar stones of the th century on which crosses were incised.In the monastery at Derry there would now have appeared intricate high crosses on which scenes from the Bible were sculptured.The purpose of the crosses ied. Some marked burials, others signied a boundary of some sort, while others acted as focuses of prayer.Distinctive manuscripts on parchment were now being produced in Columban monasteries.Sometime between  and  the Book of Kells, a brilliantly illuminated copy of the four gospels with Latin text, known as “the Great Gospel of Columkille”, was written.Its precise origin is unknown not every monastery could produce such highly decorated and, at the same time, legible and correct copies of gospels written in Latin.Undoubtedly it was written in a Columban monastery, as they were famed for their teaching of Latin and the classics and for the skills of their craftsmen and artists.It was unlikely to have been written in Derry, as the team of scribes and artists required to produce such a masterpiece probably only existed at the monastic centre of the Columban confederation, which was Iona to  and subsequently Kells in central Ireland.The contents of the th century library and scriptorium at Derry have not survived.Colum Cille, according to the Annals of Clonmacnoise, wrote  books, all copies of the New Testaments. Copies were left with each of his churches, which, of course, included Derry.The earliest surviving decorated Irish manuscript is the Cathach or Battle Book, a copy of the psalms, which according to tradition was written by Colum Cille towards the end of the th century.It was handed down in the family of Conall Gulban, i.e. Colum Cille’s kin, and it was always carried three times round the army to ensure victory before they went into battle.Illumination in this manuscript was confined to the fine large capital letters at the beginning of each psalm.With the Book of Durrow, a copy of the four gospels written in the mid-th century, an Irish style had emerged in which at the beginning of each gospel there was on the left a full ornamented page, brilliantly coloured, with intricate designs of spirals and interlocking animals and plants while on the right there was an introductory page beginning with a large, beautully proportioned, capital letter. In addition, portraits or symbols were used to depict each of the four evangelists.The Book of Kells marked the pinnacle of Irish achievement in manuscript production, with its profusion of illustration, colour and ornamentation, and its repeated use of the same symbols for the four evangelists a man for Matthew, a lion for Mark, a calf for Luke and an eagle for John.By the end of the th century the monastic settlement at Derry would have changed little.The monastic complex would still have been made of timber.The only new physical feature would have been the erection of a few high stone crosses.The scriptorium may have begun to produce some basic illuminated manuscripts, similar to the Cathach. It would, of course, have continued to make straight copies of the psalms and gospels.In  a fleet of ships, the like of which had never been seen before, sailed up Lough Foyle.These ships, built of oak, some over  feet long and  feet wide, and steered by a rudder paddle, were powered by both oar and sail.From  feet pine masts fluttered square sails of double-thickness strips of red and white woven cloth, and, from behind rows of shields slung over the side, men, up to  on each boat, pulled on narrow-bladed spruce oars and manoeuvred the boats into the sheltered waters of the River Foyle.They beached their boats, which drew only three feet of water, on the shore beneath the monastery.From the boats men rushed up the hill, the leaders wearing protective coats of mail and helmets with a nose piece which projected down over the face the rest, following close behind, in thick woollen coats which reached half way down their thighs.They all carried a round wooden shield, many of which were painted either yellow or black.The long, broad, two-edged iron sword and the long-handled, broad-edged battle axe were the principal weapons they carried.Some were armed with spears, others with bow and arrows. Most had an iron kne, with a wood or bone handle, tucked in their belts.The Vikings had located the monastic settlement at Derry, and, as where in Ireland and Britain, they met no organised resistance.They burnt the abbey and massacred her clergy and students.Not only was the monastery an easy target to attack because of its secluded, yet very accessible, location, it was also a very rewarding one.Derry was a centre of wealth, rich in lands and livestock.The Vikings were interested in food provisions, to sustain further voyages, as well as in the precious metal ornaments associated with a monastery.They were also interested in taking prisoners, especially girls, as they had been trading in human slaves to central Europe for centuries.The Vikings never attempted to settle in Derry.In  they again attacked, but this time they were driven back, with great losses, by Niall Caille, King of Ireland and Murchadh, Prince of Aileach.Derry continued to be attractive to Viking invaders throughout the th century.In  the shrine of Colum Cille was carried away by the Vikings. In  and  she was again plundered.Derry’s long-term growth did not suffer because of the Viking raids,anything it increased.With the Viking raids on Iona in ,  and , the monks acquired a site at Kells in central Ireland, and, bearing the relics of Colum Cille, moved there to found a new monastery.There was a steady rise in the status and importance of Derry from , as she succeeded Iona and then Kells as the centre of all Columban foundations in Ireland and Scotland.By the end of the th century Derry was known as Doire Columcille, as opposed to Doire Calgach.This Viking period resulted in two new additions to the monastery at Derry: her first stone church and a round tower.Sometime after the first raid in , the wooden church, which the Vikings burnt, was replaced with a stone one.It would have been a simple building, similar in shape to its wooden predecessors.This stone single-chamber church, later known as Dubh Regles or Black Abbey church, was perhaps no longer than  feet.It probably had one narrow slit for a window, and was roofed with stone to simulate overlapping tiles. Housing for the monks and their tenant farmers was still made of the traditional wood and wattle combination.Sometime between the end of the th century and the beginning of the th century, a round tower of stone was built next to the Black Abbey church to serve a iety of purposes, such as a belfry, a watch tower and a place of refuge.Perhaps  feet high and  feet in diameter, with five floors, each lit by one window except the top which had four, entrance was gained,  feet above ground level, by a movable ladder.Inside, each wooden floor was linked by a wooden staircase. If set on fire this tower would have been a death trap, as the up-draught working on ignited wooden floors would have created an inferno.By the turn of the th century Derry was beginning to see a revival in its fortunes as an important monastic town.Apart from the additions of elaborate stone crosses, a small dry-stone church and a round tower, Derry was still very similar to the settlement founded in . googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Minister Mallon said: “Just yesterday I confirmed MOT test centres would no longer be carrying out tests and that all vehicles eligible would be issued with a temporary exemption certicate . However, this could not be applied to four year old cars and taxis due to legal requirements. “I am pleased to confirm that following signicant work by my officials, I am now able to put arrangements in place to ensure four year old cars can get back on the road,given the ongoing health advice, the journey to be made is essential. googletag.cmd.push “From tomorrow, four year old cars will be given a TEC for six months from the date that their MOT test should have been due. This will allow the vehicle to be taxed and driven on the road. Issuing the certicates will take some time but the exemption will automatically apply from the due date. “The PSNI has agreed to our request that given these exceptional circumstances, where PSNI detects a vehicle without a valid MOT certicate, it will in suitable cases, exercise its discretion under the law, in circumstances where there is no identied risk to public safety. It is important that drivers realise that they are responsible under the law for the roadworthiness of their vehicle at all times.” googletag.cmd.push The Minister continued that she and officials are continuing to urgently explore options to support taxis at this dficult time. “For taxis which require PSV tests, new regulation and legislation needs to be put in place to allow the legal issuing of Temporary Exemption Certicates and,despite best efforts, this is taking longer to resolve. However, I want to reassure taxi drivers that we are working urgently on options to help them at this dficult time. I recognise the taxi industry is being hard hit by this public health and economic crisis. I also am working with Executive colleagues and pushing hard for more support from the UK Government for the self-employed. Protecting drivers and the public from the serious impact of COVID- is my priority.” Alastair Ross, Head of Public Policy for Northern Ireland at the Association of British Insurers, said: “Insurers recognise that this is worrying time for everyone and will take a pragmatic view. They will not penalise customers for something that is entirely out of their control and where motorists with an MOT exemption certicate request a quote, they will not be prejudiced by their lack of a valid MOT certicate. This applies regardless of whether they wish to renew with their existing insurance provider or are looking to take out a policy with a dferent insurer. “Insurers do, however, expect that motorists comply with their legal obligation to keep their vehicle in a roadworthy conditionthey are driving it. Those affected by the ongoing MOT testing suspension should continue to service their vehicle and carry out basic checks such as looking out for brake wear, ensuring that all lights are working and that windscreen liquid and oil are at the correct levels.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Rosemarie and Sean Lynn from Dungiven tied the knot in a simple ceremony at St Columba’s Church, Long Tower after their original date fell victim to Covid-. The couple were married last Tuesday evening at :pm, just hours before government regulations banned weddings were due to be introduced. Rosemarie told the County Derry Post they were determined to go ahead with the ceremony. She said: “We got engaged in November and decided we’d get married on the th of April this year. googletag.cmd.push “A few weeks ago, our venue rang and said with coronavirus, they weren’t going to be open. “It was important for us to get married and have family and friends back at the house, so we brought it forward to Saturday the th of March.”  Boris Johnson and the British government had other ideas, however, and Monday’s announcement that weddings were banned left the couple ‘numb’. Things changed when Sean and Rosemarie rang their driver to inform him of the developments. “Brian, our limousine driver and he said: ‘Why don’t you ring the council and see what they can do ’ “So I rang and said we had the papers, we were getting married in the church and the priest was willing to marry us, but we needed the go-ahead from the council. She said to leave it with her. googletag.cmd.push “I was praying to St Anthony when the lady from the council rang back and said we had the go-ahead until  o’clock that night to get married.” The short time frame became even tighter as Rosemarie’s fianceacute Sean finished a sht as an emergency medical technician with the Ambulance Service. “Rosemarie rang and said: you’d better come home quickly because we’re getting married tonight,” said Sean. “I rang the duty control manager and was shocked when they gave the go-ahead for special circumstances. “I had to come home, lt the wean, scrub up quickly and get into the chapel. Of course, she was  minutes late.” Denied the luxury of time that most brides have to prepare for their wedding, Rosemarie was forced to improvise. She said: “I got ready, did my own nails, my own make-up, put the fake tan on, did the whole thing myself. “I had a wee dress I got last year that I just loved. It wasn’t even meant to be for a wedding, I just bought it because I liked it. “It felt like I was in a film. I wasn’t nervous, I was excited, but it was almost an out-of-body experience.” The couple’s faith was central to their decision-making, and both were delighted with the simple ceremony. Sean said: “I’m over the moon, I really am. “The big day would have been great to have, but the sacrament between me, her and God was the main thing.” “The ceremony was beautul,” said Rosemarie. “It was the two of us, the priest, two witnesses and Sean’s wee boy and we all had to stand six feet apart and sit six feet apart in the limousine because of the regulations. Although the couple were able to celebrate with a few drinks at Sean’s house, the honeymoon is on hold as he helps battle the threat of Covid-. He said: “We have a few days to spend together and keep le simple. I’m going out to C every day, so I’m glad for a few hours of something positive.” Rosemarie is hugely proud of her husband’s role. She said: “He’ll be back out in a few days saving lives, that’s what he loves to do. “He always was that kind of person who cares for people, and that’s what it’s all about now.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Letrsquos look out for each other in these turbulent times.Cllr McMurray mdash who spoke ahead of Mondayrsquos ban on access to Tyrella beach mdash said that last weekend he had been ldquoinundated with messages and calls regarding the number of people attending local forest parks.ldquoUnfortunately, it appears that the general population is not adhering to the advice in relation to social distancing and I would suggest that they are nearly treating this crisis as a national holiday.I will be reviewing access to our forest parks with party leaders and senior management team, he said.ldquoWe have been pushing a lot of advice and guidance with regard to the need for social distancing but it is not resting with the population. It is so dficult to balance the need to allow people the space to walk to protect mental and health and well-being, but we ask that the public refer to guidelines set out by public health officials to do so safely.Cllr Lewis said the closure of leisure centres, play areas, council-owned facilities and schools across this district had been done for peoplersquos safety.ldquoI appeal to people to recognise why these areas are closed, he continued. ldquoPlay parks and sporting facilities should not be used. It is imperative that we recognise and accept the seriousness of this illness. It simply cannot be business as usual, we must heed all relevant medical advice.Cllr Lewis added: ldquoThis is for our own safety, while also protecting the integrity of our health service and those vital, dedicated experienced staff who support it. Newry, Mourne and Down Council has taken extreme measures and please respect these steps. This isnrsquot a holiday and itrsquos not a jolly. We are protecting le.Cllr Gallagher said it was vital that everyone in the community ensures that social isolation is adhered to, highlighting the need to reduce the risk.He added: ldquoThe elderly and those with predisposed health conditions need to keep their distance and follow public health guidelines. Remain at homepossible and get someone to do your shopping. Family units are important. People must not allow others into their home and visits that are not essential must stopCllr Howell said that last week the Education Minister finally declared that schools would close to help prevent the spread of COVID-, highlighting the huge responsibility on parents to ensure that not just children are safe, but so are those they are in contact with.She added: ldquoUnfortunately, some young people think that this is the start of their summer holidays and they are free to continue with no worries or concerns. I am appealing to parents to inform their children about social distancing and the importance of adhering to the public health guidelines.ldquoIf your teenager goes out can you be confident that they will observe the required social distancing of two metres  Many of them donrsquot have the willpower to practice what is being advised.ldquoAs a parent I know only too well how hard it is to keep teenagers from going out, but we need to set the example to our children. If these social distancing rules are not adhered to, they will come home and unknowingly pass the virus to others, perhaps family members with underlying health issues or aged grandparents..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/25th March 2020 Pretend.jpg","title":"‘Pretend cough’ over credit union worker  ","story":"POLICE will be contacted after a saver in Downpatrick Credit Union ldquopretend coughed at a staff member last week during the coronavirus outbreak, it has been revealed.Mary Cullen, chair of Downpatrick Credit Union, warned that it was now operating a ldquozero tolerance policy as incidents of verbal abuse to staff increased during reduced opening hours.She said the credit union, which is situated in Market Street, had been inundated with messages of support after she posted a warning post on Facebook last Friday where she asked members to respect everyonersquos boundaries regarding social distancing and to accept the new reduced hours cover.She said a member of the public verbally abused a member of staff before ldquopretend coughing at them.ldquoThis particular incident is not acceptable and going forward, unfortunately, Members who cannot be courteous to our staff will not be served, said Mary in her post.ldquoWe are in a very dangerous time and are doing the best that we can. We are very lucky to have an amazing team at DCU, letrsquos appreciate and respect them as they try to continue to provide a service to members.ldquoThe support for my staff has been phenomenal. Members have contacted me to express their sadness and disgust that anyone could behave in such a manner.One shocked local person commented: ldquoWhat is actually wrong with people being totally ignorant to what is happening.Several people called for the person to be banned from the credit union.Mary said that the staff had to adopt themselves to the changed methods of operation and service in the public health crisis.ldquoWe have had a fair amount of verbal abuse since implementing restrictions on the number of people in the banking hall at any one time and staff have been working tirelessly to ensure a safe environment for all by encouraging social distancing, she explained. ldquoWe will continue to monitor member activity and behaviour and have a zero tolerance policy now in place.However, she warned: ldquoAny member who does not respect the boundaries in place or who proceeds to abuse staff will be asked to leave the building, I have told the staff that the Board support them ,% and continue to do so.ldquoI will be making contact with the member and we will be pursuing this matter through the PSNI.The credit union is from .am to .pm on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday and from .am-pm on Saturday.

If people did go out, they were advised to keep two metres apart.Council officials say the latest closures are part of the organisationrsquos ongoing coronavirus response and that the decision will be reviewed on an ongoing basis in line with Public Health Agencyguidance.Last week, council officials had decided to keep Tyrella beach and Delamont Country Park open and had agreed to waive the entrance fee to both facilities. But there was a dramatic U-turn on Monday when these two popular facilities also went into lockdown.Across the district a range of community events have been cancelled with last Sundayrsquos horse race meeting at Downpatrick taking place behind closed doors, with spectators locked out.The local authority want people to obey self-distancing requirements with its decision to close Tyrella beach and Delamont Country Park further evidence of its concern about people spreading the virus.It is clear that both facilities have now been placed in the ldquohigh risk category alongside the districtrsquos leisure and community centres. Local politicians say that their key priority is to protect the public and staff.The closure of Tyrella and Delamont comes after Sundayrsquos sunshine brought people out in their hundreds to ious locations across the district, despite government advice not to engage in mass gatherings.beachAnyone in Newcastle town centre last Sunday could have been forgiven for thinking that it was Easter, while nearby Murlough beach was crammed with visitors.It was a similar scene in Ballyhornan and along other parts of the Lecale coastline, including Kilclief and Killard.Rowallane councillor Kathryn Owens said she fully supported the decision to close Tyrella beach and Delamont Country Park.She said: ldquoI totally support this decision. It may not be popular, but sometimes we need to take the tough decisions.ldquoUnfortunately, after the droves of people went to local parks and forests on Sunday, it appears people still arenrsquot taking the coronavirus issue seriously and are clearly flouting PHA guidelines.Cllr Owens added: ldquoThis is not a decision that Newry, Mourne and Down Council wanted to take as we had hoped that common sense may have prevailed. It was a decision we were forced to take and we must do all we can to stop the spread of this disease..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/25th March 2020 C Diary.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C March 25%2C 1980  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK mdash Downpatrickrsquos Grand Cinema is to re-open in September, six years after it closed its doors.Workmen will move in shortly to give the cinema a pound, facelt and when the picture house is re-opened, it should be able to compete with the best in Ireland.That is the aim of Mr Harley Breen, the owner of the cinema, who this week outlined the work which needs to be completed before the curtain opens.ldquoWork is expected to take around six months and will involve completely refurbishing the inside of the cinema, Mr Breen explained.ldquoWe will be taking out all the seating and replacing it with a new type of seating, the most exclusive available.

Her previous experience had been restricted to cars, tractors and Land Rovers, but she was always keen on tackling something bigger.ldquoBeing so fond of driving, it was only natural that I would take such a job. Lorries were out of the question, as drivers often have to load their vehicles, so when I say the advert for bus drivers I thought I would apply, said Noelene.ldquoI never thought it possible that they would accept me, so it was a pleasant surprise when I was offered the chance to attend the Ulsterbus training school. I was the only female among the drivers, but that didnrsquot deter me.BALLYGOWAN mdash A teenage Ballygowan girl has ben congratulated by the Northern Ireland Hotel Catering Association for her success at a recent salon culinaire.Margaret Wilson won the gold award in the junior section and this earned her praise from the Association.Margaret had been attending the Associationrsquos catering course at the college in Portrush this year, having progressed from Downpatrick Technical College where she passed the pre-catering course to earn qualication.She was entered by the Association for the salon culinaire at Belfast Castle at the start of the month, and her win prompted them to write to the South Eastern Education and Library Board to congratulate them on such an outstanding pupil.The Associationrsquos letter was read at Tuesdaysrsquo Board meeting, where members were pleased to se Margaretrsquos progress.

He wrote: ldquoSo I turned with all my heart to the Lord My God...He protected me and he consoled me as a Father for his son...There is no other God...The Lord God said through the prophet, lsquoCall on me in the day of distress and I will set you free and you will glory mersquo.They said this is a reminder that ldquoGod truly is our shield in the stre.

However, that fails to take into account the number of people likely to die as a result of an economic lockdown and possible recession. Of course these people won’t die from a single disease at one go but in small numbers or singly, many not in hospital, but at home or in homes their deaths will not be part of a dramatic event with emotive pictures of hospital wards over-flowing. But die they will and probably mostly the same people, the already vulnerable.To discuss the economy now sounds callous, but one must to remember, it is the economy that enables us to live, pays the bills and sustains the NHS . Consider this: Prof Thomason BBC Radio , One o’clock News March  warns that the current lockdown in  weeks could lead to a recession exceeding .% decline in GDP, some forecasts are of up to %. The result of that could be a loss of ledue to economic recession that would exceed the number of lives saved via the current medically induced lockdown.Unemployment and poverty are known killers, which is what a recession implies. Poor diet for struggling families reduces resistance to disease, the stress and strain of long term unemployment impacts upon health and longevity.Meanwhile, those who survived economically may be saddled with enormous debts, adding stress and strain to that already incurred in trying to restart a business or get back on their feet. Concurrently, businesses that survived by going into debt will be less attractive for future investors and lenders. Lost savings and devalued investment plans to pay for our retirement will be eaten up, leading more people to rely more heavily on the state or lapse into poverty. This in turn adds to the problems of raising funds, ie. taxes, to pay for the health and social services ‘survivors’ will probably need even more. All of these are ‘hidden’ killers, years off lives.The Institute for Public Policy estimated that , preventable deaths occurred due to austerity: that poverty kills is a well known fact, but does not have the immediacy of country-wide lockdowns or the medical drama that attracts the media, but it still kills.Current government policy depends heavily on Imperial College, London’s, research on how to suppress Covid  and like all research it depends on assumptions here that the suppression tactics now employed will work over the next  weeks, but there is no guarantee. They also recognise that suppression carries major economic implications, although they have not calculated it, which brings one back to Prof Thomas , he has calculated the potential loss of le vis-a-vis current government strategy.Any strategy relating to any pandemic will inevitably have to look at a iety of options, all of which involve having to let some people die to save others, the problem is in identying which kills the fewest. Unfortunately, the best strategy is not always the one that is the most immediately and emotionally satisfying or makes the best headlines. The prime ministercontracting Covid  makes good headlines, a statistical increase in the number of people dying who live in poverty in areas with high levels of disadvantage including the Falls Road or Lower Newtownards Road in a couple of years time probably won’t even register. Working class adults might die at a younger age than in previous decades.Ultimately, the economic costs will probably kill more people than Covid  itself, which is a reality that government, media and electorate has to consciously take into accountwe are to minimise deaths. This may mean having to re-open the economy and reverse lockdown at the cost of increasing short term deaths for decreasing long-term deaths: not pleasant, but it saves lives.• James Dingley, an academic, is chair of Francis Hutcheson Institute"},{"url":null,"title":"postponed historic passion play goes back vow made  ","story":"Closure of churches shows the shallowness of evangelicalism and the lack of interest in the public worship of GodNI Coronavirus Lockdown -  COVID- deaths across UK in  hours is biggest number of fatalities since crisis began two weeks ago.NewsLatestTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats OnThings To DoArts and EntertainmentNightleRetroLestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensCoronavirusNewsOpinionColumnistsPostponed historic Passion Play goes back to a vow made in Almost lost in the current barrage of closures, cancellations and postponements in every sphere of le, an announcement on March  resonated with the poignant irony of history.By The RoamerThursday, th March , : pm\"\"Jesus Christ and John.  Performance of the Oberammergau Passion Play : Freelance“The nd Oberammergau Passion Play will be postponed due to the current situation caused by the corona pandemic.”In the Baian district of Germany, beside the Ammer River and framed by the Ammergau Alps, Oberammergau is a small town known for its woodcarvings, its NATO School and its internationally renowned -yearly Passion Play.The organisers of the Passion Play summarised the historical signicance of the postponement, explaining that the event “goes back to a vow made in .

Therefore the plans to perform the Passion Play in  are currently beginning.”Held in the ‘decimal year’I attended a performance in , one of the most vivid and moving experiences of my letime, and indeed, I had toyed with the thought of ing this year.There would have been  performancesstarting in mid-May with an expected , visitors from around the globe paying between € to € for a ticket.The enormous production has been running since  except for two cancellations and a postponement.Crucixion scene in the Passion Play in  : FreelanceNearly half of the , residents of today’s Oberammergau are involved with the show - actors, musicians, front of house, backstage and looking after the horses, sheep, goats, cows and doves that add to the often intensely dramatic scenes.The other half of the townsfolk run the restaurants, shops, hotels, BBs and farmsteads where many of the visitors stay,they’re lucky.The nearest accommodation I could get in  was St. Anton am Arlberg in the Austrian Tirol.Participants in the production must have been born in Oberammergau or have lived there for  years.Oberammergau on the River Ammer in  : FreelanceIt’s not unusual for up to four generations of the same family to be taking part in the same run of plays, which can involve around  children on stage at the same time.In the th century, passion plays were held in many parts of Europe, often performed on carts in the street.They re-enacted Christ’s last days, from his entry into Jerusalem to his trial, crucixion, resurrection and ascension.In the bigger and more elaborate productions, when scene one ended the cart trundled off to another part of the town or city and scene two arrived, and so on!They were the ‘poor man’s Bible’ enabling even the most illiterate become familiar with Bible stories.But Oberammergau’s is the only play with its origins in a collective vow to God which has run, almost without a break, for approaching four centuries. This unique double-accolade brought the town a UNESCO World Heritage award.It’s quite likely that passion plays were already common events but a document in Oberammergau’s archives records “the first decades of the th century went by in peaceful calm…but then followed the Thirty Years’ War with all its hardships from  until . As early as , infectious diseases spread in Baia. This village was spared by dutul vigilance until the church festival in , when a man brought the plague into the village.”More than  local folk died and almost every family lost loved ones.“Faced with the great distress that the terrible illness inflicted upon the population,” the archive continues, “the leaders of the community came together and pledged to hold a passion tragedy once every ten years. From this day forward, not a single person perished, even though a great number of them still showed signs of the plague”.They made the pledge in  and the Passion Play was first performed at Pentecost in , on a wooden stage that some say was built on plague-victims’ graves near the church.Surviving documentation from the  production shows that the play ran ‘completed smoothly’ with seating provided ‘for spectators standing close by.’From  the date of the performance was changed to the beginning of each decade, by which time folk were coming from all over Germany to see substantial productions.Paint and painters for the  show’s scenery cost  guilders, ‘the gentlemen trumpeters’ got two guilders and  guilders went ‘to the actors for drink’!There was no performance in  when Maximilian III’s Clerical Council banned all passion plays and when another threat loomed in the s the so-called ‘mad’ King Ludwig II of Baia protected it from those who wanted to close down the ‘harmful’ passion plays. Following WWI the play was postponed until , and there was a special th anniversary show in  attended by Adolf Hitler.There were no performances in  during WWII, just the second cancellation…until now.Plans to perform the Passion Play in  are already under way, for over  five-hour shows, several thousand participants, a -strong orchestra and a -strong choir.\"\" for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from Belfast News LetterSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bYSBpT sc-elJkPf kHpvMx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Please try again later.Submitting...Staying fit and healthy was never easy, but it just got an awful lot harder. Lurgan man Geoff Gates, who has created the Limitless weight loss programme, believes people shouldn’t use lockdown as an excuse to adopt a poor diet and exercise routine.He said: “The Limitless philosophy has always been that the only reason people get stuck in a rut is because of their limiting beliefs. If you feel good through proper nutrition and smart exercise, you will naturally be drawn towards better lestyle choices.”At times of great stress, for many diet often goes out the window. Geoff shared his advice on how to eat well during a crisis: “The issue here is we need to be not using food to combat stress but instead, tackle the stress head-on, that’s the first step. “I get all my clients to start practising meditation immediately. When I first suggest meditation to someone, they often wonderI’m joking or being serious. It’s not some hippy-dippy woo-woo thing, this is a proper prescription. They often report profound changes almost immediately.”Geoff said that having been overweight and depressed himself helped him to create Limitless: “There is gold in the depths of despair, and I count my experience as a blessing now. Without my personal struggle, I could never have developed the techniques to create the best weight loss programme in the world.”He said in terms of nutrition it was important to focus on quality food: “Broccoli is especially good for the lungs and its funny that it looks like a lung, just like walnuts a great for brain health they look like a little brain. As bizarre as this may sound, I believe our creator has provided us with clues.”Geoff said the current situation makes it even more important to make shopping lists, especially now that visits to the shops are meant to be limited. He commented: “There are always ways to make healthy food convenient food. We all own a freezer, so it’s just a matter of being a little bit smart and preparing ahead. “I advise my coaching clients to buy freezer bags then put all the ingredients together in the bag and use as and when they need them.”In terms of exercise he said: “I don’t think it’s been more relevant to use our time to focus on our health and fitness. The most used excuse I have heard continuously through my  years in the fitness industry was that people didn’t have time. Now we have an abundance of it. “So now you have plenty of time the next excuse will be that you don’t have the equipment. I refuse to hear it. “The simple truth is we don’t need gyms and never have needed them. The way I see it is the gyms have been a luxury, not a necessity. “The misconception is that you cannot get strong, fit and healthy without one – the truth being you can get the same results with just your good self, become your own gym.”He added: “If I was going to advise on one piece of home equipment it would be an adjustable set of dumbbells. He suggested a quickfire lockdown workout could include  bodyweight squats,  star jumps,  straight punches,  upper cuts,  push ups and  mountain climbers.He said those conscious of social distancing could exercise earlier to avoid encountering other people: “I have always got up at am to train so when I am out running in the morning, there is no one about.

Michael said: “People think, the music is dark and intense, they’re going to be really dark and intense.The band’s original line-up of Michael, Andy and Fyfe \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...“The most messed-up people I find are people in pop music. A lot of them are horrible twisted people with weird agendas and they become quite damaged iniduals. Then they go on stage everything is rosy.“It’s really the old cliche – never judge a book by its cover. With us the lyrics are kind of twisted, but there’s a big, dark sense of humour there.“We let off steam when we go on stage and jump up and down for  minutes. You tend to be pretty chilled afterwards.”When the band first got together in  lead singer and guitarist Andy Cairns was a pupil at Ballyclare High. Michael, who attended Larne Grammar with Fyfe Ewing , wasn’t present for the band’s first recording though he was there in spirit.On the front cover of metal magazine Kerrang! in He said: “Fyfe and I were in the same English class and would have traded records. He was in a band, I was in a band. “His band and Andy’s band had played a gig at Jordanstown Uni. They had more in common than they did with their own bands. “They did a demo together. I was there in spirit because Andy didn’t have a bass guitar so Fyfe asked me and I lent Andy my bass. Andy played it on the first demo.” Michael soon joined to play his own bass and things clicked from the start: “Our first gig was at Giro’s supporting Decadence Within. It went down really well, I was flabbergasted. “We weren’t trying to be U or Guns N’ Roses – those were the two big musical things at that time in , . I don’t mind U and I quite like Guns N’ Roses but we had our own little thing going on.“You kind of gravitated towards anyone who liked something that wasn’t Bryan Adams at school. In Larne where I grew up the metallers hung out with the goths, the goths hung out with the indie kids and you heard Joy Division, The Dead Kennedys and Slayer. We clung together as musical outsiders.”The friendship between Michael and Andy has extended more than  years: “I think I was  or  when Andy and I first met. When the first album came out I’d just turned . I’ll be  later this month.“One thing we did find quite early on is that we tend to be huffers. We got that out of our system. If you don’t like something you say then, you don’t leave it for six months and have a meltdown in the middle of eastern Europe.“There’s a lot of rock and rolls myths and stereotypes out there that people love. One of them I think which is not correct is that you need to have creative tension in a band. Maybe that’s works for one or two albums, but that burns itself out really quickly.“It’s really great working together as part of the band, what I get out of it is quite special, I think I’m very lucky.”Michael contrasted the crazy intensity when the band shared a house together in Belfast’s Holylandswith the situation now where they all live in dferent parts of the UK.He said: “I think there was one time me and Andy worked out over an -months period we’d been within  metres of each other every day with the exception of Christmas Day.“Now I live in Larne, Andy lives in Cambridge and Neilour drummer lives in Derby. When we meet up there’s lots of interesting stories and dferent experiences to share rather than walk down the main street in Larne going, ‘oh there’s the lads’.”On Fyfe, his original bandmate who left in , he said: “I haven’t spoken to him since he left. We have friends in common. He’s doing alright I believe. He moved to Brighton, he’s been there  years now. He’s had very little involvement in the music business.“It’s a real pity because he was such a great drummer, it’s just he couldn’t really get on with the lestyle. Somewhere down the line we’ll meet again.”Family man with attic of collectablesLast year Michael contributed a recipe to a celebrity cookbook to support his nephew Matthew who had been diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia.Michael said: “Matthew is doing well. The family is getting things back on track. It was a big thing, he’s still a bit traumatised as you’d expect but he’s doing well.”Of family le at home in Larne he said: “My we works full time soI’m at home I’m daddy day care. The only downside is when I’m away, I’m away   so there’s a whole dferent set of challenges for my we who’s an absolute saint.”Askedhis children, aged nine and five, were excited about their dad being in an band, he said: “They saw us at a big festival in Europe which was great because they were at the side of the stage and they were able to see , people from the other side. “They’re quite blasé about their dad being in a band. They’re not into music that much, they’re more into games, football and karate.”Michael went on to discuss some of the Therapy  treasure trovecontained in his attic: “I’ve got Fyfe’s original snare drum that he used on Babyteeth, the basses that I used on Troublegum. I’ve got a lot of the flyers, posters, tour passes and recordings and audio stuff I’ve kept over the years. The attic is a disaster area.”In the early days of Therapy  a pair of denim dungarees were Michael’s stagewear of choice. Askedstill had them, he said: “I actually do. I’m quite pleased that I’d still fit into them but I never wear them.“When we did the Troublegum shows a while ago there were some bets that they’d turn up again, but it didn’t happen for whatever reason. But never say never – right now I don’t think the world is ready for that.”Michael explained that there were in fact two pairs of his trademark dungarees, one of them he referred to as ‘the good pair’ then immediately burst out laughing.“Can you imagine denim dungarees after three weeks of touring ” he said. “It’s hard to find a -hour laundrette when you’re on the road. They were crunchy. I’m surprised they’re still in one piece.”Dates cancelled due to pandemicTherapy  have had to cancel some European tour dates later this month because of the coronavirus.Michael said: “We’ve had to cancel where the crowds would have been above ,, some of the big festivals we were really looking forward to. As it stands we’re still planning to play some of the smaller shows unless told otherwise. “It’s something that you just can’t account for. Gigs sometimes have to be cancelled because of illness or injury but this is beyond the band’s control. It’s a bit of a headmelt.”Touring major European cities is a far cry from the band’s gigging schedule in : “When we started there was the Warzone Collective in Belfast and Hope Promotions in Dublin. They worked in conjunction and would bring hardcore punk bands over like Fugazi and Concrete Sox. “We knew the Warzone people and that led to us being invited down to Dublin to play with the likes of Babes In Toyland. “They’d rent rooms above pubs for gigs, in Belfast they used the Art College and the Conor Hall. “We were quite lucky to get in at that DIY stage.”It’s okay not to be okayMuch is currently being done to raise awareness and funds for musicians suffering from mental health issues, particularly through Aware NI, PIPS and Help Musicians. As a band Therapy  have been tuned into the struggle from day one with many of Andy’s lyrics exploring the pressures that weigh on the human mind.Michael said: “It’s something that we’re all very aware of and very sympathetic towards. Being a young male in Northern Ireland there’s a bit of a ‘come on, man up’ vibe. That has been very damaging for a couple of generations now.“There is a rock and roll myth that everyone’s an all-singing, all-dancing, all-fighting gunslinger – you roll into town decimate it and move on. It’s not really like that.“I don’t think anyone hasn’t been touched by themselves or someone  who has had a mental health issue.“It’s such a fragile thing. It’s right there, there just seems not to be the widespread acknowledgement that it exists and for treatment. It’s so underfunded. It’s a real tragedy.”He added: “We’ve always had a lot of empathy, we take people as they are, we don’t have the answers, but we do try to let people know that it’s okay to not be okay. “Just talk about it, talk to your friends, talk to someone, reach out. Thankfully that stigma is moving away.“We’ve always been celebrating the outsiders – be yourself, do you own thing, what makes you happy, self preservation, looking after yourself.”Michael continued: “It’s one of these rock and roll myths that people want their musicians to be messed up and die young and leave a pretty corpse. “None of us subscribe to that at all.“We like to have a good time when we’re on tour, but doing it for so long there’s a massive element of self preservation.“It’s about doing a good gig. People don’t come and see you againyou’re stood there looking bored or hungover. It’s not pleasant for anyone – the player or the watcher.“We all feel a big responsibility to put on a good show. There’s people who have seen us  plus times.“We want every show to be as goodnot better than the last time. You make a rod for your own back with that.”• Therapy  will play the Limelight on September  to celebrate the band’s th anniversary• To coincide with the ‘So Much for the  Year Plan’ tour the band re-recorded  of their UK Top  hits in Abbey Road with producer Chris Sheldon, who produced the original Troublegum album.

The aim is that these virtues help to form them.With such a vast space at its disposal, the school ensures that children are given a rich and versatile experience.In the orchard, pupils pick fruit from pear, apple, plum, and damson trees which they use in cooking lessons during the autumn.They also grow  dferent kinds of fruit, salad, and vegetables in a polytunnel.Earlier this year, St Josephrsquos Primary was awarded a gold award in the UNICEF Rights Respecting School programme.The award is granted to schools which show a commitment to promoting childrenrsquos rights and raising awareness of these amongst young people.It recognises efforts to place the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child at the heart of a schoolrsquos policies and practice.ldquoAlongside our work on rights is the fact that we want our children to be aware of their responsibilities, said Mr Rein.ldquoYes, they have rights to be heard, but they also have a responsibility to listen to others.St Josephrsquos was the first school in Wales to develop a pupil parliament.Every child is a member of the parliament, and elected representatives from eight student groups form a cabinet which has decision-making powers.ldquoThe school parliament is a vehicle for the pupils to have a voice, so they can decide how the school can be a better place, how the local community can improve, and how we can help the UN to achieve their global goals, continued Mr Rein.ldquoSo the children are looking inward ndash at themselves and how the school environment can improve ndash and looking outward at how we can develop better links with the parishes and the areas of Penarth and Dinas Powys.ldquoOur Eco Ministry has been involved in a project to tidy beaches and pick up plastic, and our Healthy Schools and School Mission team have given food to local foodbanks.St Josephrsquos Primary is one of  innovation schools which have been chosen to contribute to the Welsh Governmentrsquos new curriculum framework, which will be rolled out to every school in Wales by . As part of the new framework, schools are required to design their own curriculum based upon the needs of specic learners, rather than adhering to a national learning program.St Josephrsquos curriculum is lsquoresearch-ledrsquo, meaning it is based on findings in child development and cognitive science.Teachers have undertaken training on how childrenrsquos bodies and minds develop, and lessons have been designed to enhance pupilsrsquo personal, social, and physical development.Mr Rein said: ldquoWe want our children to develop physically in terms of their gross motor skills, their fine motor skills, and their locomotion skills.ldquoWe have apparatus on which they can hang, climb, and swing, to build up their core strength.Mr Rein called the schoolrsquos curriculum lsquoreally ambitions.rsquoldquoWe are one of sixteen innovation schools in Wales helping to implement the new curriculum and develop special projects to do with the curriculum, he said.ldquoWe have taken that on by focusing on a knowledge-rich curriculum, so that we develop childrenrsquos knowledge, skills, and give them fantastic experiences.ldquoWe have taken good, rich materials from lots of dferent places, and developed some of our own, which we have implemented to a high standard.ldquoBehaviour in the school is exemplary partly because we have spent a long time asking what good teachers do.ldquoWe practice together as staff, so our teachers are working at a high level using a very well-researched curriculum.In last yearrsquos maths reasoning test,  per cent of pupils at St Josephrsquos scored higher than the national average, and  per cent of pupils scored above average in the National Reading TestldquoWersquore extremely proud of our achievements at St Josephrsquos, said Mr Rein.ldquoEverything we do is based on the best available research and is designed to help each inidual child thrive.The schoolrsquos curriculum has recently been praised by cabinet member for education and regeneration, Councillor Lis Burnett, who said St Josephrsquos had done a lsquobrilliant job.rsquoShe said: ldquoThe new Curriculum for Wales is inspiring schools to take a more holistic approach toward learning.ldquoIt encourages them to focus more on how and why the curriculum is being delivered, rather than delivering specic content and academic results.ldquoSt Josephrsquos have done a brilliant job in helping craft this approach, and in turn have seen their own curriculum and learning practices blossom. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It will cut planned capital spending to pound million from a budget of pound million and will work to grow online.MS said in a statement: \"Whilst we remain confident that the post-crisis future of the business and our transformation programme remains as strong as ever, trading over the next nine to  months in our clothing and home and international businesses is likely to be severely impacted.\"As a result, it is not possible to provide meaningful guidance on future earnings, although we are taking every step to secure future value for shareholders, colleagues and suppliers.\"The chairman of Wetherspoon has said that a decline in sales was accelerated when prime minister Boris Johnson told people to stay away from pubs.After rising in previous weeks, sales fell by . per cent in the week to March  and the slowdown has picked up further since the Prime Ministers statement, Tim Martin said.It came as the business reported profit before tax rose  per cent to pound. million in the half-year to January  on revenue of pound million.Health secretary Matt Hancock has warned that coronavirus will keep spreading as long as people continue to socialise.Speaking on talkRadio, Mr Hancock said: \"If you stay at home you are saving lives.\"I know, of course, this is a more dangerous disease for older people but not exclusively, some young people get it too.\"But, more importantly, the more that people continue to go out and continue to socialise, the more it will spread and the longer were going to have to keep these measures in place.\"So, were urging people to follow the public health advice.In the emergency Bill thats in front of Parliament right now, we are taking the powers to be able to enforce these measures, so we can make it happen by lawwe need to.\"Id rather not do that and the evidence so far is that the vast majority of people are following the advice, are doing what is sensible and right.\"The company said it was cancelling its interim idend, which had been p a year earlier.Mr Martin said: \"It is obviously very dficult to predict, in these circumstances, how events will unfold in future weeks and months, but we now anticipate profits being below market expectations, so long as the current health scare continues.\"As a result of this uncertainty, it is impossible to provide realistic guidance on our performance in the remainder of the financial year.\"The company has decided to delay most capital projects and to reduce expenditure, where possible, including the cancellation of the interim idend.\"As a result of these actions, combined with the Governments proposals on business rates relief and credit guarantee facilities, the company believes it has sufficient liquidity to maintain operations at a substantially lower level of sales.\"Nicola Sturgeon has urged anyone who left the medical profession in the past three years to consider ing to help the fight against coronavirus.Sharing a plea from Scotlands chief nursing officer Fiona McQueen, the First minister tweeted: \"Scotlands NHS needs our help to meet the #coronavirus challenge.\"Mr Hancock said some retired medics whoto work in the NHS to fight the coronavirus will be able to come \"straight back in\".Asked on the BBCs Breakfast programme when workers couldto the NHS, he said: \"Well, over the next couple of weeks because for some theyll have very recently left and they can come straight back in, their annual trainings been up-to-date and they can just restart.\"Imagineyouve left at Christmas, for instance, you can restart straight away. For others who have been out for a little bit longer, they may need more of a refresher because, of course, its vital that we keep people safe, thats the whole point of the NHS.\"So the letter will go out today, well then be engaging inidually with all those who respond and I very much hope that many, many thousands will respond.\"From those Ive talked to, I think people can see just how important this is. The training will happen for those who need it over the next couple of weeks, at the same time well allocate people to a hospital near them because theres a logistical exercise here as well.\"Mr Hancock suggested that tougher measures could have to be brought inpeople do not follow the Governments advice.He told the BBCs Breakfast programme: \"What I can say is thatpeople follow the advice, stay home which saves lives andthey keep apart from others, more than two metres, more than six foot, then we can tackle this and we can turn the tide.\"The scientists advise that we can turn the tide in  weekspeople follow the advice.\"If people dont follow the advice, then itll be longer and we might have to bring more and tougher measures.\"He added: \"We have brought these measures in earlier than Italy did in terms of where theyre up to with the number of cases.\"But were absolutely clear thatwe need to, we have the powers, in fact weve got a Bill in front of Parliament now to strengthen those powers further.\"But I think its far betterpeople follow the advice.\"The FTSE  has risen by more than five per cent in early trading as travel companies jump out ahead after a bruising few weeks for the sector sparked by the Covid- pandemic.Intercontinental Hotels jumped by about a fth despite revealing that demand for rooms was the worst it had ever seen, as markets opened on Friday.EasyJet also rose by around  per cent and cruise operator Carnival jumped by around . per cent.Meanwhile, the price of a barrel of Brent crude oil joined the rally, rising five per cent to . dollarsafter a massive fall earlier in the week.Shadow chancellor John McDonnell has warned about the prospect of a recessionpeople do not receive their wages.Labour has urged the Government to ensure the salaries of workers are protected as businesses lose trade during the coronavirus pandemic.He told the BBCs Breakfast programme: \"We need the Government now to act to protect people to keep them in their jobs.\"In that way, what well be able to do is ensure people have an income coming in, their job will be protected, but we prevent the second wave of a recession hitting uswere not careful.\"Becausepeople lose their jobs, they dont have their wages, demand collapses in the economy and then you really do have a recession.\"The lesson from past crises like these is act fast and act big, so thats why were saying the Government should step in and say to employers, well cover  per cent of your wages, you keep people in work.\"Demand for a room at Intercontinental Hotels has reached its lowest point in history, the group said, as the travel industry continues to be battered by the coronavirus pandemic.The business revealed that it would be cutting costs, eliminating its idend and reducing salaries in a bid to save cash.However, shares in the group, which have been badly hit in recent months, jumped by around  per cent on market open in London as investors reacted positively to the companys proposals.Chief executive Keith Barr said: \"Demand for hotels is currently at the lowest levels weve ever seen.Intercontinental Hotel Group has a robust business model and the measures we are announcing today to reduce costs and preserve cash give us the capacity to manage the business through this unique environment and to support our owners during this incredibly dficult time.\"These were not easy choices and we are mindful of the impact these decisions will have on our colleagues and shareholders.\"However, we believe that these are essential to ensuring that we come out of this as strong as we possibly can and ready to capitalise on what remains an industry with excellent long-term growth potential.\"Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders , said the list of key workers to whom schools will remain open is \"perhaps more extensive than we might have expected\".He said: \"Realistically, theywill need to identy these children by lunchtime.\"Mr Barton added: \"We already know from the trajectory of this that were not going to have many staff.\"We have to be careful that the message to parents is not business as usual.\"Matt Hancock said that a communication will be sent to around . million people who are classed as vulnerable to set out specic action for them to take.The Health secretary told Sky News: \"The first thing were going to do is set out exactly what conditions that applies to.\"We expect about . million people to then get a communication from the NHS to say that they are part of this and what they need to do.\"Many of these people have pre-existing health conditions and so will be very worried right now, and I understand that, and theyll need very specic sets of action - for instance, how do you go about still getting your chemoyou have cancer whilst also social-distancing \"If you have cancer its particularly important to stay away from other people, but you also of course have got to keep going with your chemotherapy.\"He added: \"These are some of the most dficult and challenging cases so well be getting in contact with them, butpeople think that they are on this list and dont receive a communication from the NHS, then they also need to get in contact.\"So that is under way, the money was announced for it yesterday.\"A combination of money to the NHS and money to councils because theyve got a very big part to play in keeping people safe.\"ASCL general secretary Geoff Barton said schools will have first worked to identy vulnerable children, as they will know who they are, and will then be looking at the \"key worker\" category.He said the ASCL is telling members: \"You have to do your best to negotiate the key workers list. Youre doing this to a tight timescale, and what you offer children on Monday may be dferent to what you offer next Wednesday.\"Mr Barton said that initially, schools will be doing all they can so that pupils who need to can still turn up to their own school after the weekend.In the longer term, there will be more strategic planning of school provision, he added.Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers , said: \"The Government has made clear that every child who can be safely cared for at home should be. And their advice makes clear too that this applies to children of key workers.\"For the vast majority of children and young people, school buildings will close tonight and not reopen for the foreseeable future.\"Taking up a place at school during this time of wider closure is the offer of last resort, for the minority of key workers, who have no alternative.\"School leaders have many questions that remain unanswered about how this will work in practice. We will continue to work with the Government throughout the day to provide greater clarity to schools to enable this reduced offer to be up and running as soon as possible.\"Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, added her voice to calls from school leaders urging parents to only send their children in as a last resort.She said: \"This is a very long list and could result in some schools having the majority of pupils attending. This will not achieve the goal of slowing the spread of the virus.\"So it is vitally important that parents follow government advice to keep their children at home, wherever possible. Schools can only accommodate a limited number of children and the fewer children making the journey to school, and the fewer children in educational settings, the lower the risk that the virus can spread.\"The competition watchdog has launched a taskforce to tackle businesses looking to exploit the coronavirus outbreak to take advantage of customers.The Competition and Markets Authoritysaid the outbreak has prompted concerns that people could be exploited by companies \"charging excessive prices or making misleading claims about their products\".It said it has already contacted traders and s over excessive pricing of hand sanitiser as part of its efforts.Andrea Coscelli, the CMAs chief executive, said: \"This is obviously a time when we all have to behave responsibly to protect our fellow citizens, and particularly those who are most vulnerable.\"We urge retailers to behave responsibly in the exceptional circumstances of the Covid- outbreak.\"Butthey do not, our taskforce is monitoring market developments to enable us to intervene as quickly as possible.\"We have a range of options at our disposal, from warnings to enforcement action to seeking emergency powers.\"The ceremonial of the Changing of the Guard at Buckingham Palace, St Jamess Palace and Windsor Castle is being postponed until further notice \"in line with Government advice to avoid mass gatherings\", Buckingham Palace has announced.The palace said in a statement that the situation would be \"reviewed on an ongoing basis, with a view to restarting when appropriate\". article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Irsquove grown up on the beach.ldquoI normally take landscape pictures because I love the water and some of the sunsets here are incredible, especially in the winter.Rochelle wrote her Instagram handle on the parcels, so that people who found them could send her a message.ldquoIt was just to make someone smile, and Irsquove had some lovely comments from people who got back to me on Instagram, she said.ldquoThey said they were going to put it up in their room and frame it.ldquoSome people were feeling a bit down and didnrsquot expect to find anything, so it cheered them up.ldquoMy job was done ndash the main purpose was to make people smile and it did - it made me smile too.ldquoI think itrsquos very important to say hello, especiallypeople are living by themselves orthey havenrsquot got their family around.ldquoWhen Irsquom normally walking the dog I say hello and have a chat, but itrsquos quite hard to do that now because everyone is quite wary.ldquoI donrsquot have to have that physical contact with someone to brighten up their day.ldquoArt is just a dferent  to communicate with. You knowsomeonersquos a bit shy and they donrsquot want to speak using words, they may want to draw a picture and open up that way instead.ldquoI think art can show feelings that words canrsquot quite express, so itrsquos a great idea to share that with the community.At a time of uncertainty and doubt, Rochelle ended with a message of hope and solidarity:ldquoI think as a community we could do so much more at this time, she saidldquoEveryone is concerned about how long it is going to last, but I am hopeful we can get past it, andwe all work together and remain positive we may come out of this in an even better situation than we was before.Rochelle would like to make clear that all parcels were fully sanitised.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief.

It needs to be stressed that the vast majority of people are doing the right thing. I want to thank them publicly and to acknowledge how tough it is to stay at home and keep your distance from others. However there has been a lot of attention on the small minority who have not followed the public health advice. It is essential that these tight restrictions are rigorously maintained in the weeks ahead. Quite simply, lives depend on it. So, let me appeal to everyone not to slip back into old habits. Any signs of complacency and impatience must be strongly resisted. Our actions now will impact on the spread of coronavirus in future weeks. Don’t lose heart or think the measures aren’t working just because of the current numbers and trends. What we are doing now is aimed at future weeks – slowing the spread of the virus and flattening its peak by drastically reducing human contact. That’s how we protect each other and protect our health service. We all have to stick with it, to get through this together. I make no apology for re-stating the vital advice once again. Stay at home. Please. Only go outit’s absolutely necessary and,you do, make sure you keep your distance from others. Wash your hands, thoroughly. When you sneeze or cough, use a tissue and then dispose of it – catch it, bin it, kill it. As a prominent doctor said in recent days, we can all be heroes. When we get through this as a society – which we will – you will want to look back and say you played your full part in fighting back against COVID-. I know very well the anxiety being felt across the community. I’m feeling exactly the same way - as a husband, a father and a son. But we have grounds for hope and positivity, alongside the deep apprehension. Social distancing will make a major dference –we keep doing it right and doing it together. Let’s take heart from the way people from all walks of le are coming forward to provide essential help. Our HSC workforce appeal is seeking new recruits to our health and social care workforce during the pandemic. Within a few short days of the appeal going live online, more than , people had signed up to register their interest in taking on roles. And there is large scale community-level volunteering going on, helping older and other vulnerable people cope during these dficult times. The Department for Communities is playing a key role in this area. When we look back, I hope we will remember how this crisis brought out the best in us how neighbours and strangers alike stepped up to help their fellow citizens in a time of grave need. When this is over, we will have a lot of rebuilding to do. Grief-stricken families, shattered lives, the economic and social fabric of society permanently altered. The collective spirit being forged right now will stand us in good stead.  addthis, Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n n n n n bannerbox_adcfcbafbeaeba   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n n n n n bannerbox_bbffebca   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]  []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
