He is grinning mischievously and clutching a beloved Jumelle box camera that had recently been given to him by his father. In the next few years, Jacques will constantly record the world around him, photographing his bedroom, making portraits of uncles and cousins, and framing his older brother, Zissou, as he leaps into the air from a boat.Another 60 years will pass, however, before the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York hosts the first exhibition of his work, belatedly bestowing on Jacques Henri Lartigue the recognition he deserves as one of the great innovators of 20th-century photography.When the celebrated American photographer Richard Avedon saw Jacques Henri Lartigue’s work for the first time on the eve of the MoMA show in 1963, he wrote to his compatriot to express his gratitude: “It was one of the most moving experiences of my life… You brought me into your world and isn’t that, after all, the purpose of art?”The world Lartigue created with his camera was a reflection of the one he was brought up in as a privileged, pampered boy in a family environment that was both bourgeois and carefree. His father Henri, a self-made businessman, insisted that neither Jacques nor Zissou attend school, instead recruiting private tutors whose main aim was to keep Henri’s offspring amused. He once said: “I have plenty of money. My children should learn how to spend it.”Later, Lartigue’s name would become synonymous with a certain kind of ritzy glamour and elegance, epitomised in his countless images of his lover, Renee Perle, whose sultry beauty captivated him. In the 1920s and early 1930s, he was known primarily as a society photographer, shooting the rich and beautiful in the resorts along the Côte d’Azur, where he felt effortlessly at home. The life he lived seems to have been as gilded as the lifestyles of the film stars, models, socialites and playboys he photographed.In her new book, The Boy and the Belle Époque, Louise Baring concentrates on Lartigue’s childhood and teenage years, the majority of the photographs included having been taken before he turned 18. She traces a formative journey that begins in the early 1900s, when the Lartigue family lived in opulence in Paris and their country retreat in the Auvergne, and continues until 1914, when the outbreak of the first world war signalled the end of the belle époque.Lartigue’s life during this period pertains to the arc of a classic French coming-of-age novel. He was an instinctively gifted, voraciously curious prodigy who found his creative medium as a child, and was sustained by it throughout his formative years and into his adult life.From the start, it seems, Lartigue had one eye on posterity, creating photo-albums and journals of the things he witnessed. Aged 11, he photographed his bedroom from ground level, furniture and a mirror looming over his toy racing cars.More often, as the array of model racing cars suggests, he was drawn to movement, and, as a child, often photographed relatives and servants jumping off walls and over tables to his instructions. In one memorable image, he captured his cousin Simone taking a tumble from a homemade scooter. His most intriguing early subject, however, was Zissou, a daredevil and a dandy, who built and raced his own go-karts, tearing around the grounds of Chateau de Rouzat, the family’s country retreat, in goggles and a tailored suit. Zissou was the eccentric action man, while Jacques, as Baring puts it, was “a sensitive child who became a lifelong spectator”.Later, he would photograph speeding racing cars in a blur of motion and beautiful socialite women framed like exotic creatures in closely cropped compositions. When these images were belatedly discovered and exhibited decades later, they attested to Lartigue’s instinctive embrace of what later became known as the snapshot aesthetic, a term loosely applied to 60s iconoclasts such as Garry Winogrand and Lee Friedlander, who disregarded the rules of formal composition. Back in the early 1900s, when Lartigue embraced blur and movement, his approach was so singular that it amounted to what Baring calls “a new visual language of the 20th century”.On 29 May 1910, Lartigue, then 15, began a new adventure in a new setting, arriving at the Avenue du Bois de Boulogne in Paris with an unwieldy folding plate camera. His aim was “to photograph the ladies in the most outrageous and beautiful hats”. Back then, the Bois de Boulogne in early summer was an open-air promenade, where society women paraded their style. They often crossed paths on the Allée des Acacias with the more bohemian and even more fashionable women of the Parisian demimonde: actors, dancers, musical hall stars and “grand cocottes” – courtesans like Liane de Pougy, a friend of the novelist Colette, and Émilienne d’Alençon, a great beauty who would later become Edward VII’s lover.Although cold-shouldered in public by respectable members of Parisian high society, these demimondaines, writes Baring, “set the style, deciding which couture creations would rise or fall in the coming season”. Lartigue captured them all, often startling his exotic subjects with the loud click of his camera’s shutter. The results are fascinating, a record of a time and place when this sartorial exhibitionism was simply another ersion in, as Colette scathingly put it, “the bustling lives of people with nothing to do”.At times, Lartigue inevitably comes across as a proto-paparazzo. More often, though, he captures vignettes that speak volumes about the elastic social mores of the belle époque. His snatched portraits, for all the period detail they capture, seem, like his previous images of speed and movement, oddly contemporary. The blur, the often fantastical silhouettes, the sideways glances, the way he crops his images so that his subjects loom large – and even more exotic looking – in the frame, point to a singular sensibility that was at odds with traditional composition.Throughout this period, his love of speed and movement remained. He photographed the early French pioneers of flight, Gabriel Voisin and Louis Blériot, as they risked life and limb in an aerodrome near Paris. At the 1912 Grand Prix in Dieppe, he made one of his most famous early photographs, freeze-framing the rear of a Delage racing car as it sped past him at close range. The driver clutches the wheel as observers on the other side of the track appear as leaning shadows, their blurred outlines evincing the sense of motion that Lartigue set out to capture. In retrospect, all those childhood days snapping Zissou on his go-karts and his cousins leaping through the air seem to lead to this defining moment.If Lartigue was a photographer of the age of speed and modernity, he was not a man of action when it came to the war, which, for the main part, seemed to pass him by as if happening elsewhere. As France ordered general mobilisation, he retreated with his family from Paris to the Auvergne and the sanctuary that was Chateau Rouzat.“The war inevitably made us unhappy,” he wrote in a secret diary, “but it was happy all the same… I played sports and we still amused ourselves.” There is a single image in the book that suggests the unfolding horror: a platoon of marching soldiers silhouetted against a grey sky as a spindly aeroplane flies overhead. The war inevitably curtailed his carefree life, writes Baring, but “Lartigue emerged intact, plunging into life with the passions of a child, refusing ever to grow up”. That childlike optimism would fuel his life and his photography for decades to come."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0814345af234de0659b1083e7836a90d04294451/0_1513_4253_2551/master/4253.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f8a5fabf6d550a6bfea908be1bf52ccf","title":"the big picture on the road in post ceaucescu romania","story":"An odyssey around remote parts of central and eastern Europe led Fabio Ponzio to this incongruous sightBefore the collapse of the Soviet Union, Italian photographer Fabio Ponzio would look at a map of Europe and find his eyes always drawn to the east, to its “mysterious names, inscrutable frontiers and roads that ran on into unknown, prohibited lands”. It seemed to him that the iron curtain was “the ision between the conscious and the unconscious mind of Europe”.He first travelled across that dreamlike frontier in 1987, two years before revolutions reunited the continent. After the wall came down, over the course of a couple of decades, he drove determinedly through all the remote territories from which he had been excluded, with a tent and a stove and a sleeping bag in the back of his car, along with three Nikon cameras and 100 rolls of film. He slept in woods or in the homes of people he met. Once, in the mountains of Albania, the villagers told him that he was the first foreigner they had seen since two Italian soldiers fleeing the armistice of 1943.His pictures from those years – of weddings and funerals, of drunks and pilgrims, the homeless of the cities and the rural poor – caught cultures in the hinterland after communism and before consumerism. That period, as the hope of liberation gave way to endemic uncertainty, is the subject of his book East of Nowhere. Ponzio’s camera was drawn to incongruity. He took this picture in Romania in 1997, eight years on from the fall of Ceaușescu. The international licence plates and the open road stretching out beyond the mountains might promise new freedoms, but the sheep in the back of the car root this image in a stranger, older more unstable kind of reality. The car is going nowhere."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf2ce07325e2f5101ee702bb163c23b4f846db96/0_321_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a2012b105c687582b45d847c0c5437e6","title":"for one tide only modernist sandcastles in pictures","story":"Artist Calvin Seibert grew up on a ski resort strongly influenced by brutalist architecture in 1960s Colorado. “The construction sites were never fenced in, so they were great places to play and always had piles of sand,” he says.

The supply of oil is increasing. The result – as even those with only the scantiest understanding of economics knows – is that the price of oil must be falling.And some. The cost of Brent crude – one of the market benchmarks – fell to below $23 a barrel in early trading, the lowest it has been since the US and the UK were making preparations for the invasion of Iraq in November 2002.What’s happening to supply requires a bit more of an explanation, because with demand collapsing the normal response of the big producers would be to limit output in the hope that would stabilise the price.This time it is different. Saudi Arabia has responded by turning the taps full on even though its own government finances will suffer from a lower oil price. Why? Because the Saudis are in a power struggle with the world’s other two major producers – the US and Russia – and is convinced it can endure the pain of a low oil price for longer than they can.In this global game of chicken, Riyadh is gambling that it can eliminate competition from the US shale oil sector – much of which is unviable at $20 barrel – and force Moscow into accepting the need to get serious about production curbs. The Saudis ramped up the pressure at the weekend by making it clear that they were not close to a deal with the Russians.That announcement was the trigger for the latest price fall, and all the signs are that the cost of crude will go still lower. With Donald Trump accepting the need to keep tough Covid-19 restrictions in place until the end of April, it is clear that the crisis is going to last for longer than originally expected. It won’t be long before storage capacity runs out.The current weakness of oil prices will not last for ever. Supply will go down as a result of US shale producers going out of business and an eventual deal between Riyadh and Moscow. Demand will go up, in part stimulated by falling oil prices, which lower business costs and boost consumer spending power.But for the tide to turn one of two things need to happen. The Saudis need to stop flooding the market and consumers need to be able to spend their windfalls. Neither looks imminent."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d35c82b384dadeb57d4951bc4cb5c30f4b6f238/0_232_4200_2520/master/4200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=13935656be2bf5590f79cf6f6bf63fad","title":"ba suspends gatwick flights coronavirus british airways easyjet","story":"British Airways move follows easyJet’s decision to ground all aircraft for at least two monthsBritish Airways is suspending all remaining flights to and from Gatwick, ending the last scheduled flights by UK carriers from the airport during the coronavirus pandemic.The national carrier’s move comes a day after easyJet grounded its entire fleet of aircraft for at least two months. Demand for travel has collapsed in recent weeks as many countries are in partial or full lockdown, forcing airlines to cancel thousands of flights.Gatwick is closing one of its two terminals from Wednesday and will only operate any remaining flights between 2pm and 10pm to cut costs to a minimum during the crisis.The majority of Gatwick’s 2,500 employees will be laid off in the coming days, with some having already taken voluntary redundancy. About 200 contractors have been laid off.A few foreign carriers, including the Gulf airline Qatar, are continuing to operate some flights, but otherwise only a few, unscheduled repatriation services are expected to pass through the airport in the coming weeks.BA, which is still running flights to and from Heathrow, said it would contact customers to discuss their options.The consumer association Which? said that BA must offer refunds. Struggling airlines have been giving passengers vouchers or rebooking them for another date, but are legally obliged to pay out for cancellations. The global airline body, Iata, has warned that full refunds would cost the industry a collective $35bn (£28bn) immediately at a time when many carriers face bankruptcy.A BA spokesman said: “Due to the considerable restrictions and challenging market environment, like many other airlines we will temporarily suspend our flying schedule at Gatwick.”The airline will carry out essential work at Gatwick, including maintenance, to be ready to start up again once travel restrictions are relaxed.The pandemic has pushed the global airline industry into crisis, with strict restrictions across most of the main air travel markets all but wiping out most airlines’ revenues. Iata’s director-general, Alexandre de Juniac, warned: “Travel and tourism is essentially shut down in an extraordinary and unprecedented situation. Airlines need working capital to sustain their businesses through the extreme volatility.“Canada, Colombia and the Netherlands are giving a major boost to the sector’s stability by enabling airlines to offer vouchers in place of cash refunds. This is a vital time buffer so that the sector can continue to function.”The UK aviation industry stepped up its criticism of the UK government, which has insisted that it will not offer an industry-wide bailout, and would only consider support on a case-by-case basis.The Airport Operators Association said the US, Australia, Norway, Spain and France, among others, had all agreed packages of state aid including loans and credit guarantees. Its chief executive, Karen Dee, said the government was “lagging behind its international competitors when it comes to safeguarding our vital industry for the future”.The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, told the BBC on Tuesday: “We do want there to be competition in the airline market when we come out of this crisis. We are also firmly aware that airlines have shareholders … It can’t be right that in good times the shareholders benefit and in bad times the taxpayer pays.”He added: “We’re into now detailed discussion with airlines, airports, the ancillary services as well … It’s a question of finding the right solutions from that wide range the chancellor has announced … and then anything we can do to assist.”Virgin Atlantic, one of the first airlines to seek assistance, is among four carriers whose planes will be chartered by the government for a £75m repatriation operation for Britons stranded abroad.Thousands of airline staff have been temporarily laid off or are taking unpaid leave. Easyjet and Virgin are setting up schemes for thousands of laid-off crew to volunteer over the next two months with the NHS or work in supermarkets.On Monday, Loganair, the Scottish regional carrier, said it would be seeking government assistance beyond that offered to all British companies via the chancellor’s package of government-backed loans worth £330bn.BA’s owner, International Airlines Group, on Monday said it had extended a $1.38bn (£1.09bn) credit buffer by a year to June 2021. This means it has access to €9.3bn in cash, cash equivalents and loans, which it can use to get through the crisis."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e88ad38bb264d57ab27603ece2864af701ac2cf2/102_7_5305_3183/master/5305.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=95841a3f4b09c4da59c7f979eacbd32b","title":"coronavirus should not have caught leaders and markets off guard","story":"Contrary to what Donald Trump would like to believe, such a pandemic was predicted last yearEvents like the Covid-19 pandemic, the US housing-market crash of 2007-09 and the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001, are often called “black swans”. The term is meant to suggest that no one could have seen them coming. But, in fact, these episodes each involved known unknowns, rather than what the former US secretary of defence Donald Rumsfeld famously called “unknown unknowns”.After all, in each case, knowledgable analysts were aware not only that such a thing could happen but also that it was likely to happen eventually. Although the precise nature and timing of these events were not predictable with high probability, the severity of the consequences were. Had policymakers considered the risks and taken more preventive steps in advance, they might have averted or mitigated disaster.In the case of Covid-19, epidemiologists and other health experts have been warning about the danger of a viral pandemic for decades, including as recently as last year. But that has not stopped the US president Donald Trump from claiming that the crisis was “unforeseen” that it is an issue that “nobody ever thought would be a problem”. Likewise, after the attacks of 11 September 2001, President George W Bush wrongly asserted: “There was nobody in our government, at least, and I don’t think the prior government that could envision flying airplanes into buildings on such a massive scale.”In light of such statements, it is tempting to attribute these disasters solely to executive incompetence. But human error at the top is too facile to be a complete explanation, considering that the general public and financial markets have also often been caught by surprise. Stock markets had reached historic highs just before the 2008 financial crisis and again before the latest crash that began in late February. In both cases, there were plenty of foreseeable tail risks that should have militated against irrational exuberance.On these occasions, investors were not just following overly optimistic baseline forecasts. Rather, they saw essentially no risks at all. The Vix – a measure of perceived financial-market volatility (sometimes known as the “fear index”) – was near record lows in advance of both 2007-09 and 2020.Several factors help to explain why extreme events so often catch us by surprise. First, even technical experts can miss the big picture if they do not cast their net wide enough when analysing the data. They sometimes look only at recent data sets, assuming that in a fast-changing world, events from 100 years ago are irrelevant. Americans often come with an additional set of blinders: an excessive focus on the US. Giving little mind to the rest of the world is one of the perils of American exceptionalism.In 2006, for example, the finance whizzes who priced US mortgage-backed securities relied primarily on the recent history of US housing prices, effectively operating under the rule that housing prices never fall in nominal terms. But that rule merely reflected the fact that the analysts themselves had never witnessed housing prices falling in nominal terms simultaneously. Housing prices had indeed fallen in the US in the 1930s, and in Japan as recently as the 1990s. But those episodes did not coincide with the lived experience of US-based financial analysts.Worse, in 2018, the Trump administration actually eliminated the National Security Council unit that had been created by President Barack Obama to deal with the risk of pandemics and it has regularly tried to slash the budgets of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other public-health agencies. It is little wonder that America’s handling of the pandemic – the lack of testing and the dangerous shortage of critical-care equipment and facilities – has fallen so far short of other advanced economies, not least Singapore and South Korea.But, in addition to reducing America’s capacity to respond to pandemics, the White House simply had no plan, nor recognised that it would need one, even after it had become obvious that the coronavirus outbreak in China would spread globally. Instead, the administration dithered and erted blame, failed to ramp up testing, and thereby kept the number of confirmed cases artificially low, perhaps to support stock prices.As for Trump’s claim that, “Nobody has ever seen anything like this before”, one need only look back four years to the deadly Ebola outbreak that killed 11,000 people. But they were far away, in west Africa. The 1918-19 influenza pandemic killed 675,000 Americans (along with some 50 million worldwide), but that was 100 years ago.Apparently, our political leaders are impressed only when a disaster has killed a large number of citizens within their own country and within living memory. If you have never seen a black swan with your own eyes, they must not exist.The world is now learning about pandemics the hard way. Let us hope that the price in lives is not too high – and that the right lessons are learned.• Jeffrey Frankel is a professor at Harvard University’s John F Kennedy School of Government.

The measures we’re taking, such as putting some stores into hibernation, will help us better serve communities from the majority of stores that remain open during this period of disruption.”The company is also laying off 250 colleagues based at its offices in Willenhall, in the West Midlands, and Watford in Hertfordshire. About 40 contractors working at Willenhall are also being stood down at the end of this week.Poundland said shop workers would be asked to transfer to nearby stores if there were vacancies because other colleagues were absent due to the pandemic. If there is no work available nearby, the company said it would look to access the government’s lay-off scheme for shop workers to “protect jobs for the future”. The retailer has 860 stores in the UK and Ireland.The government’s order last week that all non-essential shops close leaves only a small group of retailers still trading. Poundland claims shoppers rely on the chain to buy low-priced groceries and household essentials such as cleaning products. Rivals such as Wilko, B\u0026ampM and Home Bargains are also still open. Williams said Poundland regulars did not have the cash to bulk buy and typically bought what they could carry home.Earlier this month Poundland’s owner, Steinhoff International, postponed a potential sale or flotation of its European arm. Pepco Europe, which has about 2,800 stores including Poundland in the UK and the Pepco and Dealz chains in Europe, was expected to finalise a takeover deal or IPO (initial public offering) later this year after Steinhoff confirmed it was evaluating options for the group in November."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d0ba0eeaec8bf1edaa44233dbdf74b665bcd1ef6/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0bb7e9272bbf99a4e8dbb9e910d86e45","title":"wpp savings plan covid 19 advertising pr buyback dividend","story":"World’s largest advertising and PR group shelves share buyback and idendAdvertising giant WPP has unveiled a £2bn savings plan to shore up its balance sheet in the face of the coronavirus pandemic.“It is clear that the companies in the strongest financial position will be best placed to protect their people, serve their clients and benefit their shareholders during a period of great uncertainty, which is why we are taking the steps we are outlining today,” said the WPP chief executive, Mark Read.Other measures include postponing staff salary increases, a hiring freeze and a halt to  discretionary spending, such as on travel, hotels and award shows.

Never mind Russia and China and the bizarre president of Belarus, who has advised drinking vodka and visiting a sauna as ways to stay healthy in the current crisis. Get on your comfiest socks instead, make rye bread and declutter. No harm done.Now the world outside really is unsafe, everything changes. The demand for “safe space” will never chime in the same way as it once did. No one’s priority right now is being safe from opinions they don’t really like we all want to be safe from viral loads. Public space is dangerous – and eerie, empty urban vistas have never looked more beautiful.Private space is dangerous, too. Domestic violence is rising all over the world, the terrorising by men of women who feel less able to escape than ever. Home is a sanctuary for some and a prison for others, and home, the domestic sphere, the only permissible location for many women, is now the only place many of us can be.Sure, we are lucky to have homes – and our society’s sudden ability to shelter the homeless is obviously a good thing – but so many homes have no outside space and walls can quickly close in. “Home, with our bodies touching  Home, and the cameras watching  Home, will infect whatever you do  Where home, comes to life from out of the blue,” sang David Byrne, capturing the ambivalence about what home may mean.I hear this ambivalence all the time at the moment. I hear the people who are boasting that their homes are not in the centre of the epidemic, and I hear those who think that, after all of this, they want to move. I hear those nesting and baking and making themselves feel safe by dipping into a reservoir of happy childhood memories, covering themselves in gravity blankets of nostalgic pastimes, tethering themselves to happier memories.If you didn’t feel very safe as a child, this doesn’t really work, I find. What works best is a kind of numbing, not mindfulness but mindlessness. The shrinks can back off a bit for a while. Of course, it’s good to experience a whole range of emotions, rather than cutting ourselves off, but we can’t all be feeling all the emotions at the moment. For me, watching MasterChef is great because I have no emotional investment in any of the contestants and can just watch as they transform food in ways I would never dream of (good and bad).To get through this period I can feel part of myself shutting down. This has happened to me before, when my children have been in hospital and near death. It is a physical response to trauma and I find I can sleep when, normally, I would never be able to. I observe this in myself and others. The catastrophe has happened and the anxiety lessens. Life is not safe. The illusion that it ever was turns to ash.Friends with disabilities and chronic illness, these are the experts now. They know about being stuck at home and perhaps home, as James Baldwin said, is not a place but “simply an irrevocable condition”.The new condition that the virus requires is a level of disconnect. It depends on self-reliance as well as the need to reach others who are alone. The new condition is already disrupting chains of command. The government is infected and now sends out the medical experts to make its policy announcements, to do its dirty work. How small these big men of government now look. Dominic Cummings isn’t so Teflon, is he? Just one of the herd.The people who look big are the supermarket workers and the medics. That whole other realm of fake experts, the new-age gurus, the homeopaths, the Goop drips – all those grasping attendants of the “worried well” – have never looked so fraudulent. All that spiritual advice about living in the present, embracing the moment, the power of now? Yeah, well, the present is very difficult. The present is where we are and it’s unsafe.Knowing this is one thing, feeling it is another. The poet and novelist Rainer Maria Rilke knew about uncertainty. He told us to stop looking for answers and to learn to love the questions, “like locked rooms and like books written in a foreign language”. We don’t know what is going to happen. “At present you need to live the question.” That’s what is hard. Very hard.So as we weave our cocoons and wait to see what emerges, the only certainty is our gratitude to those who leave theirs to look after us all. That is enough for now. More than enough."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/908c778b3a165b4869033f6807bba752b867a85c/0_466_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ca67d04492fa82f69e5df50119beb88b","title":"coronavirus has tainted city life now i long for nature and community","story":"I loved London. But now I wonder if, after this is all over, there will be a mass exodus from our citiesIn more auspicious times, there was a question I would sometimes ask in the pub to fuel a fun, boozy conversation. It was: “If you found yourself here in London in an apocalyptic scenario, would you stay or would you go? And if you were to flee the capital, how would you do so?”After the plausibility of bicycling to Hertfordshire was inevitably shot down by my friends, I’d usually settle on staying, making jokes about the 80 or so bottles of homemade wine that we have on the premises. But now that I’m here, in a lockdown where the only moral option was to stay put or risk spreading the infection further, I’ve had to conclude that London really could be one of the worst places to be in a national emergency.Though I grew up in the countryside, I was born in the Whittington Hospital in north London. I now live a stone’s throw away, and was married in the same building in which my birth was registered. When I moved back to London, in 2006, I fell for the city hook, line and sinker, and was under the assumption that it would always be that way. I’m that moon-eyed fool whose heart soars when the bus unexpectedly crosses the river. I’m the putz marvelling about being able to walk out of my house and consume the cuisine of a dozen different places and cultures. Even the novel I wrote was a love letter to London.The Covid-19 crisis has made the scales fall from my eyes. It isn’t just the constant sirens, which used to be background noise and now have taken on a heart-wrenching, doom-laden significance, or the lack of space, which sees me rounding corners with the apprehension of a teenage girl in a horror film.I find myself jealous of my father in Wales who has been self-isolating down by the river of my childhood friends, who have mountain ranges as their back gardens, the ocean on their doorsteps. I find myself envying their close-knit communities, which have rallied in mutual support. Meanwhile, I have only just met my next-door neighbour, who moved in six years ago. What am I doing here, so far from nature and from family? What was so important?I know the answer to this, of course: my work, my sense of identity, my friends, culture. I felt that the culture London had to offer was unparalleled. But when you close the galleries and the gig venues, what is left? I simply trudge through the same old backstreets on my daily walk even my local green space, Hampstead Heath, has little new to offer. It has led me to conclude that the city is great because of its people, the people who have made its food and its art its architecture, too, though much of that now lies empty. As for the geography, I can take it or leave it.I wonder if, after this is all over, our cities will see a mass exodus. Crises, such as this pandemic, always lead to a reassessment in this case of what constitutes privilege, that much-overused term. Aside from wealth, I used to think privilege meant access to culture, which we rightly value as important. Yet many of us have forgotten to value the natural landscape and what it has to offer us. Privilege, as I see it now, in the midst of this emergency, is the ability to roam in the open countryside. I’d lost touch with that, over the years, despite my childhood climbing trees, hiking up the sides of mountains, and swimming in the pools above waterfalls.Of course, it could just be that I am of that age now. Thousands are already fleeing London for a quieter life, with more than a third of a million people moving out of the city last year. And this pandemic, pollution, and of course climate change will only accelerate that. Or it could just be the state of emergency. In 2016, suffering the after-effects of post-traumatic stress disorder following the Paris attacks and fearful of similar happening here, I kept begging my then boyfriend, now husband, to move me to a cottage in the country where I could spend my life tending roses. He humoured me, because I wasn’t in my right mind. This time, I am. I may well forget this feeling when the city shakes itself off and comes back to life in all its shimmering vigour, but I somehow think I won’t. I’ll always have warm feelings towards London, its ersity and its energy.I’m moved by small acts of kindness in my community: one neighbour is posting nasturtiums through the letterbox, another, who is on benefits and is making a new life here after arriving from a very poor country, left a box of essentials in the hall. Last week I looked from my window and saw him meditating in a fading patch of evening sunlight. Clapping for the NHS reminded me that there are other, kindly souls all around us. This city means a lot to me. I’m fond, but not in love. Nor am I “tired of life”. I just understand that life is also elsewhere."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de407292c8eef60fc81471acf2bb7e5594f5d681/159_48_3341_2004/master/3341.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=884b154f077298dbb52119d892d8394f","title":"egypt coronavirus transparency sisi crackdown","story":"President Sisi may have nothing to hide, but his crackdown on anyone who challenges the official line only fuels speculationDuring a public health crisis, a government’s credibility is a vital asset. To slow the spread of a virus, the government must convincingly inform and instruct the public. And to do this, it must inspire trust – trust that it is following the science, acting out of the interests of the population, and enforcing measures that will help to keep the public safe. Trust depends on transparency. If governments appear to be concealing the truth, or withholding information, their credibility can quickly crumble.The Egyptian government has long seen transparency as a weakness, and guarded information as though it were a national security threat. Much like Donald Trump’s White House, Egypt’s leaders have responded to reports about the estimated number of coronavirus infections as though they were a personal attack, rather than a health crisis the entire world is struggling to contain.Anyone found spreading “rumours” about the coronavirus now faces imprisonment and fines. Websites – such as the BBC and the US-based Arabic language Alhurra news channel – continue to be censored, and the government has sought to silence journalists. Egyptian officials recently expelled the British  journalist Ruth Michaelson following her report on mathematical modelling that indicated Egypt’s number of actual infections may be far higher than the official figures.At the time of Michaelson’s report, Egypt’s ministry of health claimed there were a total of 126 confirmed infections. Rather than respond to the study’s contention, Egyptian officials condemned the  for reporting it, expelled Michaelson and rebuked the New York Times’ Cairo bureau chief, Declan Walsh, for deigning to even tweet about the study.An environment of opacity and suspicion has made the Egyptian government into its own worst enemy, and aggravated what Egyptian officials seemingly fear: that the world could suspect they are covering up the real scale of infections. By expelling a journalist who reported on the country’s coronavirus cases, the government has invited others to wonder what it has to hide.It may have nothing to hide at all. Thus far, there is no evidence of an orchestrated cover-up of infections. Egyptian authorities responded faster and more aggressively than their counterparts in the UK, shutting schools and universities weeks ago. The government has halted flights and pledged a coronavirus package of 100 billion Egyptian pounds to combat the virus.Moreover, no country can claim a perfect response – the scientific consensus about the virus is still emerging, and nobody yet knows how much devastation it will ultimately wreak. Egypt could have acknowledged that most countries undoubtedly have more infections than confirmed numbers, because testing is still limited.The UK itself is contending with two dramatically different models: one from Imperial College London researchers, who argue the country is still early in its fight with the virus, and another from researchers at Oxford University, which suggests that as much as half the population (over 30 million people) may have already been infected. In the absence of data about the virus, such models are partly reliant on assumption and speculation, as has been argued in the .Rather than concede the complexity of the subject, debate the merits of these claims or explain their views on the matter, Egypt’s government lashed out at the reports, intensifying suspicions that it had something to hide.Indeed, its persistent aversion to transparency has led many observers and foreign governments to view most official claims with a degree of suspicion. When Isis downed a Russian passenger jet over Sinai in 2015, Egypt spent several months denying what countless governments had already concluded was true: Isis’s affiliate in Sinai, Wilayat Sinai, was responsible. But Egyptian investigators pressed on, insisting there was no evidence of terrorism or foul play.Several months after the attack, Egypt’s president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, casually acknowledged that the plane was brought down by terrorists in a speech about the economy. To this day, conclusions from the investigation have not been made public. The government’s strict insistence that nothing be said until its conclusions were published now seems like an effort to delay discussion until the matter was forgotten.But terrorist attacks have plagued other countries. Fatal security failures are a regular feature of our era. Admitting to failures, and working openly with other countries to resolve them, would have helped to build confidence in Egypt’s government. Instead, by spending months denying and obfuscating, many countries questioned whether Egypt was truly committed to improving airport security.Not only was the government’s response harmful – it was also unnecessary. After the Sinai incident, Egypt took steps to improve airport security, which has continued to be far more stringent than before the crash. But the damage to its reputation had already been done, and would last for years. Flights from the UK to Sharm el-Sheikh only resumed in February, and Russia still doesn’t permit flights to the Red Sea resort town.It’s the same story with coronavirus. The government would do far better by responding transparently to concerns, and being open about the measures it is taking. During a pandemic, transparency is not a liberal luxury, but a vital feature of effective governance.• Timothy E Kaldas is an independent risk adviser and nonresident fellow at the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ceb5237f58a0f6b53b54e8b527a961bdd50691c/0_9_4600_2760/master/4600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1945e5a0969a9c031e4b69924f019279","title":"virus neighbours covid 19","story":"Across the world, the first response to Covid-19 has been grassroots community action. Governments should take noteYou can watch neoliberalism collapsing in real time. Governments whose mission was to shrink the state, to cut taxes and borrowing and dismantle public services, are discovering that the market forces they fetishised cannot defend us from this crisis. The theory has been tested, and almost everywhere abandoned. It may not be true that there were no atheists in the trenches, but there are no neoliberals in a pandemic.The shift is even more interesting than it first appears. Power has migrated not just from private money to the state, but from both market and state to another place altogether: the commons. All over the world, communities have mobilised where governments have failed.In India, young people have self-organised on a massive scale to provide aid packages for “daily wagers”: people without savings or stores, who rely entirely on cash flow that has now been cut off. In Wuhan, in China, as soon as public transport was suspended, volunteer drivers created a community fleet, transporting medical workers between their homes and hospitals.In South Africa, communities in Johannesburg have made survival packs for people in informal settlements: hand sanitiser, toilet paper, bottled water and food. In Cape Town, a local group has GIS mapped all the district’s households, surveyed the occupants, and assembled local people with medical expertise, ready to step in if the hospitals are overwhelmed. Another community in the city has built washstands in the train station and is working to turn a pottery studio into a factory making sanitiser.In the US, HospitalHero connects healthcare workers who don’t have time to meet their own needs with people who can offer meals and accommodation. A group called WePals, created by an eight-year-old, sets up virtual play dates for children. A new website, schoolclosures.org, finds teaching, meals and emergency childcare for overstretched parents. A network called Money During Corona texts news of job opportunities to people looking for work.In Norway, a group of people who have recovered from Covid-19 provide services that would be dangerous for non-immune people to offer. In Belgrade volunteers organise virtual coffee mornings and crisis counselling. Students in Prague are babysitting the children of doctors and nurses. Estates in Dublin have invented balcony bingo: the caller sits in the square between the blocks of flats with a large speaker, while the players sit on their balconies, taking down the numbers.In the UK, thousands of mutual aid groups have been picking up shopping and prescriptions, installing digital equipment for elderly people and setting up telephone friendship teams. A mothers’ running group in Bristol have restyled themselves “drug runners”, keeping fit by delivering medicines from chemists’ shops to people who can’t leave their homes. A virtual pub quiz organised on Facebook brought togethermore than 100,000 people.Around the world, self-organised groups of doctors, technicians, engineers and hackers are crowdsourcing missing equipment and expertise. In Latvia, programmers organised a 48-hour hackathon to design the lightest face shield components that could be produced with a 3D printer. A number of UK groups are encouraging companies with protective equipment in their storerooms to give it to frontline health workers. In the Philippines, fashion designers have repurposed their workshops to produce protective suits. Sharing techniques through the website PatternReview, home sewers have been mass-producing masks and scrubs.In just one week, a group of doctors, technicians and experts organised themselves to design a crowdsourced ventilator, the OxVent, which can be produced from widely available parts for under £1,000. Another design, VentilatorPAL, can be manufactured for $370, according to the community of technicians that created it. The Coronavirus Tech Handbook is an open-source library pooling technologies and new organisational models for beating the pandemic. In the US, self-organised expert groups are filling some of the catastrophic gaps in public health provision, carrying out testing and tracking projects, creating directories of vulnerable people and speed-matching medical specialists with the hospitals that need them.The horror films got it wrong. Instead of turning us into flesh-eating zombies, the pandemic has turned millions of people into good neighbours.In their book Free, Fair and Alive, David Bollier and Silke Helfrich define the commons as “a social form that enables people to enjoy freedom without repressing others, enact fairness without bureaucratic control … and assert sovereignty without nationalism”. The commons are neither capitalist nor communist, market nor state. They are an insurgency of social power, in which we come together as equals to confront our shared predicaments.A thousand books and films and business fables assure us that the fairytale ending to which we should all aspire is to become a millionaire. Then we can isolate ourselves from society in a mansion with high walls, with private healthcare, private education and a private jet. The commons envisages the opposite outcome: finding meaning, purpose and satisfaction by working together to enhance the lives of all. In times of crisis, we rediscover our social nature.You can tell a lot about a society from its quirks of language. We repeatedly misuse the word “social”. We talk about social distancing when we mean physical distancing. We talk about social security and the social safety net when we mean economic security and the economic safety net. While economic security comes (or should come) from government, social security arises from community. One of the extraordinary features of the response to Covid-19 is that, during this self-isolation, some people – especially elderly people – feel less isolated than they have done for years, as their neighbours ensure they are not alone.We still need the state: to provide healthcare, education and an economic safety net, to distribute wealth between communities, to prevent any private interest from becoming too powerful, and to defend us from threats. It currently performs these functions poorly, by design. But if we rely on the state alone, we find ourselves sorted into silos of provisioning and highly vulnerable to cuts. Rich social lives are replaced with cold, transactional relations. Community, then, is not a substitute for the state, but an essential complement.There is no guarantee that this resurgence of collective action will survive the pandemic. We could revert to the isolation and passivity that both capitalism and statism have encouraged. But I don’t think we will. I have the sense that something is taking root now, something we have been missing: the unexpectedly thrilling and transformative force of mutual aid."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f7f09f4dbaa6c9280baa5400d468beff8a081212/0_0_1300_780/master/1300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eb38f86cea847b73fd92b2e24b217a57","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of ambience","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘ambience’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘ambience’.Share your photos of what ambience means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 1 April at 10am.

Lecture theatres bulge, coffee queues lengthen and library shelves empty. The interactions are multilingual and non-stop.This year, silence. Buildings are in lockdown and staff barred from their offices. Those students who remain are mostly unable to go home.But learning goes on, displaced, not discontinued. In many respects, Covid-19 is drawing out the best from staff, their commitment to students’ education and wellbeing shining through the uncertainty. Seminars zoom on to students’ smartphones, live from lecturers’ homes. WhatsApp groups, set up very recently to coordinate picketing strategy, become forums in which colleagues can support and advise one another. Behind the scenes – and under-acknowledged – armies of administrative staff and IT workers make all of this possible.Already, old ways of working seem distant and inexplicable. Were there really so many face-to-face meetings? What did all that bureaucracy achieve? Why did universities submit to so many external metrics? Were we improved by this “accountability” regime? Or did we just get better at playing the market’s games?For logistical reasons, planned audits of teaching and research such as the National Student Survey and the Research Excellence Framework are on hold or in jeopardy. Could it be the time to consider whether their benefits are proportionate to their costs?We were told that student consumers could make informed decisions only if able to access maximum information. But the ones I’m now Skyping care little about “value for money” or expected graduate incomes. They are just glad that their learning still matters, and that university staff care about them.If universities emerge from Covid-19 with trust won back from government – and, crucially, are willing to pass on that trust to frontline staff – post-pandemic higher education could look very different.Opportunities are everywhere. With no school-based exams this year, university admissions could finally take place in ways that allow fairer access. The move to online teaching could accelerate the decolonisation of curriculums. The shift away from on-campus research could open doors for more collaborative scholarship. Unfettered by physical location, and the compulsion to erect ever-shinier buildings, universities suddenly find themselves free to reimagine their place in society.Maybe we can collaborate to form a knowledge base that allows future crises to be handled in more informed ways, so that fewer lives become disrupted or endangered? Academic research offers a highly potent antidote to the slew of misinformation and speculation that can jam social media. A single updateable point of truth, based on the most rigorous scholarship available, might help win back public confidence and redeem the tarnished reputation of experts and expertise.Covid-19 research is being published at a faster pace than sluggish peer review processes customarily allow. And there’s an audible softening of tone from the Office for Students – a regulator previously wedded to competition at all costs, now promising to adapt.But as lecturers imaginatively pivot to remote teaching, trust issues linger. What will happen to electronically “captured” content when the crisis is over?A TedX model of teaching could prove attractive to those seeking efficiency savings during the inevitable post-Covid financial squeeze, and predatory “ed-tech” companies are already seeking ways to cash in. But students don’t want passive and distant models of learning. They want technology that brings them closer to specialists in the subject they love. Now is the time to make sure that those staff are valued fully by their employers. Casualisation must dog the sector no more.For decades, universities have been distracted from their core functions by a regulatory framework and management culture that demanded they vie with one another endlessly for research and teaching income, and for league table recognition. With campuses standing empty, those “wins” seem hollow.Staff have already demonstrated their adaptability, intuitively and collegially doing what is right for their students. Now Covid-19 offers a chance for the sector to redefine its relationship with the public, and for university managers to reset their relationship with staff."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f90b79b1ccb5120edf8b2af6265146866a48edc8/160_0_2395_1437/master/2395.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ef15e35da590dbab483470a8346cf25a","title":"uk students union calls on universities to cancel summer exams","story":"NUS says some students could be disadvantaged if exams go ahead during coronavirusThe National Union of Students has called on universities to cancel or postpone this summer’s exams to avoid further stress and disruption to students’ lives during the coronavirus pandemic.The NUS said disabled, international and poorer students would be significantly disadvantaged if universities go through with plans to hold online exams and assessments next term.It said final-year students should be given a choice of how to complete their degrees, such as receiving an estimated grade based on prior attainment, doing an open book online exam, or taking their finals at the university at a later date. “In the current climate, student welfare must come first,” said Claire Sosienski-Smith, the NUS vice-president (higher education). “It is vital that there are no compulsory exams this year.”The NUS added that all exams for first and second-year students should be cancelled, while postgraduate students should get a six-month extension to their submission deadlines.People in the UK will only be allowed to leave their home for the following purposes:Police will have the powers to enforce the rules, including through fines and dispersing gatherings. To ensure compliance with the instruction to stay at home, the government will:Parks will remain open for exercise, but gatherings will be dispersed.The demand comes after thousands of students across the country called for alternative assessments to be put in place to ensure their academic performance is not adversely affected by the Covid-19 outbreak.Many international students at Imperial College London face having to do their online exams in the middle of the night after the university notified them that “being in a different time zone cannot be used as a mitigating circumstance” and they must be “available at the correct UK time, wherever they are”. Some, including Chinese students, cannot access study materials due to internet censorship.A physics student, who is quarantined in Shanghai, said he was unable to access Panopto lecture recordings for his revision because the site was blocked by China’s firewall. “Imperial College has made it more difficult than regular exams because now you have to deal with technology and censorship,” he said.Max, not his real name, said Chinese students were also under great stress because relatives had died of Covid-19. “My grandmother passed away because of coronavirus,” he said.The physics student said he might also face being quarantined for another fortnight when he returns to his family home in Wuhan, the centre of the Chinese outbreak, which would end around the time when his exams are due to start.In a statement, Imperial College said: “We are putting additional support in place for students and we are updating our mitigating circumstances policy to take account of where a student does not have access to the equipment or facilities to undertake the assessment.”Wilkinson said most of the study support provided to disabled students could either only be delivered on campus or would be impossible to provide remotely. This included providing note-taking, sign-language interpreters, close captioning of lectures, and screen-readers that render text and image content as speech or Braille.He added: “There is no way that disabled students can be on an equal level playing field as every other student during this pandemic. They should be allowed to suspend their studies until it’s reasonable and equitable for them to start again.”Cambridge University was approached for comment.A spokeswoman for Universities UK, which represents 137 higher education institutions, said universities were looking at various options to ensure students were fairly assessed. She added that “universities will try to be as accommodating as they can” to students’ varying needs for support."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4dbfc9f25e5038aa95b45a85b77ce6c6a4c337e8/164_952_4747_2848/master/4747.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9de617244c32384f2a5f3c319a585f34","title":"what are you wearing while working from home coronavirus","story":"The coronavirus outbreak has forced many people to work from home.

It’s elasticated, so it keeps you held in. The scarf is by Issey Miyake – we specifically chose the orange and pink because they are the colours of Rajasthan. I adore colour, and in India you are surrounded by the brightest colours, so the premiere was a marvellous excuse to go mad – I much prefer it to wearing black. I also wore a blue Hervé Léger dress to the New York premiere of the same film, and a bright green one on The Graham Norton Show. You do have to keep upright and breathe in, but they are comfortable.For the premiere of the first film, I got dressed up for the red carpet and then had to get on the back of a police motorbike to drive across London to the Old Vic theatre, where I put on an overall and slippers for my role in Noises Off.

In his down time, he is taking up a DIY challenge to make a patchwork quilt based on a dress he made during the filming of Next in Fashion, using other designers’ leftover scraps. The design – inspired by concerns over the melting polar ice caps – is an arctic landscape. “Ever since the show, I’ve been inundated with requests to make similar quilted items, so I thought this was a good opportunity to show people how they can do so themselves.“You can make it from any leftover fabrics you have. This time, I used some leftover damaged denim from my studio as the quilt base. I don’t imagine everyone has that lying around so use what you have.“Heavier is better for the base so it can hold the appliqué – maybe some old curtains or an existing blanket that needs some love. If you don’t have enough to do a blanket, you could use the same technique to make a cushion. For the appliqué, it could be old clothes, tablecloths, tea towels – anything you can get your hands on.“I went quite abstract with my pattern, but you could come up with a more elaborate design.“Mine took me five hours on a sewing machine. You could hand sew it instead. It’s going to be a much longer process but could be very therapeutic, which is something we could all do with right now.”Difficulty level: intermediateEquipment needed: an old blanket (or similar), scraps of fabrics, thread, sewing machine needle“For the nitty-gritty, head over to my Instagram – my wonderful sister captured the whole process.”Liam Hodges has recently moved house, so his time in self isolation has been spent unpacking and making rugs.“I learnt to crochet last October and have found it really relaxing. For our AW20 collection, we crocheted a lot of squares as embellishments. I’ve kept it up and even tried to make a skipping rope when I first went into isolation.“I had been wanting to make some rag rugs and started working out how to crochet graphics into them. I made the graphic in Photoshop so that each pixel represented each crochet stitch.“It took me around two and a half hours to complete and is made up of old, shredded T-shirts for the coloured section and yarn made using Wool and the Gang offcuts for the main black areas, so it is entirely made from waste.”Difficulty level: intermediateEquipment needed: an old T-shirt, a crochet hook, yarn and scissors“Use our how-to digital zine on Instagram, which has the pattern as well as instructions on how to crochet.”Designer Christopher Raeburn’s team are adapting to the current situation by releasing weekly creative tasks via their #RaeburnAtHome initiative.“This project is to make one of our shark mascots. We have always featured animals in our collections, initially as a way to highlight and support endangered species through our WWF UK partner. The Shark is one of our most popular animals we keep it in our collections each season, but it always evolves.“You need no more than one square metre of fabric – even less if you are conscious of pattern placement for waste reduction. Using a variety of smaller cuts of fabric is encouraged though as this adds pops of colour and texture to the final shark.“Not only is reusing and repurposing old fabric a more interesting way of working, but extending the lifetime of garments is instrumental in reducing planetary impact. When people are spending more time at home than ever before, now is the chance to pull out those bits that we no longer use and give them new life.“Unless you are an absolute master, it should keep you busy for about 10 hours. We only recommend a sewing machine for ease and speed – top marks for effort go to anyone tackles it by hand.”Difficulty level: advancedEquipment needed: a sewing machine, fabric, scissors, thread and paper.For the full instructions click here you can download the shark pattern here. It is designed to fit on A4 paper.Designer Edward Crutchley’s lockdown aim is to set himself a project each day. His first was to cut a pattern for and sew a one-piece kimono-inspired garment. Next up is making miniature sculptures of the kings and queens of England using modelling clay.“How to make Japanese clothes by John Marshall is a book I have on my shelf that I thought it would be great to lose myself in during isolation.“I love traditional Japanese clothing and now is the perfect time to study. What I love about kimonos is that they are traditionally dictated by the fabric – they are the width they are because that is how wide the looms could weave. For a fabric geek like me, that’s a dream.“A traditional kimono pattern looks like some different-length rectangles put together, but nothing is ever that simple and it takes a lot of skill to construct a traditional kimono properly. The one I made is much, much easier.“I used three metres of fabric left over from the last collection, but you could make it with two metres if it’s 150cm wide, or you can easily add seams to the patterns or patchwork fabrics together. Repurposing old curtains or a bed sheet would be perfect.“It took me around four hours to complete – there are only three seams and three hems. I tried to make it as simple as possible.”Difficulty level: advancedEquipment needed: a sewing machine, two to three metres of fabric, thread, scissors, paper and dressmaking pins.While social distancing, Rosie Wolfenden and Harriet Vine, the designers behind Tatty Devine jewellery, are doing daily making challenges.“It’s amazing for your mental health and the perfect antidote to these strange and unsettling times. This so-called shrinky necklace is something we did as kids. We first made one as Tatty Devine in 2001. It was very early days, when we made jewellery from whatever we could get our hands on. We enjoyed having to eat crisps.”Difficulty level: beginnerEquipment needed: old crisp packets (not foiled or metallic, such as Chipsticks or many supermarket own brands) a chain necklace (whether new or something you already own) greaseproof paper, a baking tray, a damp tea towel (for safety reasons), an old tea towel, a hole punch, a regular jump ring and two pairs of flat-nose pliers.You can stop with one pendant or layer up for a charm effect.Despite having no previous knitting experience, dancer Meshach Henry has made three scarves in as many days, documented on Instagram by his partner, the Radio 1 DJ Nick Grimshaw.“I always said I would learn a new skill like plumbing or plastering if I ever had a lot of time on my hands. But they aren’t ideal skills to practice in this current situation. So, having seen knitting supplies in a craftshop window recently, I thought, ‘Here’s my new hobby.’“I purchased a thick wool because it looked easier to use and less fiddly. I bought 10mm knitting needles, which I thought were an average size but later found out are strangely big – but I’m really happy with the chunky effect they produce.“What I like about knitting is that you can see your physical product. As a dancer, I rarely get to see my own work, so to be able to see and hold this tangible thing is a whole new world for me.“My intention is to move on to knitting jumpers. I want to create a matching jumper for every scarf, just to keep things interesting.”Difficulty level: beginnerEquipment needed: knitting needles and wool“I taught myself by watching an eight-minute Knitting for Total Beginners tutorial on YouTube. The tutorial taught me how to cast on in the first instance. Then there are follow-up links to a second video that teaches you how to change knitting style and how to cast off.”Lucinda Chambers is co-founder of fashion brand Colville and online shopping platform Collagerie and was fashion director at British Vogue for 25 years.“I was in Paris six months ago having a glass of water in the Bon Marché and I noticed the glass looked suspiciously like the end of a wine bottle.” When Chambers investigated she found a world of home crafters making their own tumblers from pre-used wine bottles.“I found an inexpensive kit on Amazon,” she says. “Each glass is a labour of love as I sand them by hand it’s strangely therapeutic.”Difficulty level: mediumEquipment needed: empty glass bottles, a glass cutter kit (available online, for instance from Amazon).“The kit has everything you need to make the glasses: a stand, saw and markers that you place on the empty bottle at the height you require your finished glass to be. You can make French-style low tumblers or something taller. Once you’ve cut the bottle you need to sand the cut edge smooth.”The internet is full of videos, such as this one, that show you more details."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9018f055b3426cb09f10dcebac9c4a5d4846eeb7/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=99f745dfc1667b1d2d7fbd1c559c63c1","title":"rihanna makes history did i ever imagine that i would see a durag on the cover of vogue","story":"The singer appears in fashion magazine wearing a sartorial symbol of black powerRihanna has made history, becoming the first woman to appear on the cover of British Vogue wearing a durag.The garment, which is used to help the development of braids, waves and dreadlocks, has had a storied history in the black community. From being worn by slaves through to members of the Black power movement, it is a potent sartorial symbol of African-Caribbean survival and celebration.After a period of criminalisation (it was banned by some high schools in the US), it has been reclaimed. As Observer beauty columnist Funmi Fetto wrote in Vogue: “The tainted fabric has been reclaimed as a symbol of black beauty, a signifier of style worn on the streets, the catwalk, the red carpet ... And now, in a powerful mic-drop moment, the durag is making its first appearance on the May 2020 cover of British Vogue.”“Did I ever imagine that I would see a durag on the cover of Vogue?” asked the British Vogue editor Edward Enninful on his Instagram page.In the lengthy post, Enninful revealed that it was the singer’s idea to wear the headwear, which was designed by the famed milliner Stephen Jones. “For this month’s shoot, she wanted Rihanna for a new decade,” he said. “We worked through a substantial archive of visual references (her fashion and cultural knowledge is encyclopaedic) to find a new proposition,” he explained. “Then suddenly, at 2am, my phone pinged with the latest WhatsApp: ‘How about we go with a durag?’”It’s not the first time the singer has worn the garment. At the 2014 Council of Fashion Designers of America awards she paired a sheer, Swarovski encrusted Adam Selman dress with a crystal durag. Two years later, she she opened the 2016 MTV VMA’s wearing a black and white design by Moses Gauntlett Cheng.More recently, versions of the headdress were worn by singers Solange and Janelle Monae at the 2018 Met Gala, while in January, the Californian rapper Guapdad 4000 wore a 10ft-long durag on the Grammys red carpet, designed by Faded NYC."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c6ea722d87ce34535a0e93b7b0099174636f4e7/0_120_2168_1300/master/2168.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5e6c5f5d38ede31156a1d487e277098f","title":"john landis on lockdown films worth watching","story":"Continuing our series of expert recommendations for self-isolation, Blues Brothers director John Landis on Panic in the Streets, The Producers and the delights of early 1930s horrorMy ideas on movies to watch while you are stuck at home are really no different from a list of movies I think anyone should see at any time, not just during a global crisis.Wonderful movies to see (whether you’ve seen them before or not) are:Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen’s masterpiece Singin’ in the Rain (1952), co-starring the fabulous Debbie Reynolds and Donald O’Connor. This film is so damn good, it is guaranteed to cheer you up. Howard Hawks’s His Girl Friday (1940) starring a never-better Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell, this remains one of the best comedies ever made. WC Fields seems to be overlooked these days, but I would watch three of his pictures: The Bank Dick (Edward F Kline, 1940), Never Give a Sucker An Even Break (Edward Kline, 1941), and the sublime It’s a Gift (Norman Z McLeod, 1934). Truly funny. Mel Brooks’s The Producers (1967) starring Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder remains the gold standard of laugh-out-loud movies. Please note, NOT THE MUSICAL!The director Budd Boetticher made seven westerns starring Randolph Scott, all surprisingly adult and with complex and often sympathetic bad guys. Seven Men from Now features a sly performance from villain Lee Marvin, in a stripped-down story of good and evil. The Tall T (1957), based on an Elmore Leonard story, finds Scott and Maureen O’Sullivan hostages of the charming and ruthless Richard Boone. All seven of the BoetticherScott films are consistently entertaining and almost all of them shot in beautiful Lone Pine, California.Two pre-Hays Code Paramount Studio horror films are shockingly upfront about violence, sadism and sex. Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde (Rouben Mamoulian, 1931) stars Fredric March as the handsome Dr Jekyll, who grows more and more bestial and violent every time he becomes Mr Hyde. With Miriam Hopkins as his terrified lover, showgirl Ivy Pierson. Dr Jekyll’s first transformation into Mr Hyde after drinking his experimental formula is accomplished with a simple trick in-camera that is still astonishing. Island of Lost Souls (Erle C Kenton, 1932) stars Charles Laughton as mad Dr Moreau, who uses surgery without anaesthetic on animals, creating beast men. The beast men refer to the operating room as “the house of pain”. Laughton is magnificent, the movie as dark and creepy as it gets. HG Wells loathed the film, when he saw what had been done with his anti-vivisectionist novella The Island of Dr Moreau. The book is equally sadistic, but this movie (and every other movie version since) adds a semi-human woman carved from a panther, for whom Dr Moreau has a decidedly unhealthy and unpleasant fate planned. Island of Lost Souls was banned in the UK when first released and has only recently become available via home video and Blu-ray. Well worth the watch.I could easily add several hundred more titles, but let’s wait and see just how long this thing lasts before I continue.

No, just me then.Your best friend right now, as in many a savoury culinary challenge, is the spice rack, no matter how dusty (a copy of Jack Monroe’s wonderful Tin Can Cook wouldn’t go amiss, either). It doesn’t matter which herb or spice you use, either, says chef and food writer Claire Thomson: “They’ll all add an extra dimension to humble tinned veg, from cumin or turmeric to oregano or bay. And if you have an onion andor garlic, even better.” Sweat any alliums until they’re soft, add the ground or whole spices – if they’re on the old side, revive them first by toasting in a dry pan until aromatic – then stir in the veg, heat and, voila, a more than serviceable dish that’s ready in minutes. (If you have any, lob in a few chopped fresh herbs at the end for final flourish.)Ready-made spice pastes are another invaluable source of oomph, Thomson says: “Things like Thai chilli paste, harissa, miso and chipotle in adobo bring much-needed intensity.” The same goes for tomato puree: “It’s like a steamroller of flavour. Even just a blob rewards you with a big hit of richness.” For a welcome sharp note, try a spritz of lemon or lime juice. “Ideally fresh,” Thomson says, “but there’s nothing wrong with the stuff in bottles, if that’s all you have – I’ve always got some in for emergencies.” She also swears by preserved lemons and oranges, which she also uses, diced small and mixed with oil, in pungent dressings for all sorts of cooked veg.It’s a cinch to make your own simple paste, too, says Romy Gill, chef, food writer and one of the stars of BBC2’s newly revived Ready Steady Cook. “Even one made with just blitzed fried onion, garlic and any spice works magic on tinned veg, whether pulse, potato or bean.”Gill adores vegetable tikkis, India’s answer to croquettes - “You can make them with tinned as well as with fresh: potatoes or chickpeas are especially good” - and is also an advocate of tinned spuds in salads: “They’re already cooked, so drain and dress as you normally would, or dice them and stir into yoghurt with herbs and spices.”Marwa Alkhalaf, who until the restaurant trade abruptly shut down last week was chef and co-owner of Nutshell in London, says the key is variety. “Mix and match tinned pulses,” she says. “Combinations of lentils and beans have a range of textures and stop dishes from being one-note.” Add noodles or pasta for the same reason: “We had aash reshteh, a Persian lentil, chickpea and kidney bean soup with noodles, on the menu, but any pulses will work. You can’t go wrong.”• Do you have a culinary dilemma?

Once it starts to thicken, the porridge will pop and splutter, so take care as you stir.Add gorgonzola or fontina to the polenta if you wish, or grated parmesan or pecorino. I sometimes add both. Occasionally, I stir in a little finely chopped crisp bacon together with the fat in which it has cooked.

It was not a fun day.The club got in contact with the Swedish FA, which agreed with the club that the best of action was to cancel the game.Another club in Eskilstuna, AC Primavera, who play in the sixth tier, told Eskilstuna-Kuriren that they had received hate messages on their social media channels after losing a friendly recently. “It was after our game against BK Sport that it started to come in messages on our Facebook page,” the club’s chairman, Daniel Karlsson, told the paper. “People from abroad were abusive towards the club and, among other things, we were accused to have ‘fixed’ our own game and someone said they hoped we would die from coronavirus.”Sweden has taken a different approach to the coronavirus outbreak than most other European countries. The country is not in lockdown and its borders remain open. Schools and gyms are also open with the prime minister, Stefan Löfven, asking the nation “to behave as adults”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d3a41e475a264fee2062fd53353eacdf62ac456b/41_2757_939_563/master/939.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5bbb15adb011c64cf4a8fb0fc1173b0a","title":"david squires on the english premier league game julian fellowes netflix","story":"Our cartoonist envisages Julian Fellowes being commissioned to reboot the end of the season"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c591f4151099f7dba1f9a01015188f6d4547337a/0_329_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a37664b8f1668453e144895336e87e5b","title":"sierra leone lifts ban on pregnant girls going to school but shutdown expected","story":"Decision hailed as ‘victory’ comes amid warnings that coronavirus could close schools and leave teenagers vulnerable in quarantineSierra Leone has lifted an internationally criticised ban that prohibited pregnant schoolgirls from attending school and sitting exams, in a move heralded by activists as a “victory for feminism” in the west African nation.The decision, announced on Monday, follows a judgment last December by a top regional court that ordered the immediate overturn of the ban, which effectively barred tens of thousands of girls the right to finish their education. The Economic Community of West African States court instructed Sierra Leone to establish nationwide programmes to help pregnant girls return to school.“Overturning the ban is the first step in building a radically inclusive Sierra Leone where all children – regardless of class, ethnicity, tribe, disability, location, gender, reproductive or parenting status – are able to live and learn in safety and dignity,” the education ministry said in a statement.Despite the good news, Sierra Leone is expected to close schools this week in a bid to prevent the transmission of coronavirus, which has now spread to 46 countries across Africa and threatens to create huge challenges for under-resourced health services. Sierra Leone is one of only eight virus-free countries in the continent.Last week, President Julius Maada Bio imposed a year-long state of emergency to deal with the virus.Chernor Bah, who co-founded the feminist movement-building hub Purposeful, said that although schools are closing, the fact that “the ban is now history” is what matters.“This is a great victory for the many girls who were unfairly targeted and discriminated against by this senseless ban. It’s a great victory for Sierra Leone and our ambition to achieve education for all. Above all else, this is an extraordinary victory for our feminist movement in Sierra Leone,” he said.Campaigners point to the hard lessons learned during the Ebola outbreak, which killed more than 11,000 people across west Africa. Thousands of girls were left vulnerable and forced to fend for themselves after schools were closed for months on end, which saw more than 18,000 girls fall pregnant in Sierra Leone alone, according to the UN population fund.Judy Gitau, Africa regional coordinator at Equality Now, one of the organisations that took Sierra Leone to court over the ban, said governments across Africa must put in place measures to protect adolescent girls when they are in quarantine.“Sexual predators prey on girls who would ordinarily be safe in schools and, as is the case with conflict or emergency periods, access to medical or legal services are much more difficult to access.“We must therefore anticipate these occurrences and prevent them.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a20c9644def0a022535742cd9b1afc8a8f09a760/0_6_1654_992/master/1654.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8f6ab8e470462c5c70228cd7a4c03ad3","title":"how mr motivator davina mccall lizzie webb and other fitness gurus stay healthy at home","story":"How do you stay active when the gyms are shut? Davina McCall, Lizzie Webb and others explain the secrets to staying motivatedThese are trying times. Children run between rooms as parents on video calls shush them in vain millennials in cramped house-shares attempt to carve out space to work from home. Gyms and leisure centres have closed, and elderly and vulnerable people may feel worried about venturing outside to exercise. So how can we stay active as we hunker down and ride out the coronavirus pandemic?During the coronavirus crisis, we have all got to stay motivated to work out. One way to do this is to focus on your blessings. Every day when you wake up, think of five reasons to be grateful.Then put your trainers on. Not your slippers. Walk around your house and put music on. Headbanging music, funky music – whatever gets you going. Now you’ve got your trainers on and your music pumping, you can have some fun. If you’re a young buck, start running on the spot. If you’re older, hold on to a chair or a work surface and bring your knees up and down in front of you. Now pretend you’re sitting on the loo. Then it’s time for squats! Lower yourself down, control your stomach, tighten your thigh muscles and squeeze it all in.For older people who aren’t as active, sit straight-backed in a chair and imagine there’s an orange between your shoulder blades. Now squeeze the juice so it runs down your back.If you have kids, hide things around the house for them to find. That will wear them out. Or ask them to lie on the floor and spell out the letters of the week in the air with their legs. If they knock over some of the furniture, it’s no bother. It’s all part of the fun. As long as they stay safe.When your kids are at home, it’s important they stay active. My son and I go for long walks with the dog – honestly, our dog has never been walked so much in her life! She’s beside herself. When things started getting really serious with coronavirus, I made a free fitness programme, Own Your Own Goals, for people to use. I wanted to do something to help. While we’re all still allowed out by the government, I’d recommend a power walk – on your own and far away from other people. Sunlight and fresh air are good for our mental health.Lots of people worry that they will annoy their neighbours if they exercise inside, but you can do most toning stuff inside without making any noise. Biceps curls and shoulder presses are good for toning. If you don’t have weights, improvise with a good old can of baked beans.There are so many things you can do in a plank. Mountain climbers (where you drive your knees into your chest in a plank position) or spider-mans (where you raise your right knee to your right elbow in a plank, then switch sides) are fantastic.During this pandemic, I’m going to be making sure that I have a daily routine. Without it, you lose purpose. Wake up at a reasonable hour, enjoy being able to spend more time with your family – and try to fit in 20 minutes of exercise every day. It will make you feel happier.One positive thing to come out of the coronavirus crisis is that people often have more time to focus on themselves and their bodies. But be sensible: if you aren’t a regular exerciser, don’t suddenly go mad on a programme. Ease in gently. There’s no rush. Every day, increase the number of repetitions or exercise for a little longer.I’d recommend exercising with the children – they’re going to be home with you, so why not? I’m a big fan of getting them to learn their times tables – but not sitting down at a desk. Instead, sit or stand the children opposite each other and have them throw a ball to one another while doing their times tables. The person who gets the highest is the winner.The best bit of kit in your house is always a chair. Hold on to the back of it at waist height, and use it as you would a ballet barre. Put your feet at hip-width apart and do squats. If you’re strong enough, hold the “barre” with one hand while squatting.If you’re not very mobile, there are lots of things you can do in a chair. Make sure you’re sitting with a straight back. Hug each knee to your chest, then put it down. You can even grab some bags of sugar or bottles of water to use as light weights: sit on the edge of the chair and do biceps curls.On TV-am, I would always make a point of saying: “Clear your space.” You don’t want to hurt yourself. I remember one viewer writing in to tell me that she was doing my exercises in a caravan. And, obviously, wear comfortable clothes. You want to have freedom of movement.Coronavirus has had an impact on my motivation to train – even I am having to use my own videos to motivate myself. I have been running live workouts on my YouTube channel, and yesterday I had 120 followers waiting to work out with me. I sat on the mat and told them the truth: I feel heavy, but I know that I’m going to feel better after we exercise together. And I did.Working out virtually with other people in real time is the best way forward, especially if you usually go to classes and find it hard to motivate yourself on your own. Make it social: arrange a virtual date with friends to train together and afterwards talk on FaceTime about how much you loved – or hated – it.If you can get your hands on some weights or kettlebells, I recommend weight-training at home. The resistance is beneficial for bone density and helps to reduce the effects of muscle loss, which is important as many of us are likely to be sedentary for long periods of time under lockdown.At the end of the day, we’re going through a global pandemic. No one gives a toss about abs. Aesthetics are out of the window. What you should think is: OK, movement is going to support my brain function, it’s going to help me feel better and release endorphins.Normally, you would exercise for long-term health. This is different. Now we are training to not get ill. The stronger and fitter you are, the more likely you will be to fight coronavirus off, and your recovery time will be shorter. You are less likely to end up in an intensive care unit bed, and if you do end up in one, more likely to get out of it sooner – freeing it up for someone else. So try to do something.There’s another good reason to exercise, which is that humans are inherently social animals. We depend on other people for our happiness, our wellbeing, advice and reassurance. Right now, we’re cut off from other people. So exercise is crucial to maintaining mental health. If you can, leave the house regularly and go for walks, but stay away from other people. Download a step counter on to your phone and aim for 10,000 steps a day. Or do a basic circuit at home. My only word of caution would be that your home is not a gym. Be careful. You don’t want to get injured and put the NHS under more strain.There’s a thing in geriatric medicine called pyjama paralysis. It’s when you admit older people to hospital, and they stay in bed all day in their pyjamas. It’s really bad for them: they lose muscle mass fast. So getting dressed in the morning is a good start.Walk up and down your stairs five times. If you have a garden, buy a skipping rope online and go outside and skip. Find a fitness YouTuber you like the look of, and copy their videos. It’s so easy to get caught up in the technical aspects of exercise: how much should I be doing and what should my heart rate be? Do I need the advice of a doctor? But it’s not complicated – just aim to get out of breath for a few minutes every day. That’s it.If you can, do a simple circuit of press-ups, sit-ups and squats. I stand by the view that something is much better than nothing: one press-up is better than none, and five are better than one. If you don’t know where to start, look up the Royal Canadian Air Force exercises. They were devised in the 1950s, and are just as relevant today. It’s a great set of movements."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d2943f011fbffa02dc27dc8ef7472b5195f6fc53/0_120_1600_960/master/1600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=66409515b1941e4a93ec7a6a93270a3c","title":"the day was full of joy and love how people are getting married while in lockdown","story":"Couples preparing to tie the knot have seen their plans wrecked by the global coronavirus outbreak. But from Zoom conferences to micro-ceremonies, love is finding a wayThe bride wore white and carried a bouquet of plastic flowers, from Amazon. The aisle was from Amazon, too, and so were the fairy lights strung around the chuppah. The wedding party was small: only immediate family and the rabbi. Although rain had been forecast, the weather held, and when 23-year-old student Eliana Amrani, from Chicago, married her boyfriend, 22-year-old Elliot Birn, in her parents’ garden, the sun was shining. As is customary during Jewish weddings, the bride and groom prepared to smash a glass underfoot.Unable to attend the wedding in person due to the coronavirus shutdown, the couple’s extended family and friends had driven to neighbouring streets, and dialled into the wedding on Zoom or caught it via a YouTube live stream. Cocooned in their cars a safe distance away, they watched on smartphone screens as the couple clasped hands and stamped on the glass. As it shattered, the sound of car horns filled the air. On a laptop, elderly relatives watching the ceremony smiled and waved.Amrani had initially planned to marry at the Chicago Hilton on 29 March. But on 12 March, the governor of Illinois, JB Pritzker, advised that all large events should be postponed until May. The prospect of having to wait was agonising. “We’re Orthodox Jews,” Amrani explains. “We haven’t lived together! We couldn’t wait. We were dying to get married.” After a night full of tears, the family decided: they would have a backyard wedding on Zoom. The rabbi was willing to do it, as long as it was outdoors.It was more perfect than Amrani could have hoped. “Before the wedding, I was so upset,” she says. “I couldn’t believe this was my life. Now I don’t regret it. It was so much better than I could have imagined.”If you have spent years planning your perfect wedding, the disruption caused by coronavirus can be a bitter pill to swallow. “I’m coming to terms with it now,” says Debbie Odukoya, 29, a clinical psychologist from London. She was supposed to marry her fiance, Oluchi, 33, over two days in Lagos, Nigeria, in April. Eight hundred guests were scheduled to attend the Nigerian ceremony, followed by a western wedding for 400 guests the following day. Organising not one, but two weddings was a considerable effort. “We spent a whole year literally planning,” Odukoya sighs.From the beginning of March, guests started pulling out – the airlines had cancelled their flights. But Odukoya still hoped the wedding could go ahead. Then on 18 March, the Nigerian government announced that anyone landing in the country would be subject to supervised isolation for 14 days. The wedding was in less than two weeks. It was over. “I had to go to work that day,” Odukoya says. “It was really hard trying to pull myself together, because I didn’t want to break down.”Odukoya is thankful that all her vendors and the venue have been willing to rearrange the wedding at no extra cost she hasn’t lost any money, apart from flights. And her friends have promised to re-book transport, when the time comes. “Everyone has been so nice about it,” she says.Gemma Finn, a 28-year-old communications worker from Uxbridge, London, narrowly avoided ending up out of pocket. She was due to marry her girlfriend, Ali, 28, on 15 May. On 11 March, they went to pay a deposit at the pub where they had been planning to hold their reception. Finn was ready to hand over the money – but Ali urged caution. “She said: ‘Maybe we should think about this,’” Finn says. It was the right decision. “I’m glad she’s the sensible one,” Finn jokes. “She saved us over £1,000.”“We were completely devastated,” James says. “Our wedding was cancelled. And then to face a huge bill ... To be told we are out of pocket for them cancelling our wedding is bizarre.” After a backlash from James and other couples in a similar predicament, the venue agreed to allow them to rebook. But the experience has been so stressful that James doesn’t want to get married there any more. “It’s left such a bad taste in our mouths,” he says.Elliot Metson, 30, an admin assistant from Bishop’s Stortford, Hertfordshire, was one of the last people to get married in the UK before the lockdown, the day before Boris Johnson announced the measures on 23 March. But getting married with the coronavirus pandemic hanging over you casts a pall over proceedings. In the days leading up to the wedding, people kept dropping out. Metson didn’t blame them. “We understood their concerns,” he says.Metson and his partner, Hannah, 31, approached the venue, a hotel. “We said: ‘How many more people who are important to us need to cancel before we say: ‘We need to reschedule this?’’” In the end Metson and Hannah got married that Sunday, as planned. As Hannah was getting ready on the morning of her wedding, more guests were texting her saying they couldn’t attend, due to health concerns. “It put a bit of a downer on things,” says Metson.In the end, just 40 people attended the wedding, about half of the confirmed guest list of 87. It definitely wasn’t ideal – due to the social-distancing guidelines, the Metsons spaced out their wedding guests so much that some tables were half empty – but they are sanguine. “I would have preferred to rearrange it, personally, and my wife would have as well,” he says. “But we don’t have any regrets. It was a nice day for everyone who did turn up and we’re happy to be married now.”For some, the lockdown has made them reassess what’s important. Isobel Burston, 25, a teacher from Weymouth, Dorset, was due to marry her fiance, Ian, 26, in April. On 16 March, the government banned gatherings of more than 10 people. Burston and Ian sat down to discuss the wedding, to which they had invited 120 guests. “We both had a little cry,” she says. “But we knew we couldn’t ask people to put their health at risk.” The venue agreed to postpone the wedding, at no cost. A few days later, reports began to emerge that a national lockdown could be imminent.“I turned to Ian and said: ‘I would like to marry you,’” Burston recalls. “‘How about this weekend?’ He looked at me like I was mad. And then we had this moment of realisation, like: if we want to marry, we have to do it now.” The following day, Ian called the registrar, who agreed to perform a ceremony at short notice. Their original venue gave them the use of a small room. Burston ordered an Asos dress for next-day delivery, and Ian raided their local supermarket for flowers.On 21 March, with only immediate family present and grandparents dialled in via FaceTime, the registrar married them. Afterwards, they ate a spread of quiche and sausage rolls that Burston’s mum had picked up from M\u0026ampS, and took some photos on the beach.“It sounds so cheesy, but as soon as I walked in and saw Ian there and our family, I thought: ‘What did I spend all this time worrying about?’” Burston says. “It felt super-irrelevant. What was present that day was joy and love. It didn’t feel like we’d missed out on anything. In a way, maybe it was more special.”For now, all plans of a honeymoon are on hold. “It’s an interesting way to start married life,” Burston jokes. “Spending 247 together in a tiny flat.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/73c880bd6b14ca6834e06b4d8ae203761269b13d/0_117_4276_2566/master/4276.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=349fc9fa4aa74e8120c7a9ec72a0da46","title":"the one change that worked share your coronavirus stories","story":"We want to hear about the biggest lifestyle change you have made as a result of the Covid-19 epidemicWe are living in extraordinary times and coronavirus has meant that for many life as we know it has changed exponentially in a matter of weeks.

She grins when I voice my surprise at her ride. “I should have told you it was a ragtop with crazy tyres,” she says. It’s early March, and we head to a nearby coffee shop then she steers us into the city. As soon as I take out a notebook, the bumpy ride upends my pen. “Sorry,” she says. “I love driving it so much, but it’s a little wild.”With a licence plate repping the college football powerhouse Alabama Crimson Tide, the vehicle blends into Crutchfield’s home town. Her relationship to the place is more complex. One of the US’s sharpest and most acclaimed songwriters, she’s about to give me a tour of Birmingham as she viewed it as a teenager: through the lens of the underground punk scene. Now 31, Crutchfield about to release Saint Cloud, her fifth album as Waxahatchee, which finds her reexamining her southern roots with increased self-awareness. It’s one of the year’s most bewitching albums, the bristly indie rock for which she’s best known enhanced by country and folk, and the clarifying effect of new sobriety. “If you’re getting sober, you’re facing all of this stuff that has been shoved deep down and covered in booze for years,” she says. “And I’m like, oh my god, my brain is a scary place right now.”Crutchfield is the product of a fairly conventional white, southern, middle-class upbringing. When we pass the Alabama theatre, she notes that the historic movie palace once hosted a production of the Nutcracker in which she, her twin Allison and their younger sister tap-danced. The classic rock and country in the Crutchfield household fitted the atmosphere of an industrial city in the American deep south that had absorbed generations of formerly rural people and spilled into tree-lined suburbs. Crutchfield has fond recollections of the family going to see Shania Twain dazzle an arena.Turning next to 16th Street Baptist Church, she brings up an elementary school field trip to this site of an infamous white supremacist bombing during the civil rights struggle. She points out the memorial to the four slain African American girls. The public school curriculum made this seem as if it was an ugly but distant past. “We were taught, ‘Things used to be bad, and now it’s good,’” she says. But she eventually recognised that she was “from a place with a complicated history” and that that legacy was still very much present, defining how outsiders saw Birmingham.As teenagers, Katie and Allison shared the urge to rebel. They quit tap-dancing, swore off country music and used file-sharing to enable their developing tastes for grunge, the British invasion, indie, punk and riot grrrl. They made music in the basement, Katie as singer-guitarist and Allison on drums. Katie wryly admits she was “struggling with my country music past. I was like, ‘That’s my parents’ music. I don’t care. I like Bikini Kill.’”In a scene teeming with boys who preferred hardcore, she stood out singing Velvet Underground covers at all-ages club Cave 9, in the twins’ first band, the Ackleys. “How did I end up like that?” she marvels as she drives. “It wasn’t really set up for me to do that. A lot of this stuff is even more meaningful to me now, because there were a lot of things that feel a little happenstance.”Cave 9’s long-shuttered original location is on today’s sightseeing list. Crutchfield parks next to a decaying brick building. The glass front doors are papered over, but a small tear lets us see the balcony that faced the old stage. We go on past the railroad tracks where she drank with friends and darted out of the way of approaching trains the house dubbed the Dandy Dill where she and her roommates hosted shows, one of them wild enough to collapse the floor. “I did a lot of urban exploration in my youth, trying to break into weird, creepy warehouses,” she says.Eventually, she and Allison left Birmingham in search of a new scene, trying New York before settling in a house full of musicians, including other members of Allison’s band Swearin’, in Philadelphia. Katie’s solo project took shape when she went to write at the family’s rustic retreat in Alabama. She borrowed the name of nearby Waxahatchee Creek and collected her songs on 2012’s American Weekend, an album spiky and revealing in spirit but lo-fi in execution. It landed her at the vanguard of an acclaimed new wave of singer-songwriters bringing hushed intensity and emotional specificity to indie rock: Julien Baker, Mitski, Torres, Soccer Mommy and more.On subsequent Waxahatchee releases, she added sinew to her sound, always with musical contributions from Allison. She continued writing with a nerviness that felt uncomfortably unfiltered. (“And I will visualise a tragedy  And blame you for it.”) She noticed how it was sometimes interpreted like a literal transcription of a diary as opposed to consciously chiseled expression. “For so long, my music was always described as confessional,” she says. “That felt really gendered to me. I always felt that implies that there is no thought or art. Everything I ever write is thought through and laboured over.”Her work found its loudest form to date on her 2017 album Out in the Storm, her singing half-submerged in a brutal guitar attack, a musical approach that felt right to her in the aftermath of a breakup. “I was just so on edge, and you can hear that on the record,” she says over a Caribbean-style lunch. “It’s claustrophobic, there’s so much happening.”Ultimately, she decided that neither the punishing physicality of performing that music night after night (which contributed to her hearing loss), nor the boozy night-owl lifestyle she’d grown accustomed to were sustainable. “I’m a really productive person,” she says. “I’m at my best when I’m waking up early and getting a bunch of shit done and I’m dependable. I was watching alcohol make me not that. I would stay out really late, I would sleep in, I would feel like shit. I would be argumentative with everybody, I would procrastinate, I would forget to do things. It sounds so cheesy to say, but I was really not the best version of myself.” She clarified that it was “never anything crazy. I wasn’t like getting into car wrecks or anything like that.”After contemplating quitting alcohol for a few years, Crutchfield pulled the plug for good on tour in Barcelona: “I had a few crazy nights and decided: I don’t think I’m gonna do this any more.” As she entered a new phase of her life, she found value in looking back. That included a brief return to Birmingham, cut short by her decision to join her boyfriend, musician Kevin Morby, in Kansas City, and to immerse herself in the music she’d so emphatically rejected in her teens – not so much mainstream country, but the artful Americana of Lucinda Williams, Gillian Welch and post-80s Emmylou Harris.Covering Williams’s songs, Crutchfield noticed “my voice sounds really good when I go in that direction”. She readily came up with new, lilting melodies of her own, but struggled with other aspects of sober songwriting. “I feel like I keep chipping away at this authentic thing that’s down there somewhere,” she says. “Slowly but surely, I’m getting closer to it, and as I do that, lyrics become hard for me – the rhyme scheme becomes more important, the amount of syllables I use.”The songs on Saint Cloud describe knotty interior states and examine intense interactions from a reflective remove.

From the plethora of TV shows on competing streaming platforms to the seemingly infinite choice offered by online music and gaming services, the wealth of new material being released each month is staggering. Yet when it comes to cultural consumption, audiences are increasingly choosing to seek out classic, safe bets – forgoing the next big thing in favour of the last big thing.According to UK media watchdog Ofcom, the single most-watched programme in the first quarter of 2019 was the 1990s sitcom Friends. In the US, the top Netflix spot has long been held by the US version of the Office, which first aired 15 years ago. Meanwhile at the box office, sequels and reboots abound. Last year’s top five grossing films in the UK included the remake of the Lion King, Toy Story 4, Frozen 2 and Star Wars: Episode IX – the Rise of Skywalker.Even computer gaming is stepping increasingly back into the past. Two of the biggest launches in recent years have actually been mini versions of the comparatively ancient 80s and 90s games consoles, Sega’s Mega Drive and Nintendo’s SNESNES. “Without a doubt, people are going back to the classics,” says Iain Simons, director of the National Videogame Museum in Sheffield. “They pioneered so many of the things we have today.”One obvious reason why audiences are opting for classic, safe bets is the sense of comfort they can provide in a world that feels increasingly precarious. This feeling of comfort isn’t simply a function of nostalgic familiarity, however. Today’s new TV shows often reflect our current dystopian mood and the fashion for grisly narrative plot twists and traumatic backstories. Think Black Mirror compared with Frasier.There are other reasons for playing it safe when it comes to pop culture. Partly, it can be about taking joy in simplicity amid the complexity of the world we live in. Our frantic pace of life makes spare time so rare that people are wary of not enjoying the little they have of it. “I can see the appeal in a safe bet, especially if you are going to spend a lot of money on tickets,” says Anna Smith, film critic, broadcaster and host of the all-female film review podcast Girls on Film.Likewise, Simons notes that there’s a beauty in the relative simplicity of older video games: “There’s something comforting about only having three lives in a game there are only so many hours in the day.”Nostalgic cultural consumption can also remove the all-too common problem of too much choice. “The overabundance of content can make people feel overwhelmed,” says Cristel Russell, a professor of marketing at Graziadio Business School, who has conducted several studies into people’s re-reading of stories and reconsumption of media. “It’s like going to a restaurant and the menu being 20 pages long. You’re probably just going to order something you’ve had before.”One of Russell’s studies found that revisiting cultural favourites is such a deliberate act – as opposed to a habit – that she coined the term “volitional reconsumption” to describe it. She also found that nostalgic culture can offer something that new works can’t: a form of self-discovery. “The thing you’re watching hasn’t changed, but you have,” explains Russell. “You’ve accumulated all this knowledge and experience, so you’re not looking at it through the same eyes. When you revisit it, you get to see how much you have changed as a person.”Revisiting pieces of classic cultural entertainment can also give us bonding social experiences. For instance, events such as Secret Cinema, which screens old favourites in specially-created immersive worlds, thrive on the feeling of community and belonging you get when you bring fans of a movie together to celebrate it. “I think one of the keys here is the community aspect: we love to watch a cherished film with others, and laugh and cry together,” says Smith. “In a society that feels increasingly less community driven, in many ways this is an outlet for a positive shared experience.”There are other possible psychological benefits to reconsuming cultural works. Erica Hepper, a lecturer in personality and social psychology at the University of Surrey, has researched the social emotion of nostalgia, including the reconsumption of works of art. One study involved letting participants choose an old, beloved song to listen to and then comparing their emotions with those of people who hadn’t done so. “Time and again, we found that people who listened to something that was nostalgic experienced all of these psychological boosts – they feel more connected to people, they feel better about themselves, they feel more optimistic,” says Hepper. “They also feel more motivated to achieve their goals. So nostalgia isn’t about being stuck in the past, it actually looks to the future.”Indeed, one of Russell’s studies showed that reconsuming cultural works can even involve more intense cognitive processes than watching something for the first time. To test this, subjects were made to wear eye-tracking equipment while watching a black-and-white Russian film twice. The equipment monitored both the movement of their eyes and pupil dilation, which can indicate the intensity of the cognitive effort they were undergoing. “Sure enough, on the second viewing, your eye gaze goes to different parts of the screen – you are taking it in in a different way,” says Russell.She found that people were watching in a way that suggested they appreciated the film much more as a work of art on the second viewing. For instance, they were looking at all the creative details rather than just following the plot. Moreover, she found that people’s pupils were more dilated while doing so. “When you rewatch something, the cognitive effort involved changes. You are hyper-responsive – all of your senses are on. It is a much more intense process than watching something for the first time.”That intensity might seem counterintuitive, given how comforting nostalgic pop culture can feel. But as the trend itself illustrates, opting for comforting pop culture isn’t a passive act. Given the emotional and psychological upsides of the tried and tested, it’s no wonder we enjoy watching things again. And again. And again.Safety mattersYour world matters to us.

Alexi Duggins explains why playing it safe is a smarter step Has there ever been a more underrated word in the English language than “safe”? For something that is fundamentally a good thing, people can be weirdly dismissive about it. Eyes are rolled at workplace health and safety as though it’s somehow uncool to not lose a hand to poorly maintained machinery. Romcoms lazily wield it as an unflattering cliche: “Oh, I don’t know. My award-winning humanitarian of a partner is perfect in every conceivable way – but they’re just so … safe, you know?”Meanwhile, there’s no bigger cliche than being edgy just for the sake of trend-chasing. Over the past two decades, the fad for extreme sports has reached (and plummeted from) ever-crazier heights. Our fetishisation of high-risk, high-wire living has even spread to dining, with foodies flocking to increasingly ridiculous eateries simply because they look cool on social media. How many times have our friends told us they tried out a Hot New Place that wasn’t actually very good – while we pity their gullibility and coo soothing words such as: “Oh what a shame that insect-based menu wasn’t actually that delicious.”Spurred on by the peer pressure of social media and clickbait articles about patently daft new trends, people all too often act as if they’re playing a gigantic game of chicken. When they aren’t posting smiling holiday selfies from the post-nuclear wreckage of Chernobyl, they’re braving the latest Insta grooming trends that you just have to try – even if they leave you looking like you’ve had your eyebrows rubber stamped on to your face.The 21st century seems so unhinged, it feels as though it’s drastically in need of a friend to confiscate its phone and force-feed it a sensible mug of Horlicks. So as we enter a new decade, it’s time to wake up to the obvious truth that sometimes playing it safe might be the smarter option. Sure, it won’t necessarily make for great social media content or keep trend forecasters in business, but the tried and tested route at least offers proven enjoyment.But there are things out there that are just unfailingly brilliant – melted cheese, beaten-track holidays, every Bill Murray film ever made. These are just some of the reasons that “safe” should be something we embrace. Another is the obvious fact that safety keeps you, well, safe. Just consider all the revolutionary advances in car safety technology.The safe option is one that doesn’t lead to you royally screwing up. It’s a guaranteed good time. It’s not being afraid to use your critical faculties, shun desperate fads and to do something that you genuinely know to be great. It’s suiting yourself, no matter the pressure to do the same stuff that everyone else is talking about.It isn’t always easy. But increasingly, playing it safe is the boldest thing you can do.We’re under so much pressure to be edgy these days that we often overlook safer, more rewarding options. Here are some user-friendly safety tips to help you navigate modern lifeBinge-watching TVWe might be living through an extended golden age of television, but the explosion in edgy programming has also given us an awful lot of duds. So it can be all too easy to make a habit out of wasting 12 hours of your life. Protect yourself from another bad long-term relationship with a TV show by learning when to quit. Studios like to make a big splash on their opening, so if the first episode sucks, it isn’t going to get better from there on in. But what happens when you’re, say, four episodes in? One way to develop the discipline to quickly give up is to think of your time as an economic investment. Just because you’ve invested four hours, it makes no sense to invest more if there’s no likely payoff. Economists call this the “sunk cost fallacy”. Instead, focus on the future time you’ll gain rather than on the time you’ve already sunk.The beaten trackIt’s easy to have that once-in-a-lifetime holiday: go somewhere you’ll never, ever want to visit again. Plenty of people willingly do this in the name of adventure or to prove their alpha credentials. But there is much to be said for the relaxing and restorative joy of the safe, well-trodden path – such as comfortable beds, rainproof roofs and nice food. The trick to taking your first step back to the beaten track is to refrain from judging other people for choosing the tourist trail and package holidays – then hopefully you’ll stop judging yourself.Foodie warningSocial media and TV cookery shows have conspired to make food even more of a feast for our eyes than our taste buds. But trying to assess food’s deliciousness with your eyes is like trying to appreciate music with your mouth. It’s important to take food-based Instagram posts with a pinch of (figurative) salt, as some restaurants try to capitalise on these trends by creating dishes based around how they’ll look on social media. Avoid regrets by engaging in real conversation: if you see friends posting about having eaten somewhere that looks great, get in touch to check they actually rated the taste of the meal. Just because someone shares a pretty photo, it doesn’t make it a food recommendation.Before you startup, stopThe digital revolution has fuelled such a fixation with startups that it almost feels de rigueur to quit your job and start your own venture. Alternatively, you might be tempted to devote yourself full-time to your side hustle. Before you consider whether or not to take the plunge, one question you should ask yourself is whether the thing that you’re really fetishising is the idea of being a risk-taker rather than the venture itself. So be sure to scrutinise your real motivations. For instance, are you following your passion or your ego? And bear in mind that sometimes our egos are actually fuelled by feelings of insecurity.Savvy tech is safe techEach month brings a cacophony of new digital bells and whistles and it can be easy to simply dismiss them. So how do you sift useful tech from pointless tech? One tip is to ask whether or not the new app, gadget or feature will save you time, give you pleasure or make you safer. The latter question often gets overlooked. But when it comes to developments such as smart homes and in-car technology – including driver monitoring and assistance systems – making things safer is actually the main point.Safety mattersYour world matters to us.

And these devices are already proving their worthWho hasn’t found their attention straying behind the wheel? Modern life is riddled with distractions that fight tooth and nail for our attention – whether it’s noisy children, garish adverts, tiredness, traffic cameras, personal pressures, endless to-do lists or those digital devices and social media notifications that we forgot to switch to silent. We always seem to be spreading our attention too thinly or are exhausted from having to think 10 different thoughts.This is one reason why the focus of vehicle safety design has shifted in recent years. Whereas in the past it was about applying materials and design to mitigate damage to occupants in crashes, it’s now about using the latest technology to prevent accidents happening in the first place. In short, it’s about cars that can take control when you have lost it.The shift in emphasis is often referred to as a switch from passive safety systems to active safety systems. Indeed, when it comes to cars, making things safer is one of the main drivers of tech developments. Advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) can aid concentration and alertness and encompass features including automated braking that relies on technologies such as radar, cameras and lasers. “ADAS has been a step change,” says Andrew Morris of Loughborough University’s Transport Safety Research Centre. “There was a consensus that human fallibility is hard to eradicate and that all passive systems can do is reduce damage. At that point, the focus shifted to prevention. New technology offers solutions in the shape of sensing and automation, which is a better philosophy because it also protects vulnerable road users like pedestrians and cyclists.”Japanese carmaker Subaru has been at the forefront in the development of ADAS since 2013, when it introduced its “second pair of eyes”, the EyeSight system. This uses two sophisticated colour cameras mounted inside the car on the upper edge of the windshield above the rearview mirror. The system is capable of processing accurate stereo images to identify vehicles travelling in front, as well as obstacles, traffic lanes and other objects such as pedestrians.Using images generated by the cameras, EyeSight can run a suite of six ADAS:As with all the company’s core safety tech, EyeSight is continually evolving. For example, the Forester e-BOXER and Levorg now feature the EyeSight assist monitor, which provides a heads-up display of EyeSight system warnings for drivers to see more clearly.EyeSight is fitted as standard to all Subaru models, save the BRZ sports car. In 2019, the Forester e-BOXER achieved the maximum five-star Euro NCAP rating for safety and was declared “Best in Class 2019 in the Small Off-roadMPV Class”.Other Subaru safety systems include its Driver Monitoring System, which can detect the driver’s eyes closing or looking away for an extended period of time and trigger audio and visual warnings. This could be a potential lifesaver given that, according to Thatcham research centre, at least one fatal sleep-related crash occurs every day in the UK. Subaru’s Driver Monitoring System won the Technology Award at the 2020 What Car? Awards. What Car? praised the system, calling it “the most advanced of its kind”. In the tests, it proved to be more accurate at identifying when concentration was lost, compared with other manufacturer systems.Reverse Automatic Braking (RAB) and Subaru Rear Vehicle Detection also use sensors to spot potential objects behind the vehicle or in blind spots and RAB can even apply the brakes to avoid a collision.While driver distraction can be lethal, education and legislation – like the law banning handling a mobile phone – can only go so far.Full autonomy is some way off but, as of 2022, new safety technologies will become mandatory in cars and vans under EU law and are likely to be adopted in the UK – specifically lane-keeping assistance and advanced emergency braking. This will contribute to the long-term goal dubbed “Vision Zero”, of moving close to zero fatalities and serious injuries.But is eradicating all accidents possible through technology?“It’s very aspirational certainly and hard to achieve in the foreseeable future,” admits Morris. “However it’s a sound concept, a safe-system approach, which says if an accident happens for whatever reason we blame the system rather than the driver. And these systems will definitely become more effective as they are refined.”Safety mattersYour world matters to us.

Given that the nurses on the frontline risk becoming the patients, coronavirus presents a double whammy. This “absolutely demonstrates what we’ve been saying for a long time”, she says.“I don’t think you could ever say that we could get all the people we need for a pandemic, but it has put us more on the backfoot than we might have been if there’d been the proper investment.”Beasley, who is also chair of the London region of Health Education England, points to the fact that the pace of growth has stepped up in recent months.Knowing that something needed to be done about nursing numbers, Boris Johnson made an election pledge for 50,000 more nurses by 2024-25. But the shine soon came off amid accusations of double counting when it emerged that over a third of the figure factored nurses already in the job. Although the government announced an annual grant of at least £5,000 for healthcare students, which will kick in from September 2020, critics say this doesn’t go far enough since tuition fee costs will remain a barrier for many. That was before Covid-19 overtook events and it was all hands on deck. To help cope with the crisis, final-year nursing students in England have been asked to join the ranks, and a call-out for experienced hands has seen 5,605 former nurses and midwives come back. It’s a sensible move and one that Beasley very much welcomes, but she doubts that the former nurses coming to help with the pandemic intend to return permanently.It’s down to the government to invest better financial support for nursing students and a more conducive environment for staff already in the workplace, says Beasley. And she doesn’t just mean regarding working conditions and pay – the starting salary for a nurse is £24,214 – but ensuring that nurses can further develop their skills and careers. She also makes the case for the need for nursing practice to change so that we can “make the most of the nurses that we have”. This means allowing nurses to work to the top of their proficiency, supported by other colleagues such as nursing associates and healthcare assistants, and expecting more patients to manage their own health, including using basic technology. “It’s happening in parts of the health service, but we need to push that much more.”Beasley completed her own nurse training as far back as 1965, yet her interest in nursing shows no sign of waning. Since retiring as chief nursing officer, she has held a number of non-executive posts, and has been a trustee of the Burdett Trust for Nursing for nine years.The charity, which grants funding to support nurse-led innovation, is also responsible for footing the £500,000 core costs for Nursing Now – a three-year global campaign to raise the profile and status of nursing worldwide, which concludes at the end of this year. As chief nurse, Beasley pressed home the importance of clean hands during the battle against hospital-acquired methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in the early noughties. The initiative was very much nurse-led, she says. “Most doctors didn’t believe that it could really make any difference to MRSA because it was a byproduct of modern medicine, and consequently they slightly stepped aside,” Beasley recalls. “Obviously they then came on board.” She is pleased that awareness about handwashing, and the use of sanitisers in hospitals in battling infection are now the norm. But they are only part of the story in tackling the latest bug on the block.There is a “big challenge” in getting testing kits and protective equipment to hospitals to keep staff safe. “The equipment is getting through, but that needs to be sustained and it needs to be done faster.”Health and safety also means that staff should not be doing 12-14 hour shifts “day after day after day”. She adds: “No matter if you’re a cross between Mother Teresa and the Angel Gabriel, you’re not going to be able to sustain that.”“When all of this finishes, which one day it will, society will look back and say of both nurses and doctors: ‘We need these folks. We can’t just wait until something awful happens and then quickly ramp up the numbers.’” Status: Married with three sons.Education: Westcliff high school for girls, Southend-on-Sea, Essex.Career: 2004-12: chief nursing officer, Department of Health 2003-04: partnership development director, NHS Modernisation Agency 2002-03: head of development and nursing, Directorate of Health and Social Care 1998-2002: regional director of nursing and operational development, NHS London 1996-98: regional nurse director, North Thames 1994-96: acting regional nurse director, North Thames Regional Health Authority 1990-94: chief nurse, Riverside Health Authority 1990-91: acting chief executive, Riverside Health Authority 1987-90: director of community nursing, Hammersmith \u0026amp Fulham 1981-87: community services manager, Ealing Health Authority 1978-81: district nurse, Ealing 1969-78: career gap to raise three sons 1965-68: staff nursejunior sister, Royal London hospital 1962-65: nurse training, Royal London hospital.Public life: Trustee, the Burdett Trust for Nursing chair of the Florence Nightingale Museum chair, London region, Health Education England chair of council, University of Buckingham."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/75798746ed4612793fc85ad937a2ceb720c6534a/0_237_5376_3226/master/5376.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e03c1543cb1e9b5b10d8d273ca0fe90e","title":"small sport coronavirus lockdown olympic legacy","story":"Jogging round the block. A bike ride in the park. An online yoga class. We must take what we can getSo, how’s quarantine going for you? For me, perhaps the most striking discovery of the past couple of weeks is the revelation that my many deferred and undone tasks – the books not read, the films not watched, the camera rolls not tidied, the shelves not rearranged – were never meant to be done at all.Shakespeare may famously have written King Lear while in plague quarantine but then Shakespeare never had to contend with Instagram Stories, internet chess and an online quiz with the irresistible title “Name Every England Test Cricketer of the 2010s”. (Ajmal Shahzad is the one that gets most people.)Despite this new abundance of spare time, then, my to-do list remains as stubbornly considerable as ever and it occurs to me now that in compiling these endless, sprawling lists – “buy compost”, “print wedding photos”, “sew holes in socks” – I was articulating not a genuine need but an archetype.I did not, as it turned out, actually want to sew the holes in my socks, an assignment that once undertaken (and this is the other dirty little secret about to-do lists) would immediately detonate three more, namely “research sewing equipment”, “buy sewing kit” and “learn to sew”. Instead, I was asserting a wish to be the kind of guy who wants to sew up the holes in his socks. For this reason alone, the socks must never be sewn. To do so would defeat the entire point of the task.And yet in among such bleak realisations, such yawning ennui, such dispiriting dispatches, there is one important aspect where life has improved immeasurably. If David Foster Wallace describes sport as human beings’ reconciliation with having a body, then the same might easily be said of its absence. Deprived of the throbbing bombast of Big Sport, perhaps this is the moment when we seek solace in its unassuming older sibling: the modest, sweat-ringed pleasures of Small Sport.In a sense, many of the activities that come under the banner of Small Sport are the sort of thing that many people would barely classify as sport at all. Jogging around the block. A bike ride in the park. An online yoga class in the living room. A brief but vigorous press-up routine in the bedroom. Even Eurosport would balk at showing some of this stuff. But locked down and locked indoors, we must take what we can get.In this context, the government’s stipulation that exercise is one of the few legitimate reasons for leaving the house feels less like a permission and more like an imperative. The Association of Cycle Traders has reported a surge in sales of bicycles and cycle equipment. Fitness and workout apps are doing a roaring trade. And every other afternoon I slip on a pair of trainers and join the throngs of grimacing, carefully spaced runners on the London streets: not all of whom, you surmise, can be exiles from the gym or the athletics club.Perhaps it’s possible to read into all this things that are not really there. Perhaps there is a danger of extrapolating all sorts of fantastical trends from this extremely narrow and unusual set of circumstances. But one of the most appealing traits of sport is the way it reels you in, little by little. The daily jog leads to a half-marathon. The Sunday bike ride leads to a sportive. The idle darts practice leads one day to an idle Google search for local pub leagues. We are, above all, creatures of habit and during this enforced incarceration many of us are grooving habits that may prove tough to shake on parole.There is a certain irony in all this. For decades, we have been told that the only legitimate model of driving mass sporting participation is the top-down approach: spectacle, exemplar, extravaganza.It is a convenient falsehood cruelly exposed by the firework-laden, Bowie-themed sophistry of London 2012, which derived its justification and vast public expense from the fanciful idea that watching the world’s best canoeists and modern pentathletes would send us all stampeding down to our local white water centre or wherever it is people go to do modern pentathlon. The more prosaic reality? Providing a nation with hours and hours of cracking television to enjoy from their sofas does not – remarkably enough – make them more outdoorsy.And so it would be quaintly paradoxical if it turned out the key to generating our Olympic legacy was to trap us in our own homes with no sport to watch.“Imprison A Generation” may not be the sort of feel-good slogan you can put on a Games Maker T-shirt, but perhaps in these times we can be reminded that there is an alternative vision of sport out there: one free of Ticketmaster queues and security bag searches and separate hospitality entrances and Kiss Cam and £6 pints. One that rearticulates sport not as something you sit and pay for but something you get up and do.In one sense, this is simply a rehash of the old Foucauldian trope of the body as locus of historic power struggle. In another, it’s the time-honoured human instinct known as “needing to get out of the bloody house”. After all, the resistance takes many forms. Lift a kettlebell. Do a downward dog. Go for a run.Somehow, in an age of curtailed freedoms and frightening state power, the simple repetitive movements of Small Sport can feel like the most empowering of comforts."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1cf2022628ef794476a31a2e18364a6be10bb5dc/54_113_3130_1878/master/3130.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=500c2fb82052e98196e33e218cd7f8c8","title":"japan businessman admits giving gifts for successful tokyo olympic bid","story":"New questions about Tokyo’s successful bid for the 2020 Olympics have been raised after a businessman admitted he had given digital cameras and Seiko watches to lobby Games powerbrokers, including an influential International Olympic Committee figure suspected by French prosecutors of taking bribes to help Japan’s bid.Haruyuki Takahashi, a former executive at the influential advertising agency Dentsu Inc, told Reuters he had given the gifts when lobbying IOC members such as Lamine Diack, the former head of athletics’ governing body, the IAAF. “You don’t go empty handed. That’s common sense,” Takahashi told Reuters, referring to the gifts he gave Diack and his son Papa Massata, before adding: “They’re cheap.” A senior official at the bid also told Reuters “good” watches were handed out at parties organised as part of Tokyo’s campaign to win the Olympics, although he did not specify the brand.Takahashi was paid $8.2m (£6.6m) by the committee that spearheaded Tokyo’s bid, according to financial records reviewed by Reuters – making him the single largest recipient of money from the Tokyo bid committee. He said it was for “wining and dining” people who could further the city’s bid and for marketing and other activities related to its Olympic campaign. Banking records from the Tokyo bid committee, which were examined by Reuters, show it paid around $46,500 to Seiko Watch.Takahashi admitted asking Diack to support the bid but denied he paid bribes or did anything wrong. “I didn’t pay any money to anybody,” he told Reuters.Lamine Diack is awaiting trial in Paris having been charged with corruption relating to a number of sporting events. His lawyer said Diack “denies all allegations of bribery”. Massata Diack, a former marketing executive with the IAAF, has also denied any wrongdoing. IOC regulations allowed for the giving of gifts of nominal value at the time of the 2020 bid but did not stipulate a specific amount.The banking records were provided to French prosecutors by Japan’s government as part of France’s investigation into whether Tokyo’s bid committee paid $2.3m through a Singaporean consultant to win Diack’s support for Japan to host the 2020 Games.Nobumoto Higuchi, the secretary general of the bid committee, said Takahashi earned commissions on the corporate sponsorships he collected for the bid. “Takahashi has connections,” Higuchi said. “We needed someone who understands the business world.”The IOC said it would not have been made aware of payments between private parties or gifts given to IOC members.French prosecutors have been investigating Lamine Diack, the former president of the IAAF since 2015, and he has also been accused of taking a separate $2m bribe to corral votes for Rio de Janeiro in that city’s successful bid to hold the Olympics in 2016. Diack’s lawyer said his client “did not receive any money from anyone relating to the Olympic Games in Tokyo or Rio de Janeiro”. broke the story that the Tokyo bid was under suspicion for paying bribes in 2016. Since then Tsunekazu Takeda, who headed Tokyo’s bid committee and was a member of the IOC, has resigned from both posts. He is under investigation by French prosecutors on suspicion of authorising the payments from the bid committee to the Singaporean consultant that investigators suspect acted as an intermediary to get money to Diack.Takeda has denied wrongdoing, saying he believed the payments were for legitimate lobbying efforts. His lawyer said he did not instruct Takahashi to lobby Diack and was unaware of any gifts given by Takahashi to Diack. “Mr Takeda has never approved such things,” the lawyer said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/593d81731b3c78f423692bd8df381a82184bf336/18_177_3943_2366/master/3943.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c9cccd03c15d3dfec6834c5ad4d8fe1a","title":"the spin top 10 cricket reads for a long and yawning summer","story":"With precious little, if any, cricket to look forward to, this could be just the time to catch up on some essential readingThere are only 12 days left till the non-start of the cricket season. What to do? Time – we have plenty of it after all – for a list. Today, a literary one, the best cricketing reads for an indefinite lockdown. A selection, in no particular order, of books The Spin has loved and, in some cases, lost. A confession: some are written by friends, though that’s not why they made the cut. If your fancy is tickled, some bookshops are still delivering and ebooks and audio books can be borrowed from the library. Happy browsing!Golden Boy by Christian Ryan The Australian writer’s finest book – a brutal examination of the rise and fall of Kim Hughes and the breathtakingly obnoxious treatment of him at the hands of the bullying clique at the centre of Australia’s side. A classic study of power and weakness, it is heartbreaking to read as Hughes continually makes excuses for his tormentors’ behaviour. Characteristically intelligent and beautifully written.Pundits from Pakistan by Rahul Bhattacharya Bhattacharya wrote this when he was only 25 and had been sent to cover India’s groundbreaking tour of Pakistan in 2004. It is a coming of age book really, an illustration of love, enlightenment, friendship across nations, and the power of cricket to transform. Page after page of beautiful phrases, images to bathe in, heat, dust and bat on ball.An Australian Summer by Patrick Eagar and Alan Ross Pure 1985 nostalgia from an unbeatable double act. The pithy captions, the beautiful photographs, happy memories of one of English cricket’s loveliest summers.Following on by Emma John This account of supporting England at their nadir is five parts memoir, three parts cricket and two parts easy-breezy charm. John (no stranger to these pages) peppers her teenage travails with literary references, names her teddy Steve Watkin and, as an adult, tracks down 11 members of that team and asks them … why? Utterly beguiling and cricket’s nearest thing to Fever Pitch.Glory Gardens 1-9 by Bob Cattell This jolly romp of a children’s series follows the antics of an amateur cricket club as they stretch for world domination, featuring a cheerful cast of characters. Perfect for primary school cricket fans climbing the walls without a cricket season to play, a cousin’s hand-me-downs were read, and re-read, by the Spin’s children.Tom Graveney’s Top Ten Cricket Book A niche choice, no longer in print (though available second hand), and simple in format – it essentially lists Graveney’s top-10 spin bowlers openers wicketkeepers etc. Quizzing each other from it in the back of the car was what passed for entertainment for four children in the 1980s. Ideal for the apocalypse.The Art of Captaincy by Mike Brearley The classic book on leadership in cricket and beyond by the man with “a degree in people”. Published in 1985, a couple of years after Brearley unbuckled his pads for the last time, it is thoughtful, jargon-free and empathetic, describing the complex relationships and responsibilities of captaincy and the myriad traps that await. Can someone please send one to No 10, post-haste?Beyond a Boundary by CLR James Makes every cricket book top 10 as a matter of course but really is worth the effort if you’ve never got round to it. Can be a little dense in places but though James’s 1963 tome is a product of its time, examining the game through the gaze of class, race and fading imperialism, it still speaks to the 21st century.Wisden This, of all summers, is your chance to wade further in than the editor’s notes. But which to choose out of all 157 “delectable primrose doorstops”, as Frank Keating described them? Wisden 2000 is a good starting point as an overview of the 20th century and includes the Five Cricketers of the Century. For a more up-to-date read, order the 2020 Almanack that will somehow hit its publication date in early April despite being printed in Italy.The Judge by Robin Smith and Rob Smyth A frankly disturbing autobiography of one of England’s most loved players of the 1980s and 1990s. Illustrates what happens when masculinity becomes an inescapable mask, and the damage a parent can do, however well-intentioned. Sensitively written by the ’s own OBO champion.Mystery Spinner by Gideon Haigh It’s difficult to choose just one from Haigh’s rich back catalogue but this pips the rest. The king of research picks a relatively obscure yet intriguing subject in Jack Iverson and traces his journey to that short and sweet pinnacle of fame, and the tragedy that followed.Steve Smith’s Men by Geoff Lemon This swept the awards season last year, named the Wisden, MCC and Cricket Writers’ Club book of the year. It deserved the accolade, a super read on Sandpapergate – a cricket story for the ages – a tale of what happens when cricket becomes a business, winning becomes everything, leadership is empty and the game exists in a moral vacuum.Another Bloody Tour by Frances Edmonds The Spin loved this book as a teenager. It is irreverent, rude, very funny, if bumptious in places, and pricks all the right people in all the right places. Never was a writer better suited to her circumstances than Edmonds on England’s calamitous 1986 tour of the West Indies.Fred Trueman by Chris Waters The Yorkshire Post’s cricket correspondent gets under the skin of Yorkshire’s most famous son in this cracking biography. He tells us Trueman’s story from cradle to grave, from the glorious side-on stallion to the cantankerous old bugger, examines his atrocious handling by England and, worse, by Yorkshire, who even asked him to pay £120 towards his own retirement present, which they didn’t bother to engrave. Surprisingly moving.Rain Men by Marcus Berkmann Much copied, never rivalled, Berkman’s tale of his useless cricket team struck a chord with grassroots cricketers everywhere and was a surprise hit in 1995. Twenty-five years on, it still works, the rhythms of the circular year as familiar as ever – apart from this one.• This is an extract from the ’s weekly cricket email, The Spin.

Here are some of the strangest – and most disturbingIt’s a whole new world: after a UK launch that coincided so neatly with a national lockdown that future conspiracy theorists will have a field day, we have had a fairly intense week to explore Disney+. Most of the focus has been on the blue-chip headliners, with all those beloved animated classics bolstered by shiny new Marvel and Star Wars content. That is Disney+ at its best. But in a digital vault stuffed with more than 800 titles, not everything can possibly be as cool as The Mandalorian.In yet more bad news for Bond fans, there is barely any Sean Connery on Disney+. But the strapping Scot gets to sharpen a scythe and sing a ditty called My Pretty Irish Girl in this regrettable leprechaun-themed romcom, which presents a rose-tinted and red-cheeked vision of life in rural Ireland. The real star is the wily veteran groundskeeper O’Gill, who spins tall tales at the local inn about his encounters with leprechauns. It’s not just firewater-fuelled blarney, though. The magical little people rave all night in a nearby underground lair as if they’re in The Matrix Reloaded, but their prideful ruler, King Brian, has a jaw-dropping mean streak, promising O’Gill that he’ll put “a scourge on this land that’ll make the potato famine look like a Sunday regatta”.If you’ve already binged your way through Tiger King on Netflix and are in the market for another story of big-cat mayhem, this deeply strange one-off may scratch that itch. One of hundreds of stand-alone episodes produced for Disney’s various long-running TV anthology strands, it charts the fast friendship between a Bengal tiger being hunted for sport on a private island and a Harry Styles-esque young pop idol fleeing his touring commitments. It seems to take a principled stand against animal cruelty while also featuring an action sequence in which a live tiger has been plonked on to the bonnet of a speeding truck. Wild.The gaudy production design, enthusiastic audience laughter and knockabout slapstick of this kid-targeted sitcom all help distract from what is a deeply unsettling premise: a blase tech billionaire has created three bionically enhanced teens, but keeps them locked up in a secure testing facility deep beneath his smart home. Once they are discovered by his wisecracking new stepson Leo, the naive cyborgs begin to integrate with society. But if Leo hadn’t accidentally dragged this highly unethical skunk works into the light, they would be down there still.Another tale of scientists meddling with forces beyond their understanding, this garish Disney Channel movie is one that is impossible to scroll past if it pops up in the recommendations bar. Your first reaction will probably be a sigh of relief: the “poof point” is a scientific term marking the moment a Benjamin Button-type experiment in ageing backwards becomes irreversible. The muddy moral here is something to do with kids being forced into childcare roles as their parents mentally regress to babyhood. But no one really wants to watch adults do baby voices and whine about messes in their nappies. (If they do, other streaming options are available.)A weird TV stand-alone, this suburban fantasy centres on Mikey, a 12-year-old fearful about going to high school. His new invisible friend seems to be taking Mikey’s mind off things, but while his parents and siblings roll their eyes, it is revealed (about halfway through, probably for budgetary reasons) that Fuzzbucket is very real – a furry little bipedal critter with a long, ratty tail. It is a sweet and heartwarming tale, but one tailored for standard definition: on modern TVs, Fuzzbucket has a clearly visible second human mouth inside his snout a nightmarish piece of Cronenbergian body horror that can never be unseen.In 2017, the Marvel brand was bulletproof. The company had magicked an unimaginably successful movie franchise into existence, seemingly from a standing start. Then came Inhumans, conceived as a cosmic Imax film about superpowered royals who live on the moon. It was downsized to an eight-episode TV event that struggled to leave any cultural footprint. Now, thanks to the magic of Disney+, it will be preserved for ever, a cautionary tale about corporate hubris more chilling than most episodes of Black Mirror.If it feels as if Disney now leans heavily on sequels, remakes and spin-offs it’s worth remembering the company has always been at it. The Story of Perri is the feature-length follow-up to Bambi, a “true-life fantasy” assembled from documentary-style footage of woodland creatures frolicking in a national park. It follows a year in the life of a spirited baby squirrel as she learns how to hustle beyond the beaver pond. To keep things interesting, while Perri is hibernating, there is a full-on fantasy dream sequence featuring flying squirrels and rabbits frolicking in the snow.

Despite being classed as key workers by the Cabinet Office, the rubbish collectors are only being offered the contractual minimum, which in many cases is understood to be statutory sick pay of £94.25 a week.Amey employs 17,000 people in the UK and the email was sent last Thursday, the day the known death toll from Covid-19 hit 578, its largest recorded daily rise at that time. On Monday the figure rose to 1,408, with more deaths not so far recorded from care homes and hospices to be announced on Tuesday.According to a message seen by the , Simon Schumann-Davies, head of human resources in Amey’s highways and waste collection business unit, told the GMB’s negotiator: “Ultimately it remains a disease like many others and indeed, when compared with many other diseases such as normal influenza, the impacts on the inidual are currently actually less severe the annual mortality rate for influenza is significantly higher, for example.”He continued: “That is not a reason for complacency or an indication that we are not treating this outbreak with the utmost gravity.

To this end, we are applying exactly the same rules regarding sickness benefit as we would for any other condition in that we will be paying contractual entitlement.”Schumann-Davies acknowledged that concerns raised by workers about the outbreak were “obvious and understandable”, adding: “This is clearly a situation that none of us have had to face before and it would be fair to say that we are all learning as we go along.”The GMB replied that Amey’s stance meant workers would have to choose between “health or wealth”, because those who need to self-isolate would not be able to afford to do so if they only receive statutory sick pay.Keith Williams, the GMB organiser for London, replied to Schumann-Davies that the offer was “alarming” and out of step with employers of other workers similarly designated as key workers by government.“People do not have to self isolate for the greater good for influenza,” Williams told him in the message. “Self-isolating is the key message of the government and the country is in lock down to stop the spread of the virus.“Amey employees cannot lock themselves away as they are key workers, and therefore they are at greater risk ... if people only receive statutory sick pay they are unable to afford to self isolate … There needs to be decency and morality on the part of employers in the current crisis.”A spokesperson for Amey distanced the firm from Schumann-Davies’ position on the threat posed by the outbreak.“The email referred to does not reflect Amey’s official position on Covid-19,” they said. “We are resolutely committed to the safety of our employees and the communities we serve, and we can confirm we provide contractual sick pay from day one for any Covid-19 related illness. We are working closely with our clients and mobilising all resources required to protect our employees and prioritise work that supports the government in limiting the spread of Covid-19.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/da913b2484b2a709c5e69a22a8b455b50c4cb332/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ca0ccfa5250782a940b1ad8618c00710","title":"antarctica what it means when the coldest place on earth records an unprecedented heatwave","story":"Antarctica’s weather has worldwide impacts and can be a ‘canary in the mine’ for patterns of change elsewhereWhile the world rightfully focuses on the Covid-19 pandemic, the planet is still warming. This summer’s Antarctic weather, as elsewhere in the world, was unprecedented in the observed record.Our research, published today in Global Change Biology, describes the recent heatwave in Antarctica. Beginning in late spring east of the Antarctic Peninsula, it circumnavigated the continent over the next four months. Some of our team spent the summer in Antarctica observing these temperatures and the effect on natural systems, witnessing the heatwave first hand.Antarctica may be isolated from the rest of the continents by the Southern Ocean, but has worldwide impacts. It drives the global ocean conveyor belt, a constant system of deep-ocean circulation which transfers oceanic heat around the planet, and its melting ice sheet adds to global sea level rise.Antarctica represents the simple, extreme end of conditions for life. It can be seen as a “canary in the mine”, demonstrating patterns of change we can expect to see elsewhere.This summer, Casey Research Station, in the Windmill Islands oasis, experienced its first recorded heatwave. For three days, minimum temperatures exceeded zero and daily maximums were all above 7.5C. On 24 January, its highest maximum of 9.2C was recorded, almost 7C above Casey’s 30-year mean for the month.The arrival of warm, moist air during this weather event brought rain to Davis Research Station in the normally frigid, ice-free desert of the Vestfold Hills. The warm conditions triggered extensive meltwater pools and surface streams on local glaciers. These, together with melting snowbanks, contributed to high-flowing rivers and flooding lakes.The pace of warming from global climate change has been generally slower in East Antarctica compared with West Antarctica and the Antarctic Peninsula. This is in part due to the ozone hole, which has occurred in spring over Antarctica since the late 1970s.The hole has tended to strengthen jet stream winds over the Southern Ocean, promoting a generally more “positive” state of the Southern Annular Mode in summer. This means the Southern Ocean’s westerly wind belt has tended to stay close to Antarctica at that time of year creating a seasonal “shield”, reducing the transfer of warm air from the Earth’s temperate regions to Antarctica.But during the spring of 2019 a strong warming of the stratosphere over Antarctica significantly reduced the size of the ozone hole. This helped to support a more “negative” state of the Southern Annular Mode and weakened the shield.Other factors in late 2019 may have also helped to warm Antarctica. The Indian Ocean Dipole was in a strong “positive” state due to a late retreat of the Indian monsoon. This meant that water in the western Indian Ocean was warmer than normal. Air rising from this and other warm ocean patches in the Pacific Ocean provided energy sources that altered the path of weather systems and helped to disturb and warm the stratosphere.Localised flooding appeared to benefit some of Vestfold Hills’ moss banks that were previously very drought-stressed. Prior to the flood event, most mosses were grey and moribund, but a month later many moss shoots were green.Given the generally cold conditions of Antarctica, the warmth may have benefited the flora (mosses, lichens and two vascular plants) and microbes and invertebrates, but only where liquid water formed. Areas in the Vestfold Hills away from the flooding became more drought-stressed over the summer.High temperatures may have caused heat stress in some organisms. Antarctic mosses and lichens are often dark in colour, allowing sunlight to be absorbed to create warm microclimates. This is a great strategy when temperatures are just above freezing, but heat stress can occur once 10C is exceeded.Based on our experience from previous anomalous hot Antarctic summers, we can expect many biological impacts, positive and negative, in coming years. The most recent event highlights the connectedness of our climate systems: from the surface to the stratosphere, and from the monsoon tropics to the southernmost continent.Under climate change, extreme events are predicted to increase in frequency and severity, and Antarctica is not immune."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7200859fb487792e1336e456cb1a1b0c126614c/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3c3503426875ecac8614c1ddb0a46742","title":"coronavirus at a glance","story":"A summary of the biggest developments in the global coronavirus outbreakKey developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include:Spain has recorded a record new single-day coronavirus death toll after 849 people died from the virus between Monday and Tuesday. The country’s total number of cases now stands at 94,417 – up from 85,195 on Monday – and its death toll at 8,189.The number of coronavirus cases in Russia jumped to 2,337 on Tuesday, an increase of 500, as the country recorded its biggest daily rise for the seventh day in a row. In Russia, 18 people who contracted the coronavirus have died, while 121 people have recovered.Italy has extended its lockdown until Easter. The number of new coronavirus infections reported on Monday was 1,648, as opposed to 3,815 the previous day. The death toll, however, rose again, with 812 deaths reported, compared with 756 the day before.An additional 40 previously unreported coronavirus deaths occurred in England and Wales earlier this month, according to new official backdated figures. The figures, which are based on death certificates, show there were 210 deaths where Covid-19 was listed as a cause by 20 March, 40 more than the 170 announced by the NHS at that stage.The figure is higher because it includes deaths outside hospitals, including those in homes and care homes, and includes patients who had not tested positive for the virus but were suspected of having the disease.Ireland’s daily growth rate in confirmed cases of coronavirus has halved. Ireland on Monday confirmed 295 new cases, the second highest daily number, bringing the total to 2,910. It recorded eight deaths, bringing the death toll to 54. Northern Ireland has 533 confirmed cases and 22 deaths.The coronavirus epidemic is “far from over” in the Asia-Pacific region, and current measures to curb the spread of the virus are buying time for countries to prepare for large-scale community transmissions, a WHO official said.The first comprehensive study of Covid-19 deaths and hospitalisations in mainland China has revealed in stark detail the increase in risk for coronavirus patients once they reach middle age.Figures from Johns Hopkins University show the toll from coronavirus in the US now exceeds that from the September 11 terrorist attacks. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the US, at 164,539 is double those in China.China’s growth could come to a standstill while 11 million more people in East Asia could be driven into poverty."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6dee53ed3a9f5ab0dac3511d8dd5300f66faf65/0_0_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6545e252bfa8f09bf05d37da87ef68ec","title":"coronavirus uk how many confirmed cases in your area","story":"Latest figures from public health authorities on the spread of Covid-19 in the United Kingdom.

If they were doing 400 tests a day we would be up to Germany levels of testing and that is perfectly feasible. Public Health England (PHE) was slow and controlled and only allowed non-PHE labs to start testing two weeks ago but that was only after the strategy shift to end community testing,” he said.“If you look at Korea, they have done 490,000 tests. Their death rate is three per million and they have suppressed the virus.“I don’t see why we can’t get these 44 labs up and running, finding cases and testing.“We must go to mass testing and when we remove the lockdown – all the Asian states it was six to eight weeks, even in Wuhan – then we will have a control mechanism which will enable us to wait, without socially distancing the whole country, for drugs or a vaccine for herd immunity.”Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, was asked whether the UK planned to move to mass testing at some point in order to end the lockdown.He said it was important to increase testing for current cases of the virus but an antibody test was also important to let people know if they were immune after contracting the virus.“Hugely increased testing is part of it, but there is a second type of testing which will be very significant when we get there, which is the antibody testing, which will tell us whether you have had it in the past. That will enable us to say you can come out of the lockdown.”He said the global nature of the pandemic meant to scale up testing had been a “military operation”."},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Photograph: The  After 24 hours of uncertainty, the Oireachtas has confirmed the Dáil has reversed its decision not to sit this week and will convene on Thursday afternoon.While other parties pressed for the change, the Labour Party criticised the reverse and said it will boycott the sitting on the basis it does not respect the national effort for people to stay at home for non-essential purposes.It has argued that because there is no legislation being discussed the sitting is not essential. The party says all its TDs will remain absent and will make a contribution by way of video statements from its spokespeople, which will then be laid before the Dáil. It was initially decided on Monday that no parliamentary sitting would take place this week. However, following complaints by Sinn Féin and People Before Profit on Monday, an incorporeal meeting of the Dáil’s all-party business committee on Tuesday decided proceedings would go ahead. The meeting took place by a series of inidual telephone calls by Oireachtas officials to party whips asking them their opinion on whether or not a sitting should go ahead and, if so, what should be discussed?The Oireachtas is not using teleconferencing facilities such as Zoom or Google Hangout for these meetings, which means no party whip was aware of the position of other parties. Oireachtas officials collated the opinions and decided to proceed on the basis of a majority favouring a sitting. Two Dáil sessions will take place on Thursday. The first will be statements on health, and then statements on social protection. The relevant Ministers will commence each session, which will last 90 minutes. In a statement, the Labour Party said it disagreed with the decision.“We agreed that our TDs would not attend the sitting of the Dáil for statements on Thursday as it is non-essential business and not legislation that was being proposed. “They will instead support the national effort to stay at home, and not place an unnecessary burden on the Oireachtas staff, and staff of those departments who are working heroically to deal with the Covid-19 outbreak and it’s social and economic impact,” the party said in a statement. “There is a provision for statements to be laid before the Dáil instead, and our health spokesman Alan Kelly and Employment Affairs and Social Protection spokesman Ged Nash will both avail of that opportunity (to make statements by video).”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4216843.1585658333!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"look on the bright side international space station visible in irish skies tonight","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA view of Earth from the International Space Station on March 20th.

The International Space Station will be visible at 8.45pm as it orbits the Earth and will be very bright. It will be visible for all of four minutes which is a long time for the station which travels at a speed of 27,600 kph. For those who don’t have a calculator to hand, that represents 460 kilometres per minute, or almost eight kilometres a second. It orbits the Earth every 92 minutes.The ISS will travel west to east across the southern horizon at an angle of 48 degrees so it should be high enough in the sky not to be obscured by houses or the landscape. The six members of the crew, three Russians and three Americans, departed Earth in February before the coronavirus pandemic was declared and will be returning to Earth next month. They are probably the safest human beings anywhere now as there is no chance of them catching coronavirus in space. Flight engineer Andrew Morgan, who is a medical doctor, tweeted on Monday: “As a medical doctor looking back on our planet on #NationalDoctorsDay, I think of the healthcare professionals \u0026amp volunteers that are risking their lives in this crisis. We’re at our best when we help each other. I’m in awe of your selfless service. Thank you from @Space_Station”. On St Patrick’s Day Dr Morgan posted a picture on his Twitter page that he had taken the previous autumn: He tweeted: “Happy #StPatricksDay! This past fall I captured this clear day over the southern end of the Emerald Isle: Limerick, Cork and Kerry counties.” He also shared a photo of the tricolour floating in one of the windows of the Cupola observatory the a dome-shaped module that the crew of Expedition 62, as it is called, can observe the Earth. Ireland has had a long association with the ISS as both Commander Chris Hadfield, who is a regular visitor to Ireland, and Astronaut Catherine Cady Coleman have both played traditional Irish music while on board the station.

Photograph: Oliver HosletReutersThe European Union released a draft of its hoped-for future relationship deal with Britain on Wednesday, setting out ambitions for a tight relationship on trade and security.The 440-page document crosses several of Britain’s red lines, spelling out the bloc’s ambitions for Britain to agree “uniform implementation” of state subsidy rules, with the European Court of Justice remaining the adjudicating authority.It also makes reference to the so-called “level playing field”, provisions to ensure fair competition by keeping rules aligned, which London has already rejected.“The Parties recognise that the establishment of conditions that ensure a level playing field between the Parties is necessary for trade and investment between the Union and the United Kingdom, ” the draft reads.The EU’s draft envisages reciprocal access to waters for fishing rights, with negotiations held each year by December 10th on fishing opportunities for the following year, another contentious point.The UK negotiating team said it had also sent a draft to the EU. This includes a free trade agreement with annexes, as well as agreements on aviation safety and air transport, and a civil nuclear agreement.“We are sharing ours in confidence as a negotiating document, as part of the ongoing negotiating process,” a government spokesman said.“Teams will now analyse each other’s texts and we expect further conversations between the teams next week.“We will keep under review which documents it is appropriate to publish during the course of negotiations and whether it is useful to make them availablle more widely.”Though Britain has left the EU it is is currently in a transition period, continuing to adhere to prior norms pending the agreement of a deal on the future relationship. If none can be agreed, it will automatically begin trading on World Trade Organisation terms from January 1st, 2021, with potentially severe effects on the Irish economy.The government of prime minister Boris Johnson has until July to request an extension to the transition period, but has insisted it will not do so even as the Coronavirus pandemic delayed talks this week.Both sides said they were examining options such as using video conferencing in place of face-to face talks.“The negotiations can still proceed given all of the logistical arrangements that have been put in place,” British foreign secretary Dominic Raab said on Tuesday.“We’re confident that we can get this done and, actually, I don’t think delaying Brexit negotiations would give anyone the certainty on either side of the Channel that they need.”Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons march 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178Coronavirus latest news: A further 367 die as England\u0026#39s death toll reaches 1,651 How murder of Thomas Becket impacted the environment, according to study Politics latest news: Number 10 plays down Grant Shapps\u0026#39 suggestion that tougher lockdown could be \u0026#39more harmful\u0026#39 than coronavirusComment: I could have been a coronavirus super-spreader – so why have my symptoms not been formalised?Comment: Life under lockdown is a chance to rediscover the lost virtue of patienceBritain, France and Germany bypass US sanctions to provide Iran with medical aid When will coronavirus peak in the UK?  Prime Minister Boris Johnson tests positive for coronavirus – everything we know so far How long will the UK coronavirus lockdown last?

After its long-running Brexit disgrace, it briefly returned to the straight and narrow, giving useful information calmly, as it always should, particularly in a crisis. As a result, the Government was forced to let ministers appear once more on the Today programme. Anything else would have looked petty. The BBC sensed the licence fee might be saved if it behaved.Now, however, the corporation is reverting to type. Its default position is a narrative in which the Government is failing to provide whatever it is that organised groups of public-sector iniduals – especially the NHS – demand. That is fair enough, but leaves out so much: the needs of other workers, the vital interconnection between public and private sectors, the urgent need to investigate conflicting scientific models.The BBC won’t touch wider questions, such as China’s responsibility for the catastrophe, although it attacks Donald Trump without scruple. Quickly it becomes coercively moralistic, just as it does about climate change.Yesterday morning on the Today programme, Nick Robinson was back doing what he loves best, trying to beat up a government minister. He succeeded, of course, against the decent but inexperienced Helen Whately. It was so sterile. Why didn’t the BBC look into how best to get tests to people faster, instead of scalping Ms Whately?A few minutes earlier, the news bulletin had announced that Boris Johnson, in a message to the nation, had said that “Margaret Thatcher was wrong that there is no such thing as society”. Yet all he actually said – just as David Cameron did a few years back – was: “There is such a thing as society”. Clearly Boris was making a deliberate reference to her famous sentence in order to present himself as a caring Prime Minister, a point that Chris Mason analysed fairly. But the news, as a matter of simple fact, was wrong, and wrong in the way the BBC usually is.In her famous interview, by the way, Mrs Thatcher was making almost exactly the opposite point to what we are told to think. She was trying to show that “society” is not an abstract, but made up by the obligations of each to all. She spoke of “a living tapestry of men and women” – not a bad description of our interconnectedness, which matters so much just now.Should the BBC TV licence fee be scrapped? POLLThere are certain virus phrases of which one can have too much. One is “People are dying…”, as in “People are dying, so how dare you visit your motherdrive to go on a country walksell an Easter egg”, and so on.Yes, people are dying, but you will not do much to stop them dying by self-righteous policing (by citizens or by the authorities) of the most marginal infringements of the rules. People are living, too. The more they are trusted to behave sensibly without snooping and lecturing, the likelier they are to maintain psychological balance and public-spiritedness when panic is a much more prevalent risk than death.Besides, people are not, so far, dying in unusual numbers. Roughly 50,000 people die in Britain each month. Roughly 1,500 have died with Covid-19 (not necessarily of it) this month. Since many of these deaths are of people who were already very ill for other reasons, the normal monthly statistical total has hardly altered. It is probable that the situation will get much worse, but the prevailing view is that the bad trend will not last very long.I spoke to a respected local undertaker recently. He told me that there has as yet been no rise in the number of funerals, but there is a shortage of coffins. In other words, there is what, in other contexts, people call “panic-buying”. Without coffins, body bags may have to be permitted. Unless properly informed, the public will assume the coffin shortage is because “people are dying” in unprecedented quantities. So far, it is not.It has been cheering, in the time of plague, to see pictures of the Queen granting Boris Johnson an audience down the telephone, and of the Duchess of Cambridge launching an initiative to assist mental health during the crisis, also on the phone.Both calls were made from home, of course, so one could see the pleasant backgrounds. The Queen had beside her or on the mantelpiece two statuettes of horses, two of corgis and one of a serviceman. The Duchess was seated at a desk furnished with an elegant uniform edition of hardback books (I couldn’t see the titles) and that nostalgic object, a blotter.One of those off-white numbers from the Seventies where the mouthpiece looks like a small vase for violetsBoth women spoke into telephones attached to wires, a rarity in the age of the mobile and the portable: no chance of either of them pacing up and down as they spoke. The Duchess’s instrument, admittedly, looked as if it might have been born in the 21st century. The Queen, however, was wielding one of those off-white numbers from the Seventies where the mouthpiece looks like a small vase for violets or forget-me-nots and the wire is always getting twisted up. The face of the phone was not visible in the picture, but I like to think it had a circular dial which you revolve, rather than buttons which you stab.Both scenes felt stable and cosy – effects which, in people’s idea of a successful monarchy, are even more important than pomp and circumstance.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

Unfortunately, 3,703 of the infected people are in a critical condition, said  Kianush Jahanpur, a spokesman for the Iranian health ministry. More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus four ways could get lockdown","story":"For example, social distancing could be alternated on a regional basis to give people a rest from draconian restrictions. The Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling, which feeds into the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), has proposed that parts of the country could enjoy greater freedoms for six months at a time, before returning to lockdown.Germany, which is carrying out hundreds of thousands of tests, is planning to give certificates to citizens. If a working cure does become available in the coming weeks or month then lockdown will be lifted far sooner.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus positive good news round up monastery making hand","story":"This crisis has brought about plenty of interesting pivots.Beloved local restaurants offering takeaways for the first time, conference centres turning into hospitals, and the police reinventing themselves as ultra-hardline exercise regulation shame enforcers.The baton has been picked up in Ukraine, where a monastery has become a small-scale hand sanitiser factory.

Every fresh development from international exchange of data is being entered into domestic databases modelling disease distribution and determining drastic defense measures across the globe.Since the revelation of the outbreak in Wuhan in January to the sudden realisation that in a globalised world, fomites cross borders as easily as the wind, while flights connecting every corner of the world conveyed the infected to almost every country, we journeyed from moderate social distancing to complete lockdown in days. So why, as evidence stacks up and the picture twitches in and out of focus, have official Government guidelines to key symptoms failed to be changed since publication?Just over a fortnight ago, back when only the super-cautious evaded public transport or sported makeshift masks, I was in London for a round of meetings. I took the opportunity to go for dinners with old friends, despite feeling under the weather, having passed off general malaise as seasonal lurgy. The only thing that stood out was a complete loss of all taste and smell. My WhatsApp messages from the 11th and 12th of March evidence that I was so astounded by the absolute absence of both senses, I felt compelled to share this development with friends.Back in Brussels after my London stint, what was to be a week before being forced to scramble belongings into boxes to beat border closures falling across the continent like dominoes, sofa-bound with lethargy and dosed up on paracetamol, I took to the internet to see if I could be having a neurological episode. I was devoid of detectable mucus, yet felt a pressing congestion in my nasal passages and couldn’t even detect Vick’s inside my nostrils. This led me to conduct a series of DIY experiments to detect olfactory or gustatory response, with raw garlic, salt and vinegar applied directly onto expected receptors. Google informed me that a common cold dulls the senses, but I already knew that, and I knew that this was different. Not once did ‘Covid-19’ appear.Coronavirus symptoms and compared to other common conditionsIt was only when the friend with whom I had stayed contacted me to tell me he had developed identical symptoms and believed it was mild Covid-19, that I first heard of this connection. His own internet interrogation a week after mine had thrown up startling results. I had probably given him coronavirus. Finding me initially disbelieving, he sent a couple of scholarly articles to back up his claim, including worldwide Google statistics showing an improbable surge in the search terms ‘Loss of Taste’ and ‘Loss of Smell’ in mid-March.Since then, ENT UK, the professional body of Ear, Nose and Throat specialists, has released urgent advice imploring the Government to add anosmia to the list of Covid-19 indicators, particularly when presented without other manifestations of infection. If anybody was going to know anything about losing smell, it would be the Presidents of the British Rhinological Society and ENT UK.This wasn’t just based on increased clinical presentation of these symptoms, although specialists had suddenly seen hundreds of patients present with this problem instead of the previous handful per month, but was backed up by data from every corner of the globe. Evidence from South Korea, China and Italy that significant numbers of patients with proven Covid-19 had developed anosmia and hyposmia was cited, alongside findings from Germany that more than two in three confirmed cases experienced total loss of smell.Since then anecdotal evidence has mushroomed across social media, newspapers around the world have reported on the ENT UK entreaty, and other countries have publicly ascribed these symptoms to Covid-19, with the head of the French health authority adding it to coughing, fever and myalgia on March 20th.In recent days numerous people in my social circle have reported the same. My cousin also conducted his own kitchen trials as has a fellow former Brexit Party MEP. Both feel mildly unwell but with sudden sensory suspension.That week in London, long before lockdown, making light of being unable to taste normally pungent sea urchin in one of the city’s top sushi restaurants, oblivious to what this could mean, I travelled on two tubes, in multiple Ubers, on buses and to two other eating establishments. I am mortified that I could unwittingly have been a super spreader.I now know of dozens of people claiming absolute nullification of these senses and am convinced it cannot be coincidence. Ignoring this potentially critical indicator could cost lives. For the majority of people who do not rabidly scroll through Twitter or fervently follow every news announcement as I do, the onset of anosmia is liable to being dismissed as a cold, an allergy, or a quirk, especially if the sufferer feels fine.I haven’t been tested for Covid-19, nor would I deign to demand a test ahead of the NHS frontline, the vulnerable or a key worker, when tests are so limited. But men and women who can’t smell their morning coffee or taste their Marmite on toast are without doubt on production lines up and down the country, stacking shelves or stocking up in supermarkets and delivering vital supplies to the vulnerable, oblivious that they could be shedding viral loads onto products destined for somebody whose immune system will not respond as effectively as I suspect mine did.On the balance of probability, when overall policy is to quash or avert risk as urgently as possible, I am troubled to have to ask why these symptoms have not been formalised.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

Reminiscent of the 1940s “Don’t you know there’s a war on!”, it’s a phrase that will no doubt fall from the lips of many officials over the coming weeks. But as those weeks stretch into months, the British public must be allowed a little sunbathing if it is to keep its sanity.The severity of the lockdown imposed on the people of this country will make huge demands on their patience and fortitude. Introduced in order to protect the health service and to save the lives thousands of the elderly and frail, the lockdown will nonetheless take a severe toll on the physical and mental health of millions.Current polling shows resounding public support for the measures, but to maintain that support for long enough to have the desired effect, officials at all levels must restrain their desire to emulate ARP Warden Hodges of Dad’s Army, terrorising Walmington-on-Sea with endless petty commands. Setting up hotlines, for people to inform on neighbours suspected of taking two walks a day, might appeal to self-appointed busybodies but will do nothing to build community spirit.The list of over-zealous interpretation of the lockdown laws grows longer by the day. Convenience stores, most of whose proprietors and staff are working flat out to keep the nation fed, complained yesterday that council officials had told them not to stock Easter eggs on the grounds they are “non-essential”. As the stores’ trade body was quick to point out, there is nothing in the regulations to prevent such sales. Of course no one “needs” Easter eggs, but when children cannot see their friends, go on holiday or even use the swings, who would grudge them a chocolate treat?On Saturday, MP Stephen Kinnock tweeted a photo of himself visiting his parents on his father Neil’s 78th birthday, taking food supplies plus a couple of garden chairs so he and his wife could sit in the front garden ten feet away from them and sing happy birthday. The response from South Wales police was to rap Kinnock’s knuckles, tweeting “This is not essential travel”.The Church of England has been telling clergy not to use churches for prayer or funerals, despite the fact that specific exemptions in the lockdown regulations allow them to broadcast online worship from those churches, and indeed to hold funerals (within social distancing rules). Whilst a few imaginative vicars continue to use their churches to pray and send out footage of their worship to their housebound flock, the majority have surrendered to officialdom. In this time of anxiety and spiritual hunger, churches and cathedrals stand empty even of their priests.Out of home activity over timeIf the nation is to retain its health and sanity it must also, as the Government recognises, be allowed to take exercise in the open air. For city dwellers lucky enough to own a car, it is surely reasonable for them to drive into the countryside to take a bracing walk, away from the crowds. Indeed, by so doing they are relieving pressure on urban green space needed by those who lack cars.The law does not preclude such outings, yet it seems the police are determined to clamp down on what they see as frivolity, to the extent that some forces have been setting up road blocks and asking “Is your journey really necessary?” Given that less than 6 per cent of England is built over, it’s hard to argue that there isn’t room in the countryside for us all to take a walk and hear the birds sing.Nor should the construction industry be staging a pre-emptive shutdown. Forcing building companies to go under will not help us house the homeless when this crisis passes. The enthusiastic builders working on the new “Nightingale” Covid hospital suggest that with the application of imagination and common sense, construction work can continue safely with a low risk of infection.With Corbynite enthusiasm for command and control, Labour’s shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth yesterday called for the government to publish a list of essential businesses – and close down all the rest. Labour must not be allowed to win this argument.The great British public have so far shown remarkable solidarity in embracing the lockdown and supporting the beleaguered health service. The Government must not risk that support by stamping on the few small sparks of freedom that remain undimmed. No-one thinks this is a holiday. But we all need a little sunshine.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

But of course he did have a radio, and he heard our conversation yesterday morning discussing the potential increase in domestic abuse cases during this period that families are at home, and he just brought himself into the BBC. “He got up in his pyjamas, put his coat on, packed a bag and arrived on our doorstep… it’s heartbreakingly sad really, to see this sort of young, articulate, intelligent young man who just felt that life was so desperate, he just had to get up and walk away.”Mr Grinnell said that he comforted the boy in “the good old fashioned British way” with a cup of tea, and contacted Devon and Cornwall Police, whose support team arrived at the BBC within 20 minutes. The radio editor added that the schoolboy was “apologetic almost for bringing himself out on the streets at a time when he knew that people were supposed to stay at home, but he just didn’t feel that there was anywhere else he could go”.The BBC has launched a coronavirus helpline and dedicated campaign entitled, ‘Make a Difference’, which has seen more than 100,000 people contacting the service within two weeks.The campaign aims to link up those in need of help with those who can provide it, and marks the biggest ever response the BBC has had to a Local Radio campaign.Make a Difference was launched on all 39 BBC Local Radio stations on March 17 and  gives half hourly updates on how the coronavirus is affecting the local area, offers advice and puts people who need help in touch with volunteers.Mr Grinnell said that the service is not just reaching people who may feel isolated at the moment, but that it has also become “that parish pump and community service noticeboard” during the coronavirus pandemic. Over the weekend, the government published guidance for those who feel at risk of domestic abuse during the COVID-19 outbreak, which highlighted its collaboration with the police and charity sector in order to ensure that support services remain open. However it did not mention children. Emily Hilton, Senior Policy and Public Affairs Officer at the NSPCC, said: “Hundreds of thousands of children are currently living in homes where they experience domestic abuse.“The Government has acknowledged that measures need to be taken to keep vulnerable children safe during this national emergency by keeping them in school. “Yet it was disappointing that the Home Office failed to include children in their recently published domestic abuse COVID-19 Guidance. “As local areas adapt to the new challenges they are facing there must be resources available to them to ensure that professionals feel well equipped to spot the signs of domestic abuse and swiftly take appropriate action.“We can all play our part in this as well by checking in with families however we can and reaching out for support and advice from local authorities or the NSPCC Helpline if we have any concerns for a child’s wellbeing.”Nicole Jacobs, the Domestic Abuse Commissioner for England and Wales, said that Home Secretary Priti Patel has made clear that self-isolation should not come at the cost of peoples’ safety.However she added that charities and helplines are seeing a rise in the numbers of people looking for support, help and advice. “Our concern remains that the options are limited.”More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"watch can get coronavirus twice","story":"We\u0027re constantly learning about how Covid-19 affects the body, the disease which has swept across the world and changed life as we know it. Once you have overcome the disease and it symptoms though, even more questions arise: Am I still infectious?

It can be a fun feature for finding friends to chat to, but it can also very quickly become an irritating one if your phone keeps going off in your pocket.The thing that really sets Houseparty apart from other apps is hinted at by its name. Anyone who’s friends with someone else in a chat can join – meaning that you’re likely to run into strangers – and it is not necessarily easy to lurk without being noticed.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBoth features make the app prone to more surprising encounters than other more direct chat apps like FaceTime or Skype. But they can also very quickly make it a more annoying and confusing experience.Thankfully there are easy ways to fix such problems: with a few changes of settings, and some important menus, you can make the app considerably less frustrating.When can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsWhich countries around the world has coronavirus spread to?Listen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus PodcastFrom the very moment you open Houseparty, you are on and live, and anyone can conceivably join you for a conversation. The app is built around this idea: opening the app is less like heading into a lobby and looking to call the person you want to meet, and more like wandering into a houseparty and waiting to see who might be hanging around and ready to talk.That same structure applies to everyone you are chatting with, too, which can be anyone from your phone’s contacts, or your Facebook and Snapchat account. You might be in a serious conversation with your colleagues, for instance, but without some changes your friend may be alerted and opt to join in that same chat, too.So the first thing to note is that it is important to be careful with who you add on the app. More than with other apps, anyone you are friends with has the ability not just to see that you are online, but to interact with you without much warning, too.But there appears to be no way of stopping people being notified when you first sign up. Though you’ll be able to deny their friend request if they send one, there’s not any easy way to ensure they don’t see the message and try and add you in the first place.For the same reason, it is important to lock any conversation that you don’t want unexpected people jumping into. That’s done relatively easily, by clicking the little lock icon at the bottom of the chat once everyone you want to be online is available, but you need to remember to do that every time.But perhaps the most important thing about the app is to fix the notifications that it sends out. As a user of Houseparty, you will both be sent plenty of notifications and have plenty of notifications sent about you – and both can be very annoying.Thankfully, it’s easy enough to turn either of those notifications off. That’s done by opening the app and clicking the smiley face in the corner of the screen – there, you’ll see the option to “Manage Notificatications”, and clicking that gives you the ability to stop them being sent when you open the app or being sent to you when somebody else does the same.On both Android and iOS, you can of course also simply switch off all Houseparty notifications entirely. But that will mean that you won’t even receive a notification if someone calls you, and you’ll still be sending out notifications to other people, too.You can also change these settings on a per-person basis. If you scroll down a little on the notifications screen, you’ll see the option to “mute” or “ghost” any given person.Ghosting them means that they won’t see when you come online, which might be useful for anyone who continually tries to join you when you don’t want them to. Muting somebody means you won’t get notifications when they come online, which might be a good setting for anyone who keeps logging on and making your phone buzz.Perhaps the most hidden feature on Houseparty is also one of its most useful, too. If you hold down the app icon, you’ll get the option to “sneak in” to Houseparty, meaning that you’ll open it up and be on the app without sending a notification to everyone.You will still be online, however, and can be joined like normal.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The trait differentiates us from our closest living ape relatives: chimpanzees, gorillas and orangutans.But new research based on analysis of fossil leg bones, provides evidence that a hominin species believed to be either Paranthropus robustus – which lived between 1 and 3 million years ago – or early Homo sapiens, regularly adopted highly flexed hip joints, a posture that in other non-human apes is associated with climbing trees.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThese findings came from analysing and comparing the internal bone structures of two fossil leg bones from South Africa, discovered over 60 years ago.For both fossils, the external shape of the bones were very similar, showing a more human-like than ape-like hip joint, suggesting they were both walking on two legs.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.The 25 most remarkable animal pictures of the past decade Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.825 2010: A Marvel of Ants1125 2015: Tale of Two Foxes1425 2017: Pikin and Appolinaire1925 2017: Memorial to a Species2325 2018: Bed of Seals2425 2019: Land of the Eagle825 2010: A Marvel of Ants1125 2015: Tale of Two Foxes1425 2017: Pikin and Appolinaire1925 2017: Memorial to a Species2325 2018: Bed of Seals2425 2019: Land of the EagleThe researchers examined the internal bone structure because it remodels during life based on how iniduals use their limbs.\u0026nbspUnexpectedly, when the team analysed the inside of the spherical head of the femur, it showed that they were loading their hip joints in different ways.The research project was led by Dr Leoni Georgiou, Dr Matthew Skinner and Professor Tracy Kivell at the University of Kent‘s School of Anthropology and Conservation, and included a large international team of biomechanical engineers and palaeontologists.\u0026nbspThey said the results demonstrate how novel information about human evolution can be hidden within fossil bones and can alter our understanding of when, where and how we became the humans we are today.Ancient human ancestor homo erectus survived far longer than thoughtAlcohol tolerance ‘may have kept humanity’s ancestors from extinction’Scientists reveal the face of our oldest direct ancestor Tiny T rex: Ancestor to the king of the dinosaurs discoveredDr Georgiou said: “It is very exciting to be able to reconstruct the actual behaviour of these iniduals who lived millions of years ago and every time we CT scan a new fossil it is a chance to learn something new about our evolutionary history.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Evidence has been sparse, controversial and not widely accepted, and as we have shown in this study the external shape of bones can be misleading.\u0026nbsp“Further analysis of the internal structure of other bones of the skeleton may reveal exciting findings about the evolution of other key human behaviours such as stone tool making and tool use.\u0026nbspOur research team is now expanding our work to look at hands, feet, knees, shoulders and the spine.”The research paper “Evidence for habitual climbing in a Pleistocene hominin in South Africa” is published in the journal PNAS.University of Kent\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

People who previously struggled with universal credit continue to do so. Rough sleepers and sofa surfers continue to live without shelter. Services that once offered support have shuttered to protect workers, while people are burning through their kitchen cupboards faster than usual because they are stuck inside.\u0026nbspIn short, many of those who have needed to use food banks in the past, those who are not among the government’s 1.5 million most at-risk people and will not be able to call on its swelling volunteer service for support, still need help.\u0026nbspThe Independent’s Help The Hungry campaign aims to help give these people the support they need. Click here for ways you can help.And here are five things you might not have considered to help you to support your community’s food bank.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesA common misconception is that food banks exist to offer the bare minimum – but to do so would be to completely undermine what food can give us in our day to day lives. We don’t only eat for sustenance – we do it for pleasure, to access our cultures, to engage in tradition. Food is central to the human experience, and for millennia has been key to how we experience love and affection.How to support our campaignSo ultimately think about what is going to taste good. Of course you can pick up staples that will be warmly received, but you can also donate things that get you excited, and share that excitement with someone else.Take, for example, Easter eggs. They may not be a matter of life or death, but by donating them you can give a parent the chance to treat their child, and a child the ability to engage in a communal tradition they might have been left out of. You are not just handing out subsistence, but a moment of dignity and joy for a family – and all it took was a bit of chocolate.It’s not just foodFood banks have never been just about food. Poverty is about choices – do you buy something to eat, or put money on the meter to keep the electricity running? Do you really need the heating on, or can you hold out? Will you be hungry now, or hungry later?\u0026nbspAt their most fundamental level, food banks are about a community pulling together and trying to resolve those conflicts – so when you think of donating, empathy is key. On one side of the spectrum, this means not just dredging mystery tins from the back of your cupboard – if you didn’t want to eat it over the last two years, chances are no one else will either. On the other, it’s about thinking of the groceries you couldn’t live without – be that food or something else.In the early days of the UK epidemic, among the first things to be stockpiled were hygiene products – sanitary towels, hand wash, toilet roll. If you didn’t have the ability to bulk buy, or the spare funds to travel from shop to shop by car or public transport, you were stuck. Donating bathroom products means people who use the service don’t have to choose between hunger and hygiene.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailThe range of reasons people visit food banks is vast, reflecting many of the social issues seen across the country, from universal credit delays to limited post-prison rehabilitation systems, rising rents and jobs that simply do not pay enough to allow for survival.\u0026nbspBut helping rough sleepers and sofa surfers out represents a unique challenge for food banks – particularly those who do not have access to kitchens and so are less likely to feel the benefit of, say, the bag of dry pasta many would receive. While volunteers will build a parcel that helps as much as possible, you can go a step further by putting together boxes of much-needed items that can be handed straight over as is.\u0026nbspAsk if your local service is interested, then get a few shoeboxes and add things that might prove useful – like socks and underwear, first aid kits, compact waterproofs, or toothbrushes and paste. Once again as much as you are donating a small box of odds and ends, you are also handing over dignity, and the tools people need to look after themselves.\u0026nbspBags of bagsFood banks across the country have had to make drastic changes to how they operate due to the virus – while volunteers may have a few contingency plans up their sleeves to keep services running, readying for a global pandemic was not among them.What has followed has been a herculean effort to organise outright change in a matter of days. Entire delivery systems have been dreamt up out of thin air, while the elderly and at risk who make up much of the volunteer base have been sent home.\u0026nbspFood banks strained as volunteers isolate and demand surgesFood banks have never been more needed, or closer to collapseFood banks in crisis as coronvirus panic buying leaves families hungryFood banks are under threat – the government has to step inUnited and City make joint food bank donation to fight coronavirusOperations have also been streamlined to feed as many people as possible, as hygienically as can be achieved. And as every service user’s food is bagged up and handed over, a small mountain of plastic bags are being deployed.So, bizarrely enough, in this time of national crisis, that bag of shopping bags that you and every other UK resident has been keeping in the corner of their kitchen or under their sink for years might finally serve a purpose. After all that time of being stored and neglected after trips to the supermarket, they could be put to use in ensuring social distancing.\u0026nbspAsk your local food bank if they could use them – but if you can go a step further and also feel a little apprehensive about contributing to the impact of plastic on the planet, consider handing over canvas bags instead. There are so many feelings wrapped into asking for help – and when you’ve been let down by the world around you time and time again, one that’s likely to come up is shame.\u0026nbspVolunteers work hard to try to mitigate that – and make the experience about support and community, but it’s easy to feel self-conscious walking away from a food bank and onto the high street with an array of clearly worn and mismatched carrier bags in your hands. A canvas bag, while sturdier, is also more discreet.Possibly the most useful thing you can do for your local food bank is among the easiest – ask what they need. While the Trussell Trust, the nation’s largest food bank charity, helps to set up and support sites, the inidual operation in your region sets its own rules and runs its own show. Others run via other charities or completely independently.\u0026nbspSo check out their tweets to see what they are appealing for, or send them an email to check what they are after, or give them a call and offer up a few hours a week to stack some tins (particularly if you are young, physically fit and don’t mind lugging around crates of produce).\u0026nbspReaching out, at every level, is fundamental to what food banks are. In reaching out you will get the satisfaction that comes from rallying around your community at a time where we’ve perhaps never been more isolated. What the person who comes to ask for food will get, from your contribution combined with others in your area coming together, is help when it’s possible no one else can.Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But they were being very naughty.”The following day, Mr Stuart noted the goats were “back, and gathering in groups of more than two”.He continued to document the goats’ movements throughout the weekend, eventually writing a post echoed by many, declaring: “I, for one, welcome our new goat overlords.”“Growing up in Llandudno, I always knew the Great Orme mountain goats would be ones to take over in the event of any future apocalyptic dystopia,” said Jeanna Skinner, writing on Twitter.\u0026nbspAnother Twitter user wrote: “And so it came to pass that the Great Orme goats captured Llandudno and all who saw them did tremble at their might.”While the goats are fairly regular uninvited guests in the town,\u0026nbsphaving even faced a cull in the 1990s,\u0026nbspthere appears to be a general consensus that\u0026nbsplockdown\u0026nbsphas encouraged them to roam further\u0026nbspthan usual.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They usually only come down from the Great Orme when it’s windy, and only the backstreets at the top of Mostyn Street. Now lockdown means it’s empty, they’re going further than ever.”The goats of Llandudno are not the only animals taking advantage of the absence of humans to venture more often into\u0026nbsptypically bustling towns and cities.Wild boars have been spotted in Barcelona, ducks were filmed\u0026nbspstraying\u0026nbspfrom the Seine to roam the streets of Paris,\u0026nbspand a puma was captured by authorities in the Chilean capital, Santiago.

We have teamed up with The Felix Project – a start-up charity we helped launch in 2016 – to deliver produce to community hubs in London boroughs.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Independent is also asking food charities across Britain to contact helpthehungry@ to tell us about your project and help build a directory of ways that our readers can help the hungry in their area – through money, volunteering and food donations. Food banks, which were already struggling to meet the need for emergency food parcels, have seen a huge surge in demand in recent weeks, while at the same time coping with dwindling donations, supermarket rationing systems, and a loss of many volunteers to self-isolation – yet none of the government’s rescue money goes to them.British households have stored more than £1bn worth of goods in their homes in response to the pandemic, creating shortages for food banks as shoppers ignore assurances that supply chains are robust.How to support our campaignJess Phillips, the Labour MP who recently ran for party leader, has backed our campaign, saying: “Nobody should be in the position of not being able to get enough food. In my constituency, London and in places all around the UK the coronavirus pandemic is placing extra stress on a system that was already straining.“We should all do what we can to help food and other essentials get to those that need it. That is why I’m backing the Help the Hungry campaign – please give if you are able.”Pastor Obi Onyeabor, the manager at Barking Foodbank, part of The Trussell Trust’s national network, said his pool of around 50 volunteers has been reduced by a dozen or so people currently self-isolating at home. Yet he and his team have kept their two church hall food banks open, and are now making home deliveries on Tuesdays and Thursdays to make sure the most vulnerable get supplies.“We have been scrambling for the past couple of weeks, doing all that we can – but we’re appealing for more people to come and help,” he said. “Out of fear people have been buying for themselves and their families, but I’ve seen some real generosity too.“I hope that if we can get past the panic buying stage, more people will want to give money, food or some of their time too.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But funding has dropped since the outbreak of Covid-19, limiting their capacity to carry out vital work at a time when it is more important than ever. As part of the London Food Alliance, along with FareShare and City Harvest, The Felix Project will coordinate deliveries in London boroughs in order to distribute surplus food to the elderly, poor and vulnerable. The charities will deliver food to the hubs, where local volunteers will package up parcels and arrange “last-mile” deliveries to the homes of the vulnerable.Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, has backed our campaign to help in the capital in partnership with our sister title the Evening Standard. He said: “In a city as prosperous as London, everyone should have enough food to feed themselves and their families – but unfortunately the coronavirus outbreak means some Londoners are facing even greater difficulties. It’s commendable these organisations are joining forces to help ensure surplus food isn’t wasted and instead reaches those who need it most. I urge Londoners to support this crucial initiative.”Mark Curtin, CEO of The Felix Project, said: “Our role is to pick up large volumes of nutritious surplus food from the commercial sector and deliver it to community hubs to ensure there is enough food for vulnerable people for as long as this health crisis ensues. We will be working all hours doing our bit – and it would be wonderful if your readers can get behind us so we can do this job for London.”Emma Revie, chief executive of The Trussell Trust, which supports 1,200 food banks, appealed for help from the public to get vital food to people who cannot afford the basics, and to boost volunteer numbers in areas where they are needed.\u0026nbsp“Our main priority as coronavirus unfolds is ensuring the safety of everyone who comes to a food bank – whether it’s someone needing help, someone volunteering their time, or someone making a donation,” said Ms Revie. “Until we are confident that adequate government protection against poverty is in place, food banks provide an essential community service to people unable to afford food. But this should not fall to food banks.\u0026nbsp“Our benefits system could be the life raft people need now. That’s why it’s more important than ever that we end the five-week wait for universal credit. While incredible food bank volunteers continue to help people unable to afford the basics, we would ask our government to take this essential step and end the five-week wait now. It’s five weeks too long.”Sabine Goodwin, coordinator of the Independent Food Aid Network UK, which oversees 834 independent food banks, said the charitable services were “struggling to stay above water” in the current climate and accused the government of so far “failing to act” to prevent an ever-increasing number of people falling into poverty.“Food bank use was rising before the coronavirus outbreak and the impact of job losses can only make matters far worse. But this catastrophe in the making is avoidable,” she said. “We’re calling for an income-based solution to this crisis which would mean that the Herculean efforts by volunteers across the country wouldn’t be needed.“FareShare, the UK’s biggest food redistribution charity, is also calling for more volunteers to help with packing and making van deliveries. The organisation takes food from the food manufacturers that can’t be sold in shops, either because of packaging errors or overproduction, and gets it out to food banks, hospices, homeless hostels and other charities.Commercial director Alyson Walsh estimates around 1,200 people have got in touch over the past week. “We have quite a lot of older volunteers who have had to stay at home, but we are now seeing a wave of interest in new people willing to fill in.”Ms Walsh added: “We know we have the capacity to do more – we have the warehouse\u0026nbspspace and the chillers. But the government needs to help the food industry do more in terms of all the bagging and boxing and delivery of food that needs to be done.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It follows several walkouts at US Amazon warehouses, with workers complaining of unsafe working conditions and claiming that the company has been less than transparent about the spread of Covid-19 cases through its workforce.Also striking are workers at grocery delivery company Instacart. All three companies are facing an unprecedented spike in demand as three in every four Americans enter stay-at-home mode to stop the spread of coronavirus, and accordingly turn to online companies to deliver grocery and essentials.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAmong its more specific demands are guaranteed paid leave for workers who quarantine or self-isolate, funding for coronavirus testing and treatment, hazard pay during scheduled hours, and hazard pay during scheduled hours.When can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsWhich countries around the world has coronavirus spread to?Listen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus PodcastAlso on the list of demands is the “immediate shutdown of any location where a worker tests positive for COVID-19.

Employees in Louisiana and California reported receiving automated voicemail messages telling them a colleague had been diagnosed.On its website, Whole Foods says that “our team members are our top priority”, and that it has offered workers increased hourly wages, social distancing guidelines, and enhanced overtime pay. It is also offering two weeks’ additional paid leave to workers who are diagnosed or quarantined, though it does not refer to those who choose to isolate or self-quarantine.Among other things, they called on the company to provide paid time off for full- and part-time employees unable to work because their child’s school is closed or because their usual child carer is diagnosed with Covid-19.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Normally such extensions would need approval by Hungary’s parliament.\u0026nbspIt has also introduced jail terms of up to five years for “distorting” facts and spreading misinformation that hampers the government’s efforts to contain the outbreak, raising concern that it could lead to censorship.Justice minister Judit Varga dismissed all criticism of the new powers as unfounded, saying the law’s scope is “limited” and envisions only “necessary and proportionate measures” to fight Covid-19.\u0026nbspZoltan Kovacs, an international spokesman of the Hungarian government, said: “Each and every country is trying to use the best methods and measures according to their own needs and framework.\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

After first announcing a “state of emergency for mass immigration” following the 2015 refugee crisis, his anti-immigrant party has repeatedly renewed the legislation, even as the number of asylum seekers arriving in Hungary has fallen.Timea Szabo, an opposition lawmaker from the Dialogue for Hungary Party, said that there was no trust in the government.“If you look at the past 10 years, they’ve used their power to curb democracy and the rule of law,” he said. “So we need some kind of guarantee that they’re not going to do that again.“If all the countries in Europe could introduce similar laws with a time limit, then I believe that a Hungarian government should do that as well.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The products are unrelated to coronavirus, said a diplomatic source.“That’s not to say that the mechanism couldn’t be used to help with the pandemic effort in Iran,” they said.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThough unrelated, the sale could help alleviate pressure on a public health system reeling under the impact of an outbreak, which has officially killed nearly 2,900 people in Iran, infected at least 44,000 and at its peak was causing a fatality every 10 minutes.The deal also bolsters prospects for the survival of Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), the 2015 nuclear deal established by Iran and world powers to curtail Iran’s atomic technology ambitions. But it potentially heightens tensions with the US\u0026nbspover Iran.\u0026nbspThe German foreign ministry announced on Tuesday that Instex had “successfully concluded its first transaction”, facilitating the export of “medical goods” from Europe to Iran.\u0026nbspHundreds die in Iran after drinking methanol as fake coronavirus cureIran’s leader suggests US cooked up ‘special version’ of coronavirusOne dead every 10 minutes in Iran: health ministryNazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe temporarily released from Iran prisonIran asks for IMF help for first time in decades as coronavirus ragesUS sanctions on Iran are causing coronavirus to spread“These goods are now in Iran,” said a press release by the UK Foreign Office.The name of the companies involved remains “confidential”, said the diplomatic source.Instex, which includes nine European nations as shareholders, was set up as a way to circumvent draconian sanctions on Iran imposed by the United States after the administration of\u0026nbspDonald Trump withdrew from the JCPOA.The deal gave Iran relief from international financial restrictions in exchange for limits on its nuclear programme. It is meant to conduct non-cash bartering transactions with its Iranian counterpart, called the Special Trade and Finance Institute (STFI).\u0026nbsp“Now that Instex has passed the hurdle of its first transaction we’re hoping the second transaction will happen soon,” said the diplomatic source.\u0026nbspAs US\u0026nbsptrade restrictions damaged Iran’s economy, Tehran began ramping up its nuclear programme, though it has yet to end its cooperation with international inspectors watching over sensitive facilities.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It is what a government should do, but only when faced with a le-or-death situation. It is not a sane strategy for normal times.What the old dunce cannot grasp is that such gargantuan bailouts will need to be paid back by years of tax rises and further austerity. If he wants credit for the spending, will he also accept responsibility for that future hardship No, we didn’t think so.Corbyn will be remembered as Labour’s worst-ever leader, the architect of their most abject defeat in  years. He drew anti-Semites like flies to dung. He repelled decent Labour MPs and voters.Only leftie cranks and Tories will miss him.IN six weeks as Chancellor, Rishi Sunak has saved an estimated .million jobs and bailed out Britain.

I’ve been wasting my le really, so I’ll stay in bed.”Everyone thinks their job is important, so everyone went to work, and this meant that in London especially, the public transport system was rammed full of commuters. This made everyone very angry.I don’t want to blame anyone for what’s going on. If you shut a country down overnight there are bound to be issues. It’s no one’s fault.I do, however, have a helpful suggestion for people who really do need to get to work. A suggestion that no one will have considered. It’s a means of transport that’s virus proof.You can’t be infected when you’re inside it and you can’t pass your infection on to anyone . It’s called the “motor car”.For years, successive leaders and politicians have done their best to squeeze it out of society.They’ve lowered the speed limits and raised the taxes and ­introduced congestion charging and even suggested, hilariously, thatyou ­absolutely must have one, it should have an electric motor.

I know this flies in the face of what the eco-mentalists say is good for us but buses are petri dishes so park them at the depot.Trains and the Tube are no better, so turn off the power immediately. In the last three months of last year, million people in this country had jobs. And that’s handy because at the last count there were million cars registered for use on the road.This means that everyone can get to their place of work, safely, in a virus-proof cocoon. Strange isn’t it. For years we were told that cars would one day kill us all. But now it’s obvious that actually, they are our knights in shining armour.I only ask because the phone she was using looked like it was from about .Who was she calling  Dial-a-Disc WHILE scrolling through my phone the other day I was interested to read that I could increase my immunity to coronavirus by taking more vitamin C.Then I was told I would not catch itI stared for two hours every day at a picture of Charlize Theron.Later, I received news from someone whose neighbour’s aunt lives next door to a doctor’s cleaning lady that I should drink my own urine.But I was quickly distracted by someone  whose hairdresser had hacked the World Health Organisation and found that under no circumstances should I eat anything containing vitamin C. Or look at Ms Theron.And then I remembered something Important. Every single thing on the internet is b******s.But there’s one small problem.How do you reach anything on the shelves AS I write, the whole world is trying to work out why Germany is doing so much better with the coronavirus than everywhere .The bald figures are certainly intriguing. In Britain, . per cent of people who catch the disease go on to die. In Italy, it’s a terrying nine per cent. Whereas in Germany, it’s . percent.Experts have claimed that the epidemic started there in the Baian Alps, so the people it affected were young, fit skiing enthusiasts. Who barely noticed they had it.Others have pointed to the fact that Germany has many more beds for critically ill patients than Italy. And a HELL of a lot more than the UK.Then there’s testing. For months German medics have been testing the sort of numbers the rest of the world can only dream about. I wonder, however,anyone has considered this: The Germans do well . . .  because they are German.I was once told by a professor at Rome University that: “You can have as many laws as you like in Italy. Just so long as they are not enforced.”So, when the government there first told everyone to go home and stay there, they simply carried on riding around on their Vespas and kissing everyone.It’s the same story in Britain. We were told to stay at home but because the sun was out, we all hit the park for a picnic.The Germans are dferent. You tell Wolfgang that he must wash his hands every  minutes and he will wash his hands every  minutes. You tell him to go home and he will do so, immediately.It’s probably considered racist to talk about national characteristics these days. But in these troubled times I’m going to plough on regardless and say thatwe want to survive, we’ve got to be a bit more German. And for once, do as we are told.Which I’m told is an important ­ingredient in a building project.WE keep being told that the supermarkets will be able to keep up with our demand for food. But I seriously doubt that.I was told this week that the supplier providing my farm with veg seeds had closed. And because he had no delivery drivers, he was dumping his stock.I’ve now found a replacement and I will be getting them in the ground next week. But who will harvest them in three months, when the people who normally do this kind of thing are stuck in Latvia  Students  Fat chance.To make matters worse, a lot of peppers, tomatoes, cucumbers and courgettes you buy come from Spain.And who, right now, in this locked-down country, is planting them, and packing them and taking them to the docks or the airport  Still, there is some good news.Vegetarians will be forced to abandon their idiocy and start to eat meat. Lamb looks like a good bet. Because all the restaurants and pubs are shut, and exports are tricky, prices have more than halved in the past seven days.Bloody annoying for me as a sheep farmer.

The -year-old commander knows all too well what le is like on lockdown.He spent a year and a half living in a tiny tin can in close proximity to his crew.And he has some good tips for not going stir crazy.Obviously the space station astronauts had a lot of work and experiments to do, but that did not take up all of their time. And like the rest of us, they needed to keep busy.Scott has lots of common-sense advice for coping with being cooped up.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.First of all, we need to have a routine. We have to make sure we get up at the same time every morning and that we get washed and dressed and make our beds. We also need a regular bedtime.Scott says you have to get outside at least once a day — we can do that on earth — while also folowing the rules.You need to schedule times to talk to family and friends and have proper meal times.Exercise is vital. Our very own spaceman, Tim Peake, trained and completed a marathon on a running machine when he was part of the crew on the Space Station.Not all of us are fit enough to run -odd miles, but we can use this time to improve stamina and energy levels. I’m still doing my exercise classes with instructor Maxine Jones on her YouTube channel, and I will be starting virtual yoga with my daughter Rosie, who is in Singapore.I was surprised to learn Scott took actual books, not ebooks, into space.But he said holding a real book in his hands meant he could become completely absorbed, and concentration was not interrupted by messages pinging on his iPad.One of the most interesting things he said was to keep a journal of these strange times.It is more than just jotting down what you got up to that day. You need to go deeper and describe your hopes, fears and state of mind, and also what you hope to achieve when this is all over.One of the things Scott valued most during his long stint in space was video calls with family and friends. And he says one of the silver linings of this crisis is time to reconnect with loved ones.I know exactly what he means. I have been spending hours in WhatsApp chats with Rosie, my best friend Joyce, who is in lockdown in Spain, and my mum in East Kilbride.We chat about everythingand it lts my spirits. Scott’s other sensible advice is to get your information from the experts — and he advises against relying on the internet.He is right. Social media is stuffed with misinformed people and mad conspiracy ­theories.I was shocked to realise how some teens don’t watch any news outlets or read newspapers. They get their “news” from Facebook.They also think they are invincible, which is why we saw those packed beaches and parks this time last week.This was partly because they were unaware of the need for “social distancing” but also because they think it won’t happen to them.But Scott’s most important message to all of us is about working together.“All people are inescapably connected and the more we can come together to solve our problems, the better off we will be.“I’ve seen humans work together to prevail over the toughest challenges imaginable, and I know we can prevail over this one,we all do our part and work together as a team.”Well, I would urge you all to listen to Scott.If we can put a man on the moon then we can beat this awful virus. It won’t be easy but I have faith in science.And as long as we obey the rules, and make some sacrices, we WILL overcome.NO matter what you think of him, it would be churlish not to wish Boris Johnson a speedy recovery.But my sympathies are with Carrie Symonds, who is due to give birth in three months. She’s in isolation at a time when she needs his support.My thoughts are with all expectant parents now, bringing babies into a world we barely recognise and unable to be together in the delivery room. It will be bittersweet for all of them.ONE part of the world untouched by Covid- is my spiritual homeland of Antarctica.I visited the great white wilderness three years ago and cannot wait to .Aside from astronauts, the men and women who man the science bases in Antarctica – particularly the station at the South Pole – are well used to being in isolation while living on top of one another.Which is exactly what most of us are doing right now.Living space is limited at the Pole, and there’s no escaping the other  human beings holed up at the station for the full Antarctic winter.It’s virtually pitch black for six months and you can’t really go outside apart from short bursts of vital scientic work.Most are in danger of becoming “toasty”, which is their description of going stir-crazy.Being cramped, isolated and without proper personal boundaries and “me time” can make you cranky, short-tempered and irritated by the smallest things.In order for us all to avoid toastiness during these strange times, I’d recommend a few rules, some of which were given to me by a hardy survivor of winter at the extreme south.Have a sanctuary, evenit is just in the toilet reading your newspaper and doing the crossword.If you are feeling at the end of your tether, don’t bottle it up.Talk about your feelings and listen to what others in the house with you are saying.You might very well be annoying them as much as they are driving you up the wall.It’s early days, and this is a marathon and not a sprint.Unlike those at the Pole, at least we can still go outside and enjoy the sunshine and the heat as well as the light.I’VE got a Star Trek version of Monopoly and I’m wonderingit is too soon to bring it out from the back of the cupboard.I’ve never actually got to the end of a game of Monopoly and I reckon this might just be the only time that will ever happen.I’m also going to start watching Game Of Thrones for the first time, which should keep me going for a couple of weeks. Any other suggestions for box sets gratefully received.I’M sure all dog owners would agree that our fantastic, loyal, loveable pets are keeping us sane right now. I don’t know what I would doI couldn’t take Angus for a walk once a day.It’s not just a chance to get out in the fresh air and do some exercise, which is good for our physical and mental health, but it’s having something that takes your mind off the current state of the world.When I’m playing with Angus I can almost forget those feelings of anxiety that creep up on all of us and simply enjoy his energy and enthusiasm.He needs to be fed and watered and taken care of, and that gives me a much-needed sense of purpose.It’s a proven fact that just having a dog in the house to cuddle boosts your well-being and cuts stress levels.I don’t know what I would do without him.IT has never been more vital for all of us to receive clear-headed analysis and news we can trust.That’s why it’s so important you continue to buy your Sun every day.There’s a free delivery offer for those unable to get to the shops and of course there’s our splendid online version.We need to be well informed about the latest, fast-moving events and have all the facts to best protect ourselves and our families.Thank you for your loyalty and, as always, for your comments and feedback.

Then suddenly, since Monday, we are not.It’s not even been a week since the new normal for all of us is to stay put.I am guessing that for most of us, it feels like twice that. For many of us, being unable to roam freely is the stuff of nightmares.Still, although it’s been a hard week, I am feeling fortunate. Others I know are really struggling, but I’m very lucky to have a house, a job and the basics in my fridge. But my goodness, it’s boring staying at home all the time, isn’t it At the moment more or less every day is the same. I get up, do conference calls, watch the news and go to bed.But I have been trying to do a few things dferently. For fear of my muscles atrophyingI have started using an exercise video.That may sound normal to you but for me, this is staggering. It’s one from the s and is really quite funny and ­dficult at the same time.I’ve also been more studious than usual and have been doing online lectures for my master’s degree.I have put in the hours with a TV show called This Is Us.And I’ve been cooking up a storm — making increasingly inventive recipes with bits and bobs from the back of the store cupboard because the idea of getting a supermarket delivery slot feels like a fantasy so I have not even bothered to try. I cook whatever my corner shop has in stock, which sadly is not a lot.I know many supermarkets are prioritising elderly and vulnerable shoppers, which is right and proper. And I really hope that the people who are hoarding and stockpiling out of fear soon realise that they don’t need to do that.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.Friends who work in the food ­industry have repeatedly told me there is no issue with supply.Especiallypeople continue to go to their local shops, which should still be stocked — and which need their custom.I am nine days into my -day self-isolating as I am still waiting to see my dad, who is recovering from cancer.And, like many others, I’m focused on the importance of being absolutely certain I am ­infection-free before I even think of going to see him and my mum.So really, I’m just sitting it out. But gosh, it’s tedious.One of the biggest changes for me is not being able to go out or see my friends. But on Friday night we had a Skype party. We all got out a bottle of wine, and I even washed my hair before we had a laugh.We are also playing the game Psych — which is great fun and played on your mobile with your mates.It’s made me realise how many of the things I blithely took for granted as being my inalienable right have changed — literally overnight.And I don’t know whether it’s a good or bad thing that my kids aren’t home with me. I’m pretty sure my daughter has already had coronavirus but happily she seems fine now.But I obviously can’t see her other than on video phone as I am isolating. And boy, do I miss her.My son, meanwhile, is with his housemates in Buckingham. They seem fine — working out in their garden gym, making meals together and playing Xbox. In fact, it’s just another day for him.I know there are people reading this who are genuinely struggling and having a seriously hard time with being isolated, who are worried about loss of income, about elderly or vulnerable relatives, or who are stuck at home with ­dficult or even violent people.It is hard to reflect on anything when we are in the middle of it.We have to focus on getting through a day at a time knowing there will be plenty of time to learn lessons when this has passed.We’ll no doubt start from the basics, like being hyper-vigilant about which animals enter the food chain, scrupulous hand-washing and reassessing our attitude towards travel — something we’ve all taken for granted for so long.We will also focus on building the NHS back up. Just as we built nuclear deterrents to protect ourselves against war, we have to protect ourselves from the ious viruses that we now know are, increasingly, out there.Yes, the important thing is the here and now. We’ve seen unprecedented events this week alone, with the PM Boris Johnson,Health Secretary Matt Hancock and Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty all self-isolating after either testing positive or showing symptoms of the virus.But what is vital is the long-term strategy to fight another attack like this in the future.And in the meantime, apart from feeling a bit cooped up, all in all I am pretty much doing OK with self-isolating.Apart from one thing — I can’t find any hair dye to cover my grey hair, for love nor money. Now that really is a nightmare.ASbeing stuck at home wasn’t hard enough, sports fans are having to get through this time without any football.Now that’s what I call adding insult to injury.As fans will already know, all football has been postponed until April . But behind the scenes, all football clubs, including mine, are doing whatever it takes to ensure the season finishes.I think everyone understands that our priority has to be the safety and good health of our players and the fans. So, while matches are not being played, players are doing all they can to stay fit and well so they are ready whenever it’s time to resume games.Meanwhile, the stadiums, training grounds and offices are all shut.Then, after April , we hope matches can recommence, behind closed doorsrequired.In the meantime, it’s a waiting game. So here’s hoping you’ve got some old Match Of The Day shows lined up to while away your time.ONE thing about us all having to stay at home is that it’s giving celebrities nowhere to hide in terms of what they have got to offer the world.They are on their own at home, with nothing much to do, just like us.Some – Joe Wicks teaching PE to the nation’s primary school kids every morning, Carol Vorderman holding online maths classes or Richard E Grant reading from the script of Withnail And I – are trying hard to provide the nation with useful entertainment.And then there are others. Instagram is also peppered with images of reality TV and soap stars in extremely scanty underwear.Without the props of stylists, red carpets and paparazzi shots, we see them for what they really are.Human beings, just like us.AS a week of firsts comes to a close, athletes and sports fans alike were further disappointed by the announcement that the Olympics have been postponed.Something that only a few weeks ago would have seemed unimaginable now feels, clearly, like the only sensible thing to do.Apart from the logistics involved with quarantine and uncertainty about travel restrictions, some athletes cannot train while some can, which, when the integrity of the sport is at stake, is fundamentally unfair.ANYONE  bored  With This Is Us my current favourite thing to watch, I’ve compiled a list of some other fab shows, just in case you’ve finished Succession and need some inspiration.Here goes – The Crown, Ozark, Luther, Line Of Duty, Sense, Grace And Frankie, Schitt’s Creek, Sex Education, Messiah, Spinning Out, Unbelievable and Mum.I WAS so moved by the nation overriding the old stf upper lip mentality to stand on their doorsteps to give NHS workers a round of applause on Thursday night.And then I read a tweet from a nurse saying that literally as the nation were clapping, she had received an email from her employers advising her not to travel to work in unorm or display her work ID.This is because some people have been mugged for these items and the very scant privilege – like an early supermarket slot – that they bring.Come on, people – sort it out. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

People think mice are a lot better, but in some ways mice are more dangerous. If you develop a flu-like illness seven to  days after contact with fresh surface water or with rats, visit your GP and explain you may have been exposed to the disease.And its not just Weils disease that vermin can bring into your homes.Mice also carry a virus which a man in China just died of called hantavirus, which is primarily an American virus but it’s a new virus in the UK, Peter explains. Mice in the UK have been found to have that virus.People infected with hantavirus will show symptoms including fever, bleeding and kidney damage, according to experts from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention.Early symptoms can also include exhaustion, vomiting and reddish cheeks.“On top of what’s going around at the moment, it’s even more important to eliminate rodents and not let them run riot, Peter says. If you get coronavirus and then get something from rats as well, it might be trickier to cure.Stockpiling throughout the lockdown has another problem for attracting pests — were all creating more household waste because people have been buying more fresh food than they can eat.And the problem of rubbish piling up outside our homes is made even worse by councils cutting back on bin collection services during the pandemic.We will accumulate more household rubbish, which might invite many dferent pests, says Jordan Foster, a pest control technician with Fantastic Services.We will eventually leave more crumbs and other food products all around the house. Mostly because we are binge-watching TV and are having snacks on the sofa and so on.So, be safe, but most of all, be smart and keep your property in neat condition because for now, it is your fortress.But its not just rats and mice that you need to keep an eye out foryoure stockpiling.Armies of ants will be drawn to the food and theres a particularly high chance of that happening as the weather gets warmer.Surplus food can attract ants as well, while it’s also likely that warmer weather is creating favourable conditions for insects, says Paul Blackhurst, Head of the Technical Academy at Rentokil Pest Control.Most garden ants are content living outside, where their main food source is sugary secretions from sap-sucking insects like aphids.However, some may enter houses in search of sugary deposits from fruit or food.This is particularly common in urban areas, where ants tend to build their nests outside buildings.Paul recommends finding out where the insects are emerging and then tackling them with poisonyou have a problem.Most patios are laid on sand, and ants will often emerge between the cracks to find and carry food, he says.By watching where the ants disappear into the crack, you’ll be able to locate the nest — and have a place to aim that ant killer powder before the problem escalates any further.To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.If youve already stocked up on large amounts of food, there are simple things you can do to keep the pests at bay.Make sure to plug any holes on the outside of your house which pests could exploit to get inside.And take care so that the food you do have is kept securely.“Keep it in metal containers or plastic containers and keep an eye on it regularly to make sure nothing’s got into it, Peter says.Don’t just leave it out of sight. The key thing is to check it on a regular basis.Have a process where you’re checking at least every three days to have a look around for droppings, urine, and chewed or damaged products.“If you’re not doing that, by the time you notice it’ll be too late anyway.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But I went above and beyond with the coronavirus, not just washing my hands  or  times a day until they were red raw but boiling my gloves as well.I took them off first, obviously, and even photographed the act, as I was aware this behaviour was a little “out there”.But, like the committed hypochondriac I am, I figured the ridicule was worth enduring so long as it provided one further line of defence against the invisible enemy which has us all surrounded.The glove thing seemed to be working as well, right up until the time it wasn’t. And, on Sunday, March , I very suddenly became one of those symptom lists you read about.Head in a “vice-like grip”  Check. Whole body feeling like it’s been in a car crash  Yes, and the bag didn’t inflate. Feverish  Oh boy, yes.  Chills  They’re multiplying.There was the cough as well. A textbook dry, intermittent hack that’s had its moments but never really amounted to much and has left me in a grey area, medically speaking.Testing has been out of the question, so to this day I still don’t knowI’ve had coronavirus or just something  horrible. The advice from Jake at  was unequivocal, though — “self-isolation” — and the response from everyone  was almost exactly the same.“Ha ha. Not much dferent for you then.”Ha ha. Indeed not.They mean no harm, bless them. It’s the classic British response to bad medical news. They’re reassuring themselves, as you need to do with this thing.If you think I’ve spent the past fortnight sat monitoring EastEnders for minor continuity errors, though, you haven’t had coronavirus, or anything like it.The thing does not lend itself to watching television as easily as you might think. Especially not during its first week when I was sleeping for anything up to  hours a day.The time you are awake you’re in a lot of discomfort and unwilling to be reminded of your condition, which is what television is now doing incessantly, while trying to take moral ownership of the illness as well.With endless spare time on my hands, I didn’t give up on the medium, though. I thought, in fact, it might be a good opportunity to watch some of those films I’d never got round to watching, like Get Carter, Lost In Translation and The Big Lebowski. It wasn’t.I hated all three of them, especially The Big Lebowski— not because they were without merit but because I had no appetite, zero energy and was unable to stand upright without losing my breath, while watching them.I shall now associate all three movies with misery, pain and paracetamol, for ever. About the same time I gave up on films, Sky’s Football HD channel played an even crueller trick on me, on Monday.Start to finish, it re-ran Scotland’s abortive Euro  campaign. The full chronological nightmare, starting with the - defeat in Kazakhstan, which I’d witnessed first-hand.A bullet to be dodged, surely  Reader, I watched the lot and, must confess, I found it strangely cathartic and quite funny, as well as sad.Because it reminded me of a time when there was a le that stretched so far beyond the walls of my own little home isolation unit.It provided a salutary lesson as well. Television is a fickle, uncaring beast and, with some honourable exceptions, like The Repair Shop, pretty useless at cheering you up in times of personal distress.People, on the other hand, are amazing and came up trumps during my illness.I’ve been particularly blessed with my amazing and generous East London neighbours, Fatima, Richard and David, who became aware, early on, what was happeningand reacted accordingly.Every day the buzzer would go, I’d hear footsteps beating a fairly quick retreat and by the time I’d shuffled my way to the front door, dinner would be sitting by my feet. They phoned regularly as well, to check on me.Until, on Day , after a couple of  dawns , the fever had lted, I’d had my last night-sweat, could think straight again and even a hint of an appetite ed.If this is being done for one miserable, solitary, middle-aged git who boils his gloves, I have not the slightest doubt that even more noble things are being done for all those in far greater need, and humanity will triumph over this illness, with something to spare.In the meantime, my isolation continues for now and —it so pleases the British comedy gods — no, it’s really not much dferent for me.To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

While millions of people are in lockdown to help our brave NHS this is what is going on at London Heathrow. Someone needs to get a grip.Around , passengers passed through Heathrow yesterday and althought this was way down on the usual , a day and landings and takes off were down to one every fteen minutes - as opposed to one every  seconds it still meant regular traffice all day.While other countries are enforcing arrivals to go into quarantine, Britain is simply requesting those from abroad to follow self-isolation guidelines.There are no extra restrictions stopping people who could have travelled from the most infected cities in the world from getting on the Tube, trains or buses.In China, where the coronavirus originated, all airline passengers from abroad are in enforced quarantine, and foreigners have been banned from midnight on Friday.Yesterday among the flights that landed was one from Newark just a short drive from New York city which has seen , cases while another landed from Madrid - the coronavirus capital of Spain.A Brit passenger who was on the BA flight that landed just after pm walked through with a mask and told The Sun: There must have been around  people on the flight which was a lot more than I was expecting to see.All the crew had masks and gloves on and some of the passengers had masks or scarves over their faces but other than that there were no checks on board or anything like that.We were just asked to try and keep apart as much as possible from each other and to self isolate when we got home as we had come back from a high risk area.When I landed at Madrid last week I had my temperature checked when I landed there but there was nothing of the sort at Heathrow when I landed.In an email to staff, the airline’s Gatwick managing director Adam Carson also told workers they can “expect to hear more soon” about potential job losses.The move came after easyJet halted its entire fleet.Mr Carson said: “Due to the considerable restrictions and challenging market environment, like many other airlines, we will temporarily suspend our flying schedule at Gatwick.“I know you will have concerns and questions about what this means for you.“I appreciate there is a desire for more detail about jobs and you should expect to hear more soon.”Another traveller told The Sun: I was gobsmacked there were no checks when we landed. We were just told to go home and self isolatewe showed any symptoms but Im now getting on the tube and could infect dozensI have it.Throughout the terminals at Heathrow a tannoy message chimed out every few minutes asking travellers to keep apart and also make use of  hand sanitisers dotted throughout.A Heathrow Airport spokesperson said:“Our teams are doing their best to support passengers and provide the space and facilities for social distancing during this dficult time. We have implemented signage across all terminals to remind passengers of the government’s recommendation to social distance themselves more than  metres from others.Our colleagues are also on hand to help manage the queues and provide more space where possible. We ask all passengers to continue to follow government advice as best they can while we work to get you home as quickly and as safely as possible.”While a message on Heathrows website read:You may be used to seeing temperature checks at airports around the world, as some of our partner airports operate checks year-round regardless of outbreaks of illnesses. It may be the case that you have just landed at Heathrow from an airport that checked your temperature before you boarded your plane.There are currently no temperature checks at Heathrow for arriving flights, so you should not expect to see them when you land.This is not a measure that Heathrow decided itself we would like to reassure you that Heathrow is following the guidance and advice of Public Health Englandon which measures are required to contain and respond to Coronavirus effectively.Some government ministers are keen to ban flights from the worst affected countries and the EU has barred travellers from outside its member states for  days.PM Boris Johnson and Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab are keen not keep flights operating so they can bring back stranded Brits and one of the flights that landed yesterday was from Peru where dozens had been trapped.In a statement the Foreign Office said:There is no evidence that interventions like closing borders or travel bans would have any effect on the spread of infection.To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

find out more.Professor Nirmal Kumar, president of ENT, told Sky News: In young patients, they do not have any signicant symptoms such as the cough and fever, but they may have just the loss of sense of smell and taste, which suggests that these viruses are lodging in the nose.ENT has urged ministers to recognise loss of smell and taste as an official sign of the deadly illness and say they have told Public Health England about the apparent link.Meanwhile, the World Health Organisationalso said it is investigating the link between loss of smell and taste and Covid-.Last night, the countrys top scientist, Sir Patrick Vallance said loss of smell or taste was a feature of coronavirus.However, he followed it up by saying that it was up to the Chief Medical Officer, Professor Chris Whitty - who himself is currently self-isolating after showing symptoms - to change the official diagnostics list.Chief Scientic Adviser, Sir Patrick, said: The symptoms that the Chief Medical Officer has outlined - and the ones that you should self-isolate on - are a persistent new cough or fever.Loss of taste and smell is something that can happen with other respiratory viruses.It does seem to be a feature of this from what people are reporting and it is something that people should take into account as they think about their symptoms.I think it’s for the Chief Medical Officer to decide at what point,any, diagnostic change takes place in terms of self-isolation.Those symptoms we are learning about for this disease are the ones that will get more information on over time but a new cough or fever captures the vast majority of people with this illness.Its thought that losing the ability to smell or taste could be due to the virus destroying cells in the nose and throat.Experts say its something people can commonly experience after having other types of coronaviruses - such as the common cold.Prof Carl Philpott, of the Norwich Medical School at UEA, said: Coronaviruses have previously been associated with what we refer to as post-viral olfactory loss– this is smell loss that persists after a cold.There are many respiratory viruses that can potentially cause problems with the smell receptors.So far with Covid-, the smell loss appears to be transient but only as time elapses will we know how many people have a more permanent loss.US scientists also recently claimed that those with Covid- might also experience a tummy ache when they have the deadly bug.A new study, published in the American Journal of Gastroenterology, suggests people might experience digestive issues, such as diarrhoea, when they are infected with coronavirus.Despite this revelation, people should still be vigilant in looking out for the primary symptoms of coronavirus including a dry cough and high temperature - as Covid- primarily attacks the lungs and respiratory system.Some patients may also have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose or a sore throat - but these are usually mild and begin gradually.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Its quite important, it tells you that actually this is a bit more stable than it has been.The measures we are taking will stop the transmission, delay the transmission, reduce the amount of transmission in the community and therefore reduce the number of people who might die from the infection.I want to thank the people in the NHS working extremely hard.What all of us can do is heed the advice and stay at home so we can reduce the number of people who will be seriously ill or die from this infection.He warned the number of deaths from the virus are expected to jump tomorrow as figures including those who have died outside of hospitals will be released for the first time.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.Earlier an extra  deaths from outside hospitals were revealed - and more jumps are expected.Regional data released showed all areas outside of London had steady increases in hospital admissions but were not spiking, giving more time to get ready for extra cases.Three regional hospitals in London, Birmingham and Manchester are in the process of being set up to help deal with cases.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Economic collapse. The PM and heir to the throne have a deadly disease and the police are using drones to tell people off for not exercising. Itaposs only been a week. Coming soon: middle-class chicken theft, Michael Gove leaving his fleshsuit chrysalis, and the tasering of anyone who refuses to jog on the spot. Our lockdown is widely regarded as vital. It keeps all of us, and others, safe. It protects the NHS from a surge it could not handle, and saves the lives of thousands from coronavirus.But yesterday the authorities said the lockdown may last, in some form, for  months. And the public perception of danger is simply never going to last that long. Weaposll either get used to the idea, or the risk will seem to disappear.Whether youaposve got the bug or not, whether you have symptoms or not, after a month of isolation you will no longer be infectious. And how tempting will it be, then, to meet up with another virus-free household - your mum, your grandchildren, the mates who live across the road. Which all begs the question: how long have we got, until mass civil disobedience begins   In week , the public perception of threat is as immediate, and certain, asthe Luftwaffe were rumbling overhead. In week , it may not be. The policeaposs randomised interpretation of the rules may seem like a bigger issue, or not being able to work, or bright summer sunshine beckoning people outside.In week ,the infection and death rates slow as expected, Stephen Kinnock will not be the only person popping round to deliver birthday cake to a relative. Andeveryoneaposs certain theyaposre virus-free, the meeting wonapost take place ft apart on the front path, either. But it will be breaking the rules. The rules which today we accept are keeping people safe, and which we are already chafing at, because they stop us taking the dog out twice a day, or driving to an isolated spot where thereaposs no risk of infection.By doing those things we raise our chances of a car crash, a twisted ankle, maybe hospitalisation. But thataposs a risk weaposre all used to, to the extent weaposve mostly forgotten it. There will be a time when even covid- seems no more risky than popping somewhere in the car. The lockdown regulations were written in a hurry, and as such are imperfect. Takeaways may stay open, but not restaurants. Room service is just as likely to be coughed on as restaurant food, but itaposs allowed. Shops are closed but online shopping is open, despite the infection risks of warehouse workers and delivery drivers. Children can be swapped between parents, but not grandparents, eventhey normally provide the childcare. The public, and the police, are interpreting things dferently. Some are being idiots, and others doing their best to be sensible while carrying on as normally as possible. It may not be aposessentialapos to give your dad a birthday cake. And itaposs not aposessentialapos to buy flowers on your trip to the supermarket. But the police arenapost going to arrest you for it, even though they couldthey wanted to. And both of them will help to keep you sane, which seems pretty essential to me.What is aposessentialapos is that everyone agrees whataposs a crime and whataposs not. And the only way any rules survive prolonged contact with human beings isthey are flexible.For example - murder is wrong, and gets you le imprisonment. Manslaughter, though, may be an accident. And itaposs possible to intentionally take anotheraposs le out of mercy, and to be shown mercy as a result. Three dferent ways to take a personaposs le, with an infinite iety of outcomes.Strict rules, in scary times, are broadly accepted. When the threat recedes, the rules need to do the samethey are to retain our consent, and for society to keep being a thing. The public need to see a route back to normality, where virus-free households can socialise, virus-free children can play together, or virus-free grown-ups can get back to work. They especially need to see it, when their own PM hasnapost been following the rules. In just a week, over-zealous police officers damaged our consent by following people with drones, or ordering those sat on park benches to go home. Itaposs entirely possible someone could be taking their daily exercise, and sit on a bench for a bit to get their breath. Itaposs possible people drove to a beauty spot because itaposs their nearest public footpath.And itaposs also possible for someone to shove his we in a car boot and drive more than  miles to pick up an eBay purchase. But rules have to flex for asthmatics having a walk, and flex again for plonkers whoaposd go that far for something worth £. The issue is how long public consent will last, and how long the lockdown will be necessary. If in a few weeks we see cases tail off, more and more people will flout the regulations, and Boris Johnson will then face a choice - does he become more authoritarian, or does he relax the rules so they bend around us  The answer depends on the progress of the disease, and its cure. If new treatments prove effective,a vaccine edges closer, the risk will dissipate, butinfections keep rising a tougher lockdown will be demanded.

Workers have slammed a glaring loophole in the Covid- job retention scheme that means itaposs not available to people with a brand new job. The unprecedented scheme will see the state pay % of the wages of any worker who is furloughed - put completely out of action - due to the virus. Yet the rate is based on Februaryaposs wage, so anyone who started their job after February  is not eligible. More than , people have signed a petition urging Boris Johnson to make things right, while more than , have joined a Facebook group to share their stories. Tony MacDonald, , from Dundee, left his job of three years to start a new role as a fire safety engineer on March . Now he and we Logan, , have been left high and dry unable to support children Alfie, , and Aoe, , on her midweaposs salary alone. Tony told the Mirror: My weaposs wage doesnapost quite cover our bills, so there is a shortfall there without counting food or anything . The worry is about getting ourselves into more debt just to see us through this period. At this stage my employer was good enough to pay me yesterday for what Iaposd already done. But after a month we will have to see. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps today admitted some people will slip through the cracks.  He told Sky News: “There will be circumstances under which not every single last business or inidual is helped. This is unfortunately the nature of the scale of this thing.” He added: “It is probably the case we won’t be able to capture every single inidual circumstance under any scheme that was ever put in place.” But Mr MacDonald said the Cabinet ministeraposs defence of the scheme was short-sighted. The safety engineer pointed out that anyone who was made redundant before March  can be re-hired and furloughed - but not those who quit to start a new job. He called on the government to move the cut-off date at least to when a full lockdown was announced on March .  The Treasury has said people can claim Universal Credit - but with his weaposs wage, Tony says he is not eligible. He said: I realise where theyaposre coming from but there are people whoaposve accepted job offers as far back as September. Thereaposs one case where a guy moved, relocated his le, was in his job for three days and couldnapost be furloughed.  A Treasury official said they picked the February  date because it is the last full set of PAYE data that HMRC will use as the reference for the claims. Peter Mills, , from Bath, started a new job in the TV industry March but lost it the day after the full lockdown was announced. He said itaposs a particular problem in the TV industry, where young workers move from one temporary contract to the next - but are not classed as self-employed.

Both the NHS and the World Health Organisationhave spoken out to reassure shoppers that itaposs aposunlikelyapos shoppers can be infected with the virus through groceries, or its packaging. The NHS has said: Itaposs very unlikely [coronavirus] can be spread through things like packages or food - with the governmentaposs own guidance stating: COVID- is a respiratory illness.

Stephen Baker, from the Department of Medicine at the University of Cambridge, said viruses - unlike bacteria - do not survive well outside the body, and described the risk when it comes to supermarket food and home deliveries as aposnot zeroapos but aposreally lowapos. He advised washing fruit and vegetables as normal, and said although food in packages would be unlikely to make anyone ill, the packages themselves can be wiped downthere are any concerns.NHS guidelines for washing fruit and veg can be found here. Being in shops themselves may carry a higher risk, however, with Dr Baker adding thatyou touch the same surface as someone who has sneezed on to their hands then aposthataposs going to be a bigger problemapos. Handles of trolleys, baskets and self-checkout machines are all commonly used by other shoppers, so itaposs vital you follow guidelines to properly wash your hands when youfrom the shop and after putting your groceries away.

We understand their desire to take a dferent approach, but these are complicated issues that will take time to work through. In the following days she summoned Harry, Charles and William to Sandringham for a crisis summit to work out what was going to happen next. She chaired the meeting, in which the family worked out six points that needed to be sorted before progress was made. After the discussions were over, the Queen released another statement on the issue in which she referred to the couple as Meghan and Harry rather than using their HRH titles.  She said: Today my family had very constructive discussions on the future of my grandson and his family. My family and I are entirely supportive of Harry and Meghan’s desire to create a new le as a young family. Although we would have preferred them to remain full-time working members of the Royal Family, we respect and understand their wish to live a more independent le as a family while remaining a valued part of my family.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor more information on how we use your data and your data protection rights.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailThese are the first pictures of a family-of-four who died in a suspected murder-suicide during the coronavirus lockdown. The bodies of mum Kelly Fitzgibbons, , partner Robert, and their two children Ava, five, and Lexi, three, were found upstairs at their home, according to Robertaposs grandmother, Maureen Needham. Maureen,, had posted a picture to Facebook of her -year-old builder son with his two daughters just days ago.  This morning she commented under the picture and told friends and family: It was Robert, Kelly and my lovely grandchildren that all died upstairs. Police launched a murder investigation after finding the bodies of the family and their dog inside their home on Duffield Lane, Woodmancote, West Sussex, on Sunday evening. Detectives said it was an isolated incident and they were not seeking anyone  in connection with it.  Kelly shared photos of the family and their Staffie dog out on their one walk a day last Thursday. She captioned the sweet set of photographs: Our walk for the day alongside a heart emoji. They show dad Robert walking the dog whilst the coupleaposs young daughters are both wearing pink sunglasses and carrying easter baskets. One friend wrote underneath: So cute, wish we could see you.  In a nod to her daughters, Kellyaposs bio states: Totally in love with my baby girls. One neighbour who lives less than  yards from the house, said: On Sunday night we were aware a lot of activity outside. The activity started about .pm but by .pm or .pm when I looked out there were upwards of eight or  police cars and a couple of paramedics vehicles with both marked and unmarked police cars - a lot of activity around one particular house in the lane and from there it just emerged that there had been a major incident at the house.  “Its been mentioned that it’s a murder. I don’t want to speculate but it’s just surprising that there has been an incident of this kind in this lane. The family are, as I understand it, a close family. The house is owned by the grandmother. after her husband died some years ago the son moved back in with his partner and they, between them, had two children.  “Recently they had been building a very large extension on the house and a brick wall outside on the frontage to replace an old hedge. “The owner of the house, I sometimes would take to the doctors or to the hospital because she is somewhat disabled, she has had joint replacements and suffers somewhat with rheumatism.  He added: “What is sad is that we don’t know who is dead over there. I get on OK with the owner of the house and I don’t knowshe’s one of the deceased or not although I suspect at this point that she is not. “There were three adults living in the house which means there is one not accounted for. We don’t know which one. “I didn’t know the younger ones that well but the son he always seemed quite calm, collected, laid back, I would say.  But his partner, I think is not quite as laid back but other than that I don’t really know and of course there are two young children they are about five and three and there is also a dog who is a Staffie. “The mother, whenever I took her out she would say, ‘he’s done this, he’s done that’ she was quite proud of the fact that he’s got on and done the building work over there.  You can never tell whataposs going on behind doors. Iaposve never heard any sound of argument coming from the house.” Another neighbour, who did not want to be named, described the small rural neighbourhood as “close knit.” She said: “There are very few of us and we stick very closely together.” On Monday, Chief Superintendent Jerry Westerman said: This is believed to be an isolated incident contained to one property and in these early stages of the investigation we are not seeking anyone  in connection with the incident.  Local residents can expect to see an increased police presence in the area as our enquiries continue.

Meghan Markle and Prince Harry are no longer senior members of the Royal Family, and are no longer allowed to use their HRH Duke and Duchess of Sussex titles. Everything will change for the couple, who have already moved to Canada and then onto LA,, including their working le, their security and even their names. But the adjustment will be much bigger for Harry who has been royal his entire le, compared to Meghan who donned her first tiara less than two years ago. Harryaposs years in the royal spotlight have been filled with ups and downs, with many proud moments and several he would probably rather forget. Weaposve taken a look back through Harryaposs royal le as he says goodbye to it. The highs There are many reasons that Harry is most peopleaposs favourite member of the royal family, and his relaxed and funny approach to engagements is always a hit with fans. He was the first to get involved in games and activities, and always seemed to really care about the work he was doing and the people he was meeting.  His brother Prince Williamaposs wedding to Kate Middleton Harry took up the role of best man when his brother tied the knot at Westminster Abbey, standing at his side as he said his vows. Heaposs always had a very special relationship with his sister-in-law Kate, so welcoming her officially into their unusual family was a huge moment. After the guests tucked into a three-course meal at the evening reception at Buckingham Palace, Harry got to his feet to make his best man speech. In her book Harry: Le, Loss, and Love, royal author Katie Nicholl writes: It was affectionate, warm and funny and touched William deeply.  The speech was peppered with Harryaposs classic sense of humour, and he ribbed his brother: aposWilliam didnapost have a romantic bone in his body before he met Kate, so I knew it was serious when William suddenly started cooing down the phone at Kateapos. Famous for his mimicry, Harry then impersonated his brother calling Kate aposBabykinsapos, to much laughter from the guests. When he said the couple’s decade-long romance was his inspiration, there was a shy smile from Chelsy, while Kate shed a tear. Becoming an uncle Harry became an uncle for the first time when Kate and Wills welcomed Prince George in July . He said it was fantastic to have another addition to the family, and that the newborn was crying his eyes out when he met him.  He told a reporter his mission as an uncle was to make sure he has a good upbringing, and keep him out of harmaposs way and to make sure he has fun, before adding: the rest Iaposll leave to the parents. Launching The Invictus Games In  Harry attended the Warrior Games in America and saw first hand how sport can help injured people physically, psychologically and socially. He was so inspired by what he saw he started planning his own version, and in  Invictus was born. The international games sees wounded, injured or sick armed military personnel go head to head for their country in a number of sports including  wheelchair basketball, sitting volleyball, and indoor rowing.  The games are Harryaposs great passion, and it was at one of the events that he officially stepped out with Meghan for the first time after announcing their relationship. The website states: The Invictus Games is about much more than just sport – it captures hearts, challenges minds and changes lives. The fth games were due to be held in The Hague, The Netherlands, in May this year but have been cancelled due to coronavirus Covid-.      Marrying Meghan Markle Harry got down on one knee and asked his American girlfriend Meghan Markle to be his we at their two-bedroom Kensington Palace home Nottingham Cottage. The couple were trying to cook a roast chicken at the time during what Meghan described as a standard typical night in, saying it was sweet, natural and very romantic. They tied the knot six months later in a stunning service at St Georgeaposs Chapel in Windsor Castle.  Hollywood met royalty as the couple said their vows, with the guestlist packed with Meghanaposs celebrity friends as well as the Queen, Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, Prince Charles and the rest of the Firm. Harry couldnapost have looked happier as he kissed his new bride on the chapel steps, with the evening celebrations continuing into the early hours. Becoming a dad Just a few months after their wedding, Meghan and Harry shared the happy news that they were expecting their first child. On the eve of their royal tour of Australia and New Zealand, the Kensington Palace account tweeted: Their Royal Highnesses The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are very pleased to announce that The Duchess of Sussex is expecting a baby in the Spring of .  Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor arrived at .am on May . Meghan gave birth to Archie at the private Portland Hospital in Westminster - which costs about £,. As is traditional with royal babies, the birth was officially announced with a notice placed on an easel outside Buckingham Palace. Hundreds of onlookers also watched from outside the gates as the framed message was put in place, describing the Queen and the Royal Family as being delighted at the babyaposs arrival.  Speaking hours after the birth, proud dad Harry said his son is absolutely to die for and he was over the moon. The couple broke tradition and didnapost pose on the hospital steps, instead introducing their son to the world at a photocall a few days later. On the certicate, Meghanaposs job title is listed as aposPrincess of the United Kingdomapos. The lows However there have also been some bad moments for Harry, and on occasion he has had to issue public apologies. Prince Dianaaposs death The most heartbreaking moment that sticks in most peopleaposs minds is when we saw a young Harry walking behind his mum Princess Dianaaposs coffin at her funeral in . He stood shoulder to shoulder with Princes Philip, Charles and William and Dianaaposs brother.  He was just  when she died in a car crash in Paris, and his hand written note rested on top of her coffin during the procession. He has since said that no child should be asked to do what he was that day, but heaposs also said heaposs glad he was part of the day. Nazi unorm fancy dress In  Prince Harry left people outraged when he dressed up as a Nazi for his friendaposs fancy dress birthday party. He was heavily criticised by politicians, religious leaders and charities after the photos were leaked. Pictures on the front page of the Sun under the headline Harry the Nazi showed the royal in a shirt with an eagle insignia on the front and a Swastika armband.  It was claimed it was the unorm of Rommelaposs Afrika Korps. He was holding a drink and a cigarette in the shot. The Prince was third in line to the throne at the time, and Clarence House quickly issued a statement saying he was sorryhe had caused any offence. The scandal came just two weeks before the th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz. The infamous Las Vegas trip Harry said I let myself down, I let my family down after being pictured frolicking naked in Las Vegas in .  The Royal spoke openly of his remorse over his wild partying, and revealed he struggles to balance his position as third-in-line to the throne while trying to have a “normal” army and social le. Pictures showed Harry cupping his privates next to an unnamed naked woman and exposing his bottom during an August trip to Sin City, when he stayed at the £,-per-night Wynn Hotel.  British-born Carrie Reichert, then , ­revealed she spent  minutes alone with the prince in his hotel bedroom. She was handpicked with nine other girls to join Harry in his penthouse suite but soon the royal heart-throb led her away so they could be together.

Brits are being urged to stay at home and only step outside when they need essential supplies, like food or medication. Exercise once a day is also recommended and people can also go outsidethey have a hospital or medical appointment. But pubs, cafes, restaurants and theatres have been closed for more than a week with all non-essential shops ordered to close last Monday.Initially introduced for three weeks, senior government officials have warned the lockdown could last up to six months in a bid to stop the NHS being overwhelmed with people suffering from coronavirus.What once seemed like a mundane, every day task - going to the supermarket - can now expose people to the deadly virus that is sweeping the world.

Then wash your hands again when you get home and again once youaposve unpacked your shopping. Stay six feet apart Under the new social distancing rules people are being told they can no longer gather in groups.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor more information on how we use your data and your data protection rights.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailItaposs been a year,  months and  days since Meghan Markle and Prince Harry shared a kiss on the steps of St Georgeaposs Chapel and became the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. The first year was a whirlwind, with the couple heading off on their first major Royal Tour, moving into their newly renovated home Frogmore Cottage and welcoming their first child Archie. The coupleaposs modern and relaxed approach to royal le was a complete change for aides, the media and fans, and while some loved their new way of doing things it didnapost sit well with those fond of the traditional methods. But things werenapost rosy behind closed doors, with reports of upset staff, family fallouts and anger at media coverage. On January , after many months of reflection and internal discussions, the couple decided enough was enough and threw in the towel as members of the Royal Family. The family stunned royal watchers around the world - not to mention their own family - when they announced their plans on Instagram. They reportedly sent the statement to Princes Charles and William just minutes before they shared it with their millions of followers. The decision reportedly left Harryaposs father and brother incandescent with rage, while his grandmother the Queen was deeply upset. In their statement, Meghan and Harry explained they want to carve out a progressive new role within the Royal Family and become financially independent.  They wrote: We intend to step back as ‘senior’ members of the Royal Family and work to become financially independent, while continuing to fully support Her Majesty The Queen. They also thanked fans for their support, adding: It is with your encouragement, particularly over the last few years, that we feel prepared to make this adjustment. They said they planned to split their their time between the UK and North America so they could raise our son with an appreciation for the royal tradition into which he was born, while also providing our family with the space to focus on the next chapter. In response, the Queen was forced to release a short statement saying discussions were ongoing, warning the couple of complicated issues. She said: Discussions with The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are at an early stage.  We understand their desire to take a dferent approach, but these are complicated issues that will take time to work through. After making the announcement Meghan fled to Canada while Harry stayed in the UK to deal with the fallout. The Queen called an crisis summit between senior members of the family, which saw Charles, William and Harry travel to Sandringham. The gathering came after numerous meetings between senior royal aides, government chiefs from the UK and Canada and police forces including the Met Police. Chairing the meeting across a large polished table with room for eight chairs, the Queen and her family set out their vision of how a new version of monarchy would emerge. After weeks of discussions, the Queen and other senior royals have agreed the terms of Meghan Markle and Prince Harry quitting the Royal Family. This is what has been agreed for aposMegxitapos:The couple will officially step back from the roles as senior royals on March  They will close their Buckingham Palace office, with their  loyal staff reportedly being axed Meghan and Harry will retail their HRH royal titles but will not use them. The same applies to the Dukeaposs military titles They will not use the word aposRoyalapos in their branding, meaning they will have to rebrand their website and drop their trademark application for Sussex Royal They willto the UK regularly, staying at their Windsor home Frogmore Cottage Rather than setting up a foundation as planned, they will create a new non-profit organisation and will continue working with their existing patronages  There will be review of their new set up after  months.  Over the next two hours they thrashed out the framework of a deal. Sources close to the negotiations later revealed the family set six main points to be agreed on before real change could take affect - titles, finances, protection, advisors, media plan and where they will live. Days later, the Queen released a second statement in which she referred to the couple as Meghan and Harry rather than using their titles. She said: Today my family had very constructive discussions on the future of my grandson and his family.  My family and I are entirely supportive of Harry and Meghan’s desire to create a new le as a young family. Although we would have preferred them to remain full-time working members of the Royal Family, we respect and understand their wish to live a more independent le as a family while remaining a valued part of my family. Harry and Meghan have made clear that they do not want to be reliant on public funds in their new lives. It has therefore been agreed that there will be a period of transition in which the Sussexes will spend time in Canada and the UK. These are complex matters for my family to resolve, and there is some more work to be done, but I have asked for final decisions to be reached in the coming days. When the deal was done, Harry flew back to Canada to be reunited with Meghan and baby Archie. More details of the coupleaposs new lives were announced in the following weeks, including that they would close their Buckingham Palace office and axe their staff, and that the Queen banned them from using the word aposRoyalapos in their branding andHowever Harry and Meghan were said to be disappointed by the strict restrictions placed upon them by the Queen.  Former royal protection officer Ken Wharfe told the Sun: They’d want to keep that Sussex Royal brand name — they haven’t. Without that brand it’s going to be much more dficult for their charitable causes because that was their trademark. “I think they’d want to keep the office at Buckingham Palace as well, which they now don’t have. Harry would also have wanted to have kept using the HRH title but he can’t. He will be incredibly disappointed with that. Last month, a full logistical plan was released and Meghan and Harry posted a further ,-word statement of their own. Experts believed it contained a number of digs and complaints, including one at Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie. The statement read: “While there is precedent for other titled members of the Royal Family to seek employment outside of the ­institution, for The Duke and Duchess of Sussex, a -month ­review period has been put in place.”  A royal source said: “It’s pretty clear they are referencing minor royals such as Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie, which is an odd association to make for two people whose associates were once claiming they had single-­handedly modernised the monarchy.” On security, they suggested they would demand round-the-clock protection paid for by the public, owing to, “The Duke’s public profile by virtue of being born into The Royal Family, his military ­service, the Duchess’ own independent profile, and the shared threat”. The couple ed to the UK to carry out a farewell tour, visiting a number of their charities and patronages. Their final royal engagement was Commonwealth Day, when they joined the rest of the Royal Family at Westminster Abbey. Last week it was reported that Meghan and Harry have left Canada and moved to Calornia, where they now plan to live full-time. According to the Sun, they made the decision after realising Canada would not work out for ious reasons.  However, people close to the family are stunned and horried they didnapost opt to come back to the UK amid the pandemic. A insider told the newspaper: “We are stunned and horried. The country is going through a traumatic event at the moment. They have a beautul cottage in Windsor where they could have based themselves. “It’s just a stone’s throw away from where the Queen and Prince Philip are in self-isolation. “Prince Charles and Prince Andrew are both out of action too for very dferent reasons. This was an opportunity for them to put country before their own interests. Calornia isn’t going anywhere.” Meghanaposs first post-royal job - a voice over gig on Disneyaposs new film Elephant - was also officially announced. Yesterday, Meghan and Harry said their public goodbyes and shared their final Instagram post. They used their final message, which they signed Meghan and Harry rather than using their official titles, to speak about the dficult times weaposre currently in as the world battles coronavirus Covid-. They wrote: As we can all feel, the world at this moment seems extraordinarily fragile. Yet we are confident that every human being has the potential and opportunity to make a dference—as seen now across the globe, in our families, our communities and those on the front line—together we can lt each other up to realise the fullness of that promise.

Louise had been booked to leave the country on March , and managed to get home on one of the last flights to leave India before a seven-day flight ban was put in place.The couple found an emergency flight home for Hans at the end of that period - but then a total lockdown was imposed for at least  days, with just a few hoursapos notice, Chronicle Live reports.Now, people are banned from leaving their homes, and Hansapos family are now among hundreds begging the UK government to arrange repatriation flights for loved ones in India. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office says officials are working on getting British nationals out of India as an absolute priority and that it is also working to improve health, safety and conditions in the country for UK travellers where thataposs needed. Louise, , says the response from government hasnapost reassured her. She said: Hans has been registered with the FCO in Delhi, sothere is a flight home, he will be told.

Police are patrolling the streets, and Hans is trapped in a busy tourist resort without any way of getting to the shops for food. At the moment, heaposs got a bit of food, but heaposs run out of fresh drinking water and has been boiling tap water, which comes from a well. The family are terribly, terribly worried about him. If we had had any indication this was going to happen we would have arranged for him to come home earlier, but it all happened so quickly. Hans, , who teaches yoga classes, is fit and healthy but says there are other tourists with young children, or those who are rapidly running out of medication, also trapped on the resort.In a Facebook post on Friday, Hans said: I know there are worse places by far to be stuck in but we have been told that shops won’t open until about April  and that means we have to run off what we have in stock. I have food for about  days, moreI ration it, which I have started to do.The government is very unpredictable and many think the curfew may be extended. The police are patrolling the streets and have actually used batons on anyone found flouting the curfew. Arrest, fine and a possible prison stay all being consequences. We are not meant to be even off our front door step. Still most of India has been thrust into this without preparation and people will be really suffering badly.

The bizarre video shows the whole family sat on the floor and puffing away. Among the smokers were two young boys — one of whom looks to be as young as five years old — who were each holding their own cigarettes. A woman, with a cigarette in hand, is seen cradling an even smaller child on her lap while she smoked.  It is claimed the family, in Indonesia, believe inhaling the herbs will help them fight off coronavirus.A man, who appears to be the one filming, can be heard saying off camera: “In order to resist the coronavirus, we, as a family, are smoking. Hopefully,Allah wills it, covid- will be blocked.”  Herbal cigarettes, locally known as rokok sin, are widely available in Indonesia. Vaccinologist Dirga Sakti Rambe told Detik, a health website in the Asian country: Quitting or staying away from passive smoking can indirectly prevent covid- infection.

Do you keep the players ticking over on their own or rest “The most important thing, though, is the health of everybody – as a club we are doing everything to look after our players and our staff, that’s paramount.“There’s not many times when I’ll say football isn’t important but it isn’t right now.”The Dundee players have been given inidual training programmes to work on at home but, with government advice to stay indoors as much as possible, it’s not easy for some.“As a club we have set up inidual programmes for the players but the trouble with that is a lot of the work is on treadmills or exercise bikes and not everyone has access to them,” added the Dens boss.“Otherwise you’re asking them to go out and do bits in the park and the advice is now not really to do that.

Bottom of the second tier got £,.Could they not pay out the minimum to everybody right now and decide the rest later Welcome to lockdown everybody!

McDaid have been standouts for their clubs.Goal machine Shankland has particularly impressed Docherty.“It’s not been a surprise to me at all how well he’s done,” the -year-old midfielder said.“I had every confidence in him going up there at the start of the season because he’d done it for Ayr.“We were a decent team last season but he’s gone to Dundee United and they’re dominating the league.“If he gets a chance, he’s going to score and he’s maybe been getting a bit more service up there.“He’d dried up before the league stopped but they’d been struggling as a team.“His form has seen him get caps and a goal for Scotland which is amazing.“He knowshe performs he’s going to get an opportunity.“There’s been a shortage of strikers, obviously, but you can’t take it away from Lawrence.“Boys can look at him and take confidence and encouragement, even though they might not get a Scotland cap playing in the Championship.“It’s unexpected and a bit out there but,you’re going to perform well over a period of time, there’s chances out there to better yourself.”And Doc puts a large portion of Shankland’s improvement down to the -year-old getting himself into shape mentally as well as physically after joining Ayr.The former Livingston and Airdrie man added: “With any striker when they’re going through a period of good form then it’s got to be about having confidence.“That comes from doing well and what started that off was when he came in at Ayr.“He was maybe a wee bit unfit having not done much over the summer before signing for us and he was unfit the season before – he’d be the first to admit that.“His head wasn’t right so it was a number of things but he come in, got as fit as he could and he’s just in a better space.“He was like a dferent guy to the one I played against before and, once you get that, the confidence and the ability he has makes him unstoppable in the league at times.“I’m fairly close to him and he’s a bubbly character but it’s a quiet confidence.“He wouldn’t be bragging to anyone about anything or in anyone’s face.“He knows he’s good enough and that’s probably what a lot of good players miss in this league.“He’s one where,he misses a chance, he knows he’s going to go and score the next one.”Although a dferent character, Docherty believes Smith is almost as important to the Tangerines as Shankland.“I’m not surprised he’s been one of United’s most consistent players because he was the same last season at Ayr.“He came in and flew under the radar but, with two or three months to go in the season, people were starting to say ‘he’s been amazing for us’.“He did it the whole season but he sometimes goes unnoticed but that’s probably because he is such a quiet boy.“He’s a steady Eddy and he and Lawrence link up well.“They did it at Ayr but when you look at us compared to what Dundee United have in terms of budget this season I’m not surprised they’ve gone and done it again.”Docherty does admit, though, that McDaid’s transformation into a left wing-back under James McPake at Dens Park was unexpected.“I’ve seen recently they’ve been playing a -- so he’s almost been playing wing-back,” he added.“I spoke to him and, obviously, as a winger you never really want to be playing there so he was kind of laughing about it!“At the end of the day, though, it shows that he has that side of his game and will benefit him in the long run.“If people maybe two years ago, and I was probably one of them, had thought that Declan McDaid would be playing wing-back they’d have laughed.“He wasn’t as good defensively but now you can see he’s really improved there.“Whenever we’ve played them or I’ve seen them on the telly he’s been one of their best players this season.“It’s brilliant for him, the same as Lawrence and Liam, that boys from Ayr can go to these other clubs and really perform.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/seedundee/wp-content/uploads/sites/104/2020/03/dayne-topkin-Pl7Cs2z4Lsc-unsplash-300x200.jpg ","title":"whorter

Kittybrewster depot as the facility best suited to providing additional capacity on a temporary basis.“We appreciate the sensitivities of this situation and are working through details.“Our priority has been to share the update with staff at Kittybrewster and to give them reassurances it will have a minimal impact on their work and pose no health risk.”Leslie Tarr, Unison branch secretary, said: “We obviously support the council in its effort to organise and keep essential services such as the morgue going in these dficult times.“Providing the proper health and safety conditions are in place

Bite, CFine and Aberdeen Foyer, are working together to make sure no one is left struggling to buy food and essential household items.They have formed a partnership called ACU to help iniduals and families who cannot leave their homes to access essential goods.Aberdeen Cyrenians, which supports people affected by homelessness, violence, domestic abuse and other forms of social exclusion, vowed to continue delivering its critical services.CEO Mike Burns said: “These are uncharted waters demanding a partnership response.“Working together to take care of those in need is vital to ensuring the safety and wellbeing of the most vulnerable people in our city.“We are therefore doing all we can to ensure people’s most basic needs are met and ask that the public support us in this endeavour.“As the outbreak progresses, there will doubtlessly be many more coming under extreme pressures who may be unable to meet their basic housing and food needs.“With this strain on resources and people, working in partnership with Aberdeen City Council provides a collective support through Aberdeen City Council’s Feed the City Strategy.”He added: “These services over the next three months will be a vital leline for highly vulnerable people in Aberdeen.“We’d like to thank the public and the many businesses offering us their support, and those who donated, enabling this service development.”The charities are appealing for non-perishable food as well as cleaning products, hygiene products and nappies.They can be handed in at Sainsbury’s at Berryden, Asda at Middleton Park and the Tesco stores at Wellington Road and in Westhill.Mike explained how the ACU service will work, saying: “We’ve basically turned our direct access service inside-out so instead of people coming to us, we’re now, as part of a consortium of partners, going out to people and delivering food and welfare resources.“Pooling resources can have a really big impact and there’s a great network of charities in Aberdeen

The most important thing all of us can do is to follow the advice and stay at home wherever possible.”Dr Calderwood also said Thursday night’s Clap for Carers, which she took part in, was the first time she had cracked a smile “for quite some time”, adding: “I am very proud to be part of the NHS.“My NHS colleagues really appreciate it.

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community.

So how did Britain look before human interventions  Dense forest  or open woodland Research now favours the latter.Plants and animals evolved in equilibrium for thousands of years before humans impacted the landscape. Essential to this balance were ‘keynote species’ including aurochs , bison and tarpan . By grazing, these animals trampled and eroded soils, dispersed seeds and redistributed nutrients, thereby keeping the forest open. This in turn encouraged growth of large trees while also creating numerous habitats and microenvironments for a wonderful ersity of plants and smaller animals.Now this bioersity is severely threatened by modern monocultures , and massive quantities of pesticides, fungicides, fertilisers and #weed# killers. It is no wonder that insect numbers have plummeted, many bird species are endangered and wild-flower meadows have virtually vanished. So could we recreate this natural order on unproductive land and save our wildle For Isabella Tree and her husband Charlie Burrell the answer is a resounding #yes#. In her book #Wilding#, Tree describes #wilding# their , acre farm at Knepp, West Sussex, that had been unproductive for years.They introduced longhorn cattle, Exmore ponies, deer and pigs but otherwise left well alone. Within months they saw a dference # most scrub was cleared, producing an explosion of plant and animal species. And where grazers were deterred by spiny or unpalatable plants, oaks emerged that will eventually form an open woodland.But Knepp is isolated. More rewilding sites are needed with wildle corridors between them to support the populations and genetic ersity essential for long-term survival.Surely parts of Argyll are ideal for rewilding. We already have beavers creating new waterways to support aquatic species – now how about some large grazers to open up the landscape and perhaps one day recreate the ancient Celtic rainforest "},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column february 7 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsDog walkers on the banks of the Crinan Canal need to take collective responsibility for lting their canine companions# mess.There is no excuse for leaving it lying for others to tread in, push a pram through or meet while cutting grass.The bins are there, so use them.We wish Rhona Love all the best in her shooting career.

As we stood about on deck while the dishes were being washed a boy from one of the motor boats passed in his dinghy. He was wearing blue shorts and red stockings which brought from the Pilot the remark: #In Brodickyou don’t wear red stockings you might just as well be in Lamlash.#All but the Skipper and Mate went ashore on Centre Island for a stroll. The Major was still completely paralysed in his hind quarters but he was full of spirit and when the Bosun held up his hind legshe galloped along. It was a quiet peaceful evening with a very light northerly breeze but it was distinctly chilly and there was a magnicentsomewhat lurid sunset. The shore party back aboard the Bosun took the Tar off in the dinghy and they landed on Eilean na Beithe and while the former explored the island the latter played on a shingly shore – it was long after dark when they ed.At half past ten we began to turn in and, as always on the first evening, this was a longer business then usual as pillows and blankets had to be allocated and pillowslips put on but by a quarter past eleven we were all in bed and shortly after that a light shower pattered on the deck. The problem of what to do with the Doctor’s mattress was solved by the Pilot double banking his bunk. We were all very glad to have had such a good day for the start.It was noticed that voices were still coming from the ladies’ cabin when the last of us in the main cabin fell asleep.The Tanky brought an innovation to the Fulmar # #Quickies# # a patent washing gadget that saved precious water.We had a dead quiet night with, as far as any of us knew, no rain but the forecast was not good, promising north to north-east winds, force  to  with frequent heavy showers. The glass had continued its steady drop. When we turned out, a light but cold north wind was blowing from a well broken up sky.We had a breakfast of bacon and eggs then the Bosun took the Major ashore for his walk. The latter was possibly a little better and was able to take a few steps on the deck, but ashore on the rough ground could do nothing. While they were ashore the big motor boat with the red-stockinged boy left after very nearly going ashore on Seil Island while getting his anchor aboard.At twenty past ten we were away under engine, but as soon as we were outside the sails went up to the north-easterly breeze and we set off for the Sound of Mull. There was no sign of the swell that is usually met south of Kerrera and we got along quite well, but we could not point any higher than a mile or so south of Loch Don. The Pilot went below and brewed a welcome cup of tea which warmed us up, then we took a tack right up to the south coast of Kerrera and had a close up view of Gylen Castle and the Skipper waxed historical.Putting about again we passed close south of the Potlid Island, but when we were about halfway across to Loch Don the wind died and the strong ebb began to force us south and about the same time the rain came on.The engine was started and we headed up for Duart, but our progress was pitully slow, and indeed at one period we but barely held our ground. The Lady Rock and Lismore Lighthouse seemed never to get any nearer closing. When the engine had run an hour we waited for the first sign of the old familiar falter but none came and we began to hope a cure for its stopping had been effected by replacing the HT coil.This change was a despairing effort made because it was the only thing we had not tried, though all the pundits declare it could not possibly be the cause. The engine would either go or not go, they said, and it would never startthe coil was defective. We got one scare when it staggered for a moment, but the Bosun, who was at the tiller at the time, said we had just passed though a big mass of floating seaweed and may have got some round our propeller.As we were to prove later the cure had been found and the engine ran impeccably all the cruise and the Skipper had a lot of unkind thoughts about all the many professional motor experts who had caused him a great deal of trouble, not a little acute anxiety and more than considerable expense through their failure to diagnose a not very obscure disease.As we came up to the Black Memorial Tower Leonora crossed our bows making for Oban and another yachtpassed close by south bound under engine though by this time quite a reasonable and, for then, favourable breeze was blowing from the north-east and our sails were drawing.We learnt later that the owner’s we would not allow a sail to be set under any conditions as long as she was aboard – a pity, we thought, as she certainly was a lovely job and we felt it would have been betterthe we had decided to stay ashore.At Duart we stopped the engine and were able to make good progress, but the rain got heavier and heavier and our sandwich lunch was taken below in relays. Then at about three with the turn of the tide the wind died completely and the engine was started again. Near the Grey Rocks we saw St Roma coming south under power so we altered course to intercept her then at slow speed turned back the way we had come for a few hundred yards while we exchanged news.We heard a thoroughly bad forecast at mid-day, the wind had gone, the rain was stotting in the glassy sea, and, though the glass had come back only a fraction, we decided to call it a day so, with the Bosun the only dissentient, made for Loch Aline. As we turned inshore at Ardtornish we saw Seewolf to the north of us, becalmed but heading south, and guessed she would be joining us later. Coming in, when between Morven Pier and the Ferry Pier, the Skipper held too close to the west shore and the bottom showed up suddenly far too clearly for our peace of mind and a quick sheer out was necessary.Through the narrows we turned to starboard and anchored at half past four in Kyle Bay in a flat calm and the rain coming down heavier than ever. Gratefully we realised that it was not quite as bitterly cold as it had been out in the Sound.Seewolf came in shortly after going very slowly and Hamish Lawrence called over that he had run a big end and was on his way to Oban for repairs and to hand over to brother Alec and his family. Soon after that we were joined by a small motor boat, Saguenay, flying a blue ensign which, in view of her size, the Skipper was sure she was not entitled to do and then a little later, while we were warming up with some coffee, Lindisfarne arrived and anchored close beside us with Guy Clephane in his usual tremendousform – he’s a proper marvel is Guy.Hamish Lawrence came across in his dinghy and came aboard for a gin and while he was there Guy called over inviting Tanky and the Pilot across to Lindisfarne then sent the Pilot back to Fulmar to fetch the Bosun. Hamish gone, the Skipper began to put nine inch tacklines into our line of flags as we had discovered at Rothesay at the Royal Clyde Centenary Regatta that without them our line was about fteen feet too short and we wanted them to be right for the Queen’s visit to Tobermory.When the Pilot came back he and the Bosun got the tents up as the rain was by then torrential.We had a supper of sausages and beans and while the dishes were being done the Bosun took the Major ashore. He was walking a little bettervery slowly, but there was, unfortunately, no concrete results from his exercise.At nine o’clock we went in two loads across to Seewolf and were offered drinks OR tea, but the Skipper insisted on both. We were, however, not allowed any biscuits with our tea as to have them would have meant opening a new box and broaching Alec Lawrence’s stores. The Tanky had not wanted anything but tea, but Hamish had given her a good strong gin which she tried to hide on a shelf behind her and it was only got rid of when the Pilot took it off her hands and quickly put it to its proper use. The Bosun was drinking beer and when he opened up the tin a goodly portion of it bubbled onto the fitted carpet in the cabin.On board Seewolf were, besides the two paid hands, Hamish’s mother and his two sisters. The old lady, well over eighty, was in grand form and waxed eloquent on #The old days# and the greatness of #Belshaft#. Also on board was a great big collie who was obviously petted and spoilt beyond measure and he behaved more like a lap dog than the great big clumsy creature he was.It was half past eleven before we went back to Fulmar all in one load with little enough freeboard for the dinghy considering the conditions. There was a nasty little lop on the water, the northerly wind was bitterly cold, and the rain was as heavy as ever. As quickly as possible we got below and into our warm bunks, not even the Bosun wasting any time about it, though he did read for some time after all the rest were sound asleep."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast podcast episode 10 nessie and the lost golf balls","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWelcome to Episode  of the Oban Time#s BOBcast.Charting Bob#s progress  and discussing lots of things golfare  presenters Stephen Day, George Graham, Martin Laing and Keith McIntyre.

As part of this project the fund provided MACPool with seven aqua cycles and training from Hydrorider.Arriving early to take photogaphs of the others giving these bikes a go, any sense of nervousness was set aside as I watched healthcare professionals and fitness and well-being enthusiasts laugh and chat through their shot.After some quick adjustments to the bikes June, from our advertising department, and I were raring to go.Partially submerged, the feeling of being weightless combined with the resistance of the water as we began peddling was initially a bit odd. As we got used to the feeling, we started to speed things up, pretending we were racing the rest of our group to The Cairnbaan for a gin and tonic.Finding our rhythm, instructor Kathryn Craig began to lead us through arm exercises. Our co-ordination was put to the test as we carried on cycling while doing simple arm movements that felt more impactive due to the water resistance. Then for the real challenge # floating off the back of the bike while continuing to pedal – not an easy taskyou are short-legged but a workout that feels like it is doing you the power of good.For me aqua cycling is everything I hoped it would be – a fun, impactiveand enjoyable way of exercising. And I could still walk after it!With no aches and pains the next day and still smiling, I signed up for some of the classes.Classes y in intensity and are currently running on Tuesdays from .-.pm, Wednesday evenings from .-.pm and Saturdays from  .-.am.

Editor Andrew McQuarrie grabbed a torch, pulled on his big-boy trousers and joined the funhellipIt was .pm on a Saturday night and I was trying to communicate with a supernatural beingusing a pair of copper rods.Having done as instructed and asked the tools a simple lsquoYes Norsquo question, I was slightly dismayed to see the rods stubbornly remaining still, the spirit apparently refusing to play ball.Sheila, an employee of UK Ghost Nights, appeared quite perplexed as her eyes darted between me and the rods.ldquoAre you a sceptic  she asked, a faint edge of suspicion laced in her voice.I admitted that I was indeed a sceptic, but one who was more than willing to be converted into a true believer.Happy with this answer, Sheila ushered me into a corner that was, she said, known to be particularly popular with spirits.ldquoAre we in Melrose  I asked the rods, willing them to show even the smallest hint of movement.But after a full minute of tense observation, it was plain to see the equipment would not co-operate.An hour earlier, when the ghost experts were delivering their briefing, they had promised the  paying customers that ldquonothing is fabricated on the tours.The insinuation, it seemed to me, was that this would likely not be a night of high drama and theatrics.Nevertheless, I couldnrsquot help but feel a bit disappointed that my opening bid to converse with the dead had fallen distinctly flat.And over the next four hours, so it would prove, my luck would not change much.Yet, as I wandered the portrait-lined corridors of the George  Abbotsford Hotel, trying to channel my inner Bill Murray, some of the people to whom I spoke offered compelling tales.Few were as gripping as those delivered by Dawn Barrett - owner of the hotel for the last  months - and her cooking team.Among the unusual goings-on noted by Mrs Barrett, for instance, were lights turning on and off on their own, furniture moving around, footsteps at all hours and even the feeling of her hair being brushed.Asked for her views on the supernatural, Mrs Barrett said: ldquoI definitely believe - Irsquove seen and heard too much now.It was Mrs Barrett herself who contacted UK Ghost Nights in the first place, with the aim of getting to the root of what makes the hotel tick.ldquoI want to know why they [spirits] are here. I donrsquot understand how they can put lights on and off. I just want to understand it more, she said.Head chef Kailee Reidie, , spoke of an alarming encounter with a spirit who has come to be known as John, supposedly a grouchy ex-chef.As Kailee turned on the fryer one evening, while she was alone in the kitchen, her hair was pulled back so sharply that she was thrown into the table behind her, banging her head.ldquoAs soon as I turned my back on him [John], thatrsquos when it happened, recalled Kailee, going on to explain her emotions at the time.ldquoI was in shock because I knew he [John] was there, but Irsquom not a big believer in ghostshellip Irsquove never seen John - itrsquos just a feeling.Just a feeling. Well, there was certainly a sense of foreboding in some areas of the building - not least the cellar and the attic.In one of the attic rooms, we indulged in an activity called the lsquohuman pendulumrsquo. This entails three people standing in a row, with the person in the middle acting as the spiritrsquos means of communication.When the spirit is asked a Yes No question, the piggy in the middle is expected to rock forwards for a lsquoYesrsquo and backwards for a lsquoNorsquo - a movement being directed by the answering spirit.One by one, the customers lined up to participate in this creepy experiment, watched by the rest of the room with a mixture of excitement and dread.Time and again, the spiritrsquos presence was well felt. In fact, there turned out to be a number of obliging spirits, each surprisingly keen to answer questions including, lsquoDo you have childrenrsquo  and lsquoAre you happy with us being herersquo As I watched this circus unfold, I was praying Irsquod be able to endure the entire episode as an observer, a witness to the craziness.Not so much because I was scared - although I was a little, I must admit - but more because I knew what would happen.,params: .pushldquoAndrew, would you like to have a shot in the middle What followed was several minutes of embarrassment for everyone.Because of course I didnrsquot move. Not even an inch. And the change in atmosphere was so marked that I genuinely wonderedmy trousers had somehow dropped to my ankles without my noticing.Thankfully, my clothes had remained bound to my body, but any faith I might have had in the ghost-hunting process was sliding away fast.As the tour continued, taking in several other locations promising ldquohigh activity, it became increasingly dficult to muster the energy to stay alert, with the clock ticking into the wee small hours.That said, there was one incident which aroused a certain degree of puzzlement - a maglite which appeared to flash when certain questions were posed.Admittedly, that was a curious development. But still not enough to push me into the camp of believers.The more I dwelt on the nightrsquos events, however, the more I came to realise the deeper signicance of it all.Before the tour, UK Ghost Nights founder Lisa Tedstill had made sure I was aware of the crucial equipment to bring.ldquoAll you need is a torch and a sense of humour, she said, going on to lay her finger on the true essence of the affair.ldquoWe donrsquot guarantee there will be any paranormal activity - anyone who does that is a charlatan.ldquoBut we can guarantee everybody will have a very fun experience.And, indeed, while I may have left the George  Abbotsford that night without a firmer belief in ghosts, I certainly ed home with a smile."},{"url":null,"title":"council-powers-handed-chief-meetings-scrapped","story":"PLANS to hand Scottish Borders Councilchief Tracey Logan delegated control of decision-making are expected to be rubber-stamped this week.It comes hot on the heels of Prime Minister Boris Johnsonrsquos instruction that everyone in the UK should spend most of their time at home in order to counter the coronavirus outbreak.But on Thursday , in an unprecedented move, proposals to temporarily delegate the local authorityrsquos decision-making responsibility to the Chief Executive will be passed.Council meetings in Newtown St Boswells will be cancelled until September , with the exception of vital committee meetings which will be done through video-conferencing.SBC chief legal officer Nuala McKinlay stated: ldquoAs the virus makes a wider impact on public le, Scottish Borders Council must consider how to respond.\"In taking any decision to protect health by limiting social contact, it must also ensure processes are in place to enable it to continue to make urgent decisions.ldquoIn order to allow decisions to be made, it is proposed that all those decision-making s of council which can lawfully be delegated, be delegated to the chief executive to be made in consultation with members and relevant senior officers.It is also proposed that any committee meetings which do need to take place between now and October will be held via remote video links.Ms McKinlay added: ldquoThe Local Government in Scotland Act  allows a local authority to y that process and conduct a meeting by other ways.

Viruses like coronavirus cannot live outside the body for very long.What are the symptoms The NHS states that the symptoms are: a dry cough, high temperature and shortness of breath - but these symptoms do not necessarily mean you have the illness. Look out for flu-like symptoms, such as aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose and a sore throat. Itrsquos important to remember that some people may become infected but wonrsquot develop any symptoms or feel unwell.What precautions can be taken Washing your hands with soap and water thoroughly.

Viruses like coronavirus cannot live outside the body for very long.The NHS states that the symptoms are: a dry cough, high temperature and shortness of breath - but these symptoms do not necessarily mean you have the illness.

It was so strange not being able to give each other a hug, as we have always done over the past  years of our friendship.I chose a walk in which I hoped we would meet nobody , and we walked two metres apart. Despite our plan not to talk about the virus, we inevitably ended up doing just that, although not all the time.The walk took us to the site of the old Byres Kirk, just beyond Ormiston. As hoped, it was deserted, and so we entered.The eeriness of current events affected my behaviour. I walked around with my friend, carefully ensuring I touched nothing. The original kirk built here in  is long gone. It replaced an even older kirk, the remains of which are hidden in private woodland next to nearby Ormiston Hall not far from this site.The first kirk at Byres was eventually demolished and replaced by a neo-gothic building in the s. But after the opening of a new church in Ormiston in the s, Byres Kirk was finally abandoned and eventually demolished in the s.But the graves remain, including war graves, and there is also a headstone erected by Isabella Burns, sister of the famous poet, to the memory of her children.It was this headstone I had come to see. Isabella was the youngest sister of Robert Burns and she lived in Ormiston and Tranent for a while. In  she was widowed, with nine children, three girls and six boys. She set up a village school to help make ends meet.Itrsquos dficult to imagine what her le must have been like, but I think the fact she was part of Robert Burnsrsquo immediate family may have given her a status and a degree of respect most women were denied.I found the stone and was intrigued by it. Two of Isabellarsquos children are mentioned one of them, Edward, died at the age of  in China.ldquoChina  I said out loud to myself, wondering what he was doing there. I saw the date of his death: November , .Then it dawned on me: the Opium Wars! He must have been a soldier. I quickly Googled it on my phone and sure enough he was serving in a regiment there.I stood for a moment, thinking about the story behind this scant piece of information. The Opium Wars are not usually a prominent part of our history curriculum, although they should be. The British state went to war with China to safeguard the ability of British traders to sell opium to the Chinese, which resulted in  million addicts there. Itrsquos a dark part of our imperial history, and the fact that a nephew of Robert Burns ended up dead in China defending state-sponsored drug smuggling by Britain seemed horribly ironic and sad. But it also gave me a sense of the connectedness we all have. The decisions people make, especially those in power, affect the lives of others in ways we will never know or predict.The memorial headstone also had a later inscription which recorded the death of Isabella herself. She lived until she was  and died in . She isnrsquot buried in this graveyard, however, as she spent the last years of her le in Ayrshire and was laid to rest in Alloway Kirkyard.Such a web of le and connection, now mostly long forgotten, revealed by this one memorial stone.As I left, I noticed the trees: oak, sycamore, beech and yew. They seemed to grow out of lost human memory, asthey were now s of forgotten stories.On ourjourney to the car, we passed another memorial stone, this time to the Polish soldiers who had been based in Ormiston Hall in the s during the war. This too is now a time of memory fading, but not forgotten, as the flowers someone left revealed.We had succeeded in a walk seeing almost nobody, except a passing cyclist at the end. Next time we go on such a walk, spring will have arrived undisturbed by human footprints. Keeping people safe must be the priority.Although it was an unusually sombre walk, we found time to laugh and see the funny side of things too. We have to live le, make the best of our time, and the times, we have.And when we can once again regularly venture into naturersquos wonders, what an extra special gt it will seem."},{"url":null,"title":"sleep-boost-prestonpans-youngster-charity-dad-supported-lends-hand","story":"Murray Scott, , liveswith broadcaster dad Mark,  mum Laura, , a supply classroom assistant at The Hub at Sandersonrsquos Wynd Primary School and sister Sophie, seven, a pupil at Prestonpans Primary School.Murray, who attends The Hub in Tranent, has a partially deleted chromosome which affects his development and brain.The condition also affects Murrayrsquos spine and hips he is unable to walk or talk, is doubly incontinent and is tube fed.Murray also has epilepsy and reduced vision, and for the first eight years of his le was unable to sleep through the night.Mark said: ldquoHe was born with it ndash itrsquos a chromosome disorder which neither of us [mum and dad] carries.ldquoHe would have been  months when we got the diagnosis ndash at that point he was one of  [sufferers] in the world.Murray is described by his family as a ldquoreally happy, content wee boy, and ldquoreally good natured.

support developers are already seeing applications for public meetings lodged without a date or venue for exhibiting future proposals.And Tony Thomas, director of APT Planning  Development in East Linton, says ensuring the building industry is ready to resume as soon as possible may mean future consultations have to be carried out on websites.Mr Thomas revealed that one consultation had already begun online as Queensberry Properties launched a website inviting feedback on its proposals for Finance House in Edinburgh.The website was launched after a planned second public consultation this month had to be cancelled and gives people a chance to view the plans to turn the former office building into residential accommodation with associated commercial and leisure facilities.And it could be the way people are consulted in the future as more companies look at ways to engage with the public without face-to-face gatherings.The first public stage of planning applications for large developments is lodging a pre-application noticewith a council informing them that public consultation meetings are being held.The meetings, which usually take place in town halls or community centres, give local residents a chance to see the proposals for the first time, talk to developers and give their views.However, that crucial stage is on hold for some developments after the lockdown, which prohibits gatherings of more than two people.At Millerhill, Midlothian, a pre-application notice for housing at Wellington Farm on land known as Dukersquos Field has been lodged with no date or venue for the public exhibition.In a note to the council, the developers have said: ldquoIn light of Governmentadvice which seeks to minimise the spread of coronavirus, non-essential contact is limited at his time.ldquoWe are therefore awaiting the advice of the Scottish Government before making any formal arrangements for pre-application public engagement.Mr Thomas said it was vital for the industry that companies were ready to resume work as soon as possible.He said: ldquoThe approach to all aspects of the planning process is very much an emerging issue.ldquoThe authorities are working hard to continue lsquoas normalrsquo whilst working remotely and this is hugely appreciated.ldquoIt will be important that as and when restrictions are lted the development industry is ready to respond quickly.ldquoFrom a workload perspective, most clients are looking to progress with projects that are already in the pipeline and to be fair the alternative would be catastrophic for a sector that feels peaks and troughs very quickly.ldquoWhere public consultation is still proposed programmed, the only way to achieve this will be to set up a dedicated website with the ability to post

At a crucial time in the survival of the language, graduates have helped create a Gaelic speaking workforce that now holds key posts across a wide range of sectors in Scotland.Sabhal Mograver Ostaig is one of the key partners in fulfilling the governmentrsquos objectives in the National Gaelic Plan, which aims to increase the number of people speaking the language and accelerate the growth of Gaelic.Many people are keen to learn more about the language because of its rich culture and the college provides a wide range of short courses in Gaelic language, song and traditional music. Ceilidhs, workshops, conversation circles and music sessions all create an encouraging atmosphere that bring together students from  countries across five continents.As a modern, innovative college, Sabhal Mograver Ostaig has excellent learning resources on campus including an exceptional library collection, residential student accommodation, broadcast and recording facilities and a Gaelic medium childcare facility on site. It also has a growing international reputation for academic research.The college was founded on the principle of being part of the local and wider community and its activities are greatly enhanced by co-operative links, being home to a number of signicant national creative and cultural projects such as Tobar an Dualchais, Ainmean Agraveite na h-Alba and Cagravenan Graphics Studio. It plays a leading role in the promotion of the Gaelic arts and culture and also offers an international exchange programme with universities in Canada and Ireland.The collegersquos graduates include Seumas Greumach , Chief Executive of An Comunn Gaidhealach, which runs the Royal National Mod, who studied the Cugraversa Comais in  and then ed for another year to study Cagravenan is Cultar na Gagraveidhlig.

Those who commit themselves to months alone at sea in the name of le-changing moments, philanthropy and legacies.It was in  that The Sunday Times announced the award of a trophy, The Golden Globe, for the first person to sail single-handed and non-stop around the world. The event was the first organised, non-stop race around the world for iniduals. Those attempting to make the journey had little understanding of how the experience would pan out or how their minds would cope with a year in isolation.The only sailor to complete and therefore win this first feat was Sir Robin Knox-Johnston, who crossed the finish line after  days alone at sea. Knox-Johnston once said: ldquoYou donrsquot really knowyour brain will stay sane. Your sense of humour is absolutely essential.Now a sailing legend, Knox-Johnston founded the famed Clipper Yacht Race, an event he started so that everyone who wanted it ldquocould have the opportunity to experience the challenge and sheer exhilaration of ocean racing.Sir Robin spoke on the current pandemic on his Twitter feed stating: ldquoBack from the Philippines, the crews now home and the boats sitting for the next - months by which time we hope this virus will be history.\"Now in self-imposed isolation for which my past has trained me perfectly. Look after yourselves everyone.A physical challenge on the surface, ocean racing is fundamentally a mental marathon. An endurance test for the mind to adapt in an ever-changing and high-risk environment.As the power and effect of the pandemic takes hold of the world, the constant change of climate and influx of data leads for new adaptions every day. This is an environment not dissimilar to the challenges faced by iniduals who take on these solo excursions.As a marine marketing agency, Gordon Ritchie, director of GRM Marketing, continues: ldquoDealing with offshore yacht racing and rowing can bring out the best in you. All of the small teams or iniduals are normal people doing extraordinary things.\"They are all well planned and determined. They all have a complete resolve to overcome any challenge placed in front of them and are determined to get to the start line ... that can be just as dficult as getting to the finish line where the risk lies mainly with the team or inidual.GRM is no stranger to supporting sailors and rowers making their way to the start line ready to embark on psychological journeys of self-isolation out at sea.The Talisker Whisky Atlantic Challenge is a -mile rowing race beginning in La Gomera in the Canary Islands and ending in Nelsonrsquos Harbour, Antigua. The race can take anything from a record-breaking  days to four, back-breaking months.This year, GRM supported two teams in this race named \"The Worldrsquos Toughest Row\", BROAR as they made their way to the start line and HMS Oardacious in PR during their final stages. In December, team HMS Oardacious became the fastest serving military team to cross the Atlantic and raised nearly pound, to provide mental health and wellbeing support to their submarine community for The Royal Navy and Royal Marines Charity. The charity aims to support personnel, veterans and families as they overcome challenges faced during and after service.Following the impact of the pandemic, mental health has arrived back at the forefront of many online and government discussions. With businesses facing collapse, iniduals facing job losses and with millions now confined to their homes, this pandemic is predicted to move from a physical crisis to a mental one.The anticipation of lockdown and self-isolation has been the anxiety-inducing issue facing iniduals worldwide as we adapt to this new normal. It will take a period of adjustment, but as in all situations and challenges we adapt, and can in time prosper.As serving submariners in the Royal Navy, HMS Oardacious shared their unique insight on self-isolation when embarking on the Talisker Atlantic Challenge.Lieutenant Hugo Mitchell-Heggs explained: ldquoAs a Royal Navy submariner we are well versed with spending extended periods of time deployed, isolated from society, our loved ones and what most would consider home comforts.He continued: ldquoSettling into a routine and being creative is fundamental to onersquos own wellbeing. Itrsquos never easy settling into a new pattern, and even for submariners, the first week at sea is often the most challenging.\"We also observed this on our ocean row, adapting to each other and our teamrsquos dynamic, to our new diet, safety culture and challenging environment. Twenty-foot waves and gale-force winds from day one was challenging, but with the right mindset we adapted and found ways to not just survive but also thrive.\"The benefits of a routine, and building things to look forward to in your day are a fundamental tactic for maintaining motivation and positivity while self-isolating.\"He said the value of a routine was that it \"provides structure to the working day, to the week and to the whole deployment patrol which can often go on for months on end\".\"Nutrition, exercise and mental stimulation are fundamental to thriving. During the ocean crossing, physical stimulation was aplentybut keeping our mental stimulation took being both creative and adaptable: audiobooks, podcasts, Christmas day karaokeand most importantly, conversation with our crew mates ndash whether it was jokes, banter or a lsquodeep and meaningfulrsquo while rowing under a moonlit sky.Upon speaking to Mitchell-Heggs and taking time to reflect, it becomes clear that in this period of crisis, we as a society have found great dficulty in the removal of the freedom to see those that we look forward to seeing, or the cancellation of events we look forward to experiencing. Holidays were the first to go, then events and gigs, now seeing friends and loved ones. What we now need to do is to find things in a simple day routine to look forward to.Your evening meal, your FaceTime to a friend, your weekly trip to the grocery store. Like the submariners who look forward to their short slot in the gym, or their two-minute shower, happiness, contentment and in the extreme, sanity, are found in the simplest of tasks. The tasks we, on a day-to-day, take advantage of being able to do.Nicola Sturgeon explains of these unprecedented restrictions ldquole shouldnrsquot feel normal right now. Soyour le still feels entirely normal, ask yourselfyou are doing the right things. Every time you think about meeting up with, or coming into physical contact with other people, ask yourselfit is entirely necessary\".What also becomes apparent when discussing isolation and its mental challenges are the importance of the snippets of communication and information that keep spirits up when iniduals are miles from the coast or deep beneath the sea.Finding a source of creativity, communicating, staying active is key to survival, as is remaining positive and having a laugh.Though being at sea adds in a whole number of dangers, the general population today faces saying goodbye to their loved ones with no foreseeable end in sight. The concept of self-isolation, a once-unfamiliar term to the masses, has now become every inidualrsquos reality.In the coming months, we will see the effects of this new \"self-isolation\" and begin to understand the trials that sailors, rowers and explorers endure when taking on challenges that disconnect them physically from the outside world.Gordon Ritchie continues: ldquoIn the light of the Covid- outbreak we should consider that we are now at the start line and all we have to do is complete the challenge and get to the finish line.\"The common outcome is that everyone will have gained a lot from the journey, and be in a much better place when the champagne is uncorked.In this time, it is worthwhile to challenge yourself, try something new, learn something, donrsquot stagnate.\"If we can do it isolated in the middle of an ocean, anyone can do it from the luxurious comfort of their homes and with that constant connectivity, muses Lieutenant Mitchell-Heggs.How to beat isolation, by Sir Robin Knox-Johnston\"Isolation can be incredibly frustrating. But it does not have to be.\"People ask how did I manage  days alone at sea, but the answer is that I was constantly busy. I had a boat to sail, navigate , maintain, steer, plus feed myself. But in that lies the answer, create a project to focus the mind and pass the time.\"If you are a yachtsman, you can learn and practice your knots, or how to throw a line ashore. If you are a landsman, well those knots are always useful.\"Bear in mind I had no one to talk with. No communications at all for most of the time, so I had to think of things that would keep me mentally stimulated. I took to learning poetry. We have wonderful poetry in the English language, but anything that makes the mind work is good.\"Now many of us are staying at home with time on our hands, we could put the time to good use. It might amuse children as well.\"Knots are something many of us use daily so why not practice them, and learn a few new ones  It will keep those skills you have learned fresh for when you can get outside and for my Clipper Race Crew ndash when you re-join your boats next year.\"You have probably seen lines thrown from a boat that donrsquot cover the distance, or get tangled on their way. I suggest you go out into the garden with a rope and practice to develop this skill. A quick tip is to make two coils, not too large, and throw the smaller one allowing the larger one to unravel as the first one extends.\"Isolation is something we are going to have to get used to for the next few weeks. I had  days of it, but I had plenty to do during that period which made the time pass reasonably quickly. So there is the answer. Create a project to fill the time.\"I cannot get over to my boats where there is always something to do, so the garden furniture is getting sanded and re-painted and then I will have to face up to the long put-off job of sorting out everything in my Man Cave, apart from sorting out our new Clipper Race schedule, of course.\""},{"url":null,"title":"Rosemary Goring  39 s Country Life  the wonders of a walk on the wild side","story":"A friend who moved from London to Edinburgh before finally settling in a village in the Highlands, was quick to disabuse me of my perambulating dreams. In the city itrsquos easy to clock up miles on foot without even noticing, simply going about daily le. In the country, much of what you do requires a car or bus. Unless you have a dog ndash and a great many people round here do ndash it would be possible to live in the lap of hills, heath and woodlands without stepping beyond the garden gate in good weather and the front door in bad. This friend can go for months without getting her crampons on.Yet it is hard resist the call of the wild. On fine weekdays, as I sit at my desk, I hear the villagersquos retirees clumping past in their hiking boots, leaving base for an attempt on the nearby peaks, or merely a gentle stroll along the riverbank. Hoolet has more than its fair share of Munro-baggers, lean folk with the legs of grasshoppers and enough puff to inflate a hot-air balloon. There are so many dedicated walkers, in fact, that it probably partly explains why theyrsquove chosen to live here. Whatever the starting point, there are enough paths and trails to carry you across the borderlands and deep into Northumberland without using a drop of petrol.Another of my northern chums ndash she works on farms but still has the face of an English rose ndash has been planning a visit with her pony. She hopes to ride through Roxburghshire to Lindisfarne, a journey of  or  miles. As she BBs her way south, she requires not just bed, bacon and scrambled eggs but a basket for her sheep dog and grazing for her packhorse.Few things are more frustrating than not being able to stretch your legs because yoursquore working, knowing that others are out there having fun. My husband is often one of them, ing bright-eyed, invigorated, and caked in mud. He could feature in a detergent ad, though moleskins and scratchy socks coated in a rich chocolatey goo are not as photogenic as grubby football strips or toddlers drenched in spaghetti sauce.When I do get out, however, there is nothing quite like it. I can either walk up the back garden and out of the gate through the sheep field towards the lower slopes of the hills, or head into the village until I reach the woods. The first route takes me past cherry trees that in summer are laden with fruit, dangling from every branch assomeone has gone overboard decorating the Christmas tree. Itrsquos no wonder the place is alive with birds, who can gorge themselves on a daily replenished source of fruit, nuts, seeds, and the insects that nibble among them. With the squirrels getting back up to speed after winter, competition will soon heat up.One of our bird feeders fell out of the apple tree last week, thanks, I suspect, to a swinging squirrel that chases off the finches and blue tits whenever it swarms up the tree trunk. I watched the other morning as it dangled upside down from the summerhouse roof, desperate to find a way into the new feeder wersquove hung there, specially designed to keep it out. So far itrsquos showing far more interest than the birds. Who knows, maybe it willwith wire-cutters Up in the woods I once followed a squirrel that ran ahead of me for half a mile, turning to peer over its shoulder every few seconds asto make sure I was keeping up. Occasionally Irsquove come across roe deer, who take a startled look before leaping away like show jumpers. These woods are my favourite part of the walk, beech masts crunching underfoot, and thick drts of leaves hiding treacherous roots and holes. Thanks to the abundance of larches and pines, I sometimes catch the scent of the aftershave my father used to wear. And, even when rain is thundering, the canopy is so dense that in here it is dry.Itrsquos another world when you emerge from cover and start climbing. Leaf mould gives way to gorse and heather and a rutted track. We once met a man leading his horse as he bent double poring over the ground. He was retracing the route where, at some point, he had dropped his car keys. We took his number in case we came upon them, but yoursquod need a metal detector out here to have any chance. Scree and boulders, waist-high bracken and swamps of moss could swallow anything pocket-sized for the rest of eternity.By this point itrsquos high enough to catch a breeze, even on virtually windless days. Out on the hilltops themselves it can blow so hard that not just untethered hats are in danger but even sunglasses can go flying. Yet blustery or calm, sodden or sunny, the view from the summit stops time in its tracks.Spread out below is a peaceful landscape of fields and trees, sheep and cattle, and the occasional dawdling car. The hazy blue Cheviot hills fade into the distance, snow still clinging. In one direction lies the nearest town, dinky as Lego. In the other the horizon disappears much as it has for centuries. On my favourite peak, in fact, there is evidence of bronze age settlement, the trace of ancient forebears right beneath our feet.Itrsquos a reminder that, geology apart, what you see from up here is a largely manmade picture, the product of aeons of habitation and cultivation. Despite, or perhaps because of, that, getting a larkrsquos eye view is a great leveller. This vantage point invites you to think of those who came before, and those who are to follow. It also heightens respect for those creatures working ceaselessly to survive, never knowing what tomorrow holds.

At a time like this, a complex, profit-drivensystem which links healthcare with employment status is particularly likely to fail.The notoriously ungenerous welfare system only compounds this. Many people will feel compelled to keep working rather than following instructions to stay at home. The additions to unemployment benefit announced in the support package are unlikely to provide much reassurance for those in this situation.Demographics is also key. Much of the interior of this vast country, including many of the southern states and rural areas, are poor and poorly resourced to a level that would astound many Europeans. If they are short of ventilators and hospital beds in New York, I dread to think what it will be like in rural Arkansas and Mississippi, where higher proportions of the population are elderly, infirm, unemployed and uninsured.But, as Mr Trumprsquos popularity in some of these places affirms, there are other fundamental issues at play. Many Americans distrust the very idea of the state, and their in-built inidualism may make them balk at the idea of having freedoms curtailed. They have no experience of the state having this much direct control over their lives, no experience in living memory of sacricing personal freedoms, as Europeans did during the Second World War. I note with concern that in some parts of the US there has been a rush on guns as well as toilet paper.This is also the most ided of nations, along political, geographical, economic and religious lines, which plays into a narrative of suspicion and rage. Only two weeks ago, while visiting the southern states, I spoke to people who believed coronavirus had been created by China in retaliation for US trade tarfs. Others talked of it being a plague sent by God to punish sinners.Even a well-run administration would have been up against it. As it stands, Mr Trumprsquos response, strewn with delay, contrary messages and personal insults, may already have cost lives.Despite the worry I feel for my American family, I want to end on a positive. I have no doubt the ingenuity, tenaciousness and \"can do\" attitude of people there, that other strand of the inidualism mentioned earlier, will play an important role in how the world tackles this crisis in the months ahead. On this front, I hope America continues to be the home of the brave."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/11209456.jpg?type=article-full","title":"coronavirus-scottish-airline-grounds-half-staff-slashes-lifeline-services","story":"The leline services Scottish airline said it has advised its staff of the \"probability\"of furlough under the Governments Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme.The Scottish airline, which gets subsidies from the Scottish Government for some remote routes, has now been confirmed that of its  staff are now \"in storage\", as further cuts are made.In mid-March Loganair said that by the end of the month, Loganair was to cutoperations from around  to  scheduled flights each weekday - a cut of %.Now it has emerged that number has been cut further to just  a day - meaning it is running just % of normal services.Loganair, which also delivers mail and goods, including pharmaceutical products, to island airports previously said forward bookings had slumped dramatically from normal levesl.The further cutbeing made to services, leaves it with askeleton schedule of essential air services to operate within Scotland, to and from the Isle of Man and on two routes supporting critical workers in the offshore industry at Aberdeen.:Coronavirus -Scottish leline services airline will seek government bailoutIt is not clear yet, what the extent of the further cuts will mean in terms of total flights.At present, services are planned to resume on a selection of key routes April  and on others from May  but the airline said these dates will be subject to \"further review\" depending on the prevailing national circumstances and consequent demand for travel.\"The services provided in the meantime will be to facilitate travel only for those with an essential need, such as workers in designated critical professions and others covered by the latest Government advice.

If, as other experts have suggested, we could be confined to some degree or another for six months, there are going to be an awful lot of cases of cabin fever.I speak from some experience since, for a iety of reasons, not all directly a result of the coronavirus outbreak, Irsquove been confined to quarters for more than five weeks now. I havenrsquot quite reached the stage of cooking and eating my own shoes, like Chaplin in The Gold Rush, but things have definitely become a little weird.Thatrsquos the more peculiar since, for the most part, my normal routine hasnrsquot actually altered very much.Like a lot of freelancers, I hardly ever left the house anyway, even before all this started. I canrsquot remember who it waswho claimed that a writerrsquos aim should be not to go out, and real success was not having to leave your bed. But even for those of us with Proustian or ndash letrsquos be honest ndash bone-idle tendencies, therersquos a marked psychological dference, somehow, when yoursquore not allowed to.This is trivial, of course, when measured against the problems of those who are actually unwell, those who are working flat out tending to them, or those who are experiencing anxieties about work or money as a result of the lockdown.But the mental health aspect of isolating huge swathes of the population is a potentially serious issue, as will become apparent the longer these restrictions apply. And there are, naturally, implications for those with strained domestic arrangements or, worse, where there is the threat of abuse.The questions that have been asked, sometimes jocularly, about the lockdownrsquos effect on the orce and birth rates will probably turn out to have real, and perhaps worrying, demographic effects.The mathematician and philosopher Blaise Pascal declared in  that ldquoAll humanityrsquos problemrsquos stem from manrsquos inability to sit quietly in a room alone. As is often the case with the best-known apercus, Pascalrsquos broader point wasnrsquot quite as blunt as that . It turns out, however, that there is a scientic basis for the claim.Researchers at the University of Virginia, in a trial conducted  years after Pascalrsquos insight, asked volunteers to sit quietly in a room for  minutes with only their own thoughts to occupy them. The only rules were that they couldnrsquot getout of their chair or fall asleep. The room also contained a button that would give them an unpleasant electric shock ndash which they tried out at the beginning of the experiment.Faced with the prospect of doing nothing but think pleasant thoughts for under a quarter of an hour,  per cent of the men in the study chose instead to give themselves another electric shock. At the moment, the vast majority of the population appears to be complying with the restrictions placed upon them with remarkable good cheer, but the real test will come when they begin to chafe at their constraints the danger is that that moment may come before it is safe to start ing to something like normal le. That, one assumes,was the thinking behind holding off on a general quarantine until the point when it would be most effective.But notions of what constitutes normal le may sht I now find myself mildly surprised when a film or television programme shows more than a couple of people in a scene, asphysical proximity, or the concept of a dinner party, had been relegated to the realms of the fantastic.A visit to the supermarketis already a distinctly surreal experience, evenyoursquore lucky enough to locate eggs or toilet roll.Even with plenty to read, watch or listen to, and even though many of us are still able to work, more or less as usual, from home, it turns out to be surprisingly dficult to do nothing.A few motivated souls, like the Abbeacute Faria in Monte Cristo, may be galvanised by their confinement into self-improvement, but I think that most of us,wersquore honest, know in our heart of hearts that wersquore not actually going to spend the next couple of months productively, learning a language or a musical instrument, and probably not even clearing out the cupboard underneath the stairs.Indeed, we should all be praying that some projects never get off the ground, or wersquore going to get, for one thing, lots of very bad novels with titles like Love in the Time of Coronavirus.Itrsquos possible that people might get better at cooking, since being cooped up tends to make you start thinking about what to have for dinner shortly after breakfast. The dficulty is that you wonrsquot have the ingredients, since a large part of effective cookery is daily shopping, which we canrsquot do any more. About the best we can hope for is that someone comes up with an exciting new recipe involving dried pulses.We constantly seek ersion and activity, though part of us knows that they make us wretched we know that happiness is found in rest and not excitement, but we remain restless.

The gist of this work is to highlight the way in which Western society has become chronically attached to a new morality of safety, become risk conscious and prone to over-react to events, like the emergence of diseases.Take a look back at the number of times the World Health Organisation or Western governments have incorrectly predicted mass deaths from diseases. They tend to get it wrong with remarkable consistency.Does that mean Covid- is being exaggerated  Not necessarily but it does mean that we should not presume that government approaches are simply scientic and not to be questioned.The second trend of note is what has been called a culture of misanthropy. Expressed most grotesquely by Extinction Rebellion who see humans as a virus, this people-hating sentiment can encourage us to think the worst of one another. At a time of fear and with a state clampdown on movement, it can encourage the worst kind of curtain-twitching behaviour.Finally, perhaps the most dangerous trend in recent times is the attack on freedom of speech and academic freedom. This trend has developed alongside the elevation of safety and misanthropy, and reflects, at best, a conservative, or defensive attitude taken by institutions who play it safe when controversy is in the air.It is the most important of issues because it is through open, unencumbered discussion and debate about the most important issues that we are able to raise and just as importantly, counter, claims made for and against government and state action.As the American Jonathan Rauch argues, freedom of speech is the basis of a genuine social science because it ensures that we do not block the way to inquiry."},{"url":null,"title":"climber-conquers-282-munros-one-winter","story":"Kevin Woods, , started on Ben More on the Isle of Mull last December , the day of the winter solstice, and passed the halfway mark amid the icy peaks of the Grey Corries in Lochaber at the start of February.February proved to be a tough month, with six days of enforced rest ndash especially frustrating as he was in top fitness condition and he had only needed one days respite from the hills in January. He advanced slowly in relentlessly bad weather, but by mid-February a stomach bug struck, thwarting his plans for Ben Klibreck in Sutherland.Back on top form again by February , he headed for the notorious Cuillins on Skye. No place for solo climbing, he took a rope and climbing companion for safety.First, he tackled the Inaccessible Pinnacle, Scotlands most dficult summit, now plastered in ice. In deteriorating weather, plans to finish the ridge were postponed, and he completed that task in early March with Scotlands top climber Dave MacLeod.Mr Woods ed to Wester Ross from Skye to find piles of fresh snow, and ploughed an exhausting, knee-deep trench from  metres to the summit of Maol Chean-dearg above Loch Carron.In March, winter ed with a vengeance. He spent many of his hill hours in what climbers call \"the white room\" ndash when the snow-covered ground merges with flying spindrt and mist, and the horizon disappears. These disorienting conditions require meticulous compass navigation to proceed safely.March  on Carn Eighe and its two satellite peaks above Glen Affric was such a day. Mr Woods recalls: \"Snow and high winds were roaring up the glens, and in the corrie I could barely see my feet, the spindrt was so bad. I was close to turning around and amazed to reach the summit. The cold was brutal.\"He debated whether to continue to the next two peaks: \"To go on or not  I almost didnt. But the weather eased slightly, so I pressed on, feeling this enormous rush of straying into the wilds ndash extending the thread deeper into the mountains. It would all have to be retraced step by step.\"In Glen Affric, he had hoped for four peaks in one day, but conditions made him stop at the first, Tom aChoinnich. Ferocious winds and impassable, raging rivers were too much of a challenge, although frustratingly he felt he had plenty of physical reserves left.\"The hills were still reeling from a rapid overnight thaw,\" he explained. \"The glen was deep in soft snow and slush, and the rivers were flooding torrents. Conditions win again! Today felt short, but the full round of those hills would have been a futile war of attrition ndash there was no middle way.\"With snow falling once again, he drove east on slippery roads towards the easy, rounded hills of Drumochter Pass on the A. This finished his Munros south of the Great Glen, but even on these gentle slopes he was following compass bearings through a white out. Another three knocked off, he reflected: \"Back on the road, and a greasy takeaway in Kingussie as I head over west!\"On top of the monstrous dumps of fresh snow and avalanche danger, as the first hints of spring arrived his next challenge became the continuing thaw.With wild weather forecast, he chose the outlier of Am Faochagach for an \"easy\" day. But crossing the River Garbhrain at the start took him up to his waist: \"I sloshed to the top of the hill with soaked legs and frozen toes.\"More summits should have been within reach, but instead a second drenching awaited ndash thrashing back across the river to the road.Nearing the end of his quest in mid-March, the weather brightened and Mr Woods stayed overnight at Bearnais bothy for a dazzling few days through the wilds of Ross-shire. He crossed the empty mountain ranges wearing sunglasses and sun cream. \"Still massive amounts of snow in the corries, and the hills are stunning white. But spring has arrived in the glens,\" he enthused.He spent the final days of his lonely trek on the peaks around Ullapool and Dundonnell in Wester Ross, then headed south.A grey dawn on the top of Ben Lomond early last week marked a subdued finish to his mammoth expedition. As he stepped off the deserted hill track back into civilisation, Mr Woods was whisked off by his family into household isolation as most of Scotland closed down."},{"url":null,"title":"doris-day-auction-contains-800-lots-affordable-items","story":"Day was one of the top box office draws of the s and s owing to her girl-next-door image and distinctively sweet voice.She is best remembered for starring opposite Rock Hudson in romantic comedies including rsquos Pillow Talk, as well as for sitcom The Doris Day Show.US-born actress Day died in May last year at the age of .

identied in the early s, as well as related bat viruses.The comparisons are already helping to identy genetic regions of the new virus that may be changing in response to it infecting people.The insights could help devise strategies to control SARS-CoV- and better understand how it spreads.Dr Calderwood said: ldquoThere is a group in Scotland led by Ken Baillie from the Roslin Institute which is already recruiting patients on a UK-wide basis into trials of vaccines.Researchers at the Roslin Institute said last month they are working to trace when and how the current coronavirus was first

around November or December , which is consistent with the known early cases, although there is a degree of uncertainty, scientists say.The most similar coronavirus to SARS-CoV- is found in bats.However, there are sufficient dferences between the two to suggest that the current outbreak did not derive directly from the animals.There could be other, more similar viruses from other species

This is actively being considered at a regional level.Although there has been considerable modelling done within the Trust to look at how we might maximise available critical care capacity within our own hospitals, it would be premature for us to say anything more at this point given that things could change very quickly.”The Trust is also prioritising its resources to support the most vulnerable in the community. This has involved reviewing all Domiciliary Provision with families to identy what care they are able to provide for their relatives in these exceptional and very challenging times. This should free up domiciliary capacity to focus on those who require critical care which cannot be met by any other means during this COVID- period.Commenting, Phil Hughes, the Trust’s Director of Community Care said:“We will work with families to arrange for contingency placements in care homes on a temporary basis for iniduals where there is concern that the level of frailty and risk would indicate that this is the most appropriate way to provide care during this period or where the current care arrangements are unable to be sustained.We are also working to increase capacity in the community or care placements within our own community hospitals and residential units, in addition to working with the care home sector.The stepping down of non-critical interventions is allowing us to free up capacity of community nurses, social workers, care staff and Allied Health Professionals.”The Trust has also been working in partnership with GPs in primary care to set up COVID- Centres as part of a network across the region to manage the increased incidence of Coronavirus cases in the community. New centres will open in Antrim, Ballymena and Coleraine and the emphasis will be on patient safety, staff safety and the provision of a sustainable primary care service.The new centres will not be testing facilities and will only be for patients who are very unwell, are suspected of having COVID- and require medical attention.Patients will not be able to report directly to these centres without being referred by their GP or Out of Hours provider.The Centres will help to free up GP services to deal with the COVID- pandemic, whilst balancing the need for primary care services to continue with the minimum of disruption.

The grief of losing loved ones is bad enough but not being able to go and visit their graves - it’s not asyou have to worry about social distancing in a cemetery.Others agreed: This is a step too far. The cemetery is not a social gathering.There is never anyone there when I go to visit my sons grave. I wish someone can tell me what purpose this will serve.If they even left the side gate open it would be a compromise.What about peoples mental health This is a total disgrace to deprive any of us a few quiet moments at the graveside of our loved ones.Another woman said: This is just not necessary! Its absolutely ridiculous. Nobody goes to a graveyard in large groups to have social gatherings!People go to have a quiet moment with a loved one and are then on their way again! This is the only walk for the day that some people do.One woman was bereft after burying her father on the same day as the announcement.She said: Im absolutely heartbroken at this.I have just laid my daddy to rest today and he never even got the send off he deserved.We couldnt bring him home and now I cant even visit to try to come to terms with his loss this. Its so heartbreaking.Others said they would have hoped for advance notice in order to pay a final visit to their loved ones and to put fresh flowers on graves.However, one woman posted: Folks, its my sons anniversary tomorrow.I will not be able to attend his grave as usual. However, instead of finding fault, I will accept this new ruling as a neccessary action for our continued safety.Many of you dont seem to have thought about those people who have died of the virus and the need to bury them as well. Remember we had the comfort of being present when our loved ones were buried or cremated - the families of those dying with Covid- will not get this andthe council need to keep the public out for safety then respect this request.They are not asking to upset you or infringe on your actions. If they are closing the cemeteries its for a valid reason.

It’s time, she said, for the people to “embrace the spirit of Northern Ireland”.Just what the “spirit of Northern Ireland” is Squinter’s not sure. So let’s see , with the benefit of close-on  years of experience, we can see how the spirit of Are Wee Country might be redeployed in the time of coronavirus.HYGIENE vw, px\"  Troubles washing protocols for handling weapons and explosives should be resumed. A y bath and hair wash are not necessary because while gunpowder residue in your hair was always a problem, coronavirus in your hair is not. Scrub the hands thoroughly with hot soap and water, but remember, it is no longer necessary to pay particular attention to your shooting arm and hand. Both require equal attention. If you’ve kept your balaclava it could be the best decision you’ve made since you said yes to the Northern Bank job. Since hand-to-face contamination is a principle spreader of the virus, your balaclava will go a long way to keep you safe. And as face masks are dficult to access, the thick wool of the balaclava makes an excellent makesht virus filter.SOCIAL DISTANCINGIt’s reported that the car parks at Tyrella beach, Helen’s Bay and Murlough Bay were packed to overflowing at the weekend, with some tourist attractions experiencing record footfall. Although the advice is that people should remain two metres apart, crowds have been assembling in the face of the growing Covid- threat. Retired senior RUC and British army figures with long experience of, ah, public order have been employed as consultants to advise the forces of law and order on how best to deploy the Spirit of Northern Ireland during times of public non-compliance. Water cannon deployed most recently at Woodvale during the Camp Twaddell national emergency are available and ready to go with a : water-bleach ratio. Baton charges are being rehearsed at the PSNI training centre at Garnerville with officers wearing hazmat suits instead of riot gear and with temperature gauges on the end of their batons. Plastic bullets are an option but will only be used as a final resort in order not to put to too much pressure on morgues and paediatric intensive care units.STOP AND QUESTION vw, px\"  Is this your car, sir  The glory days of #Northern Ireland#If you’re on your way to the shop, out for your one walk per day, oryou’re an essential worker en route to or from your job you may be stopped and questioned by the police – or even later by the British army, depending on how the crisis pans out.

Dr Scally called for the island of Ireland to work as one unit in the fight against the virus in light of dferent health policies being taken on both sides of the border, a problem he describes as potentially very serious. The advice to someone in Lford with symptoms of the disease is to self-isolate for a minimum of  days – a stone’s throw away in Strabane the advice is isolation for seven days, he said, writing in Theon Tuesday. The Belfast-born doctor, who conducted the Scoping Inquiry into the CervicalCheck Screening Programme in the Republic, said a major dference which stands out is that the Republic is using widespread community testing, while in Northern Ireland and across the UK, testing is largely reserved for hospital inpatients and health service staff. He wrote: In the Republic with its network of over  community testing facilities, the aim is to reach , tests per week by the end of April, whereas the North has set a goal of performing just under , tests per week.It comes as Tanaiste Simon Coveney is expected to hold a teleconference at midday on Tuesday with the Northern Ireland Secretary of State and Stormont’s leaders Arlene Foster and Michelle O#Neill to discuss ongoing cooperation to deal with coronavirus.It will be the first time Mr Lewis will be involved in cross-border cooperation discussions.Dr Scally criticised the approach of Whitehall, which he said does not want people learning about the views of WHO and the successful efforts to control the virus in other countries. The public health expert accused the UK of having ignored the experience of other countries while the Republic has watched and learned from the experiences of South Korea and China in controlling the disease. He expressed disappointment that Northern Ireland had followed the advice from Whitehall, along with devolved government in Scotland. The unied approach held firm even when it was revealed by the small coterie of senior officials guiding policy that their actual aim was for the population to actively develop “herd immunity”.It is an approach that is regarded by many senior public health physicians as dangerously flawed, he said, saying the key aim of the battle against the virus is to gain time to develop a vaccine and allow the summer weather to mitigate the spread, he said. Calling for Northern Ireland to decouple themselves from the Whitehall approach, he saidthis does not happen, a larger percentage of the population here may be infected earlier and due to pressure on the health service, deaths may be higher. He saidtravel, education and work restrictions are lted at dferent times in dferent parts of the island, there could be another mass outbreak. It is a big ask, but now is not the time to be captives of our histories. Lives can and should be saved, he said.

Linda Stewart speaks to three frontline staff who are staying away from their dwellings to protect their loved ones.The AE nurseAE nurse Ruth McGreevy , from Newtownards, has moved into an Airbnb accommodation in Bangor in order to protect her mum and siblings who fall under the high risk category. Her boyfriend is Philip , a computer technicianAE nurse Ruth McGreevy has had fond memories of the Ulster Hospital since childhood when she was a frequent visitor due to her asthma.Now on the frontline in the fight against coronavirus, the -year-old from Newtownards is poised for the toughest battle of her le as the hospital prepares for a flood of patients hit by coronavirus.Although patients infected with Covid- have already started to appear at the Ulster Hospital - and there have been some deaths - there is still a sense that it is the calm before the storm.We shut down a bit of the AE to cater for people coming in, where we could call people in and treat them, send them to the ward or send them home. And then the past couple of weeks we#ve been closing off more and more of the AE, Ruth says.We#re all very nervous. I don#t even think it#s about the people coming in - people are worried about taking it home Ruth McGreevy, nurseObviously, the doctors and the managers are concerned that it#s coming because they#re shutting it down and we#re getting more in-depth training on how to deal with the really sick patients that come in. So it#s a bit scarier now that all this is taking place - everyone#s on tenterhooks just waiting for this to hit.All the wards have been emptied out to deal with this when it arrives and it#s quite bizarre lately going to the ward and seeing lots of empty beds, because that hasn#t happened in years.The staff have been getting special training in the personal protection they will wear, including masks, aprons and gloves.And then there are things like infection control, how to stop the spread. We#re learning how to work ventilators and respiratory equipment, Ruth says.That#s quite daunting - nurses generally wouldn#t really be doing much of that, but now we#re being taught it just in case we get into the circumstances where we might have to use them.We#re all very nervous. I don#t even think it#s about the people coming in - people are worried about taking it home.We all have families at home and sick people and children and things. You#re so scared of walking it back into your house, because you never know what will happen. You hear of people getting younger and younger with no medical history who are dying from this, so it#s scary.Ruth has a long association with the Ulster Hospital - she was born prematurely and had bad asthma when she was young, and spent a lot of time in the hospital.I just had lots of admissions with my chest as I had quite a lot of asthma attacks, so I was just in and out with that into Maynard Ward. They were always so nice and kind and my sister Eleanor was quite unwell as a child, so we spent a lot of time visiting her when I was little - I was just always around hospitals.It was this early experience that spurred her to become a nurse.I was struck with just how much a bit of kindness can do for someone, Ruth says.You can be so unwell and someone just giving you a nice smile or being kind - the smallest gesture can go a long way. Making someone a cup of tea sometimes goes a lot further than any other medication you can give them. with her mum and sisters\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph le features ab .ece AUTOCROP w --_l__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph le features ab .ece AUTOCROP w --_l__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph le features ab .ece AUTOCROP w --_l__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph le features ab .ece AUTOCROP w --_l__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph le features ab .ece AUTOCROP w --_l__I.JPG w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   with her mum and sisters\"Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClose with her mum and sisters\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph le features ab .ece AUTOCROP w --_l__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph le features ab .ece AUTOCROP w --_l__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph le features ab .ece AUTOCROP w --_l__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph le features ab .ece AUTOCROP w --_l__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph le features ab .ece AUTOCROP w --_l__I.JPG w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   with her mum and sisters\"Close family: Ruthwith her mum and sisters FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappClose family: Ruthwith her mum and sistersAfter leaving school, Ruth went to Queen#s University Belfast and worked as a healthcare assistant while studying to be a nurse. She is now an adult-trained AE nurse in the Ulster Hospital.Basically, it#s people walking in unwell, so it#s like doing bloods and ECGs, trying to figure out what#s wrong with people. Lately, I#ve been dealing with cardiac arrests and things like that, dealing with car accidents.Ruth lives with her mum Belleand sisters Sarah , Eleanorand Kirsty .In the past week she has been forced to make the dficult decision to move away from her family in order to protect them from the danger of infection.I#m the youngest, and I didn#t want to do it but my mum is , and she#s diabetic and has high blood pressure, Ruth says.My oldest brother Alex recently had four strokes and he was on chemotherapy treatment with quite an unusual disease that he has - nobody#s really heard of it. So he#s on chemotherapy and he would have quite a low immune system. My sister Eleanor has MS and my sister Kirsty is on immunosuppressant drugs for a stomach problem. I feel like a walking super-virus going into my house.I was thinking about it for a few weeks but I hadn#t really talked to my mum about it - I didn#t want to bring it up until I thought it was really necessary.But in the last week especially I noticed that a lot of the patients I#ve been looking after had been going off to the ward and were taken very unwell or there were people passing away. So, in my eyes I could see it escalating quite a lot and I felt like it was time to go. Ruth says her family was very upset that she had to move out. She was the youngest and had never been away from home for a long period of time.I#m only moving to Bangor - it#s not far but it#s more that I can#t come into the house and have a proper conversation with them, she says.My mum was very upset about it - she#s just worried.

We#ll keep laughing, saying we#ll be rolling out of here after coronavirus because people are feeding us so much.We#re getting pizzas and doughnuts, and a big coffee van was up the other day giving everyone free coffee and sandwiches and everything. People are donating hand creams because we#ve washed our hands until they#re cracking and bleeding - people are giving us everything.The toughest thing just at the moment is all the new training, Ruth says.They#re saying things are going to get a lot harder for us because obviously this disease is airborne, so it#s when we go into the big proper masks that it will be scary.You#re just aware that you can#t take them off, she says.It#s just the fear in people#s eyes because they#re not allowed any visitors. So it#s trying to comfort those people - they#re so unwell and scared, and they can#t have anyone in their family with them.All you can do is just try and be as kind and caring as you can, staying with them, explaining why it#s happening, why their family can#t come in, we#ll look after them the best we can. It#s just being there to hold their hands when they need it.Ruth pays tribute to all the staff who are doing their bit to combat the disease.It takes an army in here, she says.To move a single patient to the ward, the whole corridor has to close because obviously people can#t walk into the corridor when you#re moving - so the amount of porters it takes and then the whole area has to be cleaned after one patient moves. The amount of people it takes to move one person is crazy. And you couldn#t do it without everybody - the teamwork going on at the minute is amazing.I know the Down AE has closed, so the staff from the Down AE have just come up today to the Ulster. So that#s extra doctors and extra nurses coming up, which is great.Ruth says the whole thing is very scary but the key thing is to try to keep positive.It#s all going to be over soon hopefully andwe all just do as we#re told it will be over sooner rather than later, hopefully, and we#ll come out the other side, she says.It really does prove how great everybody is that works for the NHS, not just nurses. We#re being supported at the minute, but it really isn#t just us - it#s everybody. It#s amazing seeing everyone pulling together.The social workerSocial worker Maria McNamee , from Londonderry, has moved in with a friend in Castlefin, Donegal, because she is concerned about putting her partner Gareth at riskI live with my partner of  or  years - it#s just me and him, she says.He has two of the conditions that put him at a really high risk - he has type one diabetes and is on immunosuppressants for Crohn#s disease.

She said a new forum, made up of statutory bodies, trade unions, the PSNI and chief executives of local councils, would look into which firms could be regarded as essential and report to the Executive.The Deputy First Minister said there had been a disagreement in the Executive, not in terms of our joined-up approach in terms of our number one priority, which is about saving lives, but there is certainty a dference emphasis in terms of speed and approach to how we bring forward measures such as testing, PPE, those issues of concern. In a statement, Ulster Carpets said it had been adhering rigorously to all guidelines, including social distancing. But it added: As a consequence of the deteriorating Covid- pandemic situation in Northern Ireland, continuing to follow scientic advice and in line with our company contingency planning, we have decided to initiate a run-down of some elements of our production until further notice.

They very professionally and quickly contacted her on Friday confirming her details and gave her instructions for travel, and she started her journey home on Saturday morning.She added: I cannot thankSimon Coveney and the Irish Department for Foreign Affairs enough for their swt action and professionalism in the way they handled getting all the Irish back to their home safely on Irish soil.Shauna had to separate from her friend Stephanie Kiddfrom Bournemouth on Saturday, but she has also started her journey home as more rescue flights arrived. The gruelling journey for Shauna included a -hour bus trip to a military base in Lima followed by a  and a half hour flight to London Heathrow and a connecting flight to Dublin.Carol said: I am so elated to be getting her home at this very worrying and surreal time we are living in.Having already been in quarantine for  days in Cusco, Shauna will now spend another  days in quarantine at home with her family.Liz Canavan, assistant secretary at the Department of the Taoiseach, thanked the Peruvian authorities for their help.Our embassy arranged for the transfer by road of many of our citizens from remote parts of Peru to the airport in Lima, journeys which in some cases took over  hours, she said.A number of British citizens repatriated from Peru yesterday said it had been a confusing and stressful experience.Shona McKenna had been in South America since the start of the year.Speaking to ITV, she said: We had  people on standby but only  turned up to the airport.The communication wasn#t great, we didn#t know when we were going to come home and when the emails came out there wasn#t a lot of time.Belfast ,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":Most Read£ reward to find culprit behind milk dumping on Antrim coastCoronavirus: What about my bin collection  Measures NI councils are taking in response to lockdownChef who urinated in ambulance avoids prisonBelfast man accused of raping schoolgirl and blackmailing another in #catfish# scam in courtCoronavirus: Passenger claiming to have Covid- spits at Belfast bus driver ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Picture: NI Assembly FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappPaul Frew. Picture: NI AssemblyMarch   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailA DUP MLA has claimed republicans have intimidated businesses into closing during the coronavirus pandemic.Speaking in the Assembly, Paul Frew told Finance Minister Conor Murphy he was concerned when he heard that businesses in the manufacturing industry were being put under pressure to close by people including Sinn Fein activists. I am deeply worried when I hear reports of intimidation by republicans and party activists of his [Conor Murphy#s] party of businesses, employers and CEOs of manufacturing plants who are striving to stay open - who this Assembly may well call upon to redirect resources and make things for us that will save lives.I#m deeply worried that I have heard reports of party activists from his party intimidating and harassing businesses to close completely, he said. It comes after Portadown-based business Ulster Carpets said it is to run down some of its operations after they claimed threats were made against employees. The business found itself thrust into the limelight for continuing to work on during the coronavirus outbreak but stressed it had at all times followed official government advice. Ulster Carpets said it had been very disappointed by some of the ill-informed commentary used against the company.We would request that this would cease as it has created an atmosphere in which abuse and threats have been issued against many of our employees, a company spokesman said.Mr Murphy said the claims of Sinn Fein activists targeting businesses were without substance.Of courseyou#re aware of accusations which are essentially of criminal behaviour, you have an obligation to report those to the police and I hope you have rather than simply bring them here for publicity purposes, he said.

In the s, she was scouted by one of Americas biggest record labels and asked to name her price.She shared the stage with the likes of Stevie Nicks, Sheryl Crow and the Dixie Chicks, and rubbedshoulders with A-list actors.Noella is great at telling stories, and she has hundreds - living round the corner from Ben Affleck, hanging out with with Winona Ryder, and partying with Hugh Heffner at the Playboy MansionHer le in America was the stuff dreams were made of, with a critically acclaimed album, sold out gigs, luxury hotels and chauffeurs.But why didnt we know about about all this I didnt tell anyone, she shrugs.Probably because she didnt care you can see why the A-list fell for her, the beautul Irish girl who was deeply unimpressed by fame.The signs were there from an early age that Noella liked to do things her own way.She was asked to leave her local folk group aged  over creative dferences.I forgot my song book, but I didnt need it. I knew every song, she laughs, taking a drag of her vape.The teacher told me to go and get my book. I said, I dont need it and she said, Go and get your book and I said, Shove it up your arse.She came back looking for me, but I never went back.Derry was always going to be too small for Noella and at  she headed to London with her guitar on her back and gigs with the likes of Van Morrison already under her belt.There was nothing here in , she says.I would have done anything to escape.Not long after she arrived, The NoellaHuttonBand landed a residency at Madame JoJos, a legendary Soho strip club frequented by actors and popstars.Youd have people like Robbie Williams, theyd all come in there mincing about, says Noella.Before we went on wed be sitting in the green room with two totally naked strippers.But it was just normal. It wasnt a big deal. It was just work and they were so professional.Mariah Carey came in one night and she tried to move my friends from the front seats and I said, Naw, thats my friends there.She asked meI had a demo and I said naw. Honestly, I just didnt want to give her anything, she smiles.Boy George was another regular and after watching her play, he asked her to sign to his label More Protein.He said to me, No one has ever scared me before, but you scare me, she recalls.So, you signed with Boy George Naw.One of things he said to me was, So, youre a big dyke then That got my back up right away. I said George, my sexuality has got f**k all to do with what I am.Its such a small, small part of who I am.And its really nobodys business. It wasnt because I was ashamed, I just thought, Im not going to ride on the back of that honey.If he hadnthave said that, who knows  But it just wasnt meant for me.The pair still hit it off and Noella sang with Boy George at a string of gigs in Shepherds Bush Empire, dueting on a punk version of Karma Chameleon.They also enjoyed wild nights out together, where people used to confuse them for brother and sister.He was a good guy - very intelligent.And he loved me and he was so proud of me.Noella was having the time of her le, singing at Paul OGradys thbut still working at Camden Market on the weekends to make ends meet.She was hanging out with the likes of Oasis, Paula Yates and Michael Hutchence and the buzz around her was starting to grow.Then she got the call that would change her le.It was from the head of Radioactive Records who had signed the likes of Garbage and Debbie Harry.He asked me how much I wanted, I could barely afford to make it to the bus stop, she laughs.Radioactive asked Noella who she wanted to produce her album and she chooseJerry Harrison of Talking Heads, who had just produced for the American rock band Lives album Throwing Copper.The label flew her to LA to record it and soon she was living the American dream with a substantial advance and her own cab driver who was on call around the clock.I was just happy to be able to do stuff for people, she says.Sure whats the point of having money  You cant take it with you.Noella released her self titled album NoellaHutton in , toured extensively in the States and was put up in the likes of New Yorks Cha Hotel.I slept the best I ever have in my le when I was in New York, she says.It was just the characters. Everything.I felt at home there.Her husky, soulful voice was also in hot demand commercially and featured in ads for Lexus, Nike, Coca-Cola and Toyota.In  Noella played to , people at Canadian singer Sarah McLachlans Lilith Fair where she shared the stage with Nelly Furtado and Christina Aguilera.We had to do a press conference with Sky News, I just kept thinking Im a wee girl from Derry.Despite reaching such dizzying heights, very few back home knew was happening.I never told anybody, I just didnt think it was important, she says candidly.I dont think Im anything special, do you know what I mean I was just writing and playing and having a wee laugh. Thats very important. Youre only here for a wee while.Fame never interested me. It was terrying.I knew too many people who were miserable and had no le.I had too much badness to get up to.And what a le Noella was having. She was dating Taryn Manningand her album was No  on the playlist of the Virgin record store in Hollywood.She was living the kind of le most of us can only dream of, but her mental health was suffering and in  Noella suffered a complete nervous breakdown.Everything just crashed in my head at the one time, she says with characteristic frankness.It all closed in at the one time.I had just been putting it off my whole le.Everything that had went on reared its head.Id had a breakdown in London too, but this was on a dferent scale.It was just trauma. You think youve dealt with certain things. But naw, you havent.Im amazed that Im still here to be honest.Noellas sister, JeanetteHutton, brought her back to Derry, where she worked very hard to get better with the help of Gransha Hospital and the support of her family.A couple of years later she met American singer songwriter and producer Justin Black, who had her album as a teenager growing up in Arkansas.He said my album inspired him to play the guitar, she laughs.He didnt even know I was Irish.She also formed the band Blood with her sister Jeanette and brother-in-law Ruairi ODoherty and two years ago they released an album of the same name.Shes the eldest girl in the family and Im the youngest and all we do is laugh at stupid sh***, said Noella.Shes so loved. Shes brilliant. Shes my hero.In recent years Noella has also channelled her energy into animal rescue charity Friends of Rescue founded by her best friend Suzanne Fleming.Together with Suzanne, Keith Rutherford and Carly Russell, Noella helps rescue and rehome neglected and abused animals.The day before yesterday we rescued  dogs, she said.Its the most rewarding, heartbreaking, devastating, incredible all-encompassing thing.Im fearless when it comes to the well being of animals, children or old people.Noella is now sponsored by world-renowned bespoke guitar makers Emerald Guitars, who are based in St Johnston.Justin persuaded her to record her recently released solo album Love and Liars which deserves to be heard on the world stage, but Noella has no plans for a big tour.Ive honestly never made a plan in my le, she says.I dont believe in forcing squaresinto circles, do you know what I mean Its something that has to happenorganically, naturally.And this feels right at the minute.To find out more about Noella, visit her Facebook page The First Noella.Her music is available at noellahutton.bandcampA documentary about Noellas le, The First Noella, made by Justin Black is now available on YouTube.If you would like to support Friends of Rescue you can find them at Friends of Rescue Ireland on Facebook.For more information on Emerald Guitars visitwww.emeraldguitars googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

He says: Journalists have played a vital role in recent weeks providing the public with factual information needed now more than ever.It is a sad irony that the threat to jobs in journalism is higher now than ever.The steep fall in demand for products of all sorts has seen advertising revenue plummet. Widespread lay-offs are threatened.This comes on top of a series of blows in the past few years. The NUJ has fought hard to protect members. But against a bleak economic background, it hasn’t been possible to prevent redundancies.The hammer-blow of the coronavirus pandemic has now put a question mark against the very future of a number of titles in Derry and Donegal, as well as across the rest of island. Journalists fear further loss of valued colleagues.Journalism dfers from many other industries in that workers tend to have a close relationship with the communities around them as well as with those they work alongside.Many people can be sharply critical of the local media, but at the same time value what they do. A community which loses a local ‘paper will be poorer as a result. googletag.cmd.push Some of our local papers are strong and will survive. But others are at real risk. It is for these reasons that the wider public, not just those who work in the media, should support journalists in striving to keep titles alive and save jobs in journalism for the next generation.Journalists are no more entitled to their jobs than anyone . But we do play a vital role, which has been highlighted as never before over the course of the coronavirus disaster.The NUJ is in talks with government in both Dublin and London about the need for support to see newspapers survive.

We are in regular contact with our entities in affected areas which have put in place concrete measures to protect employees and proactively manage the situation, a statement issued on March  said. Such preemptive measures include allowing employees to work remotely, providing adequate health and hygiene advice, events and travels restrictions. Bans or deferrals are applied to events and business trips globally, with total ban on business trips to or from affected areas such as Hubei Province in China, South Korea, Iran, and specic areas in some European countries.

[ Ghanaian Cedi equals . Euro.]“We also paid for Precious to have her hair re-braided. Precious is the only girl in the orphanage to have long hair as she originally came from South Africa. “We then used the rest of the money to buy ice cream, crackers, pineapple and other treats for the children from day to day.”Acknowledging everyone who helped in her mammoth fundraising effort, Lauren thanked her family and friends especially.She added: “I would also like to thank Fr Mailey in Drung Quigleys Point Community Centre Sainsbury’s in Derry and Debbie, who is the manager of Lidl in Buncrana. “That is not forgetting anyone who helped out in any way at fundraisers, by donating prizes or coming along to events. Thank you all from the bottom of my heart. Even the smallest donation made a huge dference in Ghana.”An average day in Ghana for Lauren began at .am.She reaclled: “We usually arrived at Beckys Orphanage at .pm r .pm, depending on the taxis. We stayed about a  minute drive away from the orphanage.“When we arrived, we helped to get the children ready for school and had morning cuddles with the younger children. We went on the school bus with the children. “There were about  children, four volunteers and our the driver squashed on a  seater bus but we made it work.“When we dropped the children off, we went back for breakfast, then back to the school, where could had the choice of watching the children in the daycare or teaching a class,we wanted. At .pm, we went back for lunch and rested until pm. “Then it was back to school to get the children onto the bus and back to the home. Because their own bus was broken down, we had to rely on taxi buses from the village, which were not always readily available when we needed them. For a few days, we had to wait to pm for one to arrive.”But it did not stop there. Back at the orphanage, it was homework, with the younger children playing or watching TV.Lauren said: “The older children usually helped with cooking dinner. I tried to help one day but it was the hardest thing. They cook in an outside hut. “They light a fire in an old wheel alloy and cook in a huge pot. If the heat doesn’t get to you, the smoke in your eyes will. It wasn’t the easiest dinner I ever helped cook.“We usually left the orphanage around .pm but a few evenings we were lucky and the taxi was late so we could stay longer.“Volunteer safety was paramount at Becky’s, so when the mosquitos came out, we went in. Back at the volunteer house, we could have dinner, get cleaned up and then the night was our own.“We never ventured out much at night because of the mosquitos as well as the power cuts. The whole village would be in darkness. It would be very dficult to navigate your way.”Lauren described her trip to Ghana as the most amazing experience. googletag.cmd.push She said: “At first it was dficult, seeing some sights was hard. “What people live in, children on the street in rags, being sent to school with no breakfast or lunch. The children from Becky’s Orphanage are lucky as they will at least get their three meals a day.“People with no running water and power that would often go off also took a bit of getting used to. Although, washing from a bucket of cold water did become something I looked forward to and was quite refreshing.“Being able to see the joy from the children when you came to see them at the school and orphanage, how a small piece of pineapple brightened their day and even just the enjoyment they would get from sitting beside you, would melt your heart.“Of course, with the money we raised, we were able to do a lot for the children, but what we left with was so much more.“We have learned how to appreciate the simple things in le to be grateful for everything we have here at home and to never take anything for granted here,” added Lauren. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Trust would like members of the public to snap images of a tree or flower in bloom from their window, in their garden or during their daily permitted exercise and to share their images on social media.The move is part of the Trust’s campaign to help people of all ages to become more connected with everyday nature. The charity said that blossom sweeping the country is one of nature’s key moments that could help lt the spirits during these uncertain times and enable people to celebrate nature and history together. It is asking those with trees and flowers in bloom in their gardens and on their streets to share pictures on social media using #BlossomWatch and tagging their location, so everyone can enjoy this year’s blossom season. And next year there are plans to develop a #BlossomWatch map.The move follows the launch of the Trust’s Noticing Nature report last month, which demonstrated that for people to do more to protect nature, they need to have a closer everyday connection to it. Only six per cent of adults and seven per cent of children celebrate natural events such as the first day of spring, solstice or harvest, according to the Trust’s recent research.Andy Beer, nature expert at the National Trust says: “It’s really easy to take this moment in nature for granted. Celebrating blossom is a pivotal, seasonal moment that can often be all too fleeting and we want to do all we can to help people and families at home to enjoy and take stock of a special moment in the calendar.“At a time when people are being asked not to travel, we want people to notice the blossom on their doorstep – in their garden, on city streets or in public parks when taking the permitted daily walk, cycle or run. We’re asking them to take pictures of the blossom as it blooms and share the joy with others who can’t see blossom for themselves right now.“The success of blossom and the subsequent fruiting is highly dependent on the weather, which could be affected in future years by the warming climate.”The Trust will be encouraging those who’d like to get involved to share and tag their images via @NationalTrustNI on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter using the #BlossomWatch and also inserting the name of the place where they live.

In addition to Colum Cille’s own foundations at Derry and Durrow, these monasteries all looked to Iona as their leader.They adhered to the traditions of the Irish church.These Columban monasteries played a leading role in the expansion of Christianity they converted the Picts and restored Christianity to Anglo-Saxon Northumbria in the th century.In the second half of the th century Iona was at the height of its prestige – the laws of Colum Cille held sway in Ireland, with the abbots of Iona making frequent trips there.This period of Columban expansion resulted in the appearance of two art forms to Irish monasteries namely, high crosses and illuminated manuscripts.The fusion of Irish techniques of timber construction and Northumbrian skills in stone carving resulted in the appearance of highly decorated standing crosses in Irish monasteries from the second half of the th century.These elaborate high crosses with the wheel head design, in which a circle surrounded the point of intersection, developed from the earlier simple pillar stones of the th century on which crosses were incised.In the monastery at Derry there would now have appeared intricate high crosses on which scenes from the Bible were sculptured.The purpose of the crosses ied. Some marked burials, others signied a boundary of some sort, while others acted as focuses of prayer.Distinctive manuscripts on parchment were now being produced in Columban monasteries.Sometime between  and  the Book of Kells, a brilliantly illuminated copy of the four gospels with Latin text, known as “the Great Gospel of Columkille”, was written.Its precise origin is unknown not every monastery could produce such highly decorated and, at the same time, legible and correct copies of gospels written in Latin.Undoubtedly it was written in a Columban monastery, as they were famed for their teaching of Latin and the classics and for the skills of their craftsmen and artists.It was unlikely to have been written in Derry, as the team of scribes and artists required to produce such a masterpiece probably only existed at the monastic centre of the Columban confederation, which was Iona to  and subsequently Kells in central Ireland.The contents of the th century library and scriptorium at Derry have not survived.Colum Cille, according to the Annals of Clonmacnoise, wrote  books, all copies of the New Testaments. Copies were left with each of his churches, which, of course, included Derry.The earliest surviving decorated Irish manuscript is the Cathach or Battle Book, a copy of the psalms, which according to tradition was written by Colum Cille towards the end of the th century.It was handed down in the family of Conall Gulban, i.e. Colum Cille’s kin, and it was always carried three times round the army to ensure victory before they went into battle.Illumination in this manuscript was confined to the fine large capital letters at the beginning of each psalm.With the Book of Durrow, a copy of the four gospels written in the mid-th century, an Irish style had emerged in which at the beginning of each gospel there was on the left a full ornamented page, brilliantly coloured, with intricate designs of spirals and interlocking animals and plants while on the right there was an introductory page beginning with a large, beautully proportioned, capital letter. In addition, portraits or symbols were used to depict each of the four evangelists.The Book of Kells marked the pinnacle of Irish achievement in manuscript production, with its profusion of illustration, colour and ornamentation, and its repeated use of the same symbols for the four evangelists a man for Matthew, a lion for Mark, a calf for Luke and an eagle for John.By the end of the th century the monastic settlement at Derry would have changed little.The monastic complex would still have been made of timber.The only new physical feature would have been the erection of a few high stone crosses.The scriptorium may have begun to produce some basic illuminated manuscripts, similar to the Cathach. It would, of course, have continued to make straight copies of the psalms and gospels.In  a fleet of ships, the like of which had never been seen before, sailed up Lough Foyle.These ships, built of oak, some over  feet long and  feet wide, and steered by a rudder paddle, were powered by both oar and sail.From  feet pine masts fluttered square sails of double-thickness strips of red and white woven cloth, and, from behind rows of shields slung over the side, men, up to  on each boat, pulled on narrow-bladed spruce oars and manoeuvred the boats into the sheltered waters of the River Foyle.They beached their boats, which drew only three feet of water, on the shore beneath the monastery.From the boats men rushed up the hill, the leaders wearing protective coats of mail and helmets with a nose piece which projected down over the face the rest, following close behind, in thick woollen coats which reached half way down their thighs.They all carried a round wooden shield, many of which were painted either yellow or black.The long, broad, two-edged iron sword and the long-handled, broad-edged battle axe were the principal weapons they carried.Some were armed with spears, others with bow and arrows. Most had an iron kne, with a wood or bone handle, tucked in their belts.The Vikings had located the monastic settlement at Derry, and, as where in Ireland and Britain, they met no organised resistance.They burnt the abbey and massacred her clergy and students.Not only was the monastery an easy target to attack because of its secluded, yet very accessible, location, it was also a very rewarding one.Derry was a centre of wealth, rich in lands and livestock.The Vikings were interested in food provisions, to sustain further voyages, as well as in the precious metal ornaments associated with a monastery.They were also interested in taking prisoners, especially girls, as they had been trading in human slaves to central Europe for centuries.The Vikings never attempted to settle in Derry.In  they again attacked, but this time they were driven back, with great losses, by Niall Caille, King of Ireland and Murchadh, Prince of Aileach.Derry continued to be attractive to Viking invaders throughout the th century.In  the shrine of Colum Cille was carried away by the Vikings. In  and  she was again plundered.Derry’s long-term growth did not suffer because of the Viking raids,anything it increased.With the Viking raids on Iona in ,  and , the monks acquired a site at Kells in central Ireland, and, bearing the relics of Colum Cille, moved there to found a new monastery.There was a steady rise in the status and importance of Derry from , as she succeeded Iona and then Kells as the centre of all Columban foundations in Ireland and Scotland.By the end of the th century Derry was known as Doire Columcille, as opposed to Doire Calgach.This Viking period resulted in two new additions to the monastery at Derry: her first stone church and a round tower.Sometime after the first raid in , the wooden church, which the Vikings burnt, was replaced with a stone one.It would have been a simple building, similar in shape to its wooden predecessors.This stone single-chamber church, later known as Dubh Regles or Black Abbey church, was perhaps no longer than  feet.It probably had one narrow slit for a window, and was roofed with stone to simulate overlapping tiles. Housing for the monks and their tenant farmers was still made of the traditional wood and wattle combination.Sometime between the end of the th century and the beginning of the th century, a round tower of stone was built next to the Black Abbey church to serve a iety of purposes, such as a belfry, a watch tower and a place of refuge.Perhaps  feet high and  feet in diameter, with five floors, each lit by one window except the top which had four, entrance was gained,  feet above ground level, by a movable ladder.Inside, each wooden floor was linked by a wooden staircase. If set on fire this tower would have been a death trap, as the up-draught working on ignited wooden floors would have created an inferno.By the turn of the th century Derry was beginning to see a revival in its fortunes as an important monastic town.Apart from the additions of elaborate stone crosses, a small dry-stone church and a round tower, Derry was still very similar to the settlement founded in . googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Copies were left with each of his churches, which, of course, included Derry.The earliest surviving decorated Irish manuscript is the Cathach or Battle Book, a copy of the psalms, which according to tradition was written by Colum Cille towards the end of the th century.It was handed down in the family of Conall Gulban, i.e. Colum Cille’s kin, and it was always carried three times round the army to ensure victory before they went into battle.Illumination in this manuscript was confined to the fine large capital letters at the beginning of each psalm.With the Book of Durrow, a copy of the four gospels written in the mid-th century, an Irish style had emerged in which at the beginning of each gospel there was on the left a full ornamented page, brilliantly coloured, with intricate designs of spirals and interlocking animals and plants while on the right there was an introductory page beginning with a large, beautully proportioned, capital letter. In addition, portraits or symbols were used to depict each of the four evangelists.The Book of Kells marked the pinnacle of Irish achievement in manuscript production, with its profusion of illustration, colour and ornamentation, and its repeated use of the same symbols for the four evangelists a man for Matthew, a lion for Mark, a calf for Luke and an eagle for John.By the end of the th century the monastic settlement at Derry would have changed little.The monastic complex would still have been made of timber.The only new physical feature would have been the erection of a few high stone crosses.The scriptorium may have begun to produce some basic illuminated manuscripts, similar to the Cathach. It would, of course, have continued to make straight copies of the psalms and gospels.In  a fleet of ships, the like of which had never been seen before, sailed up Lough Foyle.These ships, built of oak, some over  feet long and  feet wide, and steered by a rudder paddle, were powered by both oar and sail.From  feet pine masts fluttered square sails of double-thickness strips of red and white woven cloth, and, from behind rows of shields slung over the side, men, up to  on each boat, pulled on narrow-bladed spruce oars and manoeuvred the boats into the sheltered waters of the River Foyle.They beached their boats, which drew only three feet of water, on the shore beneath the monastery.From the boats men rushed up the hill, the leaders wearing protective coats of mail and helmets with a nose piece which projected down over the face the rest, following close behind, in thick woollen coats which reached half way down their thighs.They all carried a round wooden shield, many of which were painted either yellow or black.The long, broad, two-edged iron sword and the long-handled, broad-edged battle axe were the principal weapons they carried.Some were armed with spears, others with bow and arrows. Most had an iron kne, with a wood or bone handle, tucked in their belts.The Vikings had located the monastic settlement at Derry, and, as where in Ireland and Britain, they met no organised resistance.They burnt the abbey and massacred her clergy and students.Not only was the monastery an easy target to attack because of its secluded, yet very accessible, location, it was also a very rewarding one.Derry was a centre of wealth, rich in lands and livestock.The Vikings were interested in food provisions, to sustain further voyages, as well as in the precious metal ornaments associated with a monastery.They were also interested in taking prisoners, especially girls, as they had been trading in human slaves to central Europe for centuries.The Vikings never attempted to settle in Derry.In  they again attacked, but this time they were driven back, with great losses, by Niall Caille, King of Ireland and Murchadh, Prince of Aileach.Derry continued to be attractive to Viking invaders throughout the th century.In  the shrine of Colum Cille was carried away by the Vikings. In  and  she was again plundered.Derry’s long-term growth did not suffer because of the Viking raids,anything it increased.With the Viking raids on Iona in ,  and , the monks acquired a site at Kells in central Ireland, and, bearing the relics of Colum Cille, moved there to found a new monastery.There was a steady rise in the status and importance of Derry from , as she succeeded Iona and then Kells as the centre of all Columban foundations in Ireland and Scotland.By the end of the th century Derry was known as Doire Columcille, as opposed to Doire Calgach.This Viking period resulted in two new additions to the monastery at Derry: her first stone church and a round tower.Sometime after the first raid in , the wooden church, which the Vikings burnt, was replaced with a stone one.It would have been a simple building, similar in shape to its wooden predecessors.This stone single-chamber church, later known as Dubh Regles or Black Abbey church, was perhaps no longer than  feet.It probably had one narrow slit for a window, and was roofed with stone to simulate overlapping tiles. Housing for the monks and their tenant farmers was still made of the traditional wood and wattle combination.Sometime between the end of the th century and the beginning of the th century, a round tower of stone was built next to the Black Abbey church to serve a iety of purposes, such as a belfry, a watch tower and a place of refuge.Perhaps  feet high and  feet in diameter, with five floors, each lit by one window except the top which had four, entrance was gained,  feet above ground level, by a movable ladder.Inside, each wooden floor was linked by a wooden staircase. If set on fire this tower would have been a death trap, as the up-draught working on ignited wooden floors would have created an inferno.By the turn of the th century Derry was beginning to see a revival in its fortunes as an important monastic town.Apart from the additions of elaborate stone crosses, a small dry-stone church and a round tower, Derry was still very similar to the settlement founded in . googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Minister Mallon said: “Just yesterday I confirmed MOT test centres would no longer be carrying out tests and that all vehicles eligible would be issued with a temporary exemption certicate . However, this could not be applied to four year old cars and taxis due to legal requirements. “I am pleased to confirm that following signicant work by my officials, I am now able to put arrangements in place to ensure four year old cars can get back on the road,given the ongoing health advice, the journey to be made is essential. googletag.cmd.push “From tomorrow, four year old cars will be given a TEC for six months from the date that their MOT test should have been due. This will allow the vehicle to be taxed and driven on the road. Issuing the certicates will take some time but the exemption will automatically apply from the due date. “The PSNI has agreed to our request that given these exceptional circumstances, where PSNI detects a vehicle without a valid MOT certicate, it will in suitable cases, exercise its discretion under the law, in circumstances where there is no identied risk to public safety. It is important that drivers realise that they are responsible under the law for the roadworthiness of their vehicle at all times.” googletag.cmd.push The Minister continued that she and officials are continuing to urgently explore options to support taxis at this dficult time. “For taxis which require PSV tests, new regulation and legislation needs to be put in place to allow the legal issuing of Temporary Exemption Certicates and,despite best efforts, this is taking longer to resolve. However, I want to reassure taxi drivers that we are working urgently on options to help them at this dficult time. I recognise the taxi industry is being hard hit by this public health and economic crisis. I also am working with Executive colleagues and pushing hard for more support from the UK Government for the self-employed. Protecting drivers and the public from the serious impact of COVID- is my priority.” Alastair Ross, Head of Public Policy for Northern Ireland at the Association of British Insurers, said: “Insurers recognise that this is worrying time for everyone and will take a pragmatic view. They will not penalise customers for something that is entirely out of their control and where motorists with an MOT exemption certicate request a quote, they will not be prejudiced by their lack of a valid MOT certicate. This applies regardless of whether they wish to renew with their existing insurance provider or are looking to take out a policy with a dferent insurer. “Insurers do, however, expect that motorists comply with their legal obligation to keep their vehicle in a roadworthy conditionthey are driving it. Those affected by the ongoing MOT testing suspension should continue to service their vehicle and carry out basic checks such as looking out for brake wear, ensuring that all lights are working and that windscreen liquid and oil are at the correct levels.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Rosemarie and Sean Lynn from Dungiven tied the knot in a simple ceremony at St Columba’s Church, Long Tower after their original date fell victim to Covid-. The couple were married last Tuesday evening at :pm, just hours before government regulations banned weddings were due to be introduced. Rosemarie told the County Derry Post they were determined to go ahead with the ceremony. She said: “We got engaged in November and decided we’d get married on the th of April this year. googletag.cmd.push “A few weeks ago, our venue rang and said with coronavirus, they weren’t going to be open. “It was important for us to get married and have family and friends back at the house, so we brought it forward to Saturday the th of March.”  Boris Johnson and the British government had other ideas, however, and Monday’s announcement that weddings were banned left the couple ‘numb’. Things changed when Sean and Rosemarie rang their driver to inform him of the developments. “Brian, our limousine driver and he said: ‘Why don’t you ring the council and see what they can do ’ “So I rang and said we had the papers, we were getting married in the church and the priest was willing to marry us, but we needed the go-ahead from the council. She said to leave it with her. googletag.cmd.push “I was praying to St Anthony when the lady from the council rang back and said we had the go-ahead until  o’clock that night to get married.” The short time frame became even tighter as Rosemarie’s fianceacute Sean finished a sht as an emergency medical technician with the Ambulance Service. “Rosemarie rang and said: you’d better come home quickly because we’re getting married tonight,” said Sean. “I rang the duty control manager and was shocked when they gave the go-ahead for special circumstances. “I had to come home, lt the wean, scrub up quickly and get into the chapel. Of course, she was  minutes late.” Denied the luxury of time that most brides have to prepare for their wedding, Rosemarie was forced to improvise. She said: “I got ready, did my own nails, my own make-up, put the fake tan on, did the whole thing myself. “I had a wee dress I got last year that I just loved. It wasn’t even meant to be for a wedding, I just bought it because I liked it. “It felt like I was in a film. I wasn’t nervous, I was excited, but it was almost an out-of-body experience.” The couple’s faith was central to their decision-making, and both were delighted with the simple ceremony. Sean said: “I’m over the moon, I really am. “The big day would have been great to have, but the sacrament between me, her and God was the main thing.” “The ceremony was beautul,” said Rosemarie. “It was the two of us, the priest, two witnesses and Sean’s wee boy and we all had to stand six feet apart and sit six feet apart in the limousine because of the regulations. Although the couple were able to celebrate with a few drinks at Sean’s house, the honeymoon is on hold as he helps battle the threat of Covid-. He said: “We have a few days to spend together and keep le simple. I’m going out to C every day, so I’m glad for a few hours of something positive.” Rosemarie is hugely proud of her husband’s role. She said: “He’ll be back out in a few days saving lives, that’s what he loves to do. “He always was that kind of person who cares for people, and that’s what it’s all about now.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Letrsquos look out for each other in these turbulent times.Cllr McMurray mdash who spoke ahead of Mondayrsquos ban on access to Tyrella beach mdash said that last weekend he had been ldquoinundated with messages and calls regarding the number of people attending local forest parks.ldquoUnfortunately, it appears that the general population is not adhering to the advice in relation to social distancing and I would suggest that they are nearly treating this crisis as a national holiday.I will be reviewing access to our forest parks with party leaders and senior management team, he said.ldquoWe have been pushing a lot of advice and guidance with regard to the need for social distancing but it is not resting with the population. It is so dficult to balance the need to allow people the space to walk to protect mental and health and well-being, but we ask that the public refer to guidelines set out by public health officials to do so safely.Cllr Lewis said the closure of leisure centres, play areas, council-owned facilities and schools across this district had been done for peoplersquos safety.ldquoI appeal to people to recognise why these areas are closed, he continued. ldquoPlay parks and sporting facilities should not be used. It is imperative that we recognise and accept the seriousness of this illness. It simply cannot be business as usual, we must heed all relevant medical advice.Cllr Lewis added: ldquoThis is for our own safety, while also protecting the integrity of our health service and those vital, dedicated experienced staff who support it. Newry, Mourne and Down Council has taken extreme measures and please respect these steps. This isnrsquot a holiday and itrsquos not a jolly. We are protecting le.Cllr Gallagher said it was vital that everyone in the community ensures that social isolation is adhered to, highlighting the need to reduce the risk.He added: ldquoThe elderly and those with predisposed health conditions need to keep their distance and follow public health guidelines. Remain at homepossible and get someone to do your shopping. Family units are important. People must not allow others into their home and visits that are not essential must stopCllr Howell said that last week the Education Minister finally declared that schools would close to help prevent the spread of COVID-, highlighting the huge responsibility on parents to ensure that not just children are safe, but so are those they are in contact with.She added: ldquoUnfortunately, some young people think that this is the start of their summer holidays and they are free to continue with no worries or concerns. I am appealing to parents to inform their children about social distancing and the importance of adhering to the public health guidelines.ldquoIf your teenager goes out can you be confident that they will observe the required social distancing of two metres  Many of them donrsquot have the willpower to practice what is being advised.ldquoAs a parent I know only too well how hard it is to keep teenagers from going out, but we need to set the example to our children. If these social distancing rules are not adhered to, they will come home and unknowingly pass the virus to others, perhaps family members with underlying health issues or aged grandparents..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/25th March 2020 Pretend.jpg","title":"‘Pretend cough’ over credit union worker  ","story":"POLICE will be contacted after a saver in Downpatrick Credit Union ldquopretend coughed at a staff member last week during the coronavirus outbreak, it has been revealed.Mary Cullen, chair of Downpatrick Credit Union, warned that it was now operating a ldquozero tolerance policy as incidents of verbal abuse to staff increased during reduced opening hours.She said the credit union, which is situated in Market Street, had been inundated with messages of support after she posted a warning post on Facebook last Friday where she asked members to respect everyonersquos boundaries regarding social distancing and to accept the new reduced hours cover.She said a member of the public verbally abused a member of staff before ldquopretend coughing at them.ldquoThis particular incident is not acceptable and going forward, unfortunately, Members who cannot be courteous to our staff will not be served, said Mary in her post.ldquoWe are in a very dangerous time and are doing the best that we can.

If people did go out, they were advised to keep two metres apart.Council officials say the latest closures are part of the organisationrsquos ongoing coronavirus response and that the decision will be reviewed on an ongoing basis in line with Public Health Agencyguidance.Last week, council officials had decided to keep Tyrella beach and Delamont Country Park open and had agreed to waive the entrance fee to both facilities.

It may not be popular, but sometimes we need to take the tough decisions.ldquoUnfortunately, after the droves of people went to local parks and forests on Sunday, it appears people still arenrsquot taking the coronavirus issue seriously and are clearly flouting PHA guidelines.Cllr Owens added: ldquoThis is not a decision that Newry, Mourne and Down Council wanted to take as we had hoped that common sense may have prevailed. It was a decision we were forced to take and we must do all we can to stop the spread of this disease..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/25th March 2020 C Diary.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C March 25%2C 1980  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK mdash Downpatrickrsquos Grand Cinema is to re-open in September, six years after it closed its doors.Workmen will move in shortly to give the cinema a pound, facelt and when the picture house is re-opened, it should be able to compete with the best in Ireland.That is the aim of Mr Harley Breen, the owner of the cinema, who this week outlined the work which needs to be completed before the curtain opens.ldquoWork is expected to take around six months and will involve completely refurbishing the inside of the cinema, Mr Breen explained.ldquoWe will be taking out all the seating and replacing it with a new type of seating, the most exclusive available.

He wrote: ldquoSo I turned with all my heart to the Lord My God...He protected me and he consoled me as a Father for his son...There is no other God...The Lord God said through the prophet, lsquoCall on me in the day of distress and I will set you free and you will glory mersquo.They said this is a reminder that ldquoGod truly is our shield in the stre.

However, that fails to take into account the number of people likely to die as a result of an economic lockdown and possible recession. Of course these people won’t die from a single disease at one go but in small numbers or singly, many not in hospital, but at home or in homes their deaths will not be part of a dramatic event with emotive pictures of hospital wards over-flowing. But die they will and probably mostly the same people, the already vulnerable.To discuss the economy now sounds callous, but one must to remember, it is the economy that enables us to live, pays the bills and sustains the NHS . Consider this: Prof Thomason BBC Radio , One o’clock News March  warns that the current lockdown in  weeks could lead to a recession exceeding .% decline in GDP, some forecasts are of up to %. The result of that could be a loss of ledue to economic recession that would exceed the number of lives saved via the current medically induced lockdown.Unemployment and poverty are known killers, which is what a recession implies. Poor diet for struggling families reduces resistance to disease, the stress and strain of long term unemployment impacts upon health and longevity.Meanwhile, those who survived economically may be saddled with enormous debts, adding stress and strain to that already incurred in trying to restart a business or get back on their feet. Concurrently, businesses that survived by going into debt will be less attractive for future investors and lenders. Lost savings and devalued investment plans to pay for our retirement will be eaten up, leading more people to rely more heavily on the state or lapse into poverty. This in turn adds to the problems of raising funds, ie. taxes, to pay for the health and social services ‘survivors’ will probably need even more. All of these are ‘hidden’ killers, years off lives.The Institute for Public Policy estimated that , preventable deaths occurred due to austerity: that poverty kills is a well known fact, but does not have the immediacy of country-wide lockdowns or the medical drama that attracts the media, but it still kills.Current government policy depends heavily on Imperial College, London’s, research on how to suppress Covid  and like all research it depends on assumptions here that the suppression tactics now employed will work over the next  weeks, but there is no guarantee. They also recognise that suppression carries major economic implications, although they have not calculated it, which brings one back to Prof Thomas , he has calculated the potential loss of le vis-a-vis current government strategy.Any strategy relating to any pandemic will inevitably have to look at a iety of options, all of which involve having to let some people die to save others, the problem is in identying which kills the fewest. Unfortunately, the best strategy is not always the one that is the most immediately and emotionally satisfying or makes the best headlines. The prime ministercontracting Covid  makes good headlines, a statistical increase in the number of people dying who live in poverty in areas with high levels of disadvantage including the Falls Road or Lower Newtownards Road in a couple of years time probably won’t even register. Working class adults might die at a younger age than in previous decades.Ultimately, the economic costs will probably kill more people than Covid  itself, which is a reality that government, media and electorate has to consciously take into accountwe are to minimise deaths. This may mean having to re-open the economy and reverse lockdown at the cost of increasing short term deaths for decreasing long-term deaths: not pleasant, but it saves lives.• James Dingley, an academic, is chair of Francis Hutcheson Institute"},{"url":null,"title":"postponed historic passion play goes back vow made  ","story":"Closure of churches shows the shallowness of evangelicalism and the lack of interest in the public worship of GodNI Coronavirus Lockdown -  COVID- deaths across UK in  hours is biggest number of fatalities since crisis began two weeks ago.NewsLatestTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats OnThings To DoArts and EntertainmentNightleRetroLestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensCoronavirusNewsOpinionColumnistsPostponed historic Passion Play goes back to a vow made in Almost lost in the current barrage of closures, cancellations and postponements in every sphere of le, an announcement on March  resonated with the poignant irony of history.By The RoamerThursday, th March , : pm\"\"Jesus Christ and John.  Performance of the Oberammergau Passion Play : Freelance“The nd Oberammergau Passion Play will be postponed due to the current situation caused by the corona pandemic.”In the Baian district of Germany, beside the Ammer River and framed by the Ammergau Alps, Oberammergau is a small town known for its woodcarvings, its NATO School and its internationally renowned -yearly Passion Play.The organisers of the Passion Play summarised the historical signicance of the postponement, explaining that the event “goes back to a vow made in . At that time, the people of Oberammergau vowed to perform the suffering, death and resurrection of Christ,no one died of the plague anymore.Engraving depicting the Passion Play in  : Freelance \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Therefore the plans to perform the Passion Play in  are currently beginning.”Held in the ‘decimal year’I attended a performance in , one of the most vivid and moving experiences of my letime, and indeed, I had toyed with the thought of ing this year.There would have been  performancesstarting in mid-May with an expected , visitors from around the globe paying between € to € for a ticket.The enormous production has been running since  except for two cancellations and a postponement.Crucixion scene in the Passion Play in  : FreelanceNearly half of the , residents of today’s Oberammergau are involved with the show - actors, musicians, front of house, backstage and looking after the horses, sheep, goats, cows and doves that add to the often intensely dramatic scenes.The other half of the townsfolk run the restaurants, shops, hotels, BBs and farmsteads where many of the visitors stay,they’re lucky.The nearest accommodation I could get in  was St. Anton am Arlberg in the Austrian Tirol.Participants in the production must have been born in Oberammergau or have lived there for  years.Oberammergau on the River Ammer in  : FreelanceIt’s not unusual for up to four generations of the same family to be taking part in the same run of plays, which can involve around  children on stage at the same time.In the th century, passion plays were held in many parts of Europe, often performed on carts in the street.They re-enacted Christ’s last days, from his entry into Jerusalem to his trial, crucixion, resurrection and ascension.In the bigger and more elaborate productions, when scene one ended the cart trundled off to another part of the town or city and scene two arrived, and so on!They were the ‘poor man’s Bible’ enabling even the most illiterate become familiar with Bible stories.But Oberammergau’s is the only play with its origins in a collective vow to God which has run, almost without a break, for approaching four centuries. This unique double-accolade brought the town a UNESCO World Heritage award.It’s quite likely that passion plays were already common events but a document in Oberammergau’s archives records “the first decades of the th century went by in peaceful calm…but then followed the Thirty Years’ War with all its hardships from  until . As early as , infectious diseases spread in Baia. This village was spared by dutul vigilance until the church festival in , when a man brought the plague into the village.”More than  local folk died and almost every family lost loved ones.“Faced with the great distress that the terrible illness inflicted upon the population,” the archive continues, “the leaders of the community came together and pledged to hold a passion tragedy once every ten years. From this day forward, not a single person perished, even though a great number of them still showed signs of the plague”.They made the pledge in  and the Passion Play was first performed at Pentecost in , on a wooden stage that some say was built on plague-victims’ graves near the church.Surviving documentation from the  production shows that the play ran ‘completed smoothly’ with seating provided ‘for spectators standing close by.’From  the date of the performance was changed to the beginning of each decade, by which time folk were coming from all over Germany to see substantial productions.Paint and painters for the  show’s scenery cost  guilders, ‘the gentlemen trumpeters’ got two guilders and  guilders went ‘to the actors for drink’!There was no performance in  when Maximilian III’s Clerical Council banned all passion plays and when another threat loomed in the s the so-called ‘mad’ King Ludwig II of Baia protected it from those who wanted to close down the ‘harmful’ passion plays. Following WWI the play was postponed until , and there was a special th anniversary show in  attended by Adolf Hitler.There were no performances in  during WWII, just the second cancellation…until now.Plans to perform the Passion Play in  are already under way, for over  five-hour shows, several thousand participants, a -strong orchestra and a -strong choir.\"\" for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from Belfast News LetterSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bYSBpT sc-elJkPf kHpvMx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Lurgan man Geoff Gates, who has created the Limitless weight loss programme, believes people shouldn’t use lockdown as an excuse to adopt a poor diet and exercise routine.He said: “The Limitless philosophy has always been that the only reason people get stuck in a rut is because of their limiting beliefs. If you feel good through proper nutrition and smart exercise, you will naturally be drawn towards better lestyle choices.”At times of great stress, for many diet often goes out the window. Geoff shared his advice on how to eat well during a crisis: “The issue here is we need to be not using food to combat stress but instead, tackle the stress head-on, that’s the first step. “I get all my clients to start practising meditation immediately. When I first suggest meditation to someone, they often wonderI’m joking or being serious. It’s not some hippy-dippy woo-woo thing, this is a proper prescription. They often report profound changes almost immediately.”Geoff said that having been overweight and depressed himself helped him to create Limitless: “There is gold in the depths of despair, and I count my experience as a blessing now. Without my personal struggle, I could never have developed the techniques to create the best weight loss programme in the world.”He said in terms of nutrition it was important to focus on quality food: “Broccoli is especially good for the lungs and its funny that it looks like a lung, just like walnuts a great for brain health they look like a little brain. As bizarre as this may sound, I believe our creator has provided us with clues.”Geoff said the current situation makes it even more important to make shopping lists, especially now that visits to the shops are meant to be limited. He commented: “There are always ways to make healthy food convenient food. We all own a freezer, so it’s just a matter of being a little bit smart and preparing ahead. “I advise my coaching clients to buy freezer bags then put all the ingredients together in the bag and use as and when they need them.”In terms of exercise he said: “I don’t think it’s been more relevant to use our time to focus on our health and fitness. The most used excuse I have heard continuously through my  years in the fitness industry was that people didn’t have time. Now we have an abundance of it. “So now you have plenty of time the next excuse will be that you don’t have the equipment. I refuse to hear it. “The simple truth is we don’t need gyms and never have needed them. The way I see it is the gyms have been a luxury, not a necessity. “The misconception is that you cannot get strong, fit and healthy without one – the truth being you can get the same results with just your good self, become your own gym.”He added: “If I was going to advise on one piece of home equipment it would be an adjustable set of dumbbells. He suggested a quickfire lockdown workout could include  bodyweight squats,  star jumps,  straight punches,  upper cuts,  push ups and  mountain climbers.He said those conscious of social distancing could exercise earlier to avoid encountering other people: “I have always got up at am to train so when I am out running in the morning, there is no one about. For me, being outside when no one is around is perfectly acceptable. We need fresh air.”\"\" for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from Belfast News LetterSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bYSBpT sc-elJkPf kHpvMx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Michael said: “People think, the music is dark and intense, they’re going to be really dark and intense.The band’s original line-up of Michael, Andy and Fyfe \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Then they go on stage everything is rosy.“It’s really the old cliche – never judge a book by its cover. With us the lyrics are kind of twisted, but there’s a big, dark sense of humour there.“We let off steam when we go on stage and jump up and down for  minutes. You tend to be pretty chilled afterwards.”When the band first got together in  lead singer and guitarist Andy Cairns was a pupil at Ballyclare High. Michael, who attended Larne Grammar with Fyfe Ewing , wasn’t present for the band’s first recording though he was there in spirit.On the front cover of metal magazine Kerrang! in He said: “Fyfe and I were in the same English class and would have traded records. He was in a band, I was in a band. “His band and Andy’s band had played a gig at Jordanstown Uni. They had more in common than they did with their own bands. “They did a demo together. I was there in spirit because Andy didn’t have a bass guitar so Fyfe asked me and I lent Andy my bass. Andy played it on the first demo.” Michael soon joined to play his own bass and things clicked from the start: “Our first gig was at Giro’s supporting Decadence Within. It went down really well, I was flabbergasted. “We weren’t trying to be U or Guns N’ Roses – those were the two big musical things at that time in , . I don’t mind U and I quite like Guns N’ Roses but we had our own little thing going on.“You kind of gravitated towards anyone who liked something that wasn’t Bryan Adams at school. In Larne where I grew up the metallers hung out with the goths, the goths hung out with the indie kids and you heard Joy Division, The Dead Kennedys and Slayer. We clung together as musical outsiders.”The friendship between Michael and Andy has extended more than  years: “I think I was  or  when Andy and I first met. When the first album came out I’d just turned . I’ll be  later this month.“One thing we did find quite early on is that we tend to be huffers. We got that out of our system. If you don’t like something you say then, you don’t leave it for six months and have a meltdown in the middle of eastern Europe.“There’s a lot of rock and rolls myths and stereotypes out there that people love. One of them I think which is not correct is that you need to have creative tension in a band. Maybe that’s works for one or two albums, but that burns itself out really quickly.“It’s really great working together as part of the band, what I get out of it is quite special, I think I’m very lucky.”Michael contrasted the crazy intensity when the band shared a house together in Belfast’s Holylandswith the situation now where they all live in dferent parts of the UK.He said: “I think there was one time me and Andy worked out over an -months period we’d been within  metres of each other every day with the exception of Christmas Day.“Now I live in Larne, Andy lives in Cambridge and Neilour drummer lives in Derby. When we meet up there’s lots of interesting stories and dferent experiences to share rather than walk down the main street in Larne going, ‘oh there’s the lads’.”On Fyfe, his original bandmate who left in , he said: “I haven’t spoken to him since he left. We have friends in common. He’s doing alright I believe. He moved to Brighton, he’s been there  years now. He’s had very little involvement in the music business.“It’s a real pity because he was such a great drummer, it’s just he couldn’t really get on with the lestyle. Somewhere down the line we’ll meet again.”Family man with attic of collectablesLast year Michael contributed a recipe to a celebrity cookbook to support his nephew Matthew who had been diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia.Michael said: “Matthew is doing well. The family is getting things back on track. It was a big thing, he’s still a bit traumatised as you’d expect but he’s doing well.”Of family le at home in Larne he said: “My we works full time soI’m at home I’m daddy day care. The only downside is when I’m away, I’m away   so there’s a whole dferent set of challenges for my we who’s an absolute saint.”Askedhis children, aged nine and five, were excited about their dad being in an band, he said: “They saw us at a big festival in Europe which was great because they were at the side of the stage and they were able to see , people from the other side. “They’re quite blasé about their dad being in a band. They’re not into music that much, they’re more into games, football and karate.”Michael went on to discuss some of the Therapy  treasure trovecontained in his attic: “I’ve got Fyfe’s original snare drum that he used on Babyteeth, the basses that I used on Troublegum. I’ve got a lot of the flyers, posters, tour passes and recordings and audio stuff I’ve kept over the years. The attic is a disaster area.”In the early days of Therapy  a pair of denim dungarees were Michael’s stagewear of choice. Askedstill had them, he said: “I actually do. I’m quite pleased that I’d still fit into them but I never wear them.“When we did the Troublegum shows a while ago there were some bets that they’d turn up again, but it didn’t happen for whatever reason. But never say never – right now I don’t think the world is ready for that.”Michael explained that there were in fact two pairs of his trademark dungarees, one of them he referred to as ‘the good pair’ then immediately burst out laughing.“Can you imagine denim dungarees after three weeks of touring ” he said. “It’s hard to find a -hour laundrette when you’re on the road. They were crunchy. I’m surprised they’re still in one piece.”Dates cancelled due to pandemicTherapy  have had to cancel some European tour dates later this month because of the coronavirus.Michael said: “We’ve had to cancel where the crowds would have been above ,, some of the big festivals we were really looking forward to. As it stands we’re still planning to play some of the smaller shows unless told otherwise. “It’s something that you just can’t account for. Gigs sometimes have to be cancelled because of illness or injury but this is beyond the band’s control. It’s a bit of a headmelt.”Touring major European cities is a far cry from the band’s gigging schedule in : “When we started there was the Warzone Collective in Belfast and Hope Promotions in Dublin. They worked in conjunction and would bring hardcore punk bands over like Fugazi and Concrete Sox. “We knew the Warzone people and that led to us being invited down to Dublin to play with the likes of Babes In Toyland. “They’d rent rooms above pubs for gigs, in Belfast they used the Art College and the Conor Hall. “We were quite lucky to get in at that DIY stage.”It’s okay not to be okayMuch is currently being done to raise awareness and funds for musicians suffering from mental health issues, particularly through Aware NI, PIPS and Help Musicians. As a band Therapy  have been tuned into the struggle from day one with many of Andy’s lyrics exploring the pressures that weigh on the human mind.Michael said: “It’s something that we’re all very aware of and very sympathetic towards. Being a young male in Northern Ireland there’s a bit of a ‘come on, man up’ vibe. That has been very damaging for a couple of generations now.“There is a rock and roll myth that everyone’s an all-singing, all-dancing, all-fighting gunslinger – you roll into town decimate it and move on. It’s not really like that.“I don’t think anyone hasn’t been touched by themselves or someone  who has had a mental health issue.“It’s such a fragile thing. It’s right there, there just seems not to be the widespread acknowledgement that it exists and for treatment. It’s so underfunded. It’s a real tragedy.”He added: “We’ve always had a lot of empathy, we take people as they are, we don’t have the answers, but we do try to let people know that it’s okay to not be okay. “Just talk about it, talk to your friends, talk to someone, reach out. Thankfully that stigma is moving away.“We’ve always been celebrating the outsiders – be yourself, do you own thing, what makes you happy, self preservation, looking after yourself.”Michael continued: “It’s one of these rock and roll myths that people want their musicians to be messed up and die young and leave a pretty corpse. “None of us subscribe to that at all.“We like to have a good time when we’re on tour, but doing it for so long there’s a massive element of self preservation.“It’s about doing a good gig. People don’t come and see you againyou’re stood there looking bored or hungover. It’s not pleasant for anyone – the player or the watcher.“We all feel a big responsibility to put on a good show.

The aim is that these virtues help to form them.With such a vast space at its disposal, the school ensures that children are given a rich and versatile experience.In the orchard, pupils pick fruit from pear, apple, plum, and damson trees which they use in cooking lessons during the autumn.They also grow  dferent kinds of fruit, salad, and vegetables in a polytunnel.Earlier this year, St Josephrsquos Primary was awarded a gold award in the UNICEF Rights Respecting School programme.The award is granted to schools which show a commitment to promoting childrenrsquos rights and raising awareness of these amongst young people.It recognises efforts to place the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child at the heart of a schoolrsquos policies and practice.ldquoAlongside our work on rights is the fact that we want our children to be aware of their responsibilities, said Mr Rein.ldquoYes, they have rights to be heard, but they also have a responsibility to listen to others.St Josephrsquos was the first school in Wales to develop a pupil parliament.Every child is a member of the parliament, and elected representatives from eight student groups form a cabinet which has decision-making powers.ldquoThe school parliament is a vehicle for the pupils to have a voice, so they can decide how the school can be a better place, how the local community can improve, and how we can help the UN to achieve their global goals, continued Mr Rein.ldquoSo the children are looking inward ndash at themselves and how the school environment can improve ndash and looking outward at how we can develop better links with the parishes and the areas of Penarth and Dinas Powys.ldquoOur Eco Ministry has been involved in a project to tidy beaches and pick up plastic, and our Healthy Schools and School Mission team have given food to local foodbanks.St Josephrsquos Primary is one of  innovation schools which have been chosen to contribute to the Welsh Governmentrsquos new curriculum framework, which will be rolled out to every school in Wales by . As part of the new framework, schools are required to design their own curriculum based upon the needs of specic learners, rather than adhering to a national learning program.St Josephrsquos curriculum is lsquoresearch-ledrsquo, meaning it is based on findings in child development and cognitive science.Teachers have undertaken training on how childrenrsquos bodies and minds develop, and lessons have been designed to enhance pupilsrsquo personal, social, and physical development.Mr Rein said: ldquoWe want our children to develop physically in terms of their gross motor skills, their fine motor skills, and their locomotion skills.ldquoWe have apparatus on which they can hang, climb, and swing, to build up their core strength.Mr Rein called the schoolrsquos curriculum lsquoreally ambitions.rsquoldquoWe are one of sixteen innovation schools in Wales helping to implement the new curriculum and develop special projects to do with the curriculum, he said.ldquoWe have taken that on by focusing on a knowledge-rich curriculum, so that we develop childrenrsquos knowledge, skills, and give them fantastic experiences.ldquoWe have taken good, rich materials from lots of dferent places, and developed some of our own, which we have implemented to a high standard.ldquoBehaviour in the school is exemplary partly because we have spent a long time asking what good teachers do.ldquoWe practice together as staff, so our teachers are working at a high level using a very well-researched curriculum.In last yearrsquos maths reasoning test,  per cent of pupils at St Josephrsquos scored higher than the national average, and  per cent of pupils scored above average in the National Reading TestldquoWersquore extremely proud of our achievements at St Josephrsquos, said Mr Rein.ldquoEverything we do is based on the best available research and is designed to help each inidual child thrive.The schoolrsquos curriculum has recently been praised by cabinet member for education and regeneration, Councillor Lis Burnett, who said St Josephrsquos had done a lsquobrilliant job.rsquoShe said: ldquoThe new Curriculum for Wales is inspiring schools to take a more holistic approach toward learning.ldquoIt encourages them to focus more on how and why the curriculum is being delivered, rather than delivering specic content and academic results.ldquoSt Josephrsquos have done a brilliant job in helping craft this approach, and in turn have seen their own curriculum and learning practices blossom. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It will cut planned capital spending to pound million from a budget of pound million and will work to grow online.MS said in a statement: \"Whilst we remain confident that the post-crisis future of the business and our transformation programme remains as strong as ever, trading over the next nine to  months in our clothing and home and international businesses is likely to be severely impacted.\"As a result, it is not possible to provide meaningful guidance on future earnings, although we are taking every step to secure future value for shareholders, colleagues and suppliers.\"The chairman of Wetherspoon has said that a decline in sales was accelerated when prime minister Boris Johnson told people to stay away from pubs.After rising in previous weeks, sales fell by . per cent in the week to March  and the slowdown has picked up further since the Prime Ministers statement, Tim Martin said.It came as the business reported profit before tax rose  per cent to pound. million in the half-year to January  on revenue of pound million.Health secretary Matt Hancock has warned that coronavirus will keep spreading as long as people continue to socialise.Speaking on talkRadio, Mr Hancock said: \"If you stay at home you are saving lives.\"I know, of course, this is a more dangerous disease for older people but not exclusively, some young people get it too.\"But, more importantly, the more that people continue to go out and continue to socialise, the more it will spread and the longer were going to have to keep these measures in place.\"So, were urging people to follow the public health advice.In the emergency Bill thats in front of Parliament right now, we are taking the powers to be able to enforce these measures, so we can make it happen by lawwe need to.\"Id rather not do that and the evidence so far is that the vast majority of people are following the advice, are doing what is sensible and right.\"The company said it was cancelling its interim idend, which had been p a year earlier.Mr Martin said: \"It is obviously very dficult to predict, in these circumstances, how events will unfold in future weeks and months, but we now anticipate profits being below market expectations, so long as the current health scare continues.\"As a result of this uncertainty, it is impossible to provide realistic guidance on our performance in the remainder of the financial year.\"The company has decided to delay most capital projects and to reduce expenditure, where possible, including the cancellation of the interim idend.\"As a result of these actions, combined with the Governments proposals on business rates relief and credit guarantee facilities, the company believes it has sufficient liquidity to maintain operations at a substantially lower level of sales.\"Nicola Sturgeon has urged anyone who left the medical profession in the past three years to consider ing to help the fight against coronavirus.Sharing a plea from Scotlands chief nursing officer Fiona McQueen, the First minister tweeted: \"Scotlands NHS needs our help to meet the #coronavirus challenge.\"Mr Hancock said some retired medics whoto work in the NHS to fight the coronavirus will be able to come \"straight back in\".Asked on the BBCs Breakfast programme when workers couldto the NHS, he said: \"Well, over the next couple of weeks because for some theyll have very recently left and they can come straight back in, their annual trainings been up-to-date and they can just restart.\"Imagineyouve left at Christmas, for instance, you can restart straight away. For others who have been out for a little bit longer, they may need more of a refresher because, of course, its vital that we keep people safe, thats the whole point of the NHS.\"So the letter will go out today, well then be engaging inidually with all those who respond and I very much hope that many, many thousands will respond.\"From those Ive talked to, I think people can see just how important this is. The training will happen for those who need it over the next couple of weeks, at the same time well allocate people to a hospital near them because theres a logistical exercise here as well.\"Mr Hancock suggested that tougher measures could have to be brought inpeople do not follow the Governments advice.He told the BBCs Breakfast programme: \"What I can say is thatpeople follow the advice, stay home which saves lives andthey keep apart from others, more than two metres, more than six foot, then we can tackle this and we can turn the tide.\"The scientists advise that we can turn the tide in  weekspeople follow the advice.\"If people dont follow the advice, then itll be longer and we might have to bring more and tougher measures.\"He added: \"We have brought these measures in earlier than Italy did in terms of where theyre up to with the number of cases.\"But were absolutely clear thatwe need to, we have the powers, in fact weve got a Bill in front of Parliament now to strengthen those powers further.\"But I think its far betterpeople follow the advice.\"The FTSE  has risen by more than five per cent in early trading as travel companies jump out ahead after a bruising few weeks for the sector sparked by the Covid- pandemic.Intercontinental Hotels jumped by about a fth despite revealing that demand for rooms was the worst it had ever seen, as markets opened on Friday.EasyJet also rose by around  per cent and cruise operator Carnival jumped by around . per cent.Meanwhile, the price of a barrel of Brent crude oil joined the rally, rising five per cent to . dollarsafter a massive fall earlier in the week.Shadow chancellor John McDonnell has warned about the prospect of a recessionpeople do not receive their wages.Labour has urged the Government to ensure the salaries of workers are protected as businesses lose trade during the coronavirus pandemic.He told the BBCs Breakfast programme: \"We need the Government now to act to protect people to keep them in their jobs.\"In that way, what well be able to do is ensure people have an income coming in, their job will be protected, but we prevent the second wave of a recession hitting uswere not careful.\"Becausepeople lose their jobs, they dont have their wages, demand collapses in the economy and then you really do have a recession.\"The lesson from past crises like these is act fast and act big, so thats why were saying the Government should step in and say to employers, well cover  per cent of your wages, you keep people in work.\"Demand for a room at Intercontinental Hotels has reached its lowest point in history, the group said, as the travel industry continues to be battered by the coronavirus pandemic.The business revealed that it would be cutting costs, eliminating its idend and reducing salaries in a bid to save cash.However, shares in the group, which have been badly hit in recent months, jumped by around  per cent on market open in London as investors reacted positively to the companys proposals.Chief executive Keith Barr said: \"Demand for hotels is currently at the lowest levels weve ever seen.Intercontinental Hotel Group has a robust business model and the measures we are announcing today to reduce costs and preserve cash give us the capacity to manage the business through this unique environment and to support our owners during this incredibly dficult time.\"These were not easy choices and we are mindful of the impact these decisions will have on our colleagues and shareholders.\"However, we believe that these are essential to ensuring that we come out of this as strong as we possibly can and ready to capitalise on what remains an industry with excellent long-term growth potential.\"Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders , said the list of key workers to whom schools will remain open is \"perhaps more extensive than we might have expected\".He said: \"Realistically, theywill need to identy these children by lunchtime.\"Mr Barton added: \"We already know from the trajectory of this that were not going to have many staff.\"We have to be careful that the message to parents is not business as usual.\"Matt Hancock said that a communication will be sent to around . million people who are classed as vulnerable to set out specic action for them to take.The Health secretary told Sky News: \"The first thing were going to do is set out exactly what conditions that applies to.\"We expect about . million people to then get a communication from the NHS to say that they are part of this and what they need to do.\"Many of these people have pre-existing health conditions and so will be very worried right now, and I understand that, and theyll need very specic sets of action - for instance, how do you go about still getting your chemoyou have cancer whilst also social-distancing \"If you have cancer its particularly important to stay away from other people, but you also of course have got to keep going with your chemotherapy.\"He added: \"These are some of the most dficult and challenging cases so well be getting in contact with them, butpeople think that they are on this list and dont receive a communication from the NHS, then they also need to get in contact.\"So that is under way, the money was announced for it yesterday.\"A combination of money to the NHS and money to councils because theyve got a very big part to play in keeping people safe.\"ASCL general secretary Geoff Barton said schools will have first worked to identy vulnerable children, as they will know who they are, and will then be looking at the \"key worker\" category.He said the ASCL is telling members: \"You have to do your best to negotiate the key workers list. Youre doing this to a tight timescale, and what you offer children on Monday may be dferent to what you offer next Wednesday.\"Mr Barton said that initially, schools will be doing all they can so that pupils who need to can still turn up to their own school after the weekend.In the longer term, there will be more strategic planning of school provision, he added.Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers , said: \"The Government has made clear that every child who can be safely cared for at home should be. And their advice makes clear too that this applies to children of key workers.\"For the vast majority of children and young people, school buildings will close tonight and not reopen for the foreseeable future.\"Taking up a place at school during this time of wider closure is the offer of last resort, for the minority of key workers, who have no alternative.\"School leaders have many questions that remain unanswered about how this will work in practice. We will continue to work with the Government throughout the day to provide greater clarity to schools to enable this reduced offer to be up and running as soon as possible.\"Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, added her voice to calls from school leaders urging parents to only send their children in as a last resort.She said: \"This is a very long list and could result in some schools having the majority of pupils attending. This will not achieve the goal of slowing the spread of the virus.\"So it is vitally important that parents follow government advice to keep their children at home, wherever possible. Schools can only accommodate a limited number of children and the fewer children making the journey to school, and the fewer children in educational settings, the lower the risk that the virus can spread.\"The competition watchdog has launched a taskforce to tackle businesses looking to exploit the coronavirus outbreak to take advantage of customers.The Competition and Markets Authoritysaid the outbreak has prompted concerns that people could be exploited by companies \"charging excessive prices or making misleading claims about their products\".It said it has already contacted traders and s over excessive pricing of hand sanitiser as part of its efforts.Andrea Coscelli, the CMAs chief executive, said: \"This is obviously a time when we all have to behave responsibly to protect our fellow citizens, and particularly those who are most vulnerable.\"We urge retailers to behave responsibly in the exceptional circumstances of the Covid- outbreak.\"Butthey do not, our taskforce is monitoring market developments to enable us to intervene as quickly as possible.\"We have a range of options at our disposal, from warnings to enforcement action to seeking emergency powers.\"The ceremonial of the Changing of the Guard at Buckingham Palace, St Jamess Palace and Windsor Castle is being postponed until further notice \"in line with Government advice to avoid mass gatherings\", Buckingham Palace has announced.The palace said in a statement that the situation would be \"reviewed on an ongoing basis, with a view to restarting when appropriate\". article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Providing that people continue to be generous then there wonrsquot be a problem.As increasing numbers of people self-isolate to protect themselves from the virus, Claire said that the food bank was able to offer deliveriesnecessary.ldquoWe are a very open foodbank. If yoursquove got a need, just ask and we can do our best, said Claire.After the Church in Wales announced the suspension of public acts of worship, the Tabernacle and other churches in Penarth have been finding innovative ways to support their congregation.ldquoFrom this weekend we are going to be streaming virtual services, said Clair.ldquoOur musicians are recording pieces in their homes which will be shared online.ldquoAll our small groups meet on Zoom so wersquore in touch with our congregation.ldquoThe more elderly congregations are keeping in touch by phone and telephone to support them in every way ndash spiritually, emotionally and practically.ldquoThe epidemic is pulling everybody together and cutting across denominational boundaries.The Tabernacle Foodbank is open for donations and collections between am and pm Monday to Friday.You can also deliver donations to their collection point in Sainsburyrsquos on Windsor Road.The foodbank would particularly welcome tinned products, including curry, chilli, corned beef, and potatoes.For more information, visit: Info@tabspenarth or call:  . article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Irsquove grown up on the beach.ldquoI normally take landscape pictures because I love the water and some of the sunsets here are incredible, especially in the winter.Rochelle wrote her Instagram handle on the parcels, so that people who found them could send her a message.ldquoIt was just to make someone smile, and Irsquove had some lovely comments from people who got back to me on Instagram, she said.ldquoThey said they were going to put it up in their room and frame it.ldquoSome people were feeling a bit down and didnrsquot expect to find anything, so it cheered them up.ldquoMy job was done ndash the main purpose was to make people smile and it did - it made me smile too.ldquoI think itrsquos very important to say hello, especiallypeople are living by themselves orthey havenrsquot got their family around.ldquoWhen Irsquom normally walking the dog I say hello and have a chat, but itrsquos quite hard to do that now because everyone is quite wary.ldquoI donrsquot have to have that physical contact with someone to brighten up their day.ldquoArt is just a dferent  to communicate with. You knowsomeonersquos a bit shy and they donrsquot want to speak using words, they may want to draw a picture and open up that way instead.ldquoI think art can show feelings that words canrsquot quite express, so itrsquos a great idea to share that with the community.At a time of uncertainty and doubt, Rochelle ended with a message of hope and solidarity:ldquoI think as a community we could do so much more at this time, she saidldquoEveryone is concerned about how long it is going to last, but I am hopeful we can get past it, andwe all work together and remain positive we may come out of this in an even better situation than we was before.Rochelle would like to make clear that all parcels were fully sanitised.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It needs to be stressed that the vast majority of people are doing the right thing. I want to thank them publicly and to acknowledge how tough it is to stay at home and keep your distance from others. However there has been a lot of attention on the small minority who have not followed the public health advice. It is essential that these tight restrictions are rigorously maintained in the weeks ahead. Quite simply, lives depend on it. So, let me appeal to everyone not to slip back into old habits. Any signs of complacency and impatience must be strongly resisted. Our actions now will impact on the spread of coronavirus in future weeks. Don’t lose heart or think the measures aren’t working just because of the current numbers and trends. What we are doing now is aimed at future weeks – slowing the spread of the virus and flattening its peak by drastically reducing human contact. That’s how we protect each other and protect our health service. We all have to stick with it, to get through this together. I make no apology for re-stating the vital advice once again. Stay at home. Please. Only go outit’s absolutely necessary and,you do, make sure you keep your distance from others. Wash your hands, thoroughly. When you sneeze or cough, use a tissue and then dispose of it – catch it, bin it, kill it. As a prominent doctor said in recent days, we can all be heroes. When we get through this as a society – which we will – you will want to look back and say you played your full part in fighting back against COVID-. I know very well the anxiety being felt across the community. I’m feeling exactly the same way - as a husband, a father and a son. But we have grounds for hope and positivity, alongside the deep apprehension. Social distancing will make a major dference –we keep doing it right and doing it together. Let’s take heart from the way people from all walks of le are coming forward to provide essential help. Our HSC workforce appeal is seeking new recruits to our health and social care workforce during the pandemic. Within a few short days of the appeal going live online, more than , people had signed up to register their interest in taking on roles. And there is large scale community-level volunteering going on, helping older and other vulnerable people cope during these dficult times. The Department for Communities is playing a key role in this area. When we look back, I hope we will remember how this crisis brought out the best in us how neighbours and strangers alike stepped up to help their fellow citizens in a time of grave need. When this is over, we will have a lot of rebuilding to do. Grief-stricken families, shattered lives, the economic and social fabric of society permanently altered. The collective spirit being forged right now will stand us in good stead.  addthis, Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:    n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n n n n n bannerbox_aacdfbeb   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n n n n n bannerbox_ccddfbfadbd   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]  []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
