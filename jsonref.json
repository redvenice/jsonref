First, nation states are far more effective in a crisis than unwieldy groupings of different countries.But the most bitter irony for Europe is that the one foreign politician our liberal commentariat have most mocked for years — Boris Johnson — is also the one who acted swiftly and decisively when it came to securing the vaccines. The number of doses you have speaks for itself.And it was the ‘sensible’ federalist Europeans who have failed so miserably.Anyone who still doubts the wisdom of Brexit needs only to look at the vaccine chaos unfolding across the Channel — and think again.Council leader \u0027appalled\u0027 at Covid vaccine appointments being missed in Notts - Nottinghamshire LiveNottinghamshire Live - Latest local news, sport \u0026amp business from Nottingham"},{"url":null,"title":"Coronavirus China reports highest daily COVID 19 cases 5 months infections surge Hebei","story":"Share this articleBeijing raises guard against Hebei outbreak with stricter measures in transport systems, communities - Global Times"},{"url":null,"title":"Head GP surgery used Matt Hancock promote vaccine roll says GOT ANY","story":"Share this article It comes as NHS trusts in London are on the verge of being overwhelmed, according to leaked health service documents, while other trusts are rapidly turning normal wards into intensive care units (ICUs).As of January 4, there were 30,451 people in UK hospitals with coronavirus, much higher than the April 12 peak of 21,684.Rupert Pearse, professor of intensive care medicine and a consultant at the Royal London, said his own ICU staff are having to care for far more sick patients as he urged the public to heed the \u0027stay at home\u0027 lockdown message.He told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme there would usually be one fully-trained ICU nurse to one ICU patient but staff are becoming increasingly stretched.\u0027Right now we are diluting down to one (ICU) nurse to three (patients) and filling those gaps with untrained staff and in some instances doctors helping nurses deliver their care ... and we\u0027re even facing diluting that further to one in four,\u0027 he said.\u0027As intensive care doctors, we\u0027re not sure how we can together deliver the quality of care that we need to.\u0027Speaking on behalf of the Intensive Care Society, he said the problems are not just in London, but in other hospitals across the UK, and are not limited to ICU wards."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/639ccd7c2bb09540962e5c30d6250846eecdab69/0_0_2500_1652/master/2500.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=46bf9b339cf6486dd5b3c186a58cc356 1400w","title":"great walls of china beijings burgeoning graffiti scene in pictures","story":"A thriving graffiti culture has been brewing for decades in Beijing, featuring Chinese characters, animals of the zodiac ... and complaints about the price of pork "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6efa64530b073cf46a2486142bb78d2a41410a86/0_19_768_461/master/768.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=93c41b1907795ca2b902a17eaf792f01","title":"detransition baby by torrey peters review a comedy of manners","story":"“Yes, go ask this other woman, Katrina, to split her unborn child with a transsexual.

Supermarkets have been one of the main beneficiaries of consumer spending during the coronavirus pandemic, as locked-down shoppers spent extra money on groceries that they would usually have spent in pubs, restaurants and cafes.The Bradford-based supermarket Morrisons on Tuesday reported a big sales increase, while the retail analysts Kantar said December was a record month for UK supermarkets. Despite soaring revenues, profits have been held back by significant extra costs involved in delivering social distancing measures and covering for self-isolating staff.The relief had been given on the expectation that supermarkets and other retailers would struggle, but essential shops that remained open instead reported sales increase. Sainsbury’s, B\u0026ampM and a host of other retailers only pledged to pay back the relief after a public outcry.The supermarket also reported a record number of steaks sold in the run-up to New Year’s Eve, as UK shoppers were mostly confined to their homes.He said the government “frontline workers”, such as supermarket staff and teachers, should be among those prioritised for vaccination. “Priority should be given to those that need it first. Those on the frontline should be part of that when and if capability is available,” he said.Roberts said that the end of Brexit transition had not led to problems with the flow of goods from Europe so far but there had been some problems in sending goods to Northern Ireland, where the group has had to supplement its own products with locally-sourced Spar items. He said the group was “working through administrative change”.Roberts cautioned that the flow of imports from Europe was low at present and would not be back up to normal levels until the third week of January, suggesting that any issues with new paperwork on imports from the EU might emerge then.Dr Clive Black, an analyst at Shore Capital, said it was “a quite fabulous trading update from Sainsbury’s. It is really is some decades since we have been able to make that statement.” He said not only sales were better than expected but also gross profit margins on general merchandise and clothing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d140dc5a709e475a95f772f391564573d005871/0_114_5868_3522/master/5868.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=20a856715e9500fb7535e058f56000a0","title":"what happened in washington dc is happening around the world","story":"Far-right attempts to storm parliaments and government offices have happened in Germany, Hungary and the Netherlands in recent yearsJust one day after black women, once again, protected US democracy in Georgia, white men were attacking the very symbol of that democracy in Washington DC. The first attack was actually mounted from inside, by a group of Republican congressmembers, who challenged President-elect Joe Biden’s election victory. The second attack started outside, as a pro-Trump and “Stop the Steal” rally, and ended inside, with a mob of far-right protesters breaking through the remarkably weak police cordon and illegally entering the US Capitol, where they proceeded to take selfies with police officers while shouting “Acab” (All Cops are Bastards”).I have been studying the international far right for almost 30 years now and have never seen them as emboldened as in the last years. To be clear, this is not just about Donald Trump or the US. Just last year mostly far-right anti-vaccine protesters tried to storm the Reichstag, the German parliament, also facing remarkably weak police resistance. And in the Netherlands, angry farmers, often led by the far-right Farmers Defence Force, have been destroying government offices and threatening politicians since 2019. Even further back, in 2006, far-right mobs stormed the Hungarian parliament and battled the police for weeks in the streets of Budapest – in many ways the start of the radicalization and return to power of current prime minister Viktor Orbán.How and why did we get here? First and foremost, through a long process of cowardice, failures, and shortsighted opportunism of the mainstream right. Already in 2012, in the wake of the deadly terrorist attack on a Sikh temple in Wisconsin, by a longtime prominent neo-Nazi, I wrote, “the extremist rhetoric that comes from so-called law-abiding patriots should be taken more seriously”. I advised Republican leaders to “be more careful in choosing their company and insinuations”. What happened, however, was the opposite: far-right ideas and people were mainstreamed rather than ostracized.As in so many other things, Donald Trump has been a major catalyst of this process, but not its initiator. The radicalization of the US right wing predates Trump by decades. It even predates the Tea party, which mostly helped to bring the far right into the heart of the Republican party. Obviously, racism and racist dog-whistling have been key to the party since they launched their infamous Southern Strategy in the 1970s, which brought white Southerners to the Republican party, but this goes far beyond that. The radicalization is not just ideological, it is anti-systemic.In the past decades rightwing politicians and pundits have opportunistically pandered to the far-right electorate by defining them as “the real people” and declaring this loud minority to be an allegedly victimized silent majority. While this is again a much broader process, it has played out very strongly in the US, where it was amplified by a booming “conservative” media network, from talk radio to Fox News, as well as the still formidable infrastructure of the religious right. It was so successful that, already before Trump won the presidency, a majority of white Evangelicals believed that “discrimination against whites is now as critical as discrimination against non-whites”. A year later, a poll found that a majority of white Evangelicals believed they are more discriminated than Muslims in the US.Undoubtedly, some rightwing politicians and pundits really believe their own propaganda, but the vast majority knows very well that the far-right electorate constitutes only a minority of the population and that white people – whether Evangelical or not – do not face anywhere near as much discrimination as Muslims, or other non-white and non-Christian groups. And if they don’t believe it, then ask them this question: do you really think these protesters would have made it into the Capitol if they had been African American or Muslim?Most politicians and pundits probably initially pandered to these groups for opportunistic reasons, hoping to win far-right support. But as the far right got more and more emboldened, and violent, the mainstream right became more and more afraid. Many mainstream politicians and other elites no longer dare to speak out against the far right, afraid to be personally and politically threatened by their mob.The increasingly bold and open political violence of far-right gangs and mobs should be a wake-up call to all enablers of, and peddlers to, the far right. You don’t control them. They control you. And while these gangs don’t represent the broader part of the population that holds far-right views, or supports far-right candidates and parties, fundamentally they share a similar worldview. And in this view there is no space for nuance or compromise. You are either an ally, on their terms, or an enemy. And there is no mercy for enemies, not even for former allies. Just ask Georgia Governor Brian Kemp or secretary of state Brad Raffensperger.It is therefore high time that liberal democratic journalists, politicians, and pundits finally see the far right for what it is: a threat to liberal democracy. A formidable threat, for sure, but also a threat can only succeed with the tacit help of the mainstream, either by opportunistic coalitions or by cowardly non-responses. We are not in the 1930s. Today, the vast majority of Americans and Europeans support liberal democracy. But they have become the silent majority, increasingly ignored and unprotected by its representatives.It is time to stand up to the far right and for liberal democracy. It is time to call out the racism and undemocratic discourses and behaviors of the far right. And it is time to clearly and openly reject the toxic narrative of white victimhood. Of course, we should acknowledge the struggle of parts of the white population, notably the farmers and workers, but not at the expense of the non-white population or of liberal democracy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d1d77fe9d7879f5cf967ebfc218182e3d0e4d7ef/0_386_5816_3491/master/5816.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c2694de5d94636aeb28ae7be2f893d9d","title":"share your experiences of homeschooling during the new uk lockdown","story":"We would like to hear from parents and s about how they have been coping with teaching children at homeThe prime minister said he would be “extremely cautious” about when schools will be able to reopen fully after lockdown is lifted.

Enrico scored goals everywhere he went in his career, but lining up against the Rossoneri always seemed to draw out something extra: the red-and-black flag to his bull.He punctured them 17 times in 24 encounters across Serie A and the Coppa Italia, more than he managed against any other club. Not bad when you consider the names of some of the defenders sent against him: Baresi, Costacurta, Maldini, Nesta and Stam.The back four that started for Milan on Wednesday was not quite in that category. Alessio Romagnoli and Simon Kjær have formed an encouraging partnership at centre-back, but a feeling persists that the Italian has not yet realised his full potential, while his partner’s lack of pace can be exposed. On the right side of defence, Diogo Dalot made only his third Serie A start.Theo Hernández, one of Milan’s best signings in years, still has a way to go before being considered in such illustrious company. And this would turn out to be one of the left-back’s worst games for some time.There were not 20 minutes played when Chiesa left Hernández in his wake for the first time, shimmying in from the right-hand touchline, cutting the ball square for Paulo Dybala and accelerating towards the penalty box. The ball came back to him via the Argentinian’s masterful heel-flick, and Chiesa buried it into the far corner.It was a breathtaking start to a game that would keep its audience gasping. Chiesa had already struck the woodwork, slamming a half-volley into the right-hand upright, after Wojciech Szczesny produced an important near-post stop to thwart Samu Castillejo at the other end.The stakes were as high as they could be at such an early stage of a campaign. Milan, unbeaten in 28 league games, had an opportunity to move four points clear at the top following Inter’s defeat to Sampdoria earlier on Wednesday. More significant still, a win would have left Juventus – champions of the past nine Serie A seasons – 13 points adrift.Both teams were missing key players. Milan have been without Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Ismaël Bennacer since mid-December, but a suspension to Sandro Tonali, coupled with positive Covid tests for Rade Krunic and Ante Rebic left them so short that manager Stefano Pioli was compelled to draft right-back Davide Calabria into central midfield.Juventus had to do without Álvaro Morata up front – the only player besides Cristiano Ronaldo in their squad who had scored more than twice in this league season. Both of their own starting full-backs, Alex Sandro and Juan Cuadrado, were out after testing positive for Covid as well.Neither side, though, seemed willing to let such setbacks discourage them from trying to play on the front foot. Opportunities came thick and fast throughout the first 45 minutes. It was a Bentancur backheel inside his own penalty box that set up that early chance for Castillejo, and Aaron Ramsey was every bit as careless with a pass across the face the area that went straight to Milan’s Jens Petter Hauge.The Rossoneri equalised in the 41st minute, Calabria placing a gorgeous first-time finish into the top corner from the edge of the box. A 1-1 scoreline was a fair reflection of the balance of play, but it was a surprise not to see VAR intervene after Hakan Calhanoglu had appeared to foul Adrien Rabiot at the start of the move.Chiesa, though, was not finished. One month earlier, after Juventus’s win over Dinamo Kyiv, a journalist had asked him whether there were any traits he would like to steal from his dad. Federico did not mention Milan, back then, but instead replied: “his ability to shoot off either foot. He had phenomenal co-ordination.”Perhaps he has inherited more than he knows. Having scored the opener with his right boot, Chiesa put Juventus back in front with the left, running straight at Hernández to put the defender off balance before picking out the bottom corner, giving Gianluigi Donnarumma no chance even from 20 yards out.It was the turning point. Milan did not yield but, for the first time in almost a year, Pioli’s young and overachieving team had come up against a domestic opponent they simply did not have answers for. When Chiesa limped out of the game after scoring his second, Andrea Pirlo sent on Dejan Kulusevski – a €35m signing – to replace him.The second-half substitutions spoke to the realities of both teams. Juventus went on to introduce Weston McKennie, Arthur and Federico Bernardeschi from the bench. Milan had Pierre Kalulu, a 20-year-old centre-back, together with teenage academy graduates Daniel Maldini and Lorenzo Colombo.It was McKennie who made it 3-1 to Juventus, from a Kulsevski assist. A greater vindication of Juventus’s summer transfer strategy was hard to imagine. On a night where Cristiano Ronaldo failed to sparkle, three young players who arrived together this summer had taken over the most important game of the league season to date, dragging their team back into the title picture.Chiesa, though, was the greatest gamble. He was the last to arrive, this October, and there were many who considered his signing to be superfluous for a club that already seemed to have too many options to deploy in support of Ronaldo – from Kulusevski, Dybala, Bernardeschi and Ramsey through to the newly-returned Morata. Was it really necessary to add Chiesa – whose deal is structured as a loan with obligation to buy, but could eventually cost them €60m in transfer fees – on top?If he can continue as he has started in 2021, there will be no doubts. He had already scored, and sparkled, in the 4-1 rout of Udinese at the weekend, and on Wednesday Pirlo was specific in highlighting the different options Chiesa gives to the team as a player who could dominate one-on-ones in the final 30 metres of the pitch.After all those years observing his father, he has grown into a most accomplished thief."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c1aa1b5467156832a7c96f78308078d26a5100b4/0_167_2578_1547/master/2578.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=596d39500ca365704cc63330a715fc8a","title":"mikel arteta expects mesut ozil future to be decided in next few days arsenal","story":"Mesut Özil’s future will be decided in “the next few days”, according to Mikel Arteta, although the Arsenal manager admits he does not yet know how or when the saga around his exiled playmaker will end.There is little doubt Özil, whose contract expires in the summer, has played his final game for the club and all parties are keen to move on from a soured relationship that has cast an expensive shadow. Özil has been linked with Fenerbahce and DC United in this transfer window although his agent, Erkut Sogut, said on Wednesday that the player’s “priority is to stay” until the end of the season.“I’m saying we will decide what’s happening in the next few days,” Arteta said when asked whether Özil could remain at the club. “I don’t know what is going to happen. Obviously now he’s free to negotiate with other clubs. We will discuss internally what the best solution for him is for the near future, obviously with the player and agent too, and try to find the best solution for everyone.”The logistics around Özil departing this month are likely to be complicated given none of his suitors would be able to match his £350,000 weekly wage. A simpler option might be for the former Germany international to commit to moving after his deal ends, but that would mean Arsenal have to retain a player omitted from Arteta’s Premier League and Europa League squads in October.“If something was sorted this month, it’s because it is good for both parties, it is good for Mesut and his future, and it’s good for the club,” Arteta said. “If that’s the case, we will move forward. If it’s not the case, the player will stay here.”Regarding Özil’s ostracising, which in theory could be reversed this month, Arteta said: “We have to make a decision. I had to make a decision and I made it. I knew the consequences of it and now we’re going to have to make another one in January.”Özil is available for the FA Cup third-round tie with Newcastle on Saturday, although his involvement seems unthinkable. Thomas Partey could return from the thigh injury that has kept him out for all bar 45 minutes of the past two months’ action, although Arteta suggested he could be kept fresh for the Premier League meeting with Crystal Palace on Thursday.Whereas Özil’s fate is a relatively short-term issue for Arteta, the manager is increasingly anxious about the prospects of Folarin Balogun, a highly rated striker, committing his future to Arsenal. Balogun’s deal is up in July and a number of clubs are understood to be making inquiries about taking him on. Arteta suggested any stumbling block lay at the feet of the player’s representatives.“You need three parties to make a deal,” he said. “For sure the club wants to make a deal, the manager wants to make a deal, the player wants to stay and I’m not sure about the agent.”Balogun shares a representative with several of Arsenal’s other young players, as well as the Borussia Dortmund forward Jadon Sancho. Arteta subsequently rowed back slightly on his assertion but the implication was clear.“We are doing everything we can to keep him here and hopefully they are doing the same and they defend the same interests, which is the players’ interest, which is to stay at the football club and be successful with us.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c6d2756390921495e217a1a2324f0fd22c8e524/352_51_3575_2144/master/3575.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dfb532792904ab807aecbd5808eca204","title":"manchester city purring again after stumbling upon winning formula guardiola stones","story":"Guardiola planned to build a new cathedral on a Dias-Laporte defence but Stones has emerged as key to team’s resurgenceFootball feels at times almost wilfully contrarian, as though it delights in confounding those who try to plot a rational course through it. You can plan and plan and plan. You can have a manager who is famous for his attention to detail. You can study all the data, watch all the videos, think and plot and cogitate, formulate your grand strategy, then it turns out the answer all along was John Stones.Manchester City needed a right-sided central defender, everybody said. They had Aymeric Laporte, who was probably alongside Virgil van Dijk the best central defender in the league, but he prefers the left side, so City’s job in the summer was to find somebody to play alongside him. In that area, it was widely agreed, their recruitment had gone a little awry.They signed Nathan Aké from Bournemouth for £41m, the first senior central defender City had signed since Laporte in January 2018. But one who plays on the left. A squad player, then: cover, back-up for Laporte. Aké played in the first two games of the season, in the second of which City let in five against Leicester. He has started only three league games since, and given the last two of those were against West Brom and Newcastle United, two of the five lowest-scoring sides in the ision, it’s fair to say his role is to be used against less threatening opponents to rest the frontline.But then City pounced. Rúben Dias, for £61.5m plus Nicolás Otamendi. A right-sided central defender, the first senior player City had bought in that position since Stones in August 2016. This, then, was the future: Dias and Laporte, the rock on which Pep Guardiola’s new cathedral would be built.And Dias has excelled this season. Few central defenders have adapted quite so unobtrusively into the Premier League, with all its long diags and elbows and second balls. His unruffled authority, the galvanising effect he has had, has drawn comparison to Van Dijk, which may be premature but is not unreasonable. The difference between City now and the porousness of the Leicester game is profound.But he hasn’t done it on the right of central defensive pairing he’s done it on the left and alongside him is Stones. The solution, it turns out, was there all along.Stones is one of those unfortunate players who has become a cipher for a wider debate. It’s never just about him or his form: conversations always end up in debates about the nature of defending and how central defenders should behave. As soon as Everton signed him from Barnsley, he became the icon of a new age: an angular, slightly gawky figure more notable for his reading of the game and his passing than for the more traditional defensive arts of heading, tackling and marking.It’s a concept with which English football has never been entirely comfortable. Stones made errors, as all young defenders will, as all defenders will, particular those asked to play in the proactive way he is, and each one felt like a blow on the whole concept of defending he represents. The nadir perhaps came in England’s defeat against the Netherlands in the Nations League semi-final in 2019. However many mistakes could be tolerated for the benefits brought by his willingness to pass out from the back, this was too many.Form and confidence disintegrated. Last season he started only 12 league games. He played only one of the first nine this season. At 26, he felt like yesterday’s man. But then he came into the team against Burnley at the end of November. Since then, when he has been on the pitch, the only goal City have conceded is Callum Hudson-Odoi’s largely inconsequential late strike for Chelsea on Sunday.Against Manchester United on Wednesday, the Stones-Dias partnership was exceptional again, and Stones’s goal a welcome bonus. United didn’t play badly in a high-quality game, but the threat they offered was restricted largely to a couple of long-range efforts, a handful of set plays and some extremely optimistic appeals for penalties. Fernandinho was superb, not only in his goal, but in the way he protected the space in front of Stones and Dias, stifling Bruno Fernandes.City this season have been scratchy. They’ve lacked their usual flow. When they drew at home with West Brom, it seemed reasonable to wonder whether this might be the worst side of which Guardiola had ever been in charge. But against Chelsea and then again on Wednesday, there was a zip to their football. In 12 games since the defeat at Tottenham, they’ve conceded only three times.The question was how well the new partnership would stand up against a strong counterattacking side. Here, perhaps, was the beginning of an answer. United beat City three times last season, each time by sitting deep and playing on the break. In the league meeting last month, Guardiola was so concerned by United’s counter he had his side sit off and essentially accept a 0-0. There was no such caution on Wednesday.City in spells looked back to their fluent best, and that is part down to the sense of security the defence gives them. In Stones’s resurgence, perhaps, there is a reminder that players are not mere bundles of attributes and statistics. They have lives beyond the pitch. Form and confidence can fluctuate. A few bad games, a few bad months, shouldn’t mean a player is written off for ever. They are human and therefore unpredictable. Planning can only ever go so far. This may be a formula that has been stumbled upon, but City are starting to look hugely impressive."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/90dce577f1e8434ee1e444d0dda057b6ef94b522/0_87_4503_2702/master/4503.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7e629495c60596e45c163390224db69f","title":"colin bell a life in pictures","story":"The ‘King of the Kippax’ has died aged 74 after a short illness – we take a look back at the career of the legendary Manchester City midfielder"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fe1987e5d1df93e1f45f924dbea9467b78aa8b8e/631_358_4643_2788/master/4643.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a3648aadd82261cfe691b3debc2801e9","title":"the joys of being an absolute beginner for life","story":"The phrase ‘adult beginner’ can sound patronising. It implies you are learning something you should have mastered as a child. But learning is not just for the youngOne day a number of years ago, I was deep into a game of draughts on holiday with my daughter, then almost four, in the small library of a beachfront town. Her eye drifted to a nearby table, where a black-and-white board bristled with far more interesting figures (many a future chess master has been innocently drawn in by “horses” and “castles”).“What’s that?” she asked. “Chess,” I replied. “Can we play?” she pleaded. I nodded absently.There was just one problem: I didn’t know how. I dimly remembered having learned the basic moves as a kid, but chess had never stuck. This fact vaguely haunted me through my life. I would see an idle board in a hotel lobby or a puzzle in a weekend newspaper supplement, and feel a pang.I had picked up a general awareness of chess. I knew the names Bobby Fischer and Garry Kasparov. I knew that the game had enchanted historical luminaries including Marcel Duchamp and Vladimir Nabokov. I knew the cliche about grandmasters being able to look a dozen moves ahead. I knew that chess, like classical music, was shorthand in movies for genius – often of the evil variety. But I knew chess the way I “knew” the Japanese language: what it looks like, what it sounds like, its Japaneseness, without actually comprehending it.I decided to learn the game, if only to be able to teach my daughter. It took a few hours, hunched over my smartphone at kids’ birthday parties or waiting in line at Trader Joe’s, to get a feel for the basic moves. Soon, I was playing, and some-times even beating, the weakest computer opponents (the ones with catastrophic blunders abundantly programmed in). Yet it soon became apparent that I had little concept of the larger strategies. I didn’t want to try to teach what I knew only poorly.And yet, how to learn? The number of chess books was dauntingly huge. Sure, there was Chess for Dummies. But beyond that, the chess literature was enormous. It was filled with algebraic-looking thickets of chess notation, a quasi-language that itself had to be learned. And the books were achingly specific: for example, A Complete Guide to Playing 3 Nc3 Against the French Defence.That’s right: an entire book devoted to the permutations of a single move – a move that, I should add, has been regularly played for a century. Yet people were still figuring out, 100 years and many chess books later – 288 pages’ worth of new things to say about it.A well travelled fact that one hears early in chess is that after only three moves, there are more possible game variations than there are atoms in the universe. And, indeed, I felt cosmically stupefied as I tried to figure out how to boil down this exponentially complex game to someone whose favourite show was Curious George.So I did what any self-respecting modern parent does: I hired a coach. The twist was that I wanted someone to teach my daughter and me at the same time.For most of us, the beginner stage is something to be got through as quickly as possible, like a socially awkward skin condition. But even if we’re only passing through, we should pay particular attention to this moment. For once it goes, it’s hard to get back.Think of a time when you first visited a new, distant place, one with which you were barely familiar. Upon arrival, you were alive to every novelty. The smell of the food in the street! The curious traffic signs! The sound of the call to prayer! Flushed from the comfort of your usual surrounds, forced to learn new rituals and ways to communicate, you gained sensory superpowers. You paid attention to everything because you didn’t even know what you needed to know to get by. After a few days, as you became more expert in the place, what seemed strange began to become familiar. You began noticing less. You became safer in your knowledge. Your behaviour became more automatic.Even as your skills and knowledge progress, there is a potential value to holding on to that beginner’s mind. In what’s come to be known as the Dunning-Kruger effect, the psychologists David Dunning and Justin Kruger showed that on various cognitive tests the people who did the worst were also the ones who most “grossly overestimated” their actual performance. They were “unskilled and unaware of it”.This can certainly be a stumbling block for beginners. But additional research later showed that the only thing worse than hardly knowing anything was knowing a little bit more. This pattern appears in the real world: doctors learning a spinal surgery technique committed the most errors not on the first or second try, but on the 15th pilot errors, meanwhile, seem to peak not in the earliest stages but after about 800 hours of flight time.I’m not suggesting experts have much to fear from beginners. Experts, who tend to be “skilled, and aware of it”, are much more efficient in their problem-solving processes, more efficient in their movement (the best chess players, for example, tend also to be the best speed-chess players). They can draw upon more experience, and more finely honed reflexes. Beginner chess players will waste time considering a huge range of possible moves, while grandmasters zero in on the most relevant options (even if they then spend a lot of time calculating which of those moves are best).And yet, sometimes, the “habits of the expert”, as the Zen master Suzuki called it, can be an obstacle – particularly when new solutions are demanded. With all their experience, experts can come to see what they expect to see. Chess experts can become so entranced by a move they remember from a previous game that they miss a more optimal move on a different part of the board.This tendency for people to default to the familiar, even in the face of a more optimal novel solution, has been termed the Einstellung effect (after a German word that means “set”).In the famous “candle problem”, people are asked to attach a candle to the wall using nothing more than a box of matches and a box of tacks. People struggle to solve it because they get hung up on the “functional fixedness” of the box as a container for tacks, not as a theoretical shelf for the candle. There is one group, it turns out, that tends to do pretty well on the candle problem: five-year-olds.Why? The researchers who found this suggest that younger children have a more fluid “conception of function” than older children or adults. They are less hung up on things being for something, and more able to view them simply as things to be used in all sorts of ways. Small wonder they conquer new technology so handily everything is new for them.Children, in a very real sense, have beginners’ minds, open to wider possibilities. They see the world with fresher eyes, are less burdened with preconception and past experience, and are less guided by what they know to be true.They are more likely to pick up details that adults might discard as irrelevant. Because they’re less concerned with being wrong or looking foolish, children often ask questions that adults won’t ask.No one wants to stay a beginner. We all want to get better. But even as our skills improve, and our knowledge and experience grow, what I hope to encourage is the preservation, or even cultivation, of that spirit of the novice: the naive optimism, the hypervigilant alertness that comes with novelty and insecurity, the willingness to look foolish, and the permission to ask obvious questions – the unencumbered beginner’s mind.What the chess master Benjamin Blumenfeld advised a century ago applies as much to life as to chess: “Before you make your move, look at the position as if you were a beginner.”When my daughter first began competing in school chess tournaments, I would often chat to other parents. Sometimes, I’d ask if they played chess themselves. Usually, the reply was an apologetic shrug and a smile. When I volunteered that I was learning to play, the tone was cheerily patronising: “Good luck with that!” I thought: “If this game is so good for kids, why are adults ignoring it?” Seeing someone playing Angry Birds, I wanted to tap them on the shoulder and say: “Why are you having your kids do chess while you do that? This is the game of kings! There are chess games recorded from the 15th century!”At chess tournaments, I saw a dynamic that was all too familiar from the world of children’s activities: kids doing the activity, and adults like me staring into their smartphones.Sure, we parents had work to do, work that we allowed to spill into weekends, work that helped pay for the lessons our kids were enjoying (or enduring). But I also wondered if we, in our constant chaperoning of these lessons, were imparting a subtle lesson: that learning was for the young.Strolling down the hall during one tournament, I looked into a classroom and saw a group of parents with what I took to be an instructor. They were playing chess! Just then, as if on cue, a group of kids passed me, peering in on the same scene. “Why are adults learning chess?” one asked, in a vaguely mocking tone, to the collective amusement of the group. They marched on while I slowly died in front of a cheery bulletin board.I was tired of sitting on the sidelines. I wanted in. And that is how I got a membership card from the US Chess Federation and started throwing myself in.Early on, I was nervous, even though I really had nothing to lose, save my pride. “A master can sometimes play badly,” as one grandmaster put it, “a fan, never!” And fan I was: the sombre rituals, the pulse-pounding encounters, the tense atmosphere. It was three hours of sustained concentration and intense thinking, with my phone turned off. It felt like a gym for the brain.Being a beginner can be hard at any age, but it gets harder as you get older. Children’s brains and bodies are built for doing, failing, and doing again. We applaud virtually anything they do, because they are trying.With adults, it’s more complicated. The phrase “adult beginner” has an air of gentle pity. It reeks of obligatory retraining seminars and uncomfortable chairs. It implies the learning of something that you should have perhaps already learned.There is safety in sticking with what we’re already good at. “It’s hard to be old and bad at something,” as a friend, returning to hockey after many decades, put it. We can be so put off by being a beginner that we forget we were once beginners in all sorts of things, until we were not.Adult beginners face their own version of what is known by sporting coaches as “stereotype threat”, whereby a negative image becomes associated with a particular group of players, and leads them to repeat mistakes – in this case, one that says it’s harder to learn when you’re older. There’s a pernicious, goading little voice: “You’ve started too late. Why bother?” One day, at her swimming lesson, I was impressed to see my daughter “flip turn” at the end of the lane while doing a backstroke. This is not something I can do. “How’d you learn to do that?” I asked. “You have to be a kid,” she responded matter-of-factly.As I was finding out, this kind of idea is deeply ingrained in chess. There seems to be a relation between the age at which you first learned the game and your later success in tournaments. This idea is so pervasive that Magnus Carlsen, the current No 1, is held as a fascinating outlier. “At five years old,” one account marvels, “an age by which any aspiring grandmaster should at least have made a start, Magnus Carlsen showed little interest in chess.”Sitting down against younger opponents, I tried to keep in mind a bit of advice gleaned from the  writer Stephen Moss’s book The Rookie: just face them the way you would anyone else.This could be hard. The way they played just threw me. In the face of my agonised dithering, they would launch fast, brute-force attacks – sometimes effective, sometimes foolhardy. “Children just kind of go for it,” Daniel King, the English grandmaster and chess commentator, told me. “That kind of confidence can be very disconcerting for the opponent.”Young children, for example, have been shown to be faster and more accurate at tests involving “probabilistic sequence learning” – the sort in which people must guess which triggers will lead to what events (for example, if you press button A, event X will happen).After the age of 12, this ability begins to decline. As researchers suggest, people start relying more on “internal models” of cognition and reasoning, instead of what they see right in front of them. In other words, they overthink things. In chess games, where my adult opponents often seemed to battle unseen internal demons, the kids just seemed to twitch out a series of moves.I was buying into the stereotype threat. If I lost to an adult, I would chalk it up to my own stupid errors. But if I lost to a child, I would suddenly imagine them as some incipient genius against whom I never had a chance.When I asked our chess coach about what it was like to teach adult chess beginners as opposed to child chess beginners, he thought for a moment and said: “Adults need to explain to themselves why they play what they play.” Kids, he said, “don’t do that”. He compared it to languages: “Beginner adults learn the rules of grammar and pronunciation and use those to put sentences together. Little kids learn languages by talking.”The analogy goes deeper than we might think. My daughter was, in effect, learning chess like a first language, whereas I was learning it like a second language. Even more important, she was learning it young.Language is one of those endeavours (like music, and perhaps chess) that seems to flourish best if learned during a so-called “sensitive period” in which, as one researcher has described it, “neural systems are particularly responsive to relevant stimuli, and are more susceptible to change when stimulated”.By contrast, because I am an adult, expert speaker of English, my brain may be so “tuned” to the sounds of my native language that it is harder for me to take on new grammar. What I know already gets in the way of what I want to learn. Kids, by knowing less, can actually learn more (the cognitive scientist Elissa Newport calls it the “less-is-more hypothesis”).Harder does not mean impossible. “Sensitive” periods are not “critical” periods, and the science, in any case, is not conclusive. The skill of having perfect pitch, for example, which is not only exceedingly rare but has long been thought to be impossible outside a narrow age range in childhood, can be trained in some adults, as research from the University of Chicago has shown (albeit to not quite as high a level as those possessing “true” perfect pitch).Kids often make more progress simply because they are kids, with lives built largely around learning, having few other responsibilities, and with eager parents to cheer them on. They are also motivated: if you were dropped into an entirely new setting, the way infants are, and found that you couldn’t communicate, you’d probably learn pretty quickly.You may, by now, be rightly asking, why should I bother learning a bunch of things that aren’t relevant to my career? Why dabble in mere hobbies when I’m scrambling to keep up with the demands of a rapidly changing workplace?First, I might suggest that it’s not at all clear that learning something like singing or drawing actually won’t help you in your job – even if it’s not immediately obvious how.Learning has been proposed as an effective response to stress in one’s job. By enlarging one’s sense of self, and perhaps equipping us with new capabilities, learning becomes a “stress buffer”.Claude Shannon, the brilliant MIT polymath who helped invent the digital world in which we live today, plunged into all kinds of pursuits, from juggling to poetry to designing the first wearable computer. “Time and time again,” noted his biographer, “he pursued projects that might have caused others embarrassment, engaged questions that seemed trivial or minor, then managed to wring breakthroughs out of them.”Regularly stepping out of our comfort zones, at this historical moment, just feels like life practice. The fast pace of technological change turns us all, in a sense, into “perpetual novices”, always on the upward slope of learning, our knowledge constantly requiring upgrades, like our phones. Few of us can channel our unided attention into a lifelong craft. Even if we keep the same job, the required skills change. The more willing we are to be brave beginners, the better. As Ravi Kumar, president of the IT giant Infosys, described it: “You have to learn to learn, learn to unlearn, and learn to re-learn.”Second, it’s just good for you. I don’t mean only the things themselves – the singing or the drawing or the surfing – are good for you (although they are, in ways I’ll return to). I mean that skill learning itself is good for you.It scarcely matters what it is – tying nautical knots or throwing pottery. Learning something new and challenging, particularly with a group, has proven benefits for the “novelty-seeking machine” that is the brain. Because novelty itself seems to trigger learning, learning various new things at once might be even better. A study that had adults aged 58 to 86 simultaneously take multiple classes – ranging from Spanish to music composition to painting – found that after just a few months, the learners had improved not only at Spanish or painting, but on a battery of cognitive tests. They’d rolled back the odometers in their brains by some 30 years, doing better on the tests than a control group who took no classes.They’d changed in other ways, too: they felt more confident, they were pleasantly surprised by their work, and they kept getting together after the study ended.Skill learning seems to be additive it’s not only about the skill. A study that looked at young children who had taken swimming lessons found benefits beyond swimming. The swimmers were better at a number of other physical tests, such as grasping or hand-eye coordination, than non-swimmers. They also did better on reading and mathematical reasoning tests than non-swimmers, even accounting for factors such as socio-economic status.Many of these studies or recommendations are oriented toward children. Chess, for example, is held up as a way to improve children’s focus and concentration, to strengthen their problem-solving skills, to bolster their creative thinking. But I’ve become convinced that whenever something is touted as being good for children, it’s even better for adults, in part because we assume we no longer need all those benefits an activity is said to provide.And yet what better remedy for the widespread affliction of “smartphone addiction” than two hours of burning your eyes and brain into 64 squares on a board, trying to analyse an almost infinite variety of moves and countermoves?Learning new skills also changes the way you think, or the way you see the world. Learning to sing changes the way you listen to music, while learning to draw is a striking tutorial on the human visual system. Learning to weld is a crash course in physics and metallurgy. You learn to surf and suddenly you find yourself interested in tide tables and storm systems and the hydrodynamics of waves. Your world got bigger because you did.Last, if humans seem to crave novelty, and novelty helps us learn, one thing that learning does is equip us with how to better handle future novelty. “More than any other animal, we human beings depend on our ability to learn,” the psychologist Alison Gopnik has observed. “Our large brain and powerful learning abilities evolved, most of all, to deal with change.” We’re always flipping between small moments of incompetence and mastery. Sometimes, we cautiously try to work out how we’re going to do something new.Sometimes, we read a book or look for an instructional video. Sometimes, we just have to plunge in. • Beginners: The Curious Power of Lifelong Learning by Tom Vanderbilt is published by Atlantic and available at bookshop• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, sign up to the long read weekly email here, and find our podcasts here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b9bef0b93e784d26fb598a7f4ace148e6b0ba19/0_52_5100_3060/master/5100.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=f62e6014c19d7254e77f9ceba258bf75","title":"deaf asl interpreters pandemic","story":"More people than ever are being exposed to sign language through Covid press briefings as interpreters work to pass on vital informationSaamanta Serna describes herself as a Coda – the child of a Deaf adult. She grew up up with a Deaf mother and a father who is hearing and an American sign language (ASL) interpreter, and later decided to pursue interpreting herself after high school.Now a certified ASL interpreter, Serna has done frequent in-person interpreting for medical appointments during Covid. She has also noticed a change in the world’s perception of sign language since the beginning of the pandemic: more people are paying attention.Conveying updated information to everyone in the time of Covid is a matter of life or death, as the Trump administration learned recently after losing a groundbreaking federal lawsuit to the National Association for the Deaf, which ensured that a sign language interpreter must be present in Covid briefings and visible on the live feed from the White House. The Trump White House did not include its first sign language interpreter on a Covid briefing until 11 November, a full nine months after the pandemic reached America.Even within ASL there are wide variants, differences in rhythm or slang, even regional accents and dialects. Black American Sign Language (BASL), for example, is a dialect of ASL developed during segregation. Black dDeaf Americans, denied deaf education, socialized language differently than white dDeaf Americans, with unique hand positions and word formations. Nakia Smith, a 22-year-old who is the fourth deaf generation in her family, explained this recently in a video from Netflix. (Smith’s TikTok channel, which featured her and her grandpa signing and explaining BASL, recently went viral.)Perhaps the interest in signing is due, in part, to pandemic mask-wearing. Masks muffle speech, making it more difficult to communicate using spoken language, even for those who are hearing. For those like me, who are hard of hearing and utilize lip reading, it’s virtually impossible.More people than ever are also being exposed to sign language through frequent Covid-related press conferences. Alongside governors and medical officers, in press briefings and media events, on television and online, sign language interpreters are working to pass on vital information.Translating spoken English to sign language requires interpreters like Berkowitz, who is also certified by the supreme court of Ohio and the Ohio department of education. She made national news with her work signing for Ohio’s governor, Mike DeWine. Admirers made a Facebook fan page, and she even has her own bobblehead doll.Other interpreters who have gone viral recently include Nic Zapko, who works with the Minnesota governor, Tim Walz David Cowan, known for interpreting Governor Brian Kemp’s press conferences in Georgia and Arkady Belozovsky, who grabbed the world’s attention when he interpreted an intense exchange between the New York governor, Andrew Cuomo, and reporters.Viewers have been drawn to Berkowitz’s energy, animated manner and expressions. Facial expressions, as Berkowitz said, “are an equivalent to intonation, revealing feelings, thoughts and mood while simultaneously utilizing the grammar markers (eye-gazing, eyebrow raisedlowered …) to distinguish statements from questions”. It’s not simply dramatic effect, but essential to the language. “I wish that people would normalize this communication access versus just making it a show,” said Serna.I talked to Brian Cheslik, the artistic director for Deaf Austin Theatre and an interpreter for performances. Cheslik is also dDeaf, as is Berkowitz, in a field where many interpreters are hearing. Both Cheslik and Berkowitz spoke to the importance of working together with hearing interpreters, especially when information may be impromptu or rapidly evolving. “I cherish my hearing interpreters on my team because they are always there to help me when I miss something, or if there is a change or announcement made,” Cheslik said, characterizing work with hearing interpreters as “a very important relationship”.Perhaps no recent situation has a more urgent need for clear information than Covid press conferences. These conferences relay ever-changing regulations, and provide essential medical advice on stopping the spread of the virus. “Interpreting during Covid is challenging in every way,” Berkowitz said, describing handling press conference jargon, teamwork with other interpreters who may have different styles, and “the tremendous responsibility with getting accurate information in ASL”.“The greatest joy is knowing the Deaf and hard of hearing community are receiving first-hand information seen on TV in ASL for the very first time in our lives,” Berkowitz said.“To have Deaf interpreters spotlighted and highlighted during events like Joe Biden’s press conferences has been so amazing,” says Serna. “Also the fact that that he is normalizing having an interpreter on camera.”All the interpreters interviewed for this story spoke to the struggle of getting sign language to be respected by the hearing population – a struggle I remember from my own studies, when I fought with my hearing professors who said ASL was not a “real” language, and would not count for my degree.“ASL is NOT broken English or even a form of English. ASL is an actual language with its own grammatical structure, and syntax that is embedded in Deaf culture,” Cheslik said. “Yes, ASL is beautiful, but it is our language.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3bb25f8fd6e3e140b91319c0f607c2e3494f6191/0_191_5830_3498/master/5830.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=383f97bf7270e80a68c44b6213cdd24b","title":"leisure facilities face 90m a week loss under uk winter covid 19 lockdown","story":"The winter lockdown will cost Britain’s gyms, swimming pools and leisure facilities a combined £90m a week in lost revenue, according to new analysis from ukactive, which is calling for urgent government help to protect jobs and keep the sector afloat.January is a vital month for the leisure industry, with many people renewing gym or pool memberships or committing to a new exercise programme. But with most sports banned for another six weeks – and possibly longer – ukactive, which represents more than 4,000 gyms and leisure facilities, said the industry was in deep trouble.“The government must protect this sector as a priority, before it becomes too late,” the ukactive chief executive, Huw Edwards, said. “January and February represent a vital period for gyms, pools, and leisure facilities to trade but they currently have zero income, unlike other sectors.”Last autumn the government announced a £100m fund across the sector while on Monday the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, revealed one-off grants of £9,000 for small businesses would also be made available. But ukactive says that help is nowhere near enough.“The top-up grants and funding announced by the Chancellor, while welcome, will be no more than a sticking plaster for the financial challenges being faced,” Edwards said. “Both public and private fitness and leisure operators will require additional, tailored financial and regulatory support for their recovery.”Meanwhile new research from 4Global, which provides data analysis to governments and sporting bodies, has found the November lockdown restrictions on the sports industry cost Britain £29m in terms of social value – a figured based on the sector’s contribution to the reduction, through exercise, of health conditions such as depression, diabetes and breast and colon cancer.This, said Edwards, showed the closure of gyms, leisure centres and swimming pools during January and February did not only present a “major threat to thousands of facilities and jobs, but also our nation’s health, and resilience to conditions including Covid-19, obesity and some cancers”.Edwards also pointed to evidence from the first lockdown in England, which showed anxiety levels doubled compared with the 2019 average – with an extra 3.2 million people classed as inactive, undertaking less than 30 minutes of exercise a week, as further evidence for more government support.The government has also been urged by the Youth Sports Trust to do more to help young people to stay active. Meanwhile the sports scientist Greg Whyte has told the  that Britain is heading for a “perfect storm” in which a reduction in activity levels during the winter lockdown has a disastrous effect on physical and mental health.Whyte has also called on the government to use the 400,000 people who work in the fitness sector but are on furlough to get the population more active."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/99733c2a1b1e61a966f078367704594bb92c4c55/356_211_2273_1365/master/2273.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b73f90ebd7ca8281b103a61a121e5e96","title":"cake decorating quizzes and remote lunches keeping staff connected in the remote work era","story":"We can’t meet for a chat by the coffee machine right now, so how are firms keeping spirits high? With creative and fun virtual activities, it seemsNurturing a sense of shared purpose with work colleagues is challenging in these days of remote work and video meetings. Gone are post-work pints, sandwich-queue chats, tasting your colleague’s “cake-off” creation, and anything else resembling physical proximity and connection to your team. But with a little ingenuity – and a tolerance for 2D socialising – it’s still possible to keep spirits high and have fun.From virtual magicians and online games to judging cakes purely on how delicious they look on Zoom, employees are finding new ways to bond with colleagues – remotely. Events such as quizzes and lunchtime yoga may even have become more popular now that people can log on from home rather than having to stay late at the office or endure a lunch-hour sweat.Jade Emmons, a London-based communications manager for Degreed, a US education technology company, spent part of Halloween in fancy dress, running around her home seeking random items of clothing and a pumpkin as part of a competitive scavenger hunt. That was one of several online games held during her company’s virtual party.Other companies have been equally imaginative. One media organisation replaced its summer party with a global rendition of A Midsummer Night’s Dream, in which correspondents from around the world took on some of Shakespeare’s most popular roles.Meanwhile, at Kindred, a PR firm, winning the 2020 baking competition hinges on how well you can pipe icing rather than perfect the best rise, as in previous years. Each participant received a Betty Crocker cake mix, so the real challenge was the decoration. A Chris Whitty cake – very 2020 – dreamed up by associate director Beccie Stevenson, made it to the final round. “You can’t taste it so it’s all down to the aesthetic,” she says.Stevenson is also a fan of a monthly initiative called Change Maker that gets people to nominate a colleague of the month. Her last pick was Emma Parrish, who won in October for the effort she put into suggesting books, podcasts and music to celebrate Black History Month. “She tackled quite difficult conversations, head on,” says Stevenson. Each winner gets to virtually spin a wheel to win a prize, which ranges from an alarm clock to a pair of sheepskin slippers.Nick Winham, whose job is overseeing a programme to recruit and train the next generation of talent for the software provider ServiceNow, is one of the California-based company’s culture champions, helping to run initiatives to keep its dispersed workforce feeling connected. He says the shift to remote working has resulted in many more people taking part in events such as quizzes. “When we did them at the office, we’d only get 15 people at most,” he says. “Doing them virtually, we’re getting 40 to 50. Other colleagues join in with their families.” Virtual yoga and meditation sessions are also proving to be much more popular than the real-life versions ever were.For companies keen to introduce their own programmes, Winham’s tips include blocking off time during the working day for non-work sessions. His quizzes, for instance, are at 4pm on Thursdays, with a takeaway pizza prize for the winner. “It gets very competitive,” he says.A “step-up” challenge earlier this summer, where ServiceNow colleagues formed teams to record their daily step counts, proved popular thanks to a novel twist that saw two executive directors volunteer to do something different with their hair depending on how much money was raised during the week-long challenge. “That created engagement,” Winham says. “Step-up September” developed as a result, with teams from across Europe.Other activities encourage people to chat openly about the challenges of working from home, with some offering coping tips. “The main advice has been to take a break,” Winham says, adding that he went for a walk before talking to me.London-based LocalGlobe, which invests in startup tech companies, hosts virtual “lunch and learn sessions” with guests as erse as the founder of the small business supporter Funding Circle and a representative of the anti-poverty group Camden Giving. Emma Phillips, a partner at LocalGlobe, says she wants to do all she can to keep employees engaged and connected. “At the moment people are feeling more cut off and isolated than ever, and there is concern that once we’ve defeated Covid-19, we’ll have an even worse mental health pandemic on our hands.”Often the simplest ideas can help compensate for the lack of in-person interaction. Online channels dedicated to different interests, from cats to physical fitness, work well at Degreed, says Emmons, although she steers clear of the HIIT workout and body-building chat. “Our London office manager has a virtual running club that she’s tried to convince me to join, but I’ve managed to dodge it so far!”ServiceNow gives you the power to make work, work better – no matter the circumstances.

The title of the travelogue he wrote about the trip, The Condor and the Cows, sums up how most Europeans felt about South America. While the condor has since been pushed to near-extinction, the cows have persisted: Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay and Venezuela are still seen by outsiders as primarily farming nations and global breadbaskets.Other Latin American countries are known for their wine, coffee, tropical fruits, soya beans and fishmeal. Colombia, the most bioerse country in the world per square kilometre, is known more for its exports of cocaine than for its dazzling birdlife.But conservationists across several countries are trying to redress this imbalance. At the end of 2020, the Rewilding Argentina Foundation reported that the first red-and-green macaw chicks had been born in the north-east’s Iberá wetlands for over a century. Hunted for their feathers, meat and as pets, and decimated by habitat loss, the birds are listed as critically endangered in Argentina another once-widespread species, the blue-grey glaucous macaw, is now possibly extinct.Elena Martin, who oversees the macaw breeding project, says: “The reproduction of the scarlet macaw in the wild is very important for our project because it helps us create sustainable populations so they fulfil their role in the ecosystem.” Macaws help spread seeds and repopulate areas with trees.The macaws are part of an ambitious scheme to reintroduce several animals to their former ranges, including anteaters, lowland tapirs, pampas deer, collared peccaries, giant river otters and jaguars the restoration of apex predators and carnivores is vital to controlling other populations and balancing the food chain. Two jaguar cubs were born in captivity in November 2020 and it is hoped jaguars can be released into the wild in the coming year.Meanwhile, the Colombian government recently passed into law wide-reaching sustainable tourism policies under the banner Together With Nature. The country’s vice-minister for tourism, Julián Guerrero Orozco – who used to work as a wildlife guide in Tanzania – says the country is only now waking up to its potential as a nature-tourism destination. “We have an opportunity to build a new kind of tourism, which is more serious and better researched. I really believe Colombia could provide a model for sustainability for the rest of the world.” Colombia is a signatory of the Future of Tourism Coalition, which commits members to a range of ecological and environmental goals.Decades of civil strife and drug wars in Colombia have kept areas off limits to developers, making them ideal for rewilding and ecotourism. Scientists from the University of the Andes have released six woolly monkeys into the forests of southern Huila, rescued red-footed tortoises have been released in the Meta department and former FARC combatants have been recruited to retrain as conservationists and forest s as part of the Peace with Nature programme.The town of La Macarena, south of Bogotá, is notable for its bioersity as well as attractions such as the many-hued rivers of Caño Cristales and ancient rock art in the Chiribiquete national park. According to pioneering conservationist Roque Sevilla, president of Fundación Futuro and creator of Ecuador’s Mashpi Lodge, the region has a lot of potential for ecotourism. “I first visited three years ago and was quite simply blown away. The variety of wildlife is spectacular: on a short first trip down the Guayabero River we saw six species of monkey, two species of dolphin, caimans, many hundreds of birds. We placed one camera trap and in just four hours of filming had captured footage of a tapir, a jaguar, a puma and a raccoon.“The rich geology and history mixed with endless natural wonders make it, in my mind, the most beautiful place in Colombia, and perhaps in the whole region.”In Ecuador and Peru, community-led programmes, forest purchases and monitoring schemes are helping protect spectacled bears, as well as ocelot, jaguarundi and mountain tapir. In Chilean Patagonia, Tompkins Conservation espouses a “rewilding approach to conservation”, creating corridors for pumas and other wild cats, huemul deer, Darwin’s rhea, guanaco, Wolffsohn’s vizcacha and condor. Comuna do Ibitipoca, an eco-tourism resort in Minas Gerais, Brazil, has begun a long-term scheme to rewild key species of its much-reduced Atlantic rainforest. It has licences to reintroduce the tapir, the red macaw, the woolly spider monkey and two spectacular birds, the solitary tinamou and the black-fronted piping guan.Across these areas, tourism can be a means of monetising and furthering rewilding. The best projects, says Thomas Power, co-founder of tour operator Pura Aventura, spring from local needs and knowledge and are open to travellers on ordinary budgets. “Chile’s Route of Parks is an ambitious, world-class model of development through conservation tourism. It connects 17 national parks covering 11.8 million hectares of pristine wilderness along a 1,740-mile route linking more than 60 communities. Vast grasslands, once destroyed by overgrazing and ided up by miles of fencing, are flourishing again thanks to pioneering rewilding work.“What’s so special about this region for visitors is that instead of luxury hotels, they can stay with local hosts in their privately owned guest houses. Because these places are so remote, getting there is by no means cheap, but visitors help create the financial incentive for local people to protect these precious habitats over the long term.”Many Latin American regions rival the likes of Madagascar, South Africa and the Democratic Republic of Congo in terms of bioersity. Tourism bosses hope that one day the Argentine pampas and Brazilian cerrado (a vast savannah region) might merit the kudos among wildlife tourists enjoyed by the African grasslands.South America already has its big five (for the record, they are jaguar, anteater, tapir, river otter and maned wolf). It already has tented and portable camps in its national parks. It already has extravagant topography, biting insects, hairy spiders and venomous snakes, and things that squawk and squeal in the night. If it lacks wildebeest and buffalo, it at least boasts teeming herds of Aberdeen Angus and Hereford cattle.While it also faces hefty challenges – from Chinese fishing fleets near the Galápagos to fires raging in the Amazon – rewilding and conservation schemes allied to ecotourism and political will could be transformative for the continent.“Safari hotspots in Africa are home to a huge number of mammals – but fewer species and less bioersity when it comes to insects, bird species and flora than places in South America, where the sheer number of species is extraordinary,” says Roque Sevilla.“As long as one can understand and appreciate the differences between American and African ecosystems, South America can absolutely compete.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a3e4a5913aba7bf0726c5d3ea462d2841b4056ed/0_66_4284_2570/master/4284.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=6c0f80482be2638b4cb443f3263dc9f4","title":"congress certify election biden republicans object","story":"Trump loyalists objected to certification of election result before joint session interrupted when mob breaches securityThe US Congress has certified Joe Biden as the next president of the United States hours after an insurgent mob loyal to Donald Trump stormed the Capitol in what lawmakers condemned as an attempted insurrection aimed at overturning the results of an American election.Shaken by the extraordinary scenes of chaos and violence that struck at the heart of American democracy – and were condemned by US allies worldwide - members of the House and Senate returned to the Capitol to continue the process of validating Biden’s victory, closing the session shortly before 4am local time.A statement from Trump following the certification said there would be an “orderly transition” to a Biden administration “even though I totally disagree with the outcome of the election, and the facts bear me out.” It was posted on Twitter by aides since the outgoing president’s social media accounts are locked to prevent the spread of misinformation and incitement to violence.Several Republican senators, unsettled by the day’s events, which had seen them duck under tables and don gas masks, said they no longer supported a brazen but doomed effort to keep Trump in office by rejecting the results of the electoral college as the certification proceeded.In late night speeches, lawmakers lamented the siege of the hallowed halls of Congress and the deep isions – sharpened and exploited by the president – that led to this perilous moment.“This failed attempt to obstruct the Congress, this failed insurrection, only underscores how crucial the task before us is for our republic,” the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, said, declaring that lawmakers would not be intimidated by “thugs, mobs, or threats”.Speaking to both the would-be revolutionaries who stormed and occupied the Capitol and the rebels in his own caucus who supported an effort to throw out the election results, McConnell vowed to “certify the winner of the 2020 presidential election”.The Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer – who in the midst of the mayhem learned that he would soon become the majority leader after Democrats won a second runoff election in Georgia – said 6 January was a day that would “live for ever in infamy”.The uprising disrupted what was the early stages of a futile attempt by dozens of congressional Republicans to reject certification of the electoral college votes, that affirmed Trump’s defeat, 306-232.Traditionally a ceremonial affair, Trump convinced his allies on Capitol Hill to turn the pro forma ritual into what would be his last stand in an increasingly reckless effort to cling to power. The constitutionally-mandated joint session of Congress began at 1pm, with the vice-president, Mike Pence, presiding over the proceedings and each states’ electoral votes secured in mahogany boxes.But the proceedings quickly devolved into a shocking series of events unprecedented in modern American history, as hundreds and then thousands of Trump supporters, many wearing red Maga caps and some armed, barrelled past security barricades and bashed through the Capitol doors. Some smashed windows and scaled the building’s exterior, waving Trump flags from a balcony, while authorities, seemingly outnumbered and unprepared, struggled to regain control.By nightfall, authorities said the Capitol had been secured. Escorted by armed officers, Pence, who was presiding over the joint session of Congress, senators and members of the House returned to their chambers to resume debate over an objection to the electoral college count.But the mood had changed remarkably from earlier that afternoon, when a band of Republicans arrived on Capitol Hill prepared to lead a futile rebellion against certification. Several senators reversed course and voted to uphold the results of the electoral college after saying they would object.Others were undeterred. Republican Senator Josh Hawley, one of the Senate leaders seeking to overturn the results, argued that the earlier violence should not dismiss his concerns that fraud had occurred during the election. Just after midnight, he joined some House Republicans in seeking to throw out Pennsylvania’s electoral slate.For those who planned to forge ahead with the plot, Republicans senator Mitt Romney warned in a floor speech that drew sustained applause that they would “forever be seen as being complicit in an unprecedented attack against our democracy”.Congress voted down challenges to reject Biden’s wins in Arizona and Pennsylvania, based on spurious claims of widespread voter fraud. The House rejected the challenge to the Arizona result by a vote of 303-122 and the Senate voted it down 93-6. The Pennsylvania challenge was voted down 282-138 in the House and 92-7 in the Senate.A majority of House Republicans voted to overturn the Pennsylvania result, despite no evidence of significant voter fraud in the state and multiple failed court challenges in past weeks.Attempts by House Republicans to object to the electoral slate in Georgia, Michigan Nevada and Wisconsin failed to garner support from a senator and were not considered.Earlier in the day, rioters for hours roamed the marbled halls of Congress shouting: “We want Trump.” Amid the bedlam, one woman was fatally shot, the DC police confirmed. The building was placed on lockdown, and the DC mayor imposed a rare 6pm curfew, as national guard troops were activated.After initially declaring “this is a time for strength” and urging his supporters to “walk down to the Capitol”, Trump later attempted to appeal for calm. In a video taped from the White House, the president instructed his followers to “go home”. But he also fueled their grievances by again claiming the election was “stolen.” Facebook and Twitter removed the video.In remarks from Wilmington, Biden condemned what he called an “unprecedented assault and implored Trump to “fulfil his oath” and “demand an end to this siege”.“This is not dissent. It’s disorder. It’s chaos. It borders on sedition,” said Biden, who is just two weeks away from being sworn in as the 46th US president. “The world is watching.”Several lawmakers said the day’s events were tantamount to an attempted coup. Teargas was deployed in the Capitol Rotunda. Rioters, who were mostly white men, streamed into the Senate chamber. One swung from the balcony above the floor. They trashed the office of the Senate parliamentarian and entered the private office of the House Speaker, Nancy Pelosi, leaving behind a note that read: “WE WILL NOT BACK DOWN.” In a shocking episode, officers drew their guns on the floor of the House, where just outside an armed protester faced off with Capitol police.Many blamed the president for stoking the violence by refusing to accept the reality of his decisive electoral defeat. Romney, who lost the 2012 presidential election to Barack Obama, described what transpired on Wednesday as the result of a “selfish man’s injured pride”.All 50 states have certified the election results after a number of closely contested states conducted post-election audits and recounts to ensure their accuracy. Courts at every level, including the supreme court, have rejected dozens of lawsuits filed by Trump and his allies to challenge the results. Wednesday was to be his day of reckoning.In his increasingly desperate bid to remain in power, Trump, who has yet to concede, spent the last several weeks attempting to enlist allies and pressure public officials to overturn Biden’s win. His machinations escalated last weekend when he demanded the Georgia secretary of state, Republican Brad Raffensperger, “find” enough votes to reverse his defeat in the state.His ire then turned to Pence, who he implored publicly to do “the right thing” and reject the electoral vote tally – a power the vice-president does not have. Pence’s decision not to interfere in the certification process infuriated Trump, who lashed out at him on Wednesday as he was being escorted from the Senate chamber out of concern for his safety.“Mike Pence didn’t have the courage to do what should have been done to protect our country and our constitution, giving states a chance to certify a corrected set of facts, not the fraudulent or inaccurate ones which they were asked to previously certify. USA demands the truth!” Trump said in a tweet flagged by Twitter for amplifying falsehoods about the election. Twitter later suspended the president’s account.Several House Democrats called for Trump’s removal from office, blaming Trump for fomenting the violence that unfolded. With two weeks left in his presidency, congresswoman Ilhan Omar, a Minnesota Democrat, said she was drawing up articles of impeachment and congressman Ted Lieu, a California Democrat, urged Pence to invoke the 25th amendment and remove him from office.“Let me be very clear: if all we do is accept the certified electoral college results and go home, we would have failed our country,” Lieu said in a tweet calling for Trump’s removal office. “Congress cannot just go home like nothing happened.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d2031e41d2f28d66852dadebb383b7c5b6a17c3/0_366_6048_3628/master/6048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bdb629ca4a4b47331d27e043cae499bc","title":"jon ossoff wins georgia runoff election democrats senate","story":" Victory unseats Republican David Perdue, who held the seat for the past six years, and follows fellow Democrat Raphael Warnock’s winThe Georgia Democrat Jon Ossoff has won his Senate runoff election, giving Democrats control of the Senate for the opening of Joe Biden’s presidency.Ossoff’s victory against David Perdue, was called by the Associated Press late on Wednesday, and follows fellow Democrat Raphael Warnock’s victory against incumbent Kelly Loeffler.With the victories of Ossoff and Warnock, the US Senate is now 50-50.Vice-President-elect Kamala Harris will serve as the tie-breaking 51st vote, giving Democrats control of the chamber for the first time since 2015.A pastor who spent the past 15 years leading the Atlanta church where Martin Luther King Jr preached, Warnock’s victory makes him the first Black senator in his state’s history.The results were a stinging rebuke of Donald Trump, who made one of his final trips in office to Georgia to rally his loyal base behind the state’s Republican candidates.In an emotional address early on Wednesday, Warnock vowed to work for all Georgians whether they voted for him or not, citing his personal experience with the American dream. His mother, he said, used to pick “somebody else’s cotton” as a teenager.“The other day, because this is America, the 82-year-old hands that used to pick somebody else’s cotton picked her youngest son to be a United States senator,” he said. “Tonight, we proved with hope, hard work and the people by our side, anything is possible.”The Democrats were propelled to victory in Senate runoff elections by Black voters, young voters and new arrivals to the rapidly ersifying state, a coalition just strong enough to topple a long-dominant GOP and take control of the US Senate.The coalition closely mirrored the one that handed Georgia’s electoral college votes to President-elect Joe Biden, the first Democrat to win the state since 1992. In defeating Republicans Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue, Democrats will have half the seats in the chamber, leaving Vice-President-elect Kamala Harris to serve as tie-breaker.The high-stakes runoffs drew hundreds of millions of dollars, media attention and a massive organizing effort. The result was a game of inches – both Republicans and Democrats largely held their voters from November, the survey showed, but Democrats did just slightly better in pushing their voters to the polls."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ef50fd94529c5075f1f3ddf5a581dcdfec6735ae/0_152_5469_3282/master/5469.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=846dcd46b17f1a66dcb9c5e9b83ef9e2","title":"england prepares for a wintry third lockdown in pictures","story":"Empty streets and shuttered shops as England grits its teeth for a new lockdown, with people allowed to leave their homes for limited reasons only, and measures expected to stay until mid-February or even March"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4452314.1610018217!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"dublin school to defy government request to reopen for leaving cert students","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA number of secondary schools are meeting today to consider whether to reopen to sixth year students in light of the public health threat.  File photograph: Alan BetsonThe .A Dublin secondary school has announced that it will defy the Government decision to reopen schools three days a week for Leaving Cert students.A number of other secondary schools are meeting to consider taking similar action in light of the public health threat posed by Covid-19.The principal, who asked to remain anonymous until all parents and students are informed of the decision on Thursday, said she believed a partial reopening would pose unacceptable health risks.“With numbers with the virus at almost 8,000, we do not believe it is safe to open the school,” the principal said.“Therefore, we will remain closed and sixth year students, along with all the other year groups will be taught online.“We will, of course keep the situation under review and if the numbers improve, we can look at facilitating the sixth year’s attendance.”Another principal, who declined to be named, said the school may also remain closed due to logistical problem is delivering in-person and online classes.“We have a full online timetable ready to go, but now our teachers are being asked to come into school for sixth years for three days and teach the rest online. How is that possible?” the principal said.“Many teachers have primary school children. This will weaken provision for all other students. It’s a mess.”OrderedIn the past the Department of Education has ordered schools to reopen where they have decided to close without the approval of public health officials.The Government announced on Thursday that secondary schools will reopen for three days a week for up to 60,000 Leaving Cert students from next Monday. In addition, special schools and special classes will reopen for an estimated 18,000 pupils.Minister for Education Norma Foley said the decision had been made in the best interests of students, especially those facing into exams and with learning disabilities.She said schools and teachers had proved resilient in the past in reopening schools and she was convinced the education sector would “not be found wanting” in reopening again in a limited way.For all other students, schools will be required to put in place remote learning provisions from next Monday and to communicate these plans directly to families.Leaving Cert final-year students will attend school three days per week, with the other two days’ learning being supported by their teachers remotely.Unions representing school staff have expressed alarm over the Government’s decision to partially reopen schools for special needs and Leaving Certificate students describing it as “rushed and reckless”.The three teachers’ unions said they have serious reservations over the health implications for their members, while the union representing special needs assistants said the decision was unworkable.None have yet signalled they are prepared to take industrial action or instruct members not to turn up for work next week.Access to adviceInstead, they are seeking further meetings with the department and access to public health advice which underpinned the Government decision.The director of the National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals said that reopening to sixth year students “will bring challenges which require careful consideration”.“The primary goal of all school leaders has been and remains the provision of the highest standard of education for all our students while protecting the health and wellbeing of all in the school community,” said Clive Byrne.“The logistics of maintaining online and on-site learning in this way will be complex but with the support and understanding of the Department of Education, they can be achieved.”Mr Byrne said the association was anxious to meet education partners and explore solutions with the department and the State Examinations Commission which address the “expressed concerns of students and staff to enable a mix of face to face teaching and online learning.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Company delivered 14m parcels in December, double the level of same period in 2019About 335,600 people will receive the benefit this week"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4452360.1610021461!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"covid 19 vaccine rollout starts in nursing homes","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Government hopes to vaccinate all 30,000 nursing home residents and 35,000 staff in the country by the end of next monthThe rollout of the Covid-19 vaccine in privately owned and voluntary nursing homes began on Thursday morning. Twenty-two nursing homes are scheduled to receive the vaccinations from today, with about 3,000 residents and staff to be vaccinated this week.The Government hopes to vaccinate all 30,000 nursing home residents and 35,000 staff in the country’s 582 nursing homes by the end of next month.Tadhg Daly, chief executive of Nursing Homes Ireland (NHI), said it is continuing to engage with the HSE on “expediting rollout of the vaccine to nursing homes across the country in as quick a manner as feasible”. “Every day of the week presents opportunity for nursing home residents and staff to be vaccinated. Experienced peer vaccinators employed within these specialised healthcare settings must be enabled to avail of Covid-specific training to support in the administration of the vaccine to nursing home residents,” Mr Daly said. “Every day counts and every element of support must be utilised. We require a commitment nursing homes will also be encompassed within the seven-day-a week rollout of the vaccine.”John Cremin (95), from Knocknagree, Co Cork and resident at Killarney Community Hospital, was the first community hospital resident to receive the vaccine in Co Kerry.“I’m very glad to be getting my vaccine today – it’s not something that happens every week,” Mr Cremin said.The father-of-four has six grandchildren and has been a resident at Killarney Community Hospital since 2013. He said he is looking forward to a time when he can have visitors again.“We haven’t been able to have visitors for a while now. I’m not a bit worried about getting the vaccine, it’s good that it’s here,” he said.Director of nursing Máire Flynn was the first staff member at Killarney Community Hospital to be vaccinated.“I am delighted that we are receiving the vaccine, and so happy for our residents and our staff. We are so grateful to everyone who has made this happen, and so happy to be a part of this. Our residents are very excited, and are thrilled to be getting something that gives us all new hope for 2021,” she said. Cork Kerry Community Healthcare said it expects to have vaccination teams travelling to more than 30 public and private facilities in the counties throughout next week. “We expect to vaccinate more than 3,500 staff and residents next week alone, and this programme will accelerate in the following weeks,” it said.

Only Ireland, Italy, and the United States shut down construction during earlier lockdowns, according to the Construction Industry Federation. Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollinsAll but essential construction work will shut down from Friday evening as part of the national effort to stop the spread of coronavirus.Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Darragh O’Brien, said the shutdown was “necessary” as part of wider measures aimed at halting the current trajectory of the virus.Some 7,836 new cases of Covid-19 were reported on Wednesday, the highest daily total since the start of the pandemic.A very limited number of essential sites and a small number of designated social housing projects due to be completed within eight weeks will be allowed to continue. The Cabinet also agreed that construction and work relating to the day-to-day operation of water, wastewater, and gas infrastructure remain essential.Outbreaks relating to the industry represent 0.6 per cent of all coronavirus clusters since August.A spokeswoman for Mr O’Brien said around 1,400 social housing units would be completed by the end of next month but the restrictions would “of course” have a negative impact on social housing targets.Under the new restrictions announced on Wednesday, construction will be closed with effect from 6pm on Friday next January 8th except for the construction or development of:- essential health and related projects including those relevant to preventing, limiting, minimising or slowing the spread of Covid-19- A limited number of social housing projects, including voids, designated as essential sites by local authorities based on set criteria (projects due to be completed in the next six to eight weeks)- housing adaptation grants where the homeowner is agreeable to adaptions being undertaken in their home- repair, maintenance and construction of critical transport and utility infrastructure- education facilities sites designated as essential by Department of Education- supply and delivery of essential or emergency maintenance and repair services to businesses and places of residence (including electrical, gas, plumbing, glazing and roofing services) on an emergency call-out basis- certain large construction projects in the exportingFDI sector based on set criteria.In relation to private homes that are practically complete and scheduled for habitation by 31 January 2021, including where snagging, and essential remediation work, such as pyrite works is nearing completion, works should continue to enable homeowners access their homes.Heating, water, broadband and electricity installation should also continue to enable homes be occupied.Existing tenancy protections mean that a tenant cannot be evicted from their home during the period of the 5km travel restrictions.The Minister acknowledged that closing most construction sites will have an impact on 2021 housing delivery targets, but he said his department will do “whatever is necessary to make up as much ground as possible as restrictions ease”.He said the health and safety of 200,000 people working directly and indirectly in construction is the top priority.Only Ireland, Italy, and the United States shut down construction during earlier lockdowns, according to the Construction Industry Federation. Tom Parlon, its director general, said it will take months to calculate the impact the decision to shut down work sites will have on the industry.“The previous lockdown may have resulted in 5,000 fewer homes than expected in 2020,” he said in a statement.Mr Parlon said the industry has had an “excellent track record” at keeping Covid-19 off sites and managing it on sites. He said there was never a point over the last nine months where a site recorded more than 56 cases. The rate of infection among construction workers has been considerably lower than in the general population, he added.The organisation is advocating for the sector to reopen on January 31st.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"Northern Ireland secretary could detract from Blair statement of regret, officials feared-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4451742.1609974269!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"covid 19 cabinet agrees to keep schools closed for january in most challenging phase of all","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tWe “must dig deep within ourselves and face the coming month with steely determination and resolve”, Taoiseach Micheál Martin said. Photograph: Julian BehalThe Cabinet has agreed a range of further lockdown measures, including to keep schools closed but allow Leaving Cert students to attend three days per week, and to close non-essential construction projects.The new measures will be in place until “at least the end of January” , Taoiseach Micheál Martin said.Tánaiste Leo Varadkar suggested some restrictions could remain in place past February 1st. “If I was running a business now, I would be thinking there’s a probability I’ll be closed until the end of March,” he said.Mr Varadkar said the regulations would be reviewed at the end of January, but warned “the situation is deteriorating... we won’t be out of the woods by the end of January”.Dig DeepWe “must dig deep within ourselves and face the coming month with steely determination and resolve”, Mr Martin said after the Cabinet meeting.“We have risen to all the challenges that have presented themselves… we may now be entering the most challenging phase of all,” he said.“The personal decisions we make... will directly affect how many more people get sick and how many people die”.“We are in a battle against deadly and ever changing virus,” he said.“ Unless you are involved in absolutely essential work you have no reason to be away from your home,” he said.Ministers agreed that all Leaving Cert students will be permitted to attend school for three days a week from next week.Schools will close for other children with learning moving online. However the Cabinet agreed to keep special schools and special classes in mainstream schools open for an estimated 15,000 pupils.Minister for Culture Catherine Martin’s officials have engaged with RTÉ, TG4 and the Department of Education about restarting learning from home programmes immediately.ChildcareCabinet agreed that essential workers will be allowed to form a bubble with another household in order to provide childcare if they do not have an existing arrangement, under plans discussed by the Cabinet.Childcare services, including regulated childminders and other childcare arrangements, will be permitted to continue to provide services but only for vulnerable children and children of essential workers.ConstructionNon-essential construction work will have to finish at 6pm on Friday.Work on social housing that is nearly completion will be permitted but only if it satisfies set criteria. Large infrastructure projects, understood to include the likes of the National Children’s Hospital and large school building projects, will continue, and emergency maintenance or repair work by plumbers, electricians and gas workers will be allowed continue.TravelCabinet also agreed that a ban on travel from Britain and South Africa will be be lifted this coming Saturday. But passengers must provide a negative PCR test from the previous 72 hours and isolate for 14 days on arrival. This requirement will then be rolled out to all incoming passengers.Minister for Transport Eamon Ryan said failure to provide a negaative test be subject to a fine of up to €2,500 or six months imprisonment.He said the Cabinet has agreed provisionally to apply these restrictions to other red list countries He said this will be very difficult for the travel industry and for iniduals who may have plans for travelThe Cabinet also agreed that click and collect services for non-essential retail outlets will no longer be permitted with immediate effect in what will be a big blow for the sector. Click and deliver will continue to be permitted.Getting worseThe meeting came against a backdrop of a significant rise in cases of the disease and with hospitals generally and intensive care units coming under pressure.Mr Martin urged people to remember Mariter Tarugo, the Philippines native who worked at a healthcare assistant at St Vincent’s Hospital and died with Covid-19 on Christmas Eve.Tánaiste Leo Vardkar said “This is bad, it’s getting worse, and we’re only beginning to see the impact on our hospitals”He said the Government was engaging with the banks to ensure payment breaks for mortgage holders and those with loans“January is the month in which we all stay in,” he said.Mr Martin said he was “very worried” about the spread of the UK variant of Covid in the State. “The variant is of huge concern to me, because of the potential of what it could do,” the Taoiseach said, adding that there would be extensive work to improve Ireland’s sequencing capacities and provide real time data on the spread of the variant in the weeks ahead.Mr Martin said the vaccine taskforce was significantly more confident on the supply of Pfizer-BioNtech’s vaccine in the coming months, which would mean a smaller “buffer” would be held in reserve. However, he said there was no clear timeline for the delivery of more than 800,000 doses of the Moderna vaccine approved on Wednesday to the State.“The numbers will be a help on top of Pfizer BioNtech,” he said, “but they’re not huge numbers, and we don’t have a clear timeline in terms of the release to us.” He said, however, that the “only issue holding back the vaccine programme will be the supply of vaccines into the country”.Mr Varadkar said that by the end of February, he anticipated the State being able to vaccinate all residents and nursing home staff, as well as healthcare workers on the frontline. If more vaccines come on stream, he said the timeline could speed up.“That’s with Pfizer and Moderna, if AstraZeneca comes in and becomes available we can step that up and step that up more,” he said.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4451749.1609975698!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"credibility of government on the line over covid 19 surge and slow vaccinations","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tParamedics and ambulances at the Mater hospital in Dublin as public health chiefs released the latest daily number of new Covid-19 cases – just shy of 8,000. Photograph:   Brian LawlessPA Watched by a wearied and fearful country, the Government slumped into the third national lockdown on Wednesday, warning that the third wave of the pandemic now threatens to overwhelm the health service as numbers of infections climb to previously unimaginable heights.Barely an hour after the Taoiseach and his fellow Coalition leaders announced the new lockdown measures, public health chiefs released the latest daily number of new cases – just shy of 8,000. Unless these numbers begin to abate soon, they will crash through even the surge capacity in the health service that will surely be called into operation in the coming days. The leaders of the Government now fear that the health service will simply be unable to deal with the number of cases seeking admission to hospital wards and to intensive care units in the coming days and weeks.The important numbers over the coming days are not so much the case numbers, says one senior figure, it is the hospital numbers and the intensive care unit numbers. The nightmare scenario of last March is back: the wolf is at the door.The lockdown is – for everyone with the exception of the Leaving Cert students – as stringent as last March. Few sources who spoke privately on Wednesday night expected it to finish in three weeks. Social problemsAll the social problems that are exacerbated by these conditions – educational disadvantage, domestic violence, economic damage, and the rest of that grim procession – will return. Ireland is not alone for sure, but it is a hell of a price to pay for a meaningful Christmas. The truth is that the price is vastly more than anyone envisaged.The search for someone to blame is understandable, and will continue, even if there are more pressing matters for everyone to deal with right now. Internally within the Government, there is a cacophony of finger-pointing and dissent. But ultimately the Government as a whole makes the decisions and ultimately it is accountable for them. But such judgments will be more wisely made in the fullness of time, allowing for their consequences to play out, for better or for worse.However the blame game goes, the future of the Government’s authority – and therefore its ability to enforce its will, on Covid and other matters – rests on two issues. One is within its own control, the other is not.Fate of the country’s hospitalsThe first is the fate of the country’s hospitals over the coming fortnight. If the hospitals are overrun it will be a hammer blow to the Government’s authority and credibility. The claim the Coalition could reasonably make before Christmas – when it had the lowest infection rate and limited excess deaths – that it had managed the crisis well would no longer be tenable. The second issue is more – though not entirely – within the Government’s control. The roll-out of the vaccine has been slow to start. Unless it accelerates, the Government will look woefully inadequate, especially as vaccinations continue at an apparently rapid pace in the UK and elsewhere. Teething problems are understandable and there are constraints on supply. But if the Government is not vaccinating as quickly as it is receiving supplies very soon – and is able to demonstrate that it is – people will draw their own conclusions about its competence and credibility.

Image: CNN Screengrab.Irish journalist Donie O’Sullivan said he was “overwhelmed by all the love from Ireland” on Wednesday night after he starred in US network CNN’s coverage of the siege at the Capitol in Washington. The Co Kerry native was praised on social media for his reporting from the scene as supporters of outgoing president Donald Trump stormed the building.He calmly relayed news back to the studio as hosts including veteran Wolf Blitzer urged him to “stay safe” amid the unrest and hostility towards journalists at the scene. O’Sullivan at one point reported that he had heard one of those present saying ‘next time we’re coming back with rifles’. His exploits saw ‘Donie’ trending on Twitter in Ireland. Comedian Dara Ó Briain was amongst those who congratulated the reporter, saying “CNN just introduced a reporter called Donie O’Sullivan and fair dues, he sounds exactly like you’d hope”. John King, CNN’s chief national correspondent, described O’Sullivan as “awesome”. Screenwriter Declan Lawn said of O’Sullivan: “All the other CNN correspondents can’t believe this stuff and are freaking out but Donie O’Sullivan is strolling around like he’s seen far worse coming out of a Carlow nightclub.”Responding to the outpouring on social media, O’Sullivan said on Twitter that he was “overwhelmed by all the love from Ireland tonight”. When asked about his experience on RTÉ’s Today programme on Thursday, O’Sullivan said it had been “surreal beyond belief”. “Imagine rioters swinging from the chandelier in Dáil Éireann,” he said.O’Sullivan said serious questions would have to be asked about how, in one of the “most protected cities in the world,” protesters could get into the grounds of the Capitol and also the Capitol building itself. The Cahirciveen man said he was fortunate not to have encountered any aggression from the protesters, but he knew of some colleagues who had been in “difficult situations” during the unrest. He said he had encountered different types of protesters - from pensioners wandering the grounds to “guys dressed up as soldiers who probably never served a day in their lives and were playing dress up yesterday”. He said that had it been a Black Lives Matter protest, he doubted the protesters would have been allowed near the Capitol building, never mind inside and onto the Senate floor.O’Sullivan has been working as a reporter with CNN for almost five years and prior to this spent over two years working as a journalist for Storyful in New York and Dublin.He has an undergraduate degree in history, politics and international relations from University College Dublin (UCD) and a masters degree in political science and government from Queen’s University Belfast.

There was 911, the financial crisis and now Covid, ordeals that shook us to our core, with political, economic and cultural repercussions that will last for decades. Each time, we have been exposed as spoilt, emotional and weak – utterly unprepared, psychologically and practically, to cope with such seemingly low-probability, high-impact events. When these sorts of “tail risks”, as statisticians call them, do materialise, we are immediately traumatised: panic sets in as our certainties and assumptions are shattered, and our entire way of life, our freedoms, our prosperity, our health, our self-satisfied sense of superiority are exposed as staggeringly fragile. It turns out that modern life is only possible (or, to many, desirable) if nothing goes wrong in any significant way, and yet there tends to be a major emergency every seven or so years – and three since the end of the Cold War. For a civilisation that sees itself as the most advanced, the most rationalistic ever, and that is obsessed with comparing itself with the unenlightened, backward mores of the past, our proximity to the abyss is not just a humiliating but also a terrifying realisation. Even worse, these events are all, in fact, known unknowns: all have happened many times before, and all will happen many times again. We are not talking about genuine unpredictability, real Black Swans. So why didn’t we see them coming? Why didn’t we prepare properly against the menace of evil terrorists, or viruses, or the economic cycle? Take the coronavirus. It is now clear that this latest variant is spiralling out of control, that deaths are shooting up again and that the NHS is in danger of running out of capacity in some areas once more. The prognosis is much grimmer than it was a few weeks ago: the total number of excess deaths in the UK may now end up breaching 100,000. By some calculations, we have already surpassed the death toll of the Hong Kong flu of 1968-69, which killed 80,000, and that of the Asian flu of 1957-58, which claimed 33,000, in both cases without lockdowns.The reality is that we are going to pull through this pandemic, by the skin of our teeth, despite mass deaths and extreme economic and social damage. The astonishingly speedy discovery of effective and safe vaccines – a scientific miracle – has changed everything, and the Government must now vaccinate 247 and reopen society as soon as the vulnerable are inoculated. But we can’t go through this again and again, being caught out every time and relying on luck and hideous, calamitous lockdowns to bail us out. The costs – in terms of lives, of course, but also in this case in foregone liberties as a result of lockdowns, in massive welfarism, ruined education, huge debt, economic torture, cultural damage and in destroyed families, communities and traditions are far too high. We would have suffered much less had we prepared. What will happen if the next pandemic is much more lethal, or if it kills children rather than the elderly? What if a cyberattack takes out communications and electricity in a major Western capital city, and food and water supplies run out? Or when the great quantitative easing experiment finally implodes? At some point, a rogue nation will detonate a nuclear weapon, or assassinate a world leader, Franz Ferdinand style, or there will be a far more significant accident than Fukushima. How could our decadent societies handle any of this? Simply seeking to muddle through, as we did with the virus, would guarantee Armageddon. Our inability to realise that we haven’t opted out of history, despite Twitter, robotics, AI and the rest, is one of our greatest blind spots. Our society is not robust, it isn’t “normal” (in a historic, global sense) and it won’t necessarily be eternal unless we try a lot harder to make it so. Liberalism, conservatism, capitalism: all could easily be swept away when the next really big crisis hits us.Marx was wrong about everything: the real opium of the people in a modern, developed society is simply a belief that the good days will always continue, and that the future is automatically going to be a similar but better version of the present. The public’s support for the status quo ends very quickly if it starts to believe that life is about to get worse.Most of the time, a belief in progress makes sense: rational optimism, to use the great Matt Ridley’s phraseology, is a sensible philosophy based on a sound appreciation of the wonders of capitalism and technology. Contrary to the usual whining, the world has been getting richer and cleaner for years, people are living longer and poverty has collapsed. But the fact that the international capitalist order delivers the goods also needs to be tempered by realism: the system works well overall ordinarily, but it can easily be derailed by shocks such as wars, terrorism or pandemics. These need to be better understood and managed: the role of states isn’t to rule people’s lives, tell them what to eat, spend 45 per cent of GDP or own every hospital. It is simply to prevent the system from collapsing (and, of course, to refrain from collapsing it out of malice or incompetence à la Iran or Russia, or Venezuela-style economics). Yet they keep failing that basic task, and inevitably make matters worse.It is time, therefore, for the West to become a lot more “anti-fragile”, as the philosopher and statistician Nassim Taleb puts it. Governments must focus on the modern-day equivalent of nuclear fallout shelters: we need a whole series of highly developed, well-rehearsed plan Bs with mass public buy-in. A minister for resilience should be appointed. New institutions must be developed. Our foreign policy must become far more robust towards lawless states. We need to spend much more on cybersecurity, pandemic prevention, defence and space technology. I used to be an optimist: no longer. The next big crisis, also due at some point this decade, could easily destroy our precious, fragile and deluded West.

She was part of a crowd that was breaking down the doors to a barricaded room where armed officers stood on the other side.City police said three other people died from medical emergencies during the long protest on and around the Capitol grounds.Congressmen who had gathered in the Senate and the House of Representatives to certify the election results were forced to flee under escort as law enforcement lost control of the situation.In the House chamber, security officers pulled their guns and barricaded the door.At least one pro-Trump protester entered the Senate chamber, sitting with his hand aloft in victory. As evening approached, a 6pm citywide curfew was announced. The events were widely described as a dark day for American democracy.Senators were told to go back to the voting chamber on Wednesday night to complete the voting process to confirm Mr Biden\u0027s victory after it had been cleared. Mr Trump had addressed the crowds hours before they marched on the Capitol, telling them to “stop the steal” and doubling down on his false claims of election victory.Read more: Who is Jake Angeli, the ‘QAnon shaman’ from Arizona at the heart of the Capitol riots?Mr Biden, the president-elect, said US democracy was under “unprecedented assault”. “I call on President Trump to go on national TV and demand an end to this siege,” he said.“This is not dissent, it’s disorder. It’s chaos. It borders on sedition. And it must end now. I call on this mob to pull back and allow the work of democracy to go forward.”After violence broke out, Mr Trump called for calm, writing on Twitter: “I am asking for everyone at the US Capitol to remain peaceful. No violence!”Mr Trump later released a video telling his supporters to go home. He said: “You have to go home now. We have to have peace. We have to have law and order. We have to respect our great people in law and order. We don’t want anybody hurt.”But he continued to maintain a landslide election had been fraudulently stolen from him. He told the protesters: We love you. You\u0027re very special. I know how you feel.Mr Trump told them to go home with peace and love and remember this day forever!Twitter removed two of his Twitter posts for violating its rules, as social media companies scrambled to address the messages being spread on their platforms. Later, Twitter locked Mr Trump out of his account for 12 hours after he repeatedly violated their policy in relation to the violent clashes in Capitol Hill, revoking his special protection as an elected official. Then, following these fatal events, Donald Trump committed to a peaceful transition of power for the first time. In a statement from the White House Deputy Chief of Staff, Mr Trump announced he totally disagreed with the outcome of the election but confirmed there will be an orderly transition on January 20th.”He added: “While this represents the end of the greatest first term in presidential history, it’s only the beginning of our fight to Make America Great Again!” Read more: Can the 25th amendment be invoked to remove Trump from office?Boris Johnson, the Prime Minister, wrote on Twitter: “Disgraceful scenes in US Congress. The United States stands for democracy around the world and it is now vital that there should be a peaceful and orderly transfer of power.”Former president George W. Bush on Wednesday denounced some of his fellow Republicans for fuelling the insurrection.This is how election results are disputed in a banana republic - not our democratic republic, he said.Mike Pompeo, a Trump loyalist, tweeted urging the extremists be taken to task. Let us swiftly bring justice to the criminals who engaged in this rioting, he tweeted. The remarkable developments in the nation’s capital were not inevitable when the sun rose on Wednesday morning, though there was a sense of foreboding around the city.Thousands of the president’s faithful had gathered the night before, arriving after Mr Trump demanded support for his ongoing claim that he, not Mr Biden, was the real election victor. It was the day when Congress was due to perform its largely ceremonial duty of signing off the results ahead of the inauguration on Jan 20, when Mr Biden becomes president.But the day had double significance. The final balance of the Senate, a chamber in which the Republicans have held the majority for six years, swung in favour of the Democrats.Georgia, a deeply conservative and deeply religious state which has been a stronghold of the Republican Party for decades, voted on Tuesday for its two US senators.The races had gone to a so-called run-off after no candidate got more than 50 per cent in the November election. But it carried more significance than just that. The Democrats were on 48 Senate seats and the Republicans on 50 before the run-offs.If the Democrats won both, they would finally have control of the Senate because the vice-president – soon to be Kamala Harris, Mr Biden’s running mate – casts the deciding vote in ties. On Wednesday morning it was clear the Democrats were heading for just that.The Rev Raphael Warnock was declared the winner in his race against Kelly Loeffler, the Republican. The result made Mr Warnock only the 11th black senator elected in US history and the first to represent the state of Georgia.The second race, between Jon Ossoff, a 33-year-old documentary film-maker, and David Perdue, the sitting republican senator, was closer. But by the afternoon the race had been called for Mr Ossoff. The Democrats had flipped both seats – a remarkable feat.Democrats were celebrating their expected victories and working out just how beneficial it would be for Mr Biden’s presidency.For one, he will no longer need to rely on Republican votes to confirm any of his proposed cabinet members – some of whom had been controversial – or judicial appointments, not least a Supreme Court pick should a seat become free in his term. For another, passing his legislative agenda will be easier. While bold progressive reforms like expanding government-funded healthcare and major climate change action may be hard to keep the Democrats united on, others such as getting more stimulus money to help those affected by the pandemic should pass.Plus it will mean the Democrats, not the Republicans, will hold the gavels on Senate committees, and with it the power over what and who to investigate. That could help Mr Biden in his first two years in office.The jubilation on the Democratic side was matched by the frustration on the Republican side. Georgia was now a blue state, won by Mr Biden at the election and with two Democratic senators. Much of the blame was heading towards Mr Trump, who had gone to political war with senior Republicans in Georgia over their refusal to overturn Mr Biden’s win and disheartened supporters with claims of election rigging.Josh Holmes, the former chief of staff to Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell, was among those to point the finger at the president. The president, however, reached for a familiar explanation – vote rigging. Just like in the wake of his presidential election defeat, Mr Trump began to make unfounded and wild allegations of election fraud on Twitter.By midmorning attention was focusing on downtown Washington DC.Tens of thousands of pro-Trump protesters had been gathering outside the White House. Their presence in the capital was not just welcomed by Mr Trump but actively encouraged. For weeks, the president has been turning his attention to Congress’s role in approving the presidential election results.Since the election the courts and the states have consistently rejected the president’s claim that he won a “landslide” only to have it somehow “stolen”. Now Congress was Mr Trump’s last remaining hope. Gary Dalbec had travelled seven hours from Charleston, South Carolina to attend the march. He said he hoped the protest would help to “expose the fraudulent election” and give Mr Trump another term in office.“It was fraud. They’ve got the evidence, they’re hiding it. We just need the right people to expose it. “The rest of the people are committing treason,” he added. “Today is make or break.”Susan Cardin, from Colorado, said she had been protesting outside the White House since 5am. “We’re here to save America. We’re here to stop the steal,” she said.When the president eventually spoke he unleashed a furious verbal attack on Republican congressmen who had refused to endorse his baseless claims of victory. “They’re weak Republicans. They’re pathetic Republicans,” he said at one point.His defiance of election defeat was total: “We will never give up, we will never concede. It doesn’t happen. You don’t concede when there’s theft involved.”Mr Trump also repeatedly demanded that Mike Pence, who as vice-president oversees the Senate procedures, somehow intervene to reject the confirmation of the election results.“Mike Pence, I hope you’re going to stand up for the good of our Constitution and for the good of our country,” he said. “And if you’re not, I’m going to be very disappointed in you.”The crowd cheered. And yet just as Mr Trump was uttering his demands, Mr Pence was doing the opposite – releasing a letter sent to congressmen explaining why he would not be following the president’s advice.It argued that he had no power to “unilaterally” throw out the decision of the people, insisting such a move would be unconstitutional.It was a remarkable moment in the Trump presidency, the point when Mr Pence publicly broke with Mr Trump. But he was not alone. Shortly afterwards, once Mr Pence stepped into the chair to oversee the Senate debate that would confirm the results, Mr McConnell rose. He too was about to break with the president. He said the vote was the most important he had taken in his 36 years in the US Senate.“President Trump claims the election was stolen. Nothing before us proves illegality anywhere near the massive scale that would have tipped the entire election.” He added: “Voters, courts, the states have all spoken. They’ve all spoken. If we overrule them it would damage our republic forever. “If this election were overturned by mere allegations from the losing side then our democracy would enter a death spiral.”Meanwhile, a number of White House officials resigned in the hours following the violence, including deputy national security adviser Matt Pottinger. His departure follows two top aides to Melania Trump, the White House social secretary, Rickie Niceta and deputy White House press secretary Sarah Matthews. Reports also suggest the national security adviser Robert O\u0027Brien, Mr Pottinger’s boss, will also resign, along with deputy chief of staff Chris Liddell. There were rebels, however. Thirteen Republican senators or senators-elect had made public their desire to object to the results beforehand.In the event it was Ted Cruz, the Texas senator who came close to winning the 2016 Republican nomination and is expected to try again in 2024, who led the charge.He said large numbers of Americans believed the election was “rigged” and polls showed that included 17 per cent of Democrats. Mr Cruz said “simply telling the voters go jump in a lake” would “jeopardise the legitimacy of this and subsequent elections”.Mr Cruz said: “I am not arguing for setting aside the result of the election.”Instead, he wanted Congress to appoint an impartial electoral commission to hold an emergency 10-day audit and resolve the claims.The move was doomed to defeat. Even before the session had started it was clear the vast majority of US senators were willing and ready to confirm Mr Biden’s victory.But then the crowds descended. Sent on their way by Mr Trump to march up Capitol Hill from the White House, his vocal army of supporters reached the Capitol building. The first protesters reached the inside at 2pm.Lawmakers were told to duck under their seats for cover and put on gas masks after tear gas was used in the Capitol Rotunda. Some House lawmakers tweeted they were sheltering in place in their offices.Democratic Congressman Scott Peters told reporters he was in the House chamber when rioters began storming it. Security officers made us all get down, you could see that they were fending off some sort of assault, it looked like.They had a piece of furniture up against the door, the door, the entry to the floor from the Rotunda, and they had guns pulled, Peters said.And they just told us to take our pins off, he added, referring to lapel pins members wear so Capitol Police can quickly identify them. Then the lawmakers were evacuated.Staff members grabbed the boxes of Electoral College votes as the evacuation took place. Otherwise, said Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., the ballots likely would have been destroyed by the protesters.Trump supporters posting on internet forums popular with far-right fringe elements celebrated the chaos. Messages posted on one turned from profane frustration over the content of Trump\u0027s speech to glee when supporters stormed the building. At least one leading figure was livestreaming video from inside the Capitol during the siege.The entire District of Columbia National Guard, made up of 1,100 troops, was ordered into the city at the request of Washington’s mayor, Muriel Bowser.Footage showed that one protester reached the office of Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic House Speaker, and left a note reading “we will not back down”.Both Ms Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader in the Senate, released a statement calling on Mr Trump to demand that all protesters leave the US Capitol. The democratic system had ground to a halt.Pro-Trump demonstrators assembled elsewhere in the country, forcing evacuations in at least two states. Cheers rang out in St. Paul, Minnesota, from demonstrators in reaction to the news that supporters of Mr Trump had stormed the Capitol. New Mexico state police evacuated staff from a statehouse building as a precaution after hundreds of flag-waving supporters arrived in a vehicle caravan and on horseback.The Pentagon said about 1,100 District of Columbia National Guard members were being mobilised to help support law enforcement at the Capitol. More than a dozen people were arrested.As darkness began to set in, law enforcement officials worked their way toward the protesters, using percussion grenades to try to clear the area around the Capitol. Big clouds of tear gas were visible. Police in full riot gear moved down the steps, clashing with demonstrators.As the Senate reconvened to complete the voting process to confirm Mr Biden\u0027s victory, Mr Pence condemned the violent supporters of Mr Trump.You did not win. Violence never wins, Mr Pence said of the gang of people who responded to Mr Trump\u0027s call to protest his loss in November\u0027s presidential election.Mr Pence said the Capitol was secured, and urged the Senate to get back to work. Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the failed insurrection underscored lawmakers\u0027 duty to confirm the vote. Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Congress would show the world what America is made of by finishing the count.The mayor of Washington DC, Muriel Bowser, announced he will extend the Emergency Declaration until Jan 21, the day after Joe Biden\u0027s inauguration ceremony. This gives city officials the power to order people off the street if a curfew is issued, reduce the hours of operation for businesses across the city, and expend funds as needed to protect public safety.The mayor shared: President Trump continues to fan rage and violence by contending that the Presidential election was invalid, adding, some persons can be expected to continue their violent protests through the inauguration.Punctuating their resolve, both the House and Senate soundly defeated the first objection, to election results from Arizona that had been raised by Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz. Still, most House Republicans had voted for it. Proceedings pushed into the night.The Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Maria Zakharova, has also labelled the US electoral system as archaic, before suggesting it does not meet democratic standards- blaming the media\u0027s politicisation for the deep unrest in the American capital. Speaking to Russian news agencies, she shared: The electoral system in the United States is archaic, it does not meed modern democratic standards, creating opportunities for numerous violations, and the American media have become an instrument of political struggle.On Wednesday night, the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, asked that people “pray for the USA”. He wrote in a tweet: “For the moment let us pray for the USA, the world’s greatest defender of democracy until now, as it faces this huge shock.

Protesters overturned barricades and clashed with police as thousands descended on the Capitol grounds.Here\u0027s how the world\u0027s newspapers reacted.\u0027Trump Incites Mob\u0027 read the headline on the New York TimesIn the UK, Prime Minister Boris Johnson called the events in the US Congress a disgrace, saying the United States stood for democracy around the world and that was it was vital now that there should be a peaceful and orderly transfer of power.The violence replaced the coronavirus lockdown on most of the country\u0027s front pages. Democracy under siege, The Daily  said on its front page.  Italians watched the events with shock, having always considered the US to be the model of democracy and the country that rescued Italy after its fascist descent during World War II.This is the widely anticipated outcome of Trumpism, tweeted a retired Italian center-left politician, Pierluigi Castagnetti. And unfortunately it won\u0027t end today. When politics is replaced by deception and fanaticism of the people the drift is inevitable.European Parliament President David Sassoli, who leads one of the largest legislatures in the world, also denounced the scenes at the Capitol. The European Union has spent four cantankerous years dealing with the Trump administration, and its top officials have repeatedly said they are looking forward to a better relationship under President-elect Joe Biden.This is insurrection. Nothing less. In Washington, tweeted Carl Bildt, a former prime minister of Sweden.In France, French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said on Twitter: The violence against the American institutions is a grave attack on democracy. I condemn it. The will and the vote of the American people must be respected.Le Figaro newspaper described it as fractured democracy. Libération newspaper ran with the headline Trump\u0027s strategy of chaos.In Germany, Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said democracy\u0027s enemies would be cheered by scenes of violence at the United States Capitol, and he called on Trump to accept US voters\u0027 decision.In a tweet, Maas said the violence had been caused by inflammatory rhetoric. Trump and his supporters must accept the decision of American voters at last and stop trampling on democracy.Its newspaper Morgen Post used just one word to describe the events: Shame!In Spain, Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said in a tweet: I am following with concern the news that are coming from Capitol Hill in Washington. I trust in the strength of America\u0027s democracy.The new Presidency of @JoeBiden will overcome this time of tension, uniting the American people.El Pais placed the blame solely at Trump\u0027s feet, saying he instigated the revolt.In Ireland, foreign minister Simon Coveney called the scenes in Washington a deliberate assault on Democracy by a sitting President \u0026amp his supporters, attempting to overturn a free \u0026amp fair election!

It’s mixed messaging.“People see that and think ‘maybe I don’t have to stay at home if all these people are allowed to go out and about, and that’s a problem.“The evidence of this pandemic is that when people see there is a real threat, when they think that what they do can make a difference, and when they trust the leadership and are getting clear, consistent messages - they respond to it.“But we’re not getting clear consistent messages this time and unfortunately the Government isn’t as trusted as handling the pandemic as it was at the start.“The data for the additional number of people being out and about is consistent with all those people I mentioned that are allowed to go out of their house. It’s a very large number of people.“If one wants to stop this pandemic as quickly as possible then one has to stop people being in close proximity to each other and that means having the kind of lockdown we had the first time round.“There are three things going on: There is more interaction because it’s not a full lockdown. It is colder, so the virus thrives more and we spend more time indoors where aerosols transmit the virus, and we have got a new variant which is at least 50 per cent more transmissible. “So logic would suggest that you need measures that are more stringent than March, but what we have are measures that are less stringent.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"last night straw broke republicans backs","story":"The scenes in Washington DC looked eerily familiar to me. Back in 2000 a mob descended on the parliament building in Belgrade – which has a passing resemblance to Capitol Hill  - eventually forcing Slobodan Milosevic from power.I was forced to watch the action from afar, having been thrown out of the country along with a raft of other western journalists about a week before, as tension rose and mass street protests became a daily occurrence.Of course, this was the sort of thing one expected in a country which at the time could hardly be described as a mature democracy.Never did I think I would see such scenes unfolding in the capital of my adopted country which, so we are supposed to believe, cherishes democratic values so highly. Such assumptions have been ripped apart by Donald Trump since he lost the election. Even before the first vote was cast, he was crying foul and his complaints that the election was rigged have been relentless ever since.He was not short of allies on Capitol Hill who were more than happy to echo his allegations. The majority of the Republican caucus in the House of Representatives felt it politic to object to Joe Biden’s win, as did nearly a quarter of the party’s senators.Whether this was from conviction is a matter of debate. Given the power of the Trump base, it is not unreasonable to suspect that many fear a primary challenge the next time they are up for re-election.On Tuesday – just ahead of the congressional vote – Trump’s son Eric put the frighteners on, saying he would support anyone challenging any party lawmaker who accepted the Electoral College vote.Donald Trump’s ham-fisted – and legally questionable – attempt to persuade Georgia’s Secretary of State to “find” 11,780 votes must have raised alarm bells even among his most loyal supporters.And so it appeared, with an astonishingly forceful speech by Mitch McConnell, the party’s Senate leader who had defended Trump’s right to contest the result in the courts.“If this election were overturned by mere allegations from the losing side, our democracy would enter a death spiral,” he said. “We’d never see the whole nation accept an election again.”This was as powerful a repudiation of Trump from the party establishment as I have heard in years. The sentiments were expressed as Trump’s mob of supporters began its assault on Capitol Hill.Let us not forget that only days before, Trump had promised a “wild” protest against the “stolen election.”His speech was hardly an appeal to reason. We will never give up, we will never concede. It doesn\u0027t happen. You don’t concede when there’s theft involved.As the mayhem unfolded, he tweeted just twice – on neither occasion condemning the assault on the heart of American democracy.Even when he released a video on Twitter urging people to go home, he reprised the grievances which had unleashed the mayhem in the first place.He appeared to accept no responsibility for the violence which saw members of Congress cowering in fear, an armed standoff at the door of the House of Representatives and his own vice-president having to be hustled away to safety.Trump has remained unrepentant, tweeting: “These are the things and events that happen when a sacred landslide election victory is so unceremoniously \u0026amp viciously stripped away from great patriots who have been badly \u0026amp unfairly treated for so long.”Urging the mob to “go home with love and in peace” he then told them to “Remember this day forever!”So not surprisingly people in Washington are now asking whether the US can survive even two more weeks of a Trump presidency.Several Democratic members of Congress are suggesting that the Cabinet should invoke the 25th Amendment and remove Trump from office as soon as possible.Given the political temperature, that is not surprising. But William Cohen, who was a Republican senator, has said the same thing. Even the National Association of Manufacturers has urged Mike Pence and the cabinet to intervene – a view which was retweeted by conservative columnist, Jonah Goldberg.Such calls are likely to become more widespread in days ahead and the case for action is becoming more persuasive.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"mass oxford vaccine push begins gps deliver first doses","story":"GPs have begun administering the Oxford vaccine for the first time as the race to vaccinate the nation intensifies.In a bid to vaccinate the 13.8 million most vulnerable people in the UK by mid-February GPs have been instructed by the government to prioritise Covid vaccinations over their routine care.GPs were told by The British Medical Association to re-prioritize and postpone other activities.The first GP-administered Covid vaccine was delivered at the Pentland Medical Practice in Scotland.Every vaccine up to this point has been delivered in hospitals, but now they will be rolled out in hundreds of GP surgeries.  Ian Cormack was the first pictured getting the jab and all the other patients among the first receiving the vaccine at Pentland are all over 90.The first jab comes after Boris Johnson’s Wednesday announcement that the daily death toll has topped 1,000 for the first time since April 21 and England’s healthcare workers are having to contend with quickly filling hospital beds.On Monday January 4 a further 3,500 people were admitted to hospitals with coronavirus.GP vaccinations come as welcome news as hospital bosses are being forced to find extra beds in the care and nursing home sector as wards fill up amid a coronavirus case surge, the chief executive of NHS Providers Chris Hopson said. Mr Johnson told the Commons on Wednesday: After the marathon of last year we are indeed now in a sprint, a race to vaccinate the vulnerable faster than the virus can reach them. Every needle in the arm makes a difference.With this new push of GPs delivering vaccinations the government aims to vaccinate all over-70s, front-line healthcare workers, and the most vulnerable by mid-February, which is when a review of its current lockdown rules will take place.The benefit of the Oxford vaccine is it’s cheaper price, coming in at under £3 per dose, and it\u0027s easier storage in normal fridge temperatures in contrast to the Pfizer vaccine.Health Secretary Matt Hancock said that the government and NHS are working around the clock to scale up the coronavirus vaccination program.He said: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine can be transported easily and I’m delighted care home residents will begin receiving their first OxfordAstraZeneca jabs this week.This is the first step in the effort to mass vaccinate the most clinically vulnerable population in the UK in the battle against the new virus variant and is the key upon which easing out of the national lockdown next month depends.Upward of 2million vaccines a week will need to be administered for the Government to hit its mid-February target.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and

hancock arrives gp surgery promote vaccine rollout no","story":"Health Secretary Matt Hancock faced questions about the supply of the Oxford vaccine after he visited a doctors\u0027 surgery to promote the national rollout only to arrive to find out doctors had not received a delivery.Mr Hancock was attending a photocall on the morning that GPs began administering the vaccine for the first time, but the London surgery he visited had not received the Oxford product.Bloomsbury Surgery in central London was expecting the first batch of the Oxford vaccine Thursday morning, but that has now been pushed back by 24 hours, Sky News reported.GP Ammara Hughes told Sky News it was frustrating because they have capacity to inoculate many more patients but vaccine deliveries are ad hoc.She said: There seems like there\u0027s been a supply problem for getting that delivery.The doctor told the Health Secretary: We are willing, we are able, you get us the vaccines and we will deliver.It is understood the practice was ready to vaccinate 400 people on Thursday, and have the capacity to administer 100 more. Dr Hughes said: We were expecting our first AstraZeneca 400 today, but we\u0027ve had a pushback for 24 hours so we\u0027re now getting that delivery tomorrow.It\u0027s just more frustrating than a concern, because we\u0027ve got the capacity to vaccinate and if we had a regular supply, we do have the capacity to vaccinate three to four thousand patients a week.We have been running since the middle of December, and on our busiest days we can vaccinate 500 people easily.If we could get the AstraZeneca, then we could easily vaccinate 500 a day, which would ease the pressure on the health service and we could get more and more people vaccinated quickly and hopefully get out of the pandemic.Mr Hancock said: It\u0027s great news this morning that the OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine is from right now being rolled out to GP surgeries across the country.For the first three days with the Oxford vaccine we did it in hospitals to check that it was working well and it\u0027s working well so now we can make sure that it gets to all those GP surgeries that like this one can do all the vaccinations that are needed.The rate-limiting step is the supply of vaccine, we\u0027re working with the companies, both Pfizer and AstraZeneca to increase the supply.GPs started administering the Oxford vaccine for the first time as the race to vaccinate the nation intensifies.Doctors have been instructed to stand down routine care and prioritise providing Covid vaccinations in a bid to ensure the NHS can deliver almost 14 million jabs by next month.   The first GP-administered vaccine was delivered in Scotland to Ian Cormack.Every jab up to now has been in hospitals.It comes as

a third national lockdown.The Prime Minister said schools will need to offer remote learning until at least mid-February and GCSE and A-level exams face cancellation for a second year.Mr Johnson said the new measures were necessary: because we have to do everything we possibly can to stop the spread of the disease.Only vulnerable children and the children of key workers will be allowed to attend schools for face-to-face learning, and early years settings such as nurseries will remain accessible.The Prime Minister has promised that schools will be the very first things to reopen when lockdown measures begin to be removed, saying that this could come following the February half term. However, Mr Johnson remains very cautious about the timetable, with restrictions being lifted as a gradual unravelling. Those entitled to free school meals will continue to receive them during closures, and more devices will be distributed to help remote learning, according to Mr Johnson.The Government had insisted schools would remain open only a day before the new measures were announced, reassuring parents it was safe to send their children back for the start of term on Jan 4.But the move prompted backlash from four national teaching unions, who called for the delay seen across London to apply to all schools in England amid concerns the new strain of Covid-19 poses a threat to teachers.Anne Longfield, the Children\u0027s Commissioner for England has called for teachers to be vaccinated as a priority.The new lockdown measures mean the entire country will be subject to the same tougher measures, including the closure of all schools, meaning the tier system is not currently in place.Every school had been instructed to draw up plans to ensure children continue to receive an education even if they have to stay at home.Mr Johnson said on the announcement of closing schools: I want to stress that the problem is not that schools are unsafe to children. The problem is that schools may nonetheless act as vectors for transmission, causing the virus to spread between households.Read more on the previous tier system: All schools will remain closed until mid-February, with the possibility that these measures could be extended further.This means most secondary school pupils will stay at home until at least February half term. Gavin Williamson, the Education Secretary, announced on January 6 that GCSE, A-Level and AS exams will not take place this summer. Exams will be replaced by teacher assessments, with Mr Williamson saying that the government will put our trust in teachers, rather than algorithms. The Education Secretary has also stated that the Department for Education and Ofqual had already worked up a range of options. Details are currently being fine tuned, but it will be a form of teacher-assessed grades, with training and support provided to ensure these are awarded fairly and consistently across the country.When schools reopened in September the Government published 25,000 words of guidance explaining how school children and staff should be kept safe.Older children will be encouraged to avoid close contact with one another, in part because risks increase with age. Teachers are not restricted to a single bubble, but are urged to stay at the front of any classroom to reduce contact. In class, pupils must sit spaced out side-by-side and facing forward.The use of the staff room by teachers is also meant to be “minimised”. Schools must contact local health protection teams immediately so those in close contact with the child can be traced. Currently, pupils in a bubble, year groups and very rarely, the entire school, could be asked to self-isolate. A mobile testing unit could also be sent to a campus. Schools will be offered serial testing of close contacts of staff and pupils who test positive to negate the need for entire year groups to self-isolate at home.Teachers who help a child with symptoms do not have to self-isolate unless they develop symptoms themselves. However, they should thoroughly wash their hands and wear PPE while with the child. The area where someone suspected of having Covid-19 has been must then be intensively cleaned.If a parent insists a child with symptoms should attend school, the headteacher can refuse to take the pupil if they believe there is a threat to others.Staff will also supply and promote the use of tissues as part of the “catch it, bin it, kill it” technique to control germs.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"travel news covid test holidays flights uk restrictions ban","story":"A beach in Lanzarote, Canary Isles, displays its coronavirus rulesWhat a new national lockdown means for travelCan I go on holiday?New UK entry testing rules: Everything you need to knowWill cruise holidays make a comeback in 2021?Sign up to the  Travel newsletter​Travel agents are warning of rising holiday prices and an impending shortage of summer availability – caused by pent-up demand for future trips, and the many postponed bookings from last year.We’ve already seen an increase in bookings for this summer with Greece and Turkey currently being the most popular choices for customers, followed by the Balearic and Canary Islands, a TUI spokesperson told  Travel. Meanwhile, Thomas Cook reported an immediate jump in holiday bookings as soon as people finished work for Christmas.The UK\u0027s domestic travel industry has warned of limited availability this year. The pent-up demand for Easter through to 2022 is really high, said Alistair Handyside, Executive Chair of The Professional Association of Self-Caterers UK.Anyone who has not booked a holiday in the UK soon will be looking at the leftovers.Package holiday prices are largely driven by the cost of flights, says Craig Ashford, Director of Marketing at travel agency TravelUp – and as demand rises, so too will holiday prices, he warns. Airlines are trying to stimulate the market so there are some phenomenally low rates. As confidence returns the total number of airline seats will remain the same, so the cost will rise. My strong advice is to book now.Scroll down for more on this story, and other breaking news. The summer sale comes earlier than ever before, amid strong demand from holidaymakers looking to book trips far in advance.Steve Heapy, CEO of Jet2 and Jet2holidays, said: “After much uncertainty, the positive news about a vaccine coupled with a real desire to get away, means we are seeing strong demand from holidaymakers wanting to plan and book future holidays.As always, we respond to what our customers and independent travel agency partners are telling us, so we have put Summer 22 on sale from all ten of our UK bases, meaning we’re on sale with our summer programme earlier than ever before.With sunshine favourites on sale, the scale of our programme means there is plenty of choice and flexibility for customers and independent travel agents to choose from with our award-winning airline and tour operator.With more good news around the corner, we’re sure that our Summer 22 programme will be a huge hit with local holidaymakers looking to secure a much-needed holiday and give themselves something to look forward to.”Japan\u0027s government has declared a month-long coronavirus state of emergency in the greater Tokyo area as the capital reported another record surge in daily infections.Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga described a great sense of crisis as he announced the measure, which begins Friday and is less strict than the harsh lockdowns seen elsewhere or even the country\u0027s first virus emergency last spring.It primarily targets restaurants and bars, which will be asked to stop serving alcohol by 7 pm and close an hour later.Shinjuku district in JapanSuga made a special appeal to young people to abide by the requests, saying that more than half of recent new infections in greater Tokyo were among the under-30s.Please act... in order to save precious lives of your parents, grandfathers, grandmothers and friends, he said.Tokyo recorded 2,447 new cases on Thursday - shattering the previous record of 1,591 logged a day earlier, and representing a sizeable chunk of the 7,490 new cases reported nationwide.Still, Japan\u0027s outbreak remains comparatively small, with around 3,700 deaths overall.Rising infections has seen Ireland leapfrog the UK to become the country with the third highest seven-day case rate. The Czech Republic, which was praised for its handling of the pandemic last spring only to be hit harder than the rest of Europe in winter, tops the table.The countries with the highest Covid infection rateThe Government is expected to review its quarantine-free travel corridor list at 5pm, the first update since December 21, and a couple of destinations appear at risk.Cases have risen in the UAE and Barbados in recent weeks, pushing their seven-day infection rates to 131.6 per 100,000 residents and 129.4, respectively. While the UK\u0027s own rate is far higher (607.5), it has previously ditched countries that crossed the 100 barrier.Holidays are not allowed under lockdown rules but any changes will affect those already abroad or needing to travel for essential reasons. It would also bode ill for the prospects of post-lockdown trips. National Express will fully suspend its national network of scheduled coach services with effect from 23:59 on Sunday 10 January.Chris Hardy, managing director of National Express UK Coach: “We have been providing an important service for essential travel needs.

Though holidays are, of course, currently prohibited, any changes may impact essential travel – such as work trips and emergency journeys.Shapps usually announces any changes on his Twitter feed, but we\u0027ll have all the updates right here on the Travel Live Blog too.Hotelplan, which owns leading ski operators Inghams, Ski Total and Flexiski, has confirmed it is cancelling all ski holidays until after February 27.The group has already cancelled all holidays for the winter with its brand Esprit Ski.Following the announcement of new national lockdown restrictions, this week, we have sadly further suspended all Inghams, Ski Total and Flexiski holidays until after 27 February 2021,” said Joe Ponte, CEO of Hotelplan UK.  It’s still not clear when we will able to travel from the UK to European ski destinations, and understandably many people are eager to get back on the slopes. Our customers can remain assured that we are continuing to closely monitor the situation and when it is safe to do so, we will be ready to deliver the ski holidays people want.The move follows a similar decision by Crystal Ski Holidays, the UK’s biggest ski operator, which has suspended all trips up to and including February 12 – it is yet to make a decision on February half-term departures.What impact does the UK’s third national lockdown have on ski holidays? Our experts reveal all.Airline Aer Lingus is warning travellers from Britain and South Africa that those without a negative Covid-19 certificate will face a €2,500 fine or six months\u0027 imprisonment. The law will come into effect on January 9 – this Saturday. The airline\u0027s warning reads:All travellers are advised to check the requirements on the Government website.Holidaymakers arriving in Barbados may have to wear \u0027electronic tracking bracelets\u0027 until they are confirmed to be negative of Covid-19. This morning, the updated advice from the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development office reads: If the result of that second test is negative, you will not be subject to further quarantine.It is thought the measure would enable health authorities to check whether holidaymakers are adhering to their self-isolation requirements. Whether British skiers and snowboarders will be able to travel restriction- or quarantine-free to the French Alps this winter remains to be seen. Additionally, while ski resorts have been open for other activities since mid-December, a decision on whether ski lifts in France will be allowed to open, many for the first time this winter, is yet to be made, with an announcement due this evening. Despite the uncertainty surrounding what fate President Macron will cast on ski lifts later today many resorts are still hopeful that by the spring there will be a chance to make fresh tracks.Lucy Aspden has the latest.The Home Secretary Priti Patel has told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme that the UK Government will be announcing \u0027further action\u0027 regarding border restrictions imminently. Further action is going to take place, she told the programme. The Government is reviewing measures at the border... You will hear very shortly some of the changes that the Government will be proposing.Earlier this week, The  revealed that passengers would be prohibited from travelling to the UK without a negative Covid-19 test. However, the Government is yet to publish any details of its plans. We will, of course, have more on this story as it develops. Heathrow Airporthas reminded the public that \u0027only passengers undertaking essential travel may enter\u0027 its terminal buildings.That includes those who are travelling for essential reasons under the current lockdown legislation – as well as those offering care or assistance to travellers.Face coverings are also mandatory in terminal buildings, for all people over the age of 11. If you\u0027re thinking of booking a trip for later this year, take advantage of low flight prices while you still can, warns a spokesperson from travel agency Travelup: My strong advice is to book now, especially if you have a particular dream holiday or trip in mind. The prices can only go up. Once we are out of lockdown, the vaccine programme is rolled out more widely, and more travel corridors are opened up with testing, capacity is going to disappear pretty quickly. There is no point waiting to book nearer to departure time nowadays. Years ago there were low cost carriers, charters and scheduled airlines – and they were using different price matrixes. The low cost carriers would start off cheap and then get more expensive as you got closer to the departure date. The other airlines would reduce their prices to fill the empty seats. Now they all use the same model: they get more expensive. They all work on the basis that it’s the people who really need to travel who are booking so close to departure. So there is no point waiting any more.The boss of Norwegian Air has said the airline is \u0027fighting for survival\u0027 amid the coronavirus travel ban – with traffic down 94 per cent year-on-year. CEO  Jacob Schram said that just 130,000 passengers travelled on the airline in December 2020 – just 6 per cent of the passenger numbers in December 2019. The pandemic continues to have a negative impact on our business as it has had since March 2020, said Schram.At the beginning of last year, Norwegian was headed for a positive result in 2020 instead 2020, has been a very challenging year and we now find ourselves fighting for survival.The politan Police has said that officers will now be more inquisitive of people\u0027s behaviour and be quicker to act to engage rulebreakers. Police forces around the country would take similar approaches, Scotland Yard said.Over the past few weeks, officers have already turned long-distance day trippers away from beauty spots around the UK – including Snowdonia and the Brecon Beacons. Martin Hewitt, chairman of the National Police Chiefs\u0027 Council (NPCC) said that police resources were not limitless and officers continued to prioritise their work, adding that it was really, really important that people followed the Government guidance.Canada will end its ban on flights from the UK on Wednesday, Transport Minister Marc Garneau has announced.The ban on UK flights, which was going until midnight tonight will lapse. It will no longer be applicable, Garneau told a press conference. The country prohibited flights from the UK on December 20, amid concerns over the new variant of Covid-19. In place of the ban, Canada has announced that all incoming travellers will be required to test negative for coronavirus within 72 hours of boarding a flight before being allowed into the country.Travellers will still be required to quarantine for 14 days on arrival.Book your holiday now or face potential disappointment, is the message from the travel industry. A spokesperson from Kuoni told  Travel: Many people will have gone for a year or more without an overseas holiday, so there’ll be a lot of hope pinned on summer 2021. January has always been a popular time to book as there are so many good savings, but this year it’s advisable to book sooner rather than later to guarantee you’ll get away to the spot you want.Before we begin, here\u0027s a quick recap of Wednesday\u0027s news:Passengers to be banned from boarding flights to UK without negative Covid testCruise sector in need of \u0027urgent\u0027 guidance from government Social media is full of celebrities on holiday in Dubai – are they above the law?Stansted to close terminal overnight after flight cancellations\u0027Vaccine passport\u0027 could become a requirement, says Fauci Now, on with today\u0027s stories.Coronavirus latest news: Army on standby to take over vaccine rollout if medics fall illProud Boys and neo-Nazis: Who are the protesters who stormed the US Capitol?US Capitol siege: Officials \u0026#39discuss 25th amendment to remove Donald Trump\u0026#39 as Republicans turn backs on presidentPolitics latest news: Donald Trump was \u0026#39not fit to be president\u0026#39 and UK \u0026#39got too close,\u0026#39 says former ambassadorAshli Babbit: Air Force veteran from California shot dead by plain-clothes police during US Capitol riotsInauguration Day 2021: When is Joe Biden sworn in as US president, and could it be behind closed doors?Watch: How police responded to Trump mob vs Black Lives Matter protestsOxford Covid-19 vaccine Q\u0026ampA: How effective is it, and how is it different to the Pfizer vaccine?Covid-19 vaccine: Latest updates on Oxford, Moderna and Pfizer breakthroughs - and who will get it first?Analysis: why the South African coronavirus variant is so worryingScotland lockdown: what are the new Covid rules and Tier 4 restrictions?What England\u0026#39s new national lockdown rules mean for youThe priority list for the Oxford and Pfizer vaccines - and how they will be rolled outUS Capitol riots: Trump commits to peaceful transition after Biden certified as President - latest newsFour dead in US Capitol riot after Donald Trump\u0026#39s supporters storm Washington - everything we know Capitol police firings imminent after ‘attempted coup’ in WashingtonProtester pictured with his feet up on Nancy Pelosi\u0026#39s desk is Trump supporter from ArkansasComment: YouTube censorship is a symptom of a corrosive philosophy readers on lockdown policing: \u0026#39Too many people are still ignoring the rules \u0026#39What are the rules for non-essential shops in lockdown?Jake Angeli: The ‘QAnon shaman’ from Arizona at the heart of the Capitol riots Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"vaccines minister needs military style approach lick fumbling","story":"The moment the Prime Minister decided to place a number of areas into Tier 4, it became a racing certainty that the rest of England would be in full lockdown by January. The nature of this new Covid variant has changed the terms of our response and I accept that the Government has had to take action even if I have deep concerns about aspects of the course it has chosen.However, it is clear the Government has now put all its eggs in the basket of the vaccine roll out. The way out for the country hangs on the role out of these jabs. The Prime Minister has rightly demanded of ministers and the NHS that they vaccinate the most at risk members of the public, some 13.4 million people, by the middle of February. That would require the Government to be vaccinating a minimum of 2 million people a week. This is an enormous task.  It is therefore entirely commendable that the PM has appointed a dedicated minister, Nadhim Zahawi, to oversee this task. It is especially welcome that he chose one with the useful experience of having run a global business before entering politics. Yet, even with those credentials, Mr Zahawi knows that to achieve the the task set by the Prime Minister he will have to have the most robust of institutional structures and the powers necessary to overcome the normal inertia, particularly that occurs between government departments.This must be treated as a military operation. He must be clear what the real objective is and make it clear that each person must understand this, all the way down the chain. Maintenance of the Objective, a principle that Mr Zahawi would do well to borrow from the military, cannot be forgotten and an assessment of whether the roll-out is on track but must be made daily. To that end, it is good that 101 Logistics Brigade are now embedded in the process. The military bring key command and control skills, an area in which the Civil Service is typically poor. The main problem is that Civil Servants don’t by nature tend to meet targets. They typically end up giving ministers overly optimistic objectives and then later reporting back failure once it\u0027s already too late. This is because once they set a goal, they often then leave it to those tasked with carrying out inidual assignments to report back up. Without critical interrogation along the way, problems get hidden and the targets get missed. Examples of this are endless but the test-and-trace app would be one recent example.Mr Zahawi will need, on his desk every evening, a report direct from each area of command, town and district. These will be compiled by the contract managers whose responsibility it is to deliver their area. This report should include their targets for that day and week and whether they are on track to meet their broader targets. If they are off, then they must report what they are doing to get back on track. Two days of missed targets should trigger urgent intervention. It is this feature most of all that should occupy his daily meetings. If medical centres are going to be used to organise vaccinations and call people in, then the deliveries of the vaccine must be there on time, otherwise chaos ensues.As the PM has put him in charge, he must have the power to demand that inidual Secretaries of State account to him for their compliance with the plan. The PM will need to work hand in glove with him on this. Inidual departments must not be allowed to drag their feet or have other priorities. Perhaps the best example of where this has already occurred is the delay in getting retired doctors and nurses in to carry out the jabs. The NHS has known about the ridiculous amount of compliance these people were being put through, yet dragged their feet on resolving the issue until this week. The revelation that PHE staff were not planning to work seven days a week, a situation that has since been corrected.On top of that, there is a long list of organisations that need to be on board in the role out. Pharmacies, with pre-existing venues and skills in administering vaccinations. Could coffee shops, pubs or even schools, closed now but with easy access and refrigeration, be used as sites for vaccines? They could even use Job Centres, as the authorities have in Israel, drive-in centres and mobile vaccination units. However, the issue which has the capacity to derail the objective is that of supply. There is some evidence of a problem in the supply of glass vials where there seems to be a shortage. The vaccine manufacturers deny this and say they are on track to meet the need for two million doses a week, but it isn’t certain when that will be. In time for 13.4 million to be vaccinated by mid-February? If so, that means next week.The simple truth, and what may prove to be the Government\u0027s greatest headache, is that I don’t think 2 million vaccinations a week will be enough. I suspect that it will need to be at least three million on a reducing timescale. If such a compression of the timetable takes place, there needs to be a back-up plan to cover it. From production to inoculation, the potential to scale up must be there, including 24 hour vaccinations.Urgency is the key and to that end Nadhim Zahawi should insist that everyone in government, from the Prime Minister down, should now have on their desk a note saying: Action this Day!More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"12 tory mps who voted","story":"NewsThe  Tory MPs who voted against Englands new lockdown - vote breakdownBoris Johnson faced a revolt from his own party over the third coronavirus shutdown, which came into effect on Wednesday amid surging Covid ratesmirrorShareCommentsByLizzy BuchanPolitical Correspondent:,  JAN NewsTory backbenchers rebelled against Englands new lockdown laws \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Angry backbenchers expressed alarm over new laws, after the small print revealed the lockdown could stay in place until March. MPs backed the plan in a Commons vote on Wednesday by  votes to , providing the Prime Minister with a majority of . But  Tory and  DUP MPs opposed the legislation. While the scale of the Tory revolt was smaller than the  MPs who opposed the tougher tier rules in December, it is a sign of trouble ahead for the Prime Minister. Mr Johnson insisted he had no choice but to impose a third national lockdown as the UKaposs death toll soared to levels seen during the peak of the pandemic in April. He told MPs earlier that the March deadline was not because we expect the full national lockdown to continue until then but to allow a steady, controlled and evidence-led move down through the tiers on a regional basis. The PM added: Our emergence from the lockdown cocoon will not be a big bang but a gradual unwrapping. On Wednesday, , people had died within  days of testing positive for Covid- - the highest daily reported total since April . Official figures are being affected by a lag of reporting over the festive period, with a round a third of the new deaths taking place before January  and around  in the week before Christmas Day. Record numbers of Covid- patients are in Englandaposs hospitals, with , people on the wards as of am on January . The figure is up % on a week ago. A string of Tory rebels expressed anger at new restrictions - despite the spiralling infection rates.  Former minister Sir Desmond Swayne branded lockdowns a complete failure while Sir Robert Syms said the measures, which are in place until March , were essentially a blank cheque for three months to Public Health England to do what they wish. Senior backbencher Sir Charles Walker blasted privileged people who were finding it easy to follow the rules. I canapost support criminalising a parent for seeing a child in the park over the coming months, itaposs not within my DNA to do that, he said. Sir Charles said it was easy for him and most people in this House to comply with the law, explaining: Weaposre comfortably off, we live in nice houses, we have gardens, we have outdoor spaces, we have access to family. The same applies to those journalists who fill our TV screens every night with their wisdom and wit about how people should comply with these regulations, and how they sneer at those who canapost.  How MPs voted on the lockdownThe new law, known as the Health Protection Coronavirus, RestrictionsandRegulations , passed by  votes to , with a majority of .  Conservative MPs,  Labour,  Liberal Democrats voted in favour, along with Green Party MP Caroline Lucas and Independent MPs Jeremy Corbyn and Claudia Webbe.No vote was recorded for  MPs, although this does not automatically mean they abstained.

The drive to mass vaccinate the population will gather pace with the jab available at  GP-led services from Thursday, NHS England said. It comes as the UK faces a race to protect the population after the daily reported death toll topped , for the first time since April.Record numbers are also currently in hospital with coronavirus, with a further , admitted in England on Monday January .Boris Johnson, who was given the overwhelming backing of MPs for the latest lockdown, warned that there was now a race between the spread of the virus and the delivery of vaccines to the most vulnerable. Meanwhile, the Dailyreports that family doctors have been instructedto “stand down” routine care and prioritise Covid vaccinations, so the NHS can meet its target of  million jabs by next month.GPs have reportedly been issued guidance telling them that delivering the vaccine should be their “top priority”, with advice to “postpone other activities”. After the marathon of last year we are indeed now in a sprint, a race to vaccinate the vulnerable faster than the virus can reach them, the Prime Minister told MPs yesterday as Parliament approved the new lockdown that could last until April. Every needle in every arm makes a dference. It is hoped that more than  sites will be delivering vaccines by the end of the week, with the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine easier to administer given it can be stored at fridge temperatures, unlike the Pfizer jab which requires storage at minus C.  Seven mass vaccination centres will open next week in London, Newcastle, Manchester, Birmingham, Bristol, Surrey and Stevenage. Vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi admitted the target of vaccinating around  million people in the highest priority groups - including the elderly, those with clinical needs, care home residents and staff as well as frontline NHS workers - by February  was stretching. Some . million people have already received either the Pfizer BioNTech or Oxford AstraZeneca jab. According to a report in the Daily Mail, the bid to increase the speed of inoculations will see the approval period needed for Covid vaccine batches slashed from  days to just four. The Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory Agency , the body responsible for the checks, is also set to increase staffing in a bid to accelerate the programme, the paper reported.  Ministers have already decided, in a move queried by the World Health Organisation , to administer the first jab to as many priority patients as possible by delaying a second shot. The second jab will be given  weeks later to prevent current supplies from being held back. In the clinical trials, vaccine recipients received a follow-up shot within three weeks. Mr Johnson was given approval for the latest lockdown in the Commons but faced rebellion within his ranks, with  Conservative MPs voting against the stay-at-home rules. They were joined by four DUP MPs opposing the regulations. In the face of pressure from senior Tories to commit to easing the restrictions - which came into force on Wednesday and were being voted on retrospectively by MPs - as soon as possible, Mr Johnson said there would be substantial opportunities for relaxation before March.  Mark Harper, ex-government chief whip and chairman of the lockdown-sceptic Covid Recovery Group, said the restrictions should be reviewed in the middle of February once the most vulnerable had been vaccinated, as per the Governmentaposs aim. The result came as Government data confirmed that the Covid death toll had once again reached levels not seen since the peak of the first wave in . The figures, however, continue to be affected by a lag in the publication of recent data and contain some deaths that took place over the Christmas and New Year period that have only just been reported.

The Health Secretary said it was “great news” that the jab could be delivered to family doctors from today to hit a target of inoculating million by February . But the Bloomsbury Surgery in Camden, north London, had not received its delivery of the new vaccine when he visited. GP Ammara Hughes told Sky News: “We were expecting our first AstraZeneca  today, but weaposve had a pushback for  hours so weaposre now getting that delivery tomorrow. She added: “Itaposs just more frustrating than a concern, because weaposve got the capacity to vaccinate andwe had a regular supply, we do have the capacity to vaccinate three to four thousand patients a week.  We have been running since the middle of December, and on our busiest days we can vaccinate  people easily. If we could get the AstraZeneca, then we could easily vaccinate  a day, which would ease the pressure on the health service. “And we could get more and more people vaccinated quickly and hopefully get out of the pandemic. It is thought the practice had not been due to give the Oxford jab from today, because it already had supplies of the Pfizer jab, but could still prove embarrassing to the top Tory.Ministers have insisted they can ramp up from around , vaccines per week to , per day to meet Boris Johnson ’s target. Speaking outside the surgery, Mr Hancock said the “rate-limiting step” was how fast the two jabs could be produced by the firms Pfizer and AstraZeneca. It was not clearhe knew about the Oxford jab delay to that surgery at the time. He told reporters: “The manufacturers are doing a brilliant job and they’re delivering to the schedule that’s agreed. “But that schedule is the amount of vaccine that we have, and that’s what GPs will now be delivering. “The good news is that from today the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine can be delivered by GP practices right across the country.“That means we’ll be able to get more vaccine out to more people more quickly and get everybody who’s vulnerable to this disease the offer of a vaccine by the middle of next month”. Boris Johnson has pledged to vaccinate the four top priority groups - including all over-s, shielders, care home residents and NHS and care staff - by February . There will be  GP-led centres and  hospital sites open by the end of this week, No said, plus seven ‘super’ centres next week. The government is trying to speed up the approval process by which the MHRA regulator has to pass each batch before it goes out. Public Health England is not currently taking ‘routine’ orders of the jab to hospitals on Sundays, but says it can step up and do so at any time.

The witness said: [I saw a] large cat roughly the size of a Labrador. On the road, where the road turns to a national speed limit.

Jax Batty, , who was diagnosed with Chronic Acute Constipation, had the surgery in September at the Sheffield Childrenaposs Hospital. Doctors were left with no choice but to operate after the treatment and medicine they gave him stopped working. He has since been fitted with an ACE stoma, which helps him go to the toilet by pumping medication into his bowels.His mum Mel Batty, , told Grimsby: It was a bit of a shock when we first got told his treatment wasnapost working. Within six weeks he had the surgery, but he handled the shock of it well.He has since had a bit of an issue with his anxiety, but he is being treated for it after the school recommended some people who he could speak to about it. Jax should have been home after a few days, but had a couple of issues which meant he stayed at hospital for a week. Overall, he had to recover for about three months. But now that Jax is back at home, he has gotten used to the stoma. Mel added: Itaposs manageable for him now, he was worried at first, especially about the bag coming loose, but he has some special belts that were made by my sister-in-law that help him keep it in place. He has an irrigation bag which pumps medication into his bowel and helps him go on the toilet. It still takes him about an hour to pass it all each day, but itaposs a lot better than before. Heaposs had issues all of his le with his bowel, so this is a big help to him and much better. Jax is still dealing with some side effects of the operation. Mel said: He hasnapost got his appetite back fully since the operation, as well as his medication being up and down, but he is doing okay. Jax has to eat a really good diet with plenty of fruit and vegetables, as well as drinking lots of fluids because of it. I donapost think a lot of people understand the extent of it, itaposs a lot more than just constipation. Weaposre just hoping this treatment will continue to work.  Since his surgery, Jax has been able to lead an active lestyle, and plays in a football team. His mum said: His first question to his surgeon was whether he could still play football. Thankfully he can! Now that Jax has recovered, he has decided to try to help others in a similar situation. He is raising money for aposA Bear Named Buttonyapos, a charity which provides children undergoing similar surgeries with a bear. Mel said: He loves the bear he was given, it hasnapost left his side since and makes a big impact on all of the kids who get one. He is hoping to raise enough for  bears, which cost £ each, but he has set his GoFundMe target to £. So far he has raised an impressive £. He has done a name card competition with Discoveries, the football team he plays for, raising the money for two bears there. The rest of the money has come from donations. We didnapost know about the bears until Jax got one of his own, and they all come with their own stoma so the kids do not feel alone when they have the surgery.

Mrs Lee, , and her husband, Alan, , a former electrical engineer, had received the call to head to Clitheroe Health Centre only on Tuesday afternoon. Less than  hours later they were celebrating after being given the Pfizer  BioNTech vaccine within a few minutes of each other. A -minute wait inside the building and then they were given the all-clear to go home and await the top-up jab – most likely in about  weeks’ time.How do you think the vaccine rollout effort is going  Share your views in the comments below... The World Health Organization has refused to give its blessing to Britain’s plan to space the two doses of Pfizer’s coronavirus vaccine by more than a month. Officials in the UK have decided to use all available doses of the Pfizer BioNTech jab, which was the first to be approved, to get a single dose to as many people as possible. In the process they will leave people waiting up to  weeks for their second jab. The WHO said governments should be giving people their second dose within  to  days of having the first, to make sure the vaccine works long-term.  But it did not attack Britain’s decision not to do this, admitting the Government had been forced to make a dficult decision because of spiralling infections and deaths in recent weeks. Julia and Alan, who live in nearby Whalley, have spent most of the past year painstakingly trying to avoid coronavirus while all the time childminding their grandson, Daniel, now  months. “Overall, I think we feel a great sense of relief,” said Mr Lee. “They say thatyou’ve had the first vaccination and then get symptoms it won’t be so severe.  “That gives us hope for the future – and I imagine millions of other people will feel the same. It’s a fantastic step forward for all of us”. The Lees were among scores of pensioners and care home staff to be vaccinated in a slick, military-style operation overseen by medics and aided by volunteers from two local Rotary clubs. Bill Honeywell, , a local estate agent and past president of Clitheroe Rotary, was first to brave the sub-zero temperatures, arriving just before am to supervise a handful of other volunteers.  Thirty of these are fellow Rotarians, another  made up of local people who just want to chip in and help. Bill has organised them into shts so that a group of them are always on hand to marshal cars and help guide often frail pensioners in from the cold. “They’re just so grateful to be here,” said Bill. “A lot of them haven’t been out for maybe  months, so it’s a thrill just to be out in the open. “For them to be able to go away smiling after having the jab is a joy to behold. Their relatives are all incredibly relieved and thankful. We’ve had so many tins of biscuits dropped off as thank-yous that we’re going to pile on the pounds!” Despite requests from the health centre simply to arrive on time, a number have been turning up early – “just because they’re from a generation that likes to be punctual”.  They’ve also seen it as an occasion to dress up smartly for the doctor or nurse who administers the jab. “It feels such a privilege to be involved, and we’ll be here for as long as we’re needed. The quicker we can get the vaccine into people’s arms the better”. Wednesday’s operation was geared around the time of the vaccine’s arrival. No one at the health centre was quite sure when that would be, so appointments for the elderly had only been set from pm.  The two precious boxes containing the vials were dropped off by courier at .am. Their arrival triggered a chain reaction throughout the health centre. Dr Russell Robb, clinical director of the Ribblesdale Primary Care Network, was standing by to receive the vaccine. He signed for the packages before quickly carrying them to a fridge in the preparation room. Elsewhere in the health centre receptionists and admin staff began a flurry of calls to bring in more recipients. The first to be booked in were staff at local care homes who had already been put on standby.  And because the vaccine had arrived relatively early, staff were able to book in yet more pensioners for appointments starting at around am. In the preparation room, Dr Robb set about the delicate process of getting the vials ready for the vaccinations. Conventionally there are five vaccinations for each vial. But Clitheroe’s practitioners have picked up on the experience of others to raise that figure to six. Which means more people being vaccinated in a single day. The increase from five to six means that the health centre’s medics can administer , doses in a day rather than . And a busier sht for the staff on reception. They all know they have a total of three-and-a-half days to use this latest delivery.  Dr Robb’s sons, Fred, nine, and Arthur, five, have got used to his - hour weeks during the darkest days of the pandemic. But while they tell their friends that “Dad’s going out to solve Covid”, the reality is that he went on a specialist course on how to prepare and then to administer the vaccine. Those turning up to be vaccinated also come from satellite health centres in Whalley and Slaidburn.  Dr Robb, a one-time lieutenant in the Territorial Army, said: “I just feel very fortunate to be in a position where I can help this community. The faster we can get back to some kind of normality the faster we can tackle other issues we’ve not had time for”. He added: “There’s a real energy here to try to make sure we use the vaccine in a timely manner – a real go-get attitude. “I’m hoping that all our patients from  and older will have had a first vaccination by the end of May. It will be sooner than thatwe can get supplies.”  Dr Robb’s team have drawn up a reserve list of front-line staff to get the vaccine rather than see any of it going to waste. These include local teachers, firefighters, police, ambulance crews, dentists and clinical pharmacists. On Saturday he is planning to have every care home resident in the catchment area – just under  of them given a vaccination he hopes will prolong their lives. Anita Sorrell, , an activities coordinator at the local Abbeyfield House care home in Low Moor, Clitheroe, was among the first to be vaccinated on Wednesday. “I didn’t feel a thing,” she said as she waited the required  minutes to check for any adverse effect. “I feel very privileged to be able to have it. I’d only just got to work this morning when the health centre rang. It’s reassuring to me, but also to the residents. It gives them so much hope – especially now there’s another lockdown to get through”. Outside, Tony Perry, , had just helped a woman of  towards the temporary entrance at the back of the health centre.

Hull City Council said the second Tier  Local Restrictions Grant instalment worth £ and a Additional Restriction Grant worth £, would be paid this week to those eligible. “I have still got rents to pay, gas, electric, water, phone bills and alarm monitoring. It doesn’t add up when I have got £,” she said.  “Financially, I cannot afford to heat the pub or the flat.

A mass inoculation of the Oxford AstraZeneca Covid- vaccine began today as hospitals across the country face rising numbers of seriously ill patients. The vaccines are being delivered to sites all over the UK after the Government committed to offering the vaccine to more than  million people in the top four priority groups by mid-February. It comes as NHS trusts in London are on the verge of being overwhelmed, according to leaked health service documents, while other trusts are rapidly turning normal wards into intensive care units . There have also been reports that dozens of people have failed to turn up for their jab slots for the Pfizer vaccine. In Brighton, pictures this morning showed large queues as lines of people waited to get access to the new jab, seen as a aposgame-changerapos in the fight against the disease and offering ato normality.Harold Millington, , of Chaddesden, Derby, became the first person to be vaccinated at Derby Arena as people came in their droves to get inoculated.Recent figures showed that there were , people in UK hospitals with coronavirus, much higher than the April  peak of ,.Rupert Pearse, professor of intensive care medicine and a consultant at the Royal London, said his own ICU staff were having to care for far more sick patients as he urged the public to heed the aposstay at homeapos lockdown message.

He said: Right now we are diluting down to onenurse to threeand filling those gaps with untrained staff and in some instances doctors helping nurses deliver their care... and weaposre even facing diluting that further to one in four. As intensive care doctors, weaposre not sure how we can together deliver the quality of care that we need to.  Speaking on behalf of the Intensive Care Society, he said the problems were not just in London, but in other hospitals across the UK, and were not limited to ICU wards. He added: We are really very concerned now about the seriousness of the situation... which is definitely worse than the first wave and proving much harder to deal with now as the resources we had in the first wave arenapost available to us. So weaposre really struggling to provide the quality of patient care that we think patients deserve. And the impact of the pandemic is taking care away from other illnesses such as cancer and heart disease. In essence, the healthcare available to all of us is not as good as it should be right now. Prof Pearse said that unless people take the lockdown seriously the impact on healthcare across the country could be catastrophic. It comes amid reports that despite efforts to roll out the Pfizer medicine,  people aged over  have missed their scheduled vaccination appointment at a single surgery in Kent. A spokesperson said that fortunately other patients took their place and none of the vaccine was wasted. According to a Zoom presentation seen by the Health Service Journal , hospital capacity in London will not be enough for the expected rise in patients in the coming weeks. NHS England Londonaposs region medical director Vin Diwakar set out stark predictions to the medical directors of the capitalaposs hospital trusts on a call, the HSJ reported.  The data showed eventhe number of Covid patients grows at the lowest rate considered likely, and measures to manage demand and increase capacity, including opening the capitalaposs Nightingale hospital, are successful, the NHS in London will be short of nearly , general and acuteand intensive care beds by January . The first community vaccinations against coronavirus with the Oxford AstraZeneca jab are taking place in GP surgeries today and about , sites are expected to be delivering vaccines by the end of the week. The Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine is said to be easy to administer as it can be stored at normal fridge temperatures, unlike the Pfizer jab which requires storage at minus C. Seven mass-vaccination centres will also open next week in London, Newcastle, Manchester, Birmingham, Bristol, Surrey and Stevenage.

The Department of Health confirmed to The Mirror that two cases of the iant have been found so far - and there is no evidence that tests used in the UK are unable to identy it. However an update is set to be published later this week.Earlier this week scientists questioned whether tests carried out in the UK would detect the South African strain.It comes more than two weeks after the Health Secretary announced that the two cases of the highly transmissible strain had been found in the UK. One case was in London, the other in North West England. NHS England said in a statement: Two cases of the iant have been confirmed in the UK, whole genome sequencing is ongoing and an update on confirmed cases of the SA iant will be published later this week.Askedall tests carried out in the UK are able to identy the strain, a spokesman said: There is no evidence so far that PCR or LFD tests are unable to detect this strain. And he said scientists do not have an estimate for the number of cases currently in the UK, stating: No other exported cases from South Africa have been reported, but global sequencing coverage is limited. Further analysis is being undertaken. He added: There is so far no evidence that the new iant causes more severe illness or increased risk of mortality. Research is ongoing to confirm this. Neither of the two confirmed cases were admitted to hospital.  On Monday Mr Hancock told the BBC: “I’m incredibly worried about the South African iant, and that’s why we took the action that we did to restrict all flights from South Africa. “This is a very, very signicant problem […] and it’s even more of a problem than the UK new iant.” Paul Hunter, a professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia, said the UK is facing too many iables and is very far from out of the woods following the announcement of new, more infectious iants of the disease.Any hopes that the country couldto normal by spring are nothing short of a pipe dream, he said after Boris Johnson announced Englandaposs third national lockdown as a new iant - the UK iant - rages out of control.Professor Hunter said question marks still linger over the efficacy of coronavirus vaccines and a second iant - one detected in South Africa, where scientists fear that iant might prove to be more resistant to current jabs.South African Health Minister Zweli Mkhize said medics believe the iant - first announced on December  - has been having a more profound impact on young people - but this has yet to be proven.

Anyone who hopes to call Buckingham Palace, Sandringham or Windsor Castle their office faces a tough job interview process so the royal family family can ensure their staff are discreet and excellent at what they do. When it comes to hiring a new cleaner, the recruitment team have a strange test to spot the special cleaners amid the good ones. According to Tracey Waterman, the head of recruitment, the team put the secret challenge to all interviewees to see how they react. She explains that she will place a dead fly on the fireplace or carpet of the room to seethey notice it - and what they dothey spot it. Speaking during Channel aposs documentary Sandringham: The Royals at Christmas, she said: The dference between housekeeper in a five-star hotel and in a royal Palace would be attention to detail. One of the tests I like to do, to seea candidate has potential eye for detail, is to place a dead fly, either in the fireplace or on the carpet. Once the dead fly is placed, I then bring the candidate into the room. I lead them into the room quite slowly, just giving them a chance to glance at the room, have a little look at what we’ve got inside the room.  Bringing them to the fireplace, maybe highlighting that we’ve got a beautul fireplace. At this point I’d expect them to see the dead fly, and hopefully pick it up. But itaposs not just about spotting the fly, itaposs what they dothey do notice it. She adds: It’s a great test, maybe out of  people half the candidates will notice the fly. One out of ten will actually bend down and pick it up, that’s the special housekeeper. So there you have it - how to impress at a royal job interview. The Queen last hired a new apprentice cleaner in October, offering a salary of £,. And the aposhousekeeping assistantapos role came with another very exciting benefit - the chance to live at the palace. The job came with live-in accommodation and all meals provided, as well as expenses for travel. The job description read: It’s working as a team to achieve exceptional results.

Warnings for snow and ice likely to cause slippery surfaces and travel disruption until midnight on Wednesday are in place for Scotland, and for Northern Ireland the same warning is in place until am on Thursday morning. From Thursday afternoon until Friday morning, a yellow warning for ice covers the north and the entire east and west coasts of England and Wales, with only a small portion of central southern areas free from warnings. The Environment Agency has also issued four flood warnings for areas where flooding is likely, on the Isle of Sheppey, Kings Lynn, Peterborough, and by the River Derwent in North Yorkshire. Some  alerts, for areas where flooding is possible, are also scattered across England. There were no high water warnings in place for Scotland, Wales, or Northern Ireland on Wednesday night. Snowfall is expected in the northern half of Scotland on Thursday, with -cm depth covering lowland areas, and up to cm expected to fall in areas higher than m above sea level.  Met Office meteorologist Clare Nasir said this wintry weather will be brought on by a bank of rain which readily turns to snow moving from Scotland and Northern Ireland in the early hours of Thursday, to England and Wales as the day progresses. Freezing temperatures ranging from C in London to -C in the valleys in Wales are predicted overnight, picking up to between -C for most places in the UK in the daytime. Ms Nasir said: Watch out for some freezing fog patchesthe risk of ice first thing. However, through the morning, we will see some brighter skies for southern parts of England and Wales.  Ambulance services have urged people to plan their journeys ahead of setting off and to wrap up warm to ease pressures on emergency services. The risk of icy weather and wintry showers is set to persist through Friday, with cloudier and milder weather moving in from the north and patches of sun across the country. A yellow weather warning for snow is in place for north-east Scotland from midnight on Thursday until midday on Friday, and an ice warning covers Wales and much of England with the exception of some central and southern areas until am on Friday. Today: Early rain, sleet and snow over Scotland and Northern Ireland moving into northern England and North Wales, brighter weather and wintry showers following. Elsewhere, mostly dry but early freezing fog patches slow to clear. Feeling cold. Tonight: Outbreaks of rain, sleet and snow and icy patches affecting parts of England and Wales. Southeastern England mainly dry whilst snow showers catch parts of Northern Ireland and northern Scotland.

Former health worker Beryl Clark had her first dose of the Pfizer jab on December  at the Sale Le Centre and was booked to have her second on January . But the second appointment has been cancelled and postponed - and she is yet to be given a new date, the Manchester Evening News reports. Ms Clark says this is despite medics drumming into her how important it was to get it within three weeks. She says she feels worried and had the first dose under  impressions. And she is one of many left confused at the change. One social media user tweeted: Just found out that my mum got the vaccine and had her appointment for  days after for the second, as has been tested, but the government has cancelled those appointments and is making her get it  weeks after her initial one, which could be completely ineffective  Another said: My parents would love their second shot of the Pfizer vaccine but government decided their pre-arranged appointment should be cancelled. Has your vaccine appointment been cancelled  Let us know in the comments below One said: Had my appointment for the nd dose of the Pfizer vaccine cancelled today. Canapost decideI am happy more people will receive the st dose more quickly or concerned that the vaccination programme is no longer following the trialled regime. A GP tweeted: Can I ask Matt Hancock to come and do a sht on our phones, ringing our -plus patients to explain that their second dose of vaccine has been cancelled  Our PCN needs to cancel , appointments and rebook another ,. At five minutes per phone call, thataposs  hours work. Not to mention the grief and anger. The four UK Chief Medical Officers have determined that prioritising the first doses of vaccine for as many people as possible on the priority list will protect the greatest number of at risk people overall in the shortest possible time and will have the greatest impact on reducing mortality, severe disease and hospitalisations and in protecting the NHS and equivalent health services. Second doses of either vaccine will now take place within  weeks rather than the  days that was initially planned with the Pfizer BioNTech jab, following a change in guidance which aims to accelerate immunisation. Professor Jonathan Van-Tam said administering the second dose of the vaccine  weeks after the first instead of the original three will save lives. Ms Clark received a text on Monday morning telling her the appointment on the th would no longer be going ahead. The text read: “Following updated NHS guidance to prioritise the first dose of the vaccine, your second dose on January  has been postponed. “You will contacted to rebook your second appoint in due course. Please avoid calling about this as we don’t have availability for the second vaccine. “Your first dose still offers considerable protection.” Beryl hasn’t been given a new date for her second dose.  She said: “I’m not very happy. When I went for my first dose they were drumming it into you how important it was to come back for your second dose within three weeks. “I gave permission for my first dose on the understanding that I would receive my second dose in three weeks. “I had that first dose under  impressions, they’ve broken that contract. Now, they’ve given me no date, nothing at all. “You’ve got the government telling you it’s okay, but when you’re watching the TV and reading the paper, and Pfizer themselves say it needs to be done in three weeks. “I’m stuck there wondering what is happening and nobody knows.” Beryl used to work for Manchester council and Salford town hall’s health team, originally supporting the work of mobile health clinics during the role out of the polio vaccine. She said she is concerned about the potential effect of increasing the time between doses. Beryl added: “In all probability it will be fine, or it could lose all its power and result in a lot of people with just one injection. “Will it continue to give you protection ”  Beryl said those who had second doses booked in should have their appointments honoured. She said: “For those who agreed to having them three weeks apart, they should given that second injection. “For those who weren’t booked in, make sure they have the facts in front of them and they can make that decision for themselves. “It makes you worried. I’m not one for panicking, but I am concerned. I do feel rather let down. “I blew up when I saw [the text], I was so angry. I know how important it is to get vaccinations out there. “We older people stay calm about things, but it doesn’t do you any good when you’re sat here isolated, worrying about it. I think there will be a lot of people worried and concerned with nobody medical to talk to about it and reassure people. It just hangs over you, it’s not right.”  Beryl’s daughter Yvette said: “It’s knocked her confidence and taken that glimpse of hope away from her. She was feel a bit invincible, then all of a sudden that’s changed. No, she’s frightened.” In a letter to all NHS trusts in England, the NHS’s chief executive, CCO and medical director said: “The aim, of course, is to vaccinate at-risk groups as fast as supply makes possible. The four UK Chief Medical Officers have determined that ‘prioritising the first doses of vaccine for as many people as possible on the priority list will protect the greatest number of at risk people overall in the shortest possible time and will have the greatest impact on reducing mortality, severe disease and hospitalisations and in protecting the NHS and equivalent health services.’ “They recognise that this will mean we need to reschedule second doses for most of our current first dose recipients, but for the reasons set out today, doing so should substantially improve inidual and population-level protection against Covid- over the next three months.”  A spokesperson for the NHS said: “The MHRA, JCVI and UK Chief Medical Officers have updated the second dose timing guidance which the NHS has to follow, and which will increase the number of vulnerable people protected against COVID over the next three months, potentially saving thousands of lives.” It comes as red-faced Matt Hancock visited a GP surgery today to hail the Oxford vaccine rollout - but its delivery of jabs hadn’t arrived yet. Dr Ammara Hughes, a GP at the Bloombsury Surgery in London visited by Matt Hancock, told reporters: We were expecting our first AstraZeneca  today, but weaposve had a pushback for  hours so weaposre now getting that delivery tomorrow."},{"url":null,"title":"america more divided ever thanks","story":"NewsopinionAmerica is more ided than ever thanks to Donald Trumps tsunami of untruthsThe Mirrors US correspondent Christopher Bucktin says the country is filled with more hate, death and destruction that has left it unrecognisable to the one he arrived in eight years agomirrorShareCommentsByChristopher BucktinUnited States Editor:,  NOV Updated:,  NOV NewsopinionDonald Trump delivering his inaugural address in  \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Yet almost four years on, the country is filled with more hate, death and destruction that has left it unrecognisable to the one I arrived in almost eight years ago. Amid of backdrop of Trump’s Tsunami of untruths, I’ve born witness to some of the most shameful events ever to take place in a supposed civilised society. They say journalism is the first rough draft of history, but only time will tell what will be taught in US high schools in  years time. Whether it will be America’s biggest ever mass shooting in Las Vegas, travelling to see a US leader toady up to murderous dictators, immigrant children being held in cages while separated from their parents, withdrawing from the fight against climate change or emboldening the rise of the deadly far-right, the list is endless. The writing was on the White House walls no sooner had Trump, and First Lady Melania moved in. Ever since, amid made-up crowd sizes, an obsession with Barack Obama, and “alternative facts,” the Trump presidency has been a factory of hoods from the get-go. It has churned out distortions, deceptions, conspiracy theories and brazen lies at a production-line pace that has fuelled an industry of fact-checkers. The firing of former FBI director James Comey was more signicant than most could have thought. During a dinner with his new boss, he was asked by Trump whether he would pledge loyalty to him.  Comey avoided making such a promise explaining his role was to serve the American people. Months later, he was fired without being told. Above all, it illustrated Trump’s disregard for the rule of law that has since seen him turn the US Department of Justice into his own legal firm. To then see Trump in July  side with Vladimir Putin against the FBI contradicting his own US intelligence agencies who said there had been Russian interference in the  election, was jaw-dropping. If allies like the UK had not been put on notice before the Helsinki summit over where the US leader’s feelings lay at that point they did. He single handily shattered America’s global image. Only the month before I had travelled to Singapore to see Trump meet with North Korean despot Kim Jong Un on the hope of striking a deal to de-escalate the rogue nation’s proleration of nuclear weapons. What followed was an abject failure on the Trump administration’s part, yet the President still crowed about how he “fell in love” with the murderous dictator. If the problems were not bad enough on a world stage, domestically they were worse. Shortly his inauguration, the simmering rise of the white nationalism emboldened under his leadership boiled over.  During a ‘Unite the Right Rally’ in August  members of the alt-right, neo-Confederates, neo-fascists, white nationalists, neo-Nazis, the KKK and ious right-wing militias marched on Charlottesville, Virginia. The event quickly turned violent when Hitler-loving James Field ran over  counter-protestors killing Heather Heyer. As the country became a tinder box of racial ide, Trump initially refused to comment, but I watched in New York as he then said there were “very fine people on both sides”. It was the first of many instances of his apparent support for the far-right that, along with the radical left, has seen many of America’s cities more recently go up in flames. The fact that now no one blinks an eye when the leader of the free is called a “racist”, should be of enormous concern to us all.  It was never more apparent in the wake of George Floyd’s death in May this year - killed after white cop Derek Chauvin knelt on his neck for almost nine minutes. As I stood watching the city of Minneapolis looted and torched, it was a time for the President to show leadership - to bring together a country that was clearly hurt and in turmoil. Instead, Trump added fuel to the already burning fire pitting Black Lives Matter protestors against police and more shamefully white nationalist groups. Yet despite high-profile incidents of police violence against Black Americans in recent months, including the killing of Floyd and the shooting of Jacob Blake sparking nationwide protests, renewed calls for the removal of Confederate symbols and public condemnations of systemic racism from lawmakers, corporations, sports leagues and others, recent research shows adult white America feels largely unmoved.  Americans are sceptical the current moment of racial reckoning will lead to major changes in the States, according to a new Pew Research Centre survey. They found: “The public is about evenly split on whether the increased focus on issues of race and racial inequality in the country in the past three months will lead to major policy changes to address racial inequality - % say it will and % say it will not. “A sizable sharesay this will not lead to changes that will improve the lives of Black people. And while a majority say the heightened attention to racial issues represents a change in the way most Americans think about these issues, just % say this represents a major change.” They found overall, % of U.S. adults now say the country hasn’t gone far enough when it comes to Black people having equal rights with White people but “White Americans are virtually unchanged”.  But it’s not just races that Trump, who became only the third president ever to be impeached, ides, its gender too. We should have all known. While campaigning for the White House, he was heard on tape saying of women it was perfectly acceptable to “Grab ‘em by the p****. You can do anything.” Yet still, America’s females voted for him in their millions. He has repeatedly, even during this campaign, belittled women none more so than the two dozen who have accused him of sexual impropriety and even rape. In response to writer E. Jean Carroll’s claim, he sexually assaulted her in a dressing room at a Manhattan department store in the mid-s he simply replied: “She’s not my type”.  Yet despite the accusations, the evangelicals of America still embrace him as he claims to be a good Christian - “a man of God” - using the Bible as a prop for any photo opportunity. Even after his alleged  marital affair with adult film star Stormy Daniels came to light paying her off to keep her silent, that was ok with the church because he was now a “changed person”. If it were left to Trump, the Bible would no doubt read: “Let he who has bedded a porn star just after the birth of his fth child with his third we cast the first stone.” He also pushed for transgender servicemen and women - who unlike his dodge of the Vietnam draft were prepared to put their lives on the line for American freedoms, to be banned from the military. It’s challenging to know which of Trump’s policies have been for the greater good. There is no doubt he had continued to build on the economy inherited from Barack Obama and almost wiped ISIS from the earth. Still, his recent handling of the pandemic will go down as one of the worst disasters in US history.

The picture tweeted by New York Post reporter Steven Nelson shows the man posing with a fur hat and a painted face after Republican protesters managed to swarm the historic building. QAnon is a baseless conspiracy theory that President Trump is secretly fighting a cabal of child-sex predators that includes prominent Democrats, Hollywood elites and “deep state” allies. It comes as the US Capitol was put on lockdown after protesters swarmed the historic building during a House of Congress vote confirming President-elect Joe Bidenaposs electoral win.  Violent scenes are unfolding in the heart of Washington DC in what has been described as close to a coup attempt this country has ever seen. Senators are being evacuated from the building, the meeting place of the United States Congress, after politicians were forced to shelter in their offices with police outside overwhelmed by hundreds of rioters.  Today the the US Congress and Senate were confirming the Electoral College votes from the  presidential election, won by Biden.The breach has forced a delay in the constitutional process to affirm Bidenaposs victory in the November election, after Trump urged his supporters to travel to Washington to protest over Congressapos formal approval of the win. Huff Post reporter Igor Bobic tweeted several dozen protesters are roaming through the halls, yelling, Where are they  Some were also in the visitorsapos galleries. He wrote: They’re in the chamber. One is up on the dais yelling aposTrump won that election!apos This is insane. CNN is reporting a woman is in a critical condition after being shot in the chest during skirmishes between police and Trump supporters. While US House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy has told reporters he heard on a police officeraposs radio that shots were fired about  or  minutes ago. Mr Biden condemned the violence as he took to Twitter to say it could amount to sedition. Let me be very clear: the scenes of chaos at the Capitol do not represent who we are. What we are seeing is a small number of extremists dedicated to lawlessness. This is not dissent, itaposs disorder. It borders on sedition, and it must end. Now.

The success was overshadowed events in Washington D.C, however, as pro-Trump rioters stormed the US Capitol as the outcome of last Novemberaposs election was being confirmed. Democratic challenger Rev Raphael Warnock won a hotly contested run-off race, defeating Republican incumbent Kelly Loeffler, who took a page from Donald Trumpaposs playbook and refused to concede. Warnock, a -year-old Baptist preacher, is the first black US senator in Georgiaaposs history as the results signalled a sht in politics and the wider deep south. In the run-off for the stateaposs other seat, Democratic challenger Jon Ossoff, a -year-old documentary filmmaker, overcame Republican incumbent David Perdue by a wafer-thin margin.It was a crushing final defeat for Trump, the one-term president who has just two weeks left in office. No Democrat had won a US Senate race in Georgia for  years. Whataposs in store for America with Joe Biden as president  Join the conversation in the comments section below.Ossoffaposs lead was as slim as . per cent as ballots continued to be counted on Wednesday morning after the critical elections drew a record . million voters. Victory would make him the Senateaposs youngest member. Trump stands to be the first president since  to lose the White House and both chambers of Congress in a single term. The confirmation of the second seat being flipped to the Democrats came as a joint session of Congress was suspended in Washington and forced into recess as protesters fought their way past police, shouting and waving pro-Trump and US flags as they roamed through halls, demanding the election result be overturned.  The invasion sent members of Congress scrambling for cover under their seats and donning gas masks as tear gas was fired. A woman was shot dead inside the US Capitol during the chaos.Mr Trump, who had urged the demonstrators to march on the Congress, later called on them to go home, and had his Twitter account locked for  hours over tweets relating to the riots and baseless electoral fraud claims.Why were the run-offs so signicant  The outcome of the kne-edge elections determine control of the US Senate and President-elect Joe Bidenaposs chances of pushing through his legislative agenda over the next four years.Biden, who defeated Trump in Novemberaposs presidential election, will be sworn in on January .Trump still hasnapost conceded, despite Biden being the clear winner, and is still trying to steal the election with  election fraud claims. There is zero evidence of fraud.Republicans currently control the Senate and would maintain their grip by winning at least one of the Georgia seats. Maintaining control would allow them to block Bidenaposs agenda, a scenario that President Barack Obama faced during his time in the White House. The Republicans would wield veto power over Bidenaposs political and judicial appointees as well as many of his legislative initiatives in areas such as economic relief, climate change, healthcare and criminal justice. The Democrats needed to win both seats in Georgia to take the Senate majority. A Democratic sweep would create a - split in the Senate and give Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, as president of the Senate, the tie-breaking vote after she and Biden take office. The party already has a narrow majority in the House of Representatives, meaning a sweep in Georgiaaposs run-off elections would give them control of Congress.  Run-off elections were held because none of the candidates won % of the vote in November.Gabriel Sterling, a Republican and a top election official in Georgia, told CNN thatthe Democrats won both senate seats the losses would fall squarely on the shoulders of President Trump and his actions since November .Many white suburbanites in Georgia have increasingly abandoned the Republican party under Trump. There was an unprecedented number of black voters for a run-off vote.

Members of his cabinet have begun talks to invoke the th Amendment on the basis he is unfit to serve out his final two weeks - a position that Democrats and many Americans have held throughout his presidency while Republicans protected him and allowed him to remain in power. Ratied after the assassination of John F Kennedy in , the amendment has never been used to strip a sitting presidentaposs powers, but it would be the fastest way to seize control from Trump. Click here for our live blog with the latest updates on the chaos in Washington. Trump, , incited his supporters as they rallied in Washington while lawmakers met to confirm Democratic President-elect Joe Bidenaposs election victory. Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris will be sworn in on January . Trump was blamed when a mob of his deluded fanatics - condemned as terrorists - stormed the the Capitol bulding in Washington in a bid to overturn his election defeat. He was condemned as he sat back and watched it happen, failed to condemn the violence and swtly call for peace, and later told those involved in the insurrection: We love you. Youaposre very special. Four people died during the chaos, including a Trump fanatic who was shot.  It caps four years of Trump iding America by encouraging chaos and violence, courting white supremacists and far-right groups, and spreading misinformation and conspiracy theories. He may have cemented himself this week as the worst US president ever. What is the th Amendment  The th Amendment of the US Constitution - specically, Section  of the amendment - allows a transfer of presidential powers to the vice president, but it does not remove a president from office. This isnapost the first time it has come up during Trumpaposs reign of terror. It would happenthe vice president and a majority of the cabinet determined the president is “unable to discharge the powers and duties” of the office. If a president opposes, Congress can order the transfer of power with a two-thirds vote in both chambers - the Senate and the House of Representatives. The vice president, currently Mike Pence, would then become acting president.Is it going to happen before January   A source told Reuters there have been discussions among some cabinet members and Trump allies about invoking the th Amendment. But a second source familiar with the effort doubted it would go anywhere with Trump having just two more weeks in office. A growing number of Republican leaders and cabinet officials told CNN they believe Trump should be removed from office before January . CNN said four of them called for the th Amendment to be invoked, and two others said the president should be impeached. Some cabinet members are holding preliminary discussions about invoking the th Amendment, a Republican source told CNN.  It remains unclear whether the movement will gather enough support. Why does it exist  The amendment was introduced by federal lawmakers and approved by US states after President John F Kennedy was shot dead in . Before JFK was confirmed dead, there was a debate over who would run the countryhe survived but was unable to carry out his duties. The amendment was ratied in . Has it been used before  The th Amendment has never been used to remove a president from office. It was used to fill two vice-presidential vacancies in the s.Is there another option  In the wake of Wednesdayaposs violence, there have been calls for a second impeachment of Trump. The only way to remove a president from office is an impeachment in the House and a conviction in the Senate. If Trump is impeached and removed, the Senate could vote to disqualy him from ever holding federal office again. An elected Republican official told CNN: He has to be impeached and removed. A former senior official added: How do you keep him in place for two weeks after this Trump was previously impeached but survived a trial in February last year when the Senate acquitted him of obstructing Congress and abusing the power of his office. He was accused of freezing Congress-approved aid to pressure Ukraine to investigate Biden, and impeding the inquiry by blocking witnesses and documents sought by the House of Representatives. Trump would have been removed from office and replaced by Pence had he been convicted of either charge. What happened in Washington  Lawmakers from the House of Representatives, the lower chamber, and Senate, the upper chamber, were meeting at the Capitol to confirm Bidenaposs clear victory over Trump in the November  presidential election. The certication of the final Electoral College vote -  votes for Biden and  for Trump - was the final step before Biden and Harris are sworn in on January . Trump, who has ly claimed that the election was rigged, encouraged his fanatics, including white supremacists and far-right extremists, to march on the Capitol after inciting them for months.  Speaking to thousands of his supporters near the White House shortly before the chaos unfolded, he told them to pressure their elected officials to reject the results and urged them to fight. As lawmakers held a debate before the certication of the fair election result, hundreds of deluded Trump supporters - condemned as terrorists - stormed Americaaposs seat of power in a bid to overturn his election defeat. Police and security have been heavily criticised for failing to stop the insurrection. Four people died.  A Trump fanatic was shot dead and three other people suffered fatal medical emergencies as the mob clashed with police, invaded the floor of the Senate and offices belonging to the likes of House Speaker and Democrat Nancy Pelosi, and raided rooms. This happened as Trump refused to condemn the insurrection and attempt to de-escalate the violence. Later, in a recorded video, he told the protesters We love you, youaposre very special and repeated his lies about the election result, overshadowing his weak request for them to go home. At least  people were arrested. It was the most damaging attack on the iconic building since the British army burned it in , according to the US Capitol Historical Society.

She has travelled and trekked throughout the world but now lives in Argyll amongst the scenery she loves. www.heatheryheightsDuring wintry weather and shorter days it can be tricky fitting in longer walks and time for exploring the outdoors.What is fantastic about Knapdale and Kintyre is that we only have to go a short distance to gain truly spectacular views. The three walks in this edition y from relatively short, using tracks and paths to the lovely viewpoint of Castle Dounie, to challenging, where the terrain is tough underfoot and good route finding skills are required. All three start at Crinan harbour before climbing up through oak and birch woods to gain open vistas with views to Jura, Scarba and Mull. The convoluted ridge walks are rugged and wild, the steep sides sweeping down to the Sound of Jura where tides race and swirl. If you are lucky you may see pods of dolphins or even whales.. At the car park a signboard shows the Crinan Trail. This is the shorter of the routes but all three start and finish together. Leave the car park and turn left. Keeping to the road by the shore you will see a trail marker post ahead leading you briefly along the shore before the path heads into oak woods. After m the path bends sharply left. To the right a faint trail heads west towards the Sailor’s Grave but your route starts its steep muddy ascent to the forestry road above.. On reaching the road turn right, after m you will reach a bench and the first junction to your left. Here you have a choice either come back from the track ahead or to your left. All routes can be undertaken in either direction. I suggest for the longer routes you go straight on and for the Crinan Trail you go left.. For the Crinan Trail follow the waymark posts and arrows. After .km the route turns right onto a path and winds up and down with glimpses of views to come. Turn left at a sign for a viewpoint. This will take you up to the knoll atop which the remains of Castle Dounie, a prehistoric dun, command spectacular views over the sound towards the Gulf of Corryvreckan. There it is said the Cailleach Bheur, a giant witch, once washed her plaid in its whirlpools. Enjoy the vista before ing down to the junction and turn left. The path now meanders down to the forestry road. Turn right and head north round the coast above Adnoe Point and back to your path down to Crinan harbour.. For the longer walks, go straight ahead at the bench . Follow the track for nearly km, which leads you round a couple of hairpin bends and above Adnoe Point, before turning south. Keep your eyes open for the waymark posts and turn left onto a path. Head uphill for m. At the viewpoint sign turn right up to Castle Dounie and enjoy. To your south is the ridge that leads to Creag Mhor.. Immediately after dropping from Castle Dounie you will see a broken down wall on your right. Follow this for a short distance until you can start to work your way up onto the ridge to your right, by a couple of birch trees with coners on the skyline above. The ridge walk is convoluted, airy, rough and summits numerous lumps and bumps with fantastic views. Keep to the crest or east side as the drop-offs to the west are impressive but not to be dallied with. The highest rocky bump of Creag Mhor is parallel to the north end of the rocks offshore.. After  minutes of knobbly and exposed ridge walking #you do not fancy tackling navigation along walls in woods # this is now the time to keep an eye out for an obvious wide firebreakin the trees, below to your left. This leads you at a ° angle straight to a forestry track in the valley below. To check you have the right point look across from the firebreak and you should see a wall continue the line on the other side. Head down the firebreak to the track and turn left. This will take you back to the junction by the bench where you can turn right on the forest road then left todown the path to Crinan harbour.. If you wish to adventure on* and are confident with your route finding then continue south on the ridge # crossing over an old wall not on the map # to where it suddenly drops to a tiny col with forest directly ahead. Ahead is a steep little rise with walls on it. One drops to the right but it is the one going southwest into the forest you need to follow, for the next m. Keeping the wall directly on your right, circumnavigating the odd boulder and ducking the odd branch, you will see that the deer have created quite a path and that the way is often clear. Eventually it drops you very steeply down to a stream with another wall directly ahead. Turn left, southeast, up the stream with the wall on your right # it is boggy # until you reach a quaint waterfall on your left. A small break in the wall to your right allows you to escape the trees that have fallen across the wall higher up. Continue with it on your left across a tree harvested area and up the bump ahead. You will pop out onto a track end.. Follow this short track down to the forest road below. Turn right and almost immediately turn left onto a grassy track that crosses a stream and heads east up into the forest. After m you will come to a sharp left-hand bend. Directly in front of you a wall goes steeply up into the trees. This is your route up to Bealach na Moine. It leads up slippery, mossy rock for m, over a barbed wired fence , up a very rough and eroded track for nearly m, past a spring hidden with fallen trees, then over more pleasant grass and moss to the col. This last section makes you realise why it is worth the effort as views open up east and west. Turn right over a couple of steep little hillocks on the ridge. Suddenly ahead you will see your goal, the trig point and the summit of Cnoc Reamhar, also known as Gallachoille Hill and a Marilyn to boot. It really is a fantastic view.. Toeither descend the way you came or drop down from one of the breaks in the ridge to the north end of the small lochan on the west side of the summit, and follow the faint Landover track north to the spring. Re-join your ascent route, taking care on the way down. Turn rightat the forest road it is now an easy km back to the junction with the bench. Turn right then left after m, following the path back to Crinan harbour.*You can also drop down the firebreak and turn right on the track to join the route up to Cnoc Reamhar,continuing along the ridge does not appeal.The described routes and accompanying information are there to be used as a guide and do not replace the use of map and compass and the skills required to use them.

The sector in Scotland accounts for around  per cent of UK production and is worth about £ million annually.One fth of these exports go to the EU, amounting to more than , tonnes a year.This is clearly a disastrous Brexit outcome for Scottish farmers and like all other aspects of Brexit, foisted on Scotland against its will.A terrible negotiating failure on the part of the Tory government, and a devastating blow to an extremely valuable part of Scotland’s farming industry, I am sure it will not be the first damaging impact to be highlighted once the deal is fully analysed.Alex Orr, EdinburghSir,The report on the Piers and Harbours Asset Management Plan and Fees and Charges –  , submitted to the Argyll and Bute Council Harbour Board meeting of December ,  makes interesting reading.At a time when budgets are tight and councils have had to make hard decisions about where to cut services, it is dficult to understand why the council budget should be used to supplement the funding of dedicated ferry infrastructure for which CMAL should be responsible.The asset management plan allocates £,, for planned marine infrastructure works for the year  , of which only £, , is devoted to multi-use facilities. The remainder, £,,, is mostly allocated to single-use ferry facilities, and a huge proportion of that is to provide overnight parking for CalMac ferriesreaders will have to make up their own minds about the merits of spending £,, for an overnight berth at Fionnphort, and £, on a feasibility study for a breakwater at Lismore.CMAL pay back around half of the £,, to the council through harbour dues for the use of council-owned piers, however, that still leaves a whopping £ million gap in the required funding.If past experience of other CMAL projects is anything to go by, the planned eight per cent increase in council harbour fees and charges up to   is not going to cover it.Fergus Gillanders, KilmelfordSir,Last year, , was challenging and, although many people like to give generously to charity at Christmas time, it may have been dficult to make a donation this festive season.It#s not too late # you can still help support the Royal National Institute of Blind Peopleby collecting and donating used stamps from cards and parcels you may have received.Your stamps will be recycled and turned into vital funds that will help RNIB support children with vision impairment.

These additional consumers will need more food while Scotland’s multial land can also meet, at the same time, the growing demand for a range of goods and services that hits targets on climate change, the environment, renewable energy, bioersity, and the wider and hugely important rural economy.#To move forward urgently, let us identy all the means and mechanisms we can put in place.  Let us have credibility for farmers by investing in bioeconomy, bioenergy, agro-forestry, precision farming, and shorter food chains – support for which is within the Government’s gt.#NFUS has been promoting our industry as one that can change to meet public goods for public money requirements, with an upbeat forward-looking mindset.

There is a belief binary tribalism is ‘the norm’ and the use of social media to promulgate the “yer either for us or agin us” culture is acceptable.

Food and drink is a staple in households across Scotland for Hogmanay, and it is certainly something that can remain the same, even with these uncertain times.A pot of soup to bring in the bells never goes amiss, and youd be forgiven for thinking that a slow-cooked stew is something of legend at this time of year.But while many families would plan to head out for a New Years Day meal, this will not be going ahead this year.Alternatives could include trying out some new recipes at home, and having a New Years meal at home. Bake some goodies to bring in the bells with, such as traditional Scots tablet or shortbread.Zoom have lted their -minute time limit across the New Year period, so set the camera at the bottom of your table and invite however many guests youd like!First footingA tradition throughout Scotland on Hogmanay, the normal act of first footing will certainly be missed this year, but there may be a way to salvage it.Traditionally, first footing involves the first person who enters the house after midnight bringing gts. It has been adapted through the years, and some now visit neighbours with a tipple and a song before moving on to the next house.While were not allowed in other peoples houses this year, we can certainly adapt the tradition.Ask one of your household to draw the short straw and brave the cold just after midnight and emulate a first footing with your immediate bubble. Or, have a virtual first footing, and make sure to call your loved ones and wish them a Happy New Year.TelevisionAs always, there will be a raft of content available to watch on TV on Hogmanay. Therersquoll likely be old favourites including the likes of Still Game.As ever, there will be several Hogmanay specials to help us bring in the bells from the comfort of our own home. Over on BBC One, Susan Calman will be getting ready for Hogmanay  with ldquoa studio of stars.Live eventsThe events that Scotlandrsquos festive season is famed for wonrsquot be going ahead in person this year.

In the Clyde, however, the Board of Trade did not insist on this in respect of vessels trading exclusively within what is known as the smooth water area.This area was within an imaginary line drawn from Skipness Point to Fairlie. On the date in question, the accused conveyed a cargo from Glasgow to Tobermory via the Crinan Canal.As soon as he had left Crinan, he was in contravention of the regulations, having entered the more hazardous waters off the west coast.On behalf of the accused, an agent stated that he had traded with the Bloodhound for nearly  years. During the war, the ship had been requisitioned by the Ministry of Shipping, and under the orders of that department had been sent outside the limits of the smooth water area.The accused had naturally thought that what he had been doing during the war, when he traded to ports on Islay and the Ayrshire coast, he was free to do now.Sherf Macmaster Campbell imposed a penalty of £."},{"url":null,"title":"leader january 1 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

In the Bible, more than  times He says: #Do not be afraid# or phrases that mean this. Let us take this truth into the New Year with us.Let us all pray that soon we can say we are not afraid and what a dferent year  is.#Away, then all fears.

Food and drink is a staple in households across Scotland for Hogmanay, and it is certainly something that can remain the same, even with these uncertain times.A pot of soup to bring in the bells never goes a miss, and youd be forgiven for thinking that a slow-cooked stew is something of legend at this time of year.But while many families would plan to head out for a New Years Day meal, this will not be going ahead this year.Alternatives could include trying out some new recipes at home, and having a New Years meal at home. Bake some goodies to bring in the bells with, such as traditional Scots tablet or shortbread.Zoom have lted their -minute time limit across the New Year period, so set the camera at the bottom of your table and invite however many guests youd like!A tradition throughout Scotland on Hogmanay, the normal act of first footing will certainly be missed this year, but there may be a way to salvage it.Traditionally, first footing involves the first person who enters the house after midnight bringing gts. It has been adapted through the years, and some now visit neighbours with a tipple and a song before moving on to the next house.While were not allowed in other peoples houses this year, we can certainly adapt the tradition.Ask one of your household to draw the short straw and brave the cold just after midnight and emulate a first footing with your immediate bubble. Or, have a virtual first footing, and make sure to call your loved ones and wish them a Happy New Year.As always, there will be a raft of content available to watch on TV on Hogmanay.

There was heavy traffic and, needless to say, Irsquod never driven a bus before and hadnrsquot expected to at this moment either.ldquoYou mean drive the bus  I foolishly asked.ldquoThatrsquos why you are here, isnrsquot it  he replied.I was on the bus with two other learners, as well as the instructor. We had been given some rudimentary instructions by him as hersquod driven the bus into the busy city centre, but I hadnrsquot realised we would actually have to drive the bus through busy streets.That was the first time I had driven a bus. It was, of course, an assessment of my capabilities. I negotiated as best I could and quickly learned what a tail swing was, as I nearly shaved off the nose of a woman who was standing on the edge of a pavement waiting to cross the road!The gearstick felt like it had been cemented to the vehicle, making changing gears a Herculean effort, with the engine roaring as I struggled to crunch it into gear. I drove slowly and cars began honking their horns in frustration.There was a big L on the rear of the bus, but I think when people see a bus in the city centre they assume the person driving actually knows how to drive a bus!It was a stressful  minutes and, when I finally pulled over, the instructor looked at his notes shaking his head. I cannot repeat what he said, but it was a generally negative assessment with lots of adjectives.Yet I wasnrsquot written off and was told I needed six full days of lessons as a minimum before sitting my test. Against everyonersquos expectations, including mine, I passed first time.I had done it and realised one of my lersquos dreams.There was a specic reason I needed a bus driving licence: I wanted to be a driver guide and take people around Scotland on tour. My le had undergone some dramatic changes and my le ambitions had changed as a result.It wasnrsquot, of course, about money or climbing a career ladder, but about the hopeful expectation it would make me rich in experiences and give me a new angle on le.My head and heart were full of Scotlandrsquos stories, and this seemed a perfect way to use my love of history and folklore, and share my passion for the landscape that held so many personal memories for me. I felt my le was about to be transformed and indeed it was.So that day I passed my bus driving test was a day of utter joy. Although over  years ago now, I can still feel the elation.I worked for dferent tour companies at dferent times in my le over the following  years. It was something I couldto whenever I needed it. During the last period of my time as a driver guide, a transport manager called Ronnie worked miracles as he juggled my rota to fit round my very complicated childcare arrangements. I will be forever grateful to him for his understanding.Were my expectations of the job realised or did I have an over-romanticised image of it  Irsquod say a bit of both. I tried my best to showcase Scotland, but I quickly understood people travel for dferent reasons with dferent interests.But it opened a window on the world for me. I met so many people from dferent walks of le and dferent countries and cultures. It taught me so much about the way humans behave towards each other and how we handle and respond to experiences in dfering ways.We were all on mini le journeys together, usually three days, sometimes five. In this brief fleck of time, a small group of people would be together amidst the splendour, and sometimes challenging conditions, of Scotland. When connections were made, it was because of shared values, regardless of cultural dferences.I began to see the tours as a metaphor for the way we live our lives, not just in observing others but myself as well. I had never thought the job would be a lesson on the philosophy of le, but that is partly what it became for me.It revealed to me that happiness, enjoyment and appreciation is a default within us, not something to be found, bought or acquired, or even weather dependent!That now seems so obvious but it took years for me to truly understand how we can become so easily trapped in the hedonic treadmill. I know thatrsquos a fancy term, but its meaning is simple: that as we go through le, we quickly take things for granted and so seek new and higher levels of satisfaction which we believe will give us happiness. While we can get a rush of pleasure and satisfaction in new things or experiences, we soon then take those for granted as well. So the cycle continues. We become like dogs chasing our tails in pursuit of what we think will make us happy or give us a more fulfilled le.The tours taught me that appreciation is the key to this. You donrsquot have to be a tour guide to learn this lesson, of course, as we all have our lersquos experiences that teach us. But that treadmill is so easy to fall into, even when you know it offers a  dawn. It can take a conscious effort to climb out of it.That is when we need what is called a hedonic reset: another fancy term for stopping that chase of our tail and taking time to appreciate what we have. This can be done by temporarily depriving ourselves of things we take for granted and so regaining our appreciation of them.A simple example could be when we go camping. I love it, but when I get home I appreciate my bed, my shower and central heating in ways I didnrsquot before we left on our camping trip!The virus has forced a reset on all of us it has taken away many things we took for granted: travel, staying with friends, family meals, a coffee and blether with a friend, hugging loved ones, being with loved ones, browsing in a bookshop. We will all have our list.It has been heartbreaking, with devastating consequences for so many peoplersquos livelihoods and emotional wellbeing, as well as a tragic loss of le.Itrsquos an unwanted, brutal and forced reset, but the le lesson I learnt on the tours has helped me understand that appreciation is the key to resilience and getting through this as best as we can.When times relax, as they hopefully will soon, I know how much I will appreciate hugging my daughter I havenrsquot been able to hug for  months, being able to tell stories to a live audience and have a coffee with a friend in a real cafe. And travel to the places I love within my own country.Perhapsthere is any positive out of this, I hope it will be that I will never again fall into that treadmill of taking things I have for granted.So I say Happy New Year to you, and I mean it in a heartfelt way I never meant before."},{"url":null,"title":"vet-column-consider-welcoming-new-pet","story":"ONCE your new puppy or kitten has settled into your household, there are several things to consider, ensuring your new pet is kept fit and healthy.Register with your veterinary surgeon. This gives immediate reassurancea problem does arise with your pet.At Dunedin Vets, we offer free puppy and kitten checks and for all new pets as soon as you acquire them this may be carried out by telephone during these Covid- times. Lots of advice is given by vets, qualied veterinary nurses and reception staff.Everyone is thinking about vaccination against coronavirus for humans just now. Vaccination has been the major controller of lethal diseases since the process was developed by Edward Jenner centuries ago.We must vaccinate our pets to prevent several fatal conditions. Pups can be vaccinated from six weeks of age. However, vaccinating at  and  weeks of age is the new normal during this Covid- pandemic, when most vaccinations are given.Pups should be kept isolated until two weeks after the first vaccination, then limited contact with other dogs until after the second vaccine. Boosters are given annually against parvovirus, distemper, hepatitis leptospirosis and kennel cough.It is advisable to vaccinate your kitten against cat flu, feline enteritis and feline leukaemia. Two vaccines are usually given three weeks apart from nine weeks of age. Kittens should be kept isolated until one week after the second vaccine. Boosters are given annually against cat flu, feline enteritis and feline leukaemia.Rabbits can be vaccinated against myxomatosis and rabbit haemorrhagic disease , of which there are two strains. One vaccine against the two agents can be given from six weeks of age. Boosters are given annually.Everyone loves a new puppy or kitten, but please be aware of unscrupulous dealers who take advantage of the kind and loving nature of the majority of people.Recently, Kimberly Mackie visited Dunedin Vetsrsquo Tranent surgery with her new puppy Poppy. Poppy is a Jack Russell cross Chihuahua, so is a very small pup. However, Poppy arrived with diarrhoea and very dehydrated, weighing only a few hundred grams.Poppy was examined by vet Chris Monk, who immediately saw how ill little Poppy was.Mum had bought her in all good faith from a family home. It was soon discovered that Poppy had been microchipped and had a vaccination in Eire. Poppy was an import from Eire, a victim of the illegal puppy farming trade.It is so dficult for new owners to know the origin of their pup, especially when the sellers can seem so plausible. Ask to see the parents or at least the mother and other pups in the litter, although they find many ways to circumvent these questions. It is also so dficult toa puppy or kitten once you have cuddled them and instantly fallen in love.The good news is that Poppy, after fluid therapy and medications, and lots of loving care from Dunedin Vets staff and, of course, his forever mum, has made a full recovery and is developing her own special character.We must also consider other preventable conditions which our pets may be susceptible to.Most puppies and kittens are born with a roundworm infestation. Worms are passed to them before birth by their mothers and through motherrsquos milk. This is obviously not very pleasant and potentially these worms pose a risk for humans, especially children.Tapeworms are rarely a problem in puppies and kittens, although one type is actually transmitted by fleas.We recommend worming puppies and kittens at eight,  and  weeks of age with a quality wormer in tablet or liquid form, which will kill most worms.Remember, there may be no obvious signs of worm infestation.Worming should be carried out every three months for the rest of your petrsquos le.Many puppies and kittens arrive at their new home with a population of external parasites. These include fleas and mites.Fleas are passed from one animal to another. Although there are dferent types of dog and cat fleas, they donrsquot mind what they jump onto to feed!Fleas are two to three millimetres long and move quickly through the coat. Flea droppings are black and gritty, and turn reddamp cotton wool is applied to them.Fleas can transmit several diseases, cause allergies and general irritation. Fleas live on your pet, and in the house.You must use a suitable insecticide spray to destroy flea larvae, which can survive for months in the environment. Your veterinary staff can advise what is best for your pet and your home.The rabbit flea is unusual in that it doesnrsquot move very fast. They are often found along the edge of catsrsquo ears and are dficult to remove, so are called lsquostick tightrsquo fleas. Cats pick them up when hunting wild rabbits.Walking dandruff mitesare very common in puppies, kittens and bunnies. They are too small to see but occasionally skin scurf appears to move, which is actually the mites, hence the name.Mange mitesare minute parasites which bury into the skin. Some are passed from mother to young and some spread from pet to pet. Some cause intense scratching, some cause hair loss. Some can be very dficult to treat, requiring specialised anti-parasitic washes or spot on treatment.Ear mites live in the ear canals, causing irritation, lots of wax production and a smell.At Dunedin Vets, we strongly recommend taking out insurance for your pet at a young age. Many breeders will provide initial insurance cover, and many vets will offer free insurance with certain companies for a few weeks. This gives peace of mind whilst you are considering which insurance to purchase. We suggest you look for a lsquolelong coverrsquo policy so your pet will always be covered.Consider a pet health club for your new arrival. Many veterinary practices, including Dunedin Vets, offer this type of scheme. Basically, you spread the cost of your petrsquos preventative healthcare over the year rather than being faced with large bills at booster time, so allowing you to budget monthly for this.Dunedin Vetsrsquo pet health club offers many other benefits and discounts. During these dficult times, many people are finding this a great way to ensure the best care for their pets without burdening themselves financially.Puppies, kittens and bunnies bring so much love to a family and help so much in your wellbeing ndash choose wisely, and look after them well, and you will have a friend and companion for le."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-peeps-past-december-29-31-1995-1970-1920","story":"lsquoPLEASE drink up... the pub is on firersquo was a headline in the East Lothian Courier on December , .Time was called early at the Auld Hoose pub in North Berwick last Wednesday after a fire broke out in the public bar.Customers spotted smoke coming from the floor near a fireplace about pm and the local fire brigade was alerted.The premises were evacuated ndash including an upstairs flat occupied by Jean Borthwick and her Labrador dog, Freeway ndash as landlord Ian McMinn tried to tackle the blaze with a fire extinguisher containing powder.But help was soon at hand in the shape of his brother Hugh, a local fireman, and the rest of the retained crew who began fighting the dense smoke and flames.Sub-officer McMinn explained that cracks in the old hearth at the pubrsquos real fire had caused joists and beams on the floor to burn.AN EAST Lothian pupil became the first from his high school to be accepted to study at the University of Cambridge, reported The Haddingtonshire Courier of December , .Ian Graham, son of Sergeant and Mrs Graham, Tranent, has been accepted for entry into Emmanuel College, Cambridge, in October .Ian is at present in his sixth year at the Ross High School.He was Dux of the School in his fth year and is at present Head Boy.He is a young man of high intellectual ability but at the same time he is an accomplished games player, playing in the School XV and also in the Badminton Club.He is an office-bearer in the Literary and Debating Society and last summer was a gold medallist in athletics at the Scottish Schools Athletics Championships.A MAN was fined pound after being caught stealing a bird from a train station, as reported in The Haddingtonshire Courier of December , .In the Burgh Court, on Friday, before Bailie Main, James Kelly, railway porter, Church Street, Haddington, pleaded guilty to having, on Tuesday, st, stolen a cockerel from a hamper lying in the booking-hall of the station.The Fiscal stated that, about eight orsquoclock on the night in question, a booking-clerk heard a person entering the booking-hall on tip-toe.On going out, he found Kelly alongside the hamper.He made the excuse that the label had been torn off the hamper, and that he was putting it on.The label was afterwards found lying on the floor, but it was discovered that the hamper had been opened and the cockerel removed."},{"url":null,"title":"7am-wait-worth-mum-bonnie-babies-champion-2020-harris-tait","story":"Harris Tait, who celebrated his first birthday on December , was announced as the winner in last weekrsquos Courier.He lives on East Lintonrsquos Longstone Avenue with mum Kirsty, , and dad Andrew, , a maintenance team leader at Torness Power Station.Kirsty described Harris as a ldquofunny and cheeky little boy with ldquosuch a little personality.She added: ldquoHe knows what he wants and is a determined little guy, which I think he takes from me and Andrew.Kirsty, who has been on maternity leave this year but is ing to work on Monday as a customer trade manager at Asda in Livingston, said Harrisrsquo win had been a boost to the family after what has been a tumultuous year.She said: ldquoItrsquos not really been the greatest year and hersquos not been able to interact with other kids and I thought, lsquoWhat have we got to lose rsquo so decided to enter him.ldquoYou never think that you are going to win competitions like these.When the results were announced in last weekrsquos Courier, Kirsty said she was ldquobuzzing and ldquoa bit emotional.

I will set out our decisions shortly.However, I can confirm now, in summary, that we decided to introduce from midnight tonight for the duration of January, a legal requirement to stay at home except for essential purposes. This is similar to the lockdown of March last year.However, before I set out Cabinetrsquos decisions in more detail, I want to explain in some detail why they are so necessary.In the last few weeks, there have been two signicant game changers in our fight against this virus.One, the approval of vaccines, is hugely positive and offers us the way out of this pandemic.But the other - the new faster spreading iant of the virus - is a massive blow.Possibly the most simple way of explaining the challenge we face right now is to compare it to a race.In one lane we have vaccines - our job is to make sure they can run as fast as possible.Thatrsquos why the government will be doing everything we can to vaccinate people as quickly as possible. I will say more about that later.But in the other lane is the virus which - as a result of this new iant - has just learned to run much faster and has most definitely picked up pace in the last couple of weeks.To ensure that the vaccine wins the race, it is essential to speed up vaccination as far as possible.But to give it the time it needs to get ahead, we must also slow the virus down.And because it is now spreading faster, that means even tougher restrictions are necessary.The evidence is now compelling that the new iant is up to % more transmissible than previously circulating strains, and that it may add as much as . to the R number.And according to recent analysis of PCR test samples, it appears that the new iant already accounts for almost half of all new cases in Scotland.That increased and faster spread is undoubtedly driving the very serious situation we now face.Todayrsquos case numbers ndash , new cases, with % of tests being positive - illustrate the severity and urgency of the situation.No new deaths were reported today ndash because yesterday was a Sunday and registration offices were largely closed ndash but since I updated Parliament before Christmas,  deaths have been recorded in the daily figures. That again reminds us of the continuing grief this pandemic is causing.But this is not just about one dayrsquos numbers.We are now seeing a steeply rising trend of infections.Indeed, it is no exaggeration to say that I am more concerned about the situation we face now than I have been at any time since March last year.In the week from  to  December, the seven day incidence of cases per , of the population increased by % - from  per , to  per ,.Test positivity has risen sharply too.The next update on the numbers of Covid patients in hospital and intensive care will be published tomorrow.I would expect these to show that, nationally, the total number of Covid patients in hospital is close to its April peak. And in some boards, the pressure is already very real.For example, in terms of hospital beds, NHS Ayrshire and Arran is currently at % of its Covid capacity, and three other health boards - Borders, Greater Glasgow  Clyde and Lanarkshire - are above % of their capacity.The number of people in intensive care is still signicantly lower than the April peak ndash which partly reflects the fact that treatment of Covid has improved signicantly since last spring.But even so, the total number of patients in intensive care in Scotland is already above normal winter levels. Indeed, all mainland health boards have now exceeded their normal intensive care unit capacity.And it is important to be clear that people who are in hospital and ICU now are likely to have been infected  days to  weeks ago.That means that these numbers reflect what the level of new cases was around  weeks ago.Given that the number of cases has increased signicantly since then, we can expect to see signicantly increased pressure on the NHS over the course of this month.Contingency plans remain in place to double and then treble ICU capacitynecessary.And the NHS Louisa Jordan continues to be available to help meet demand - as indeed it has been doing in recent months. , patients have attended there for scans and outpatient appointments nearly , NHS staff and students have been trained there and it is currently being used for Covid vaccinations.In short, NHS services are coping at present ndash although the pressure on frontline staff is considerable - but already in some areas the position is fragile, and getting more challenging.Andthe rate of increase in case numbers that we have seen in past two weeks was to continue unchecked, there would be a real risk of our NHS being overwhelmed - even with contingency plans in place.In fact, our modelling suggests that without further intervention, we could breach inpatient Covid capacity within  or  weeks.And, of course, a sharply increasing number of cases, in human terms, means many more people becoming ill and dying.All of that explains why we have to act quickly and decisively.The situation in some other parts of the UK - where case numbers are already much higher than here, and where the contribution of the new iant is already greater - shows what may lie aheadwe donrsquot.As things stand, we estimate that we are possibly about four weeks behind the position in London and the south east.The rapid acceleration in London began when it was at about  new cases a week, for every hundred thousand people. Thatrsquos the level Scotland was at a week ago.London is now seeing  new cases a week per ,. Test positivity is around %. And pressure on NHS services is acute.We have an opportunity in Scotland to avert the situation here deteriorating to that extent.But we must act quickly.The advice of our clinical advisers is clear that the increased transmissibility of the new iant means that the current level  measures may not be sufficient to bring the R number back below .It is essential that we further limit interaction between dferent households to stem the spread and bring the situation back under control, while we vaccinate more people.In short, we mustfor a period to a situation much closer to the lockdown of last March.Let me therefore set out in more detail the decisions Cabinet has reached.It is important to stress that these are not decisions taken lightly. I am acutely aware of the impact they will have and I know they will not be welcome.But they are in our judgment essential.As government, our clear and overriding duty right now is to act quickly to save lives and protect the NHS.We know that delay or preication in the face of this virus almost always makes things worse not better - evenit stems from an understandable desire that we all share to wait for more data or evidence.To turn to the decisions in detail. The decisions I will speak about a bit later on schools, let me be clear at this stage, they will apply to all parts of Scotland. However other decisions that I will outline will apply to those parts of Scotland currently at level , which of course is all of mainland Scotland, and they are effectively an enhancement to level .The island areas currently in level  will remain there for now, although we will continue to monitor them very carefully.These additional level  restrictions - essentially ing us to a position similar to the lockdown of last March - will be in place for the whole of January. We will keep them closely under review.However, I cannot at this stage rule out keeping them in place longer, nor making further changes. Nothing about this is easy.The first measure is that our fundamental advice, for everyone, is to stay at home.That is the single best way of staying safe.We consider that this stay at home message and advice is now so important that, from tomorrow, it will become law, just as it was in the lockdown last year.This means it will only be permissible to leave home for an essential purpose.This will include, for example, caring responsibilities, essential shopping, exercise and being part of an extended household.In addition, anyone who is able to work from home, must do so. It will only be a reasonable excuse to leave your home to go to work,that work cannot be done from home.We are asking people and businesses to take this really seriously ndash as we all did in March, during the first lockdown, - because the situation is at least as serious now as it was then.The law already requires many businesses in certain sectors to close in Level . We now need every business to look again at their operations, and to make sure that every singlethat can be done by people working at home, is being done in that way.Businesses have already shown a tremendous capacity to adapt during this pandemic and Irsquom very grateful to them for that - and we need them to consider their operations again, as we all work together to reduce transmissions.The Economy Secretary will be speaking to business organisations about this, including this afternoon. We will also engage with unions on these issues. And we will continue to considermore regulatory action is required.We are also providing new guidance for people who are in the shielding category.If you were shielding and you cannot work from home, our clear advice now is that you should not go into work at all.The Chief Medical Officer is writing to everyone who falls into this category, and his letter will count as a Fit Note for those who need it.Unlike the lockdown last year, the frequency of outdoor exercise is not being limited.It is important for physical and mental health that we can get outdoors for fresh air and exercise as much as possible.However, from tomorrow, the rule on outdoor gatherings will change.As of now, up to six people from two households are able to meet outdoors. Given the greater transmissibility of this new iant, we consider it necessary to restrict that further.From tomorrow, a maximum of two people from up to two households will be able to meet outdoors.Children aged  and under will not be counted in that limit, and they will also be able to play outdoors in larger groups, including in organized gatherings.However, for everyone  ndash including  to  year olds - outdoor exercise should only take place in a way which is consistent with the  people from  households rule.In addition, strict travel restrictions remain in place across Scotland. From tomorrow,you live in a level  area - as the majority of us do - you cannot leave your home except for an essential purpose. When you do go out, stay as close to home as possible and stay away from crowded places.And it remains the case ndash and let me stress this point - that no-one is allowed to travel into or out of Scotland unless it is for an essential purpose.Presiding OfficerA number of other measures will come into effect on Friday of this week.It is with real regret that we consider it necessary for places of worship to close during this period for all purposes except broadcasting a service, or conducting a funeral, wedding or civil partnership.I am well aware of how important communal worship is to people.But we believe that this restriction is necessary to reduce the risk of transmission.While up to  people will still be able to attend funeral services, wakes will not be possible during January. And a maximum of  people will be able to attend wedding and civil partnership services.Presiding OfficerI know how devastating restrictions like these are and I give an assurance that we will not keep them in place for longer than is absolutely necessary.There will also be additional measures in relation to businesses, in addition to the tightening of the essential retail definition that took effect from Boxing Day.The current  metre exemption for workplace canteens will end ndash so canteens will have to ensure that employees sit  metres or more apart, rather than  metre.The number of non-essential services which remain open will be further restricted.Premises which will need to close as a result of these changes will include, for example ski centres, showrooms of larger retailers, and clinics offering cosmetic and aesthetic procedures.I know that many businesses have already been hit by the restrictions which were put in place on Boxing Day.And of course I know that the vast majority of businesses have taken their responsibilities seriously, and have invested in Covid safety measures.In addition, the move to home working has brought challenges for workers and employers. I am hugely grateful for the way in which businesses and their staff have responded to those challenges.Grants are of course available for businesses required to close as a result of restrictions. That support is in addition to support through the UK wide furlough scheme.The Scottish Governmentrsquos financial support for businesses during the pandemic currently totals more than pound. billion.However, we will continue to assess what more the Scottish government can do ndash either in closure grants or other forms of support - to help businesses and those who work for them.We will also work with councils to ensure community and social support for those who need it, including for parents balancing work and online learning.We will confirm additional resources later this week.Presiding Officer,The final substantive issue I want to address - before giving an update on vaccination - relates to schools.We announced before Christmas that most school pupils would learn remotely ndash rather than in school ndash until Monday  January.I can confirm that we have now decided to extend that date and keep schools closed to the majority of pupils until  February. We will review this again in mid-January.The change will apply to all pupils - except vulnerable children, and children of key workers. And it includes nursery schools, as well as primary and secondary schools.There is no doubt that of all the dficult decisions we have had to take today, this was the most dficult of all and its impact is of course the most severe.The evidence to date makes clear that thanks to the hard work of school staff and pupils, schools in Scotland have been low-risk environments for Covid. We will work with our partners to ensure that remains the case.That will include ongoing work on testing in schools and discussions about when, in the context of the overall programme, it will be possible to vaccinate school staff.And I want to be clear that it remains our priority to get school buildings open again for all pupils as quickly as possible and then keep them open.However, right now, two factors mean that it is not consistent with a safety-first approach for all children to attend school in person.First, the overall level of community transmission is simply too high. We need to get transmission down before schools can safely reopen. A period of online learning will also, in turn, help us do that.The second reason is that there is still signicant uncertainty about the impact of the new iant on transmission amongst young people.We therefore have to adopt a cautious approach at this stage.So most pupils will be learning online for at least the rest of the month.We will review on  January whether they can - as we hope -to school on the  February.I know that remote learning presents signicant challenges for teachers, schools, parents and young people, and we will work to support children and parents throughout this.The Scottish Government, Education Scotland and local authorities are working together to further improve the remote learning options which are available for schools.And it is also worth highlighting that since schools ed after the summer, more than , devices ndash such as laptops ndash have been distributed to children and young people to help with remote learning. More devices are being distributed by councils on a weekly basis, and in total we expect our investment ndashwhich builds on existing local authority action - to benefit around , disadvantaged children and young people across Scotland.I also want to stress one final point.Just as the last places we ever want to close are schools and nurseries - so it is the case that schools and nurseries will be the first places we want to reopen as we re-emerge from this latest lockdown.They remain our priority.That is why we are considering whether and to what extent - consistent with our overall duty to vaccinate the most vulnerable first in line with JCVI recommendations - we can achieve vaccination of school and childcare staff as a priority. Many teachers will of course be vaccinated over coming weeks as part of the JCVI priority list.The fortnightly review will not simply be a choice between opening and closing schools - we will always seek to maximise the number of pupils we can safely get back to classrooms and nurseries.Sothe evidence tells us we can get some pupils back safely, we will do that.However ultimately, the best way of enabling more pupils tomore quickly is by reducing community transmission of the virus as much as possible.And all of us ndash by accepting and abiding by the wider restrictions I have set out today - have a part to play in achieving that.Before I leave the issue of education, let me remind the chamber that we already had plans in place for the staggeredof universities and colleges. We will be considering this week whether any further change is necessary.Presiding OfficerBefore I close today, I want to give a brief update on our current expectations around vaccine supply.The Health Secretary will give a more detailed update on vaccination in a statement the chamber next week.However, I can confirm today that well over , people have now received their first dose of the vaccine.The first doses of the Astra Zeneca vaccine are being administered today.In total, over the period to the end of January - including the more than , already administered - we expect to have access to just over , doses of vaccine. Obviously, we hope that increases.These will be split roughly equally between the Pfizer and Astra Zeneca vaccines.However, we anticipate that some of the Astra Zeneca portion will be available only in the last week of January.We do not yet have certainty on supply schedules beyond January but will keep Parliament updated as these become firmer.However, our current expectation, based on assumptions about supply and the new advice on doses being administered up to  weeks apart, rather than , is that by early May everyone over , and people under  with specic underlying conditions, will have received at least the first dose of vaccine.That is everyone who is on the JCVI priority list, and comprises more than . million people.Once everyone on the priority list has been vaccinated, we will start vaccinating the rest of the population, and will do this in parallel with completing second doses for those on the priority list.Those timetables are of course heavily dependent on vaccine supply. And for that reason, they are at this stage cautious.However, I have tasked our vaccination team with exploring and keeping under ongoing review all options to speed up the rate of vaccination and bring these timescales forward as far as possible.I am grateful for the many offers of assistance we have received and while many of them may not prove possible or practical to take up, they will be consideredThe Health Secretary will say more about all of this in her statement next week.Presiding OfficerTo conclude, this is most certainly not the new year statement I wanted to give.And I know it is a statement no one wanted to hear.But as I said at the beginning, we are now in a race between the vaccine and the virus.The Scottish government will do everything we can to speed up distribution of the vaccine.But all of us must do everything we can to slow down the spread of the virus.We can already see ndash by looking at infection rates where ndash some of what could happen here in Scotlandwe donrsquot act.To prevent that, we need to act immediately and firmly.For government, that means introducing tough measures ndash as we have done so today.And for all of us, it means sticking to the rulesIt means continuing to follow the FACTS guidanceAnd it means ndash above all ndash staying at home.That is again our central message.Stay Home. Save lives. Protect the NHS.If we do this, we give the vaccine the time it needs to get ahead and ultimately win the race.I know that the next few weeks will be incredibly dficult.Irsquom sorry to ask for further sacrices, after nine long months of them. But these sacrices are necessary.And the dference between now and last March is that with the help of vaccines, we now have confidence that these sacrices will pave the way to brighter days ahead.So ndash for everyonersquos sake and safety - please stick with it and stay at home."},{"url":null,"title":"new-lockdown-rules-scotland-covid-restrictions-explained","story":"First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced the new rules on Monday afternoon, asthe latest restrictions came into effect from midnight today in all Level  areas of the country andwill continue throughout the month.Speaking at Holyrood, Ms Sturgeon said: \"I can confirm now, in summary, that we decided to introduce from tomorrow, for the duration of January, a legal requirement to stay at home except for essential purposes.

It was also commended for including a system that brakes the car following a crash. The only real negative was that it could cause higher damage to other vehicles in a crash.Seat LeonThe Leon shares a  with the A and therefore scores similarly. However, it did marginally better in adult occupant protection, despite near-identical comments on injury protection. It also received a small penalty for the damage it could cause other vehicles, but otherwise received good marks for protecting passengers from injury.Volkswagen ID.Volkswagens new electric vehicle also underwent testing this year, getting full marks. It performed well in preventing injuries to its passengers, but was also noted for not causing excessive damage to the crash barrier, indicating its also quite friendly to other vehicles in a crash. The main negative was the fact that the dummy moved too far across the vehicle in the side impact test.Toyota YarisThe Yaris might be small but it scored well across the board, receiving maximum points for protecting critical body parts in the side impact test. It also gained praise for having clear information on the front airbag system, which can be disabled for rear-facing child restraints. However, an unclear manual meant it failed on the installation check for some child restraints.Honda JazzAnother small car that performed well is the Jazz, which demonstrated a stable passenger compartment in the offset frontal test. Protection of the passengers was generally good, but was rated as weak for the drivers chest. It was noted that the centre airbag protected passengers colliding with each other in a side impact.Mazda MX-Another electric car, Mazdas new MX received top marks, doing particularly well in adult occupant protection, where it scored %. The report notes that protection of passengers was strong, scoring top marks in both the side barrier test and more severe side pole impact. It was knocked for not having an advanced emergency call system or post-collision braking.Land Rover DefenderLand Rover will be pleased to learn that one of the most highly anticipated new cars of the year scored top marks in testing, despite not being outstanding in any department. Euro NCAP noted that the femur protection score was penalised, as was chest protection of the rear passenger in the full-width rigid wall test. It was also considered an aggressive partner to other vehicles in the event of a crash.Kia SorentoAnother large SUV and another five stars, the Sorento was another that didnt stand out in any particular area but did well overall. Its central airbag, whiplash protection and driver assistance were all rated highly. However, its protection of the drivers chest and right femur was rated weak, with occupant protection rated marginal in this test because structures in the dashboard could cause a risk to occupants of dferent sizes.Isuzu D-MaxThe surprise of the year was the Isuzu D-Max pick-up, which scored top marks despite competing in a segment that is not famous for highlighting safety. It received similar occupant safety comments as the Sorento in the offset frontal test, and was also penalised for how it interacts with other vehicles in a crash. However, it typically scored highly for occupant protection in a iety of crash scenarios, as well as for having an emergency call system."},{"url":null,"title":"herald-diary-tell-laura-bbc-loves","story":"WATCHING the TV news can be a dispiriting affair, points out David Kirkwood.

For the safety of one teacher the education of - children is cancelled. Teachers and school staff should all be prioritised for inoculation at the earliest opportunity.

I experienced the same feelings as Bill Murrayrsquos character reading Ronald J Sandfordrsquos letterwhich reheats several of the  scare stories.First of all, when Juan Manuel Barroso gave his opinion it concerned the possibility of Scotland, then part of the EU within the UK, remaining an EU member even on independence. That possibility has of course been rendered totally irrelevant by Brexit, and unless someone wants to argue that an independent Scotland would simply be unacceptable to the EU, then the issue is done with.On independence, therefore, we will not be members of the EU for a period that might be longer or shorter, depending on the above considerations. However, this makes even more attractive the suggestion by Dr Tim Rideout, an influential member of the Scottish Currency Group, that on independence, Scotland could seek membership of EFTA , committing to the European Economic Area, which would give us access to the single market, freedom of movement and more. Subsequently, a referendum could be held on whether to apply to join the EU, depending on the outcome of negotiations, butthe terms were unsuitable, we could stay in EFTA.Lastly, Mr Sandford, Spain has consistently taken the view that as long as Scottish independence is achieved by constitutional means they will have nothing to say. Alfonso Dastis, Foreign Minister to Mariano Rajoy, has said ldquo [Scottish independence] happens legally and constitutionally, we would not block [EU membership].

The blue tits, obviously, impatiently watching me replenish the feeders. And the chaffinches sometimes therersquos more than  of them outside the window. And the woodpecker, running up the tree, and the nuthatch, running down it. And the guest stars: a jay, magpies, doves, corvids, and the wagtails that nested in a hole in my wall. And finally, the A-lister: a robin who poses on the bench like itrsquos a throne.In the last couple of weeks, there have been some newcomers too. A linnet with a breast almost as bright as the robinrsquos and the dowdier female with her go-fast stripes on her chest. And there have been a few house sparrows too, which is a new thing for me in the middle of the country. House sparrows tend to stick to towns, but I can see a few of them checking out the hebe by the window as a potential holiday home. Theyrsquore very welcome to it. I hope they stay.I hope, too, that their presence is a good sign. Sixty years ago, the house sparrow was the most numerous bird in Britain, but the population has declined by  per cent. Fortunately, the situation appears to have stabilised more recently and part of that may be down to more of us putting out birdfeeders in our gardens: sales of feeders and food have increased big-time during the lockdowns.Obviously, all of this is good for the birds, but itrsquos good for us too. A study was published in Germany a few days ago showing a connection between birds and human happiness ndash the more birds you can see and hear around you, said the report, the more satisfied yoursquore likely to be with your le. It also concluded that the effect of more birds is as great as the effect of more money. But then I could have told them that.Irsquod also like to tell you about some of the things Irsquove learned about helping the birds: a few of the tips that experts in the RSPB and other organisations have passed on to me over the years. The first of them is that you should keep your feeders filled all year round, not just in the winter. In the summer, a lot of the birdsrsquo diet will be made up of insects, but even then every little extra bit helps.The second tip could be more dficult: donrsquot be so neat and tidy. A lot of birds feed on the scraps that humans leave behind, and use the hedges in our gardens as shelter, and for food, and for nesting ndash the ordinary garden is a birdrsquos fortress and kitchen and nursery. So donrsquot leave your hedges too trim and neat ndash leave spaces for the birds to get in and out. And put scraps and leftovers out on the birdtable. It will all be appreciated.Maybe we could check our attitudes too. We know the British people love birds, but we also know we have a confused attitude to them. We put up bird tables but put spikes on buildings to discourage pigeons. We celebrate the robin but decry the gull. The hen harrier is killed to protect the right to kill the grouse. Perhaps we could stop trying to impose our rules on the birds. Perhaps we could step back and realise they are all the same. Perhaps we could look at the birds and learn.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

If properly resourced, there is no reason why those leaving secondary school cannot have a formal extension of one or two years to continue their lost education and take their exams in further education colleges. This would require strategic organisation involving all sectors of education and I believe this would be a better solution than to allow our elderly, in which I have a vested interest, to wither away.It is clear Mr Tait does not care for Nicola Sturgeon or her regular media updates, for which there is an off switch as an immediate cure.

He echoes what seems to be accepted generally and without question that for some reason children are at low risk of virus infection and of passing it on. If that is the case, do children have some inherent immunity, which presumably diminishes as they grow up, which should be researched, identied, isolated and passed over to adults as an alternative or additional treatment to vaccination Alan Fitzpatrick, Dunlop.PUBLISH DAILY VACCINE FIGURESTHE Covid vaccination programme is probably the most vital and important public health exercise in modern history. Notwithstanding, given comments made be either Nicola Sturgeon or Jeane Freeman over the last  hours, I have heard or read at least six dferent versions of their expected Covid vaccination timetable in terms of who will be vaccinated and by when. This is a disgrace. Once again, like the flu jab fiasco, John Swinneyrsquos education mess-up last year and other examples too many to mention here, this indicates this SNP administrations complete inability to manage anything effectively or efficiently.Since March last year, Ms Sturgeon has managed to find ample resources to both compile and produce her daily political broadcast ndash sorry, Covid update ndash so why can she now not find resources to deliver a daily update on vaccination progress against a clearly articulated timetable  This is what we want to hear from her, not her ongoing, daily, repetitive political jibes, nor her monotonous and very isive independence monologue.Paul McPhail, Glasgow G.JAG ROLL-OUT MUST NOT FAILI WAS more than pleased when my -year-old brother contacted me yesterday to advise that he had just received his first Covid vaccination. He lives in Essex, where NHS England has commenced the roll-out of a major vaccination programme which is intended to immunise the entire top four priority groups by mid-February this includes all the over-seventies, NHS workers, care home staff and care home residents in addition to people with underlying health problems, amounting to more than  million people. This is an exceptionally ambitious target, but one which the Prime Minister is confident of achieving.Under the circumstances it is not unreasonable to expect that here in Scotland we can achieve similar success with a vaccination roll-out that includes the most vulnerable groups over a similar time frame. Should the Scottish Government fail to deliver a successful vaccination programme, at speed, and without similar problems to those experienced with last yearrsquos flu vaccine debacle, then it will never be forgiven by the Scottish public.Christopher H Jones, Gfnock.TRAINING IS A LONG SLOGI READ with real concern in your front-page report todaythat a number of health care staff in Glasgow yesterdayhad been unable to get their Covid- vaccine as had been originally scheduled.Undoubtedly such a mass immunisation programme requires a considerable amount of planning and effort, including recruitment of vaccinators. I have been practising as a GP for  years and I first offered to be a vaccinator as part of the hospital community hub vaccination programme on December . I received an email on December  inviting me to complete the online training, which I did ndash this taking me six hours, but which unlike as has been reported to be the case in England, did not include compulsory modules in de-radicalisation or equality and ersity. On December  I submitted my completed application and currently await to find outmy skills can be useful to the vaccination effort. Cases of Covid- continue to rise, but at this point Irsquom not too sure that the vaccine is outrunning the virus.Dr Alan Mitchell, Motherwell.WHY MESS WITH THE PROGRAMME NICOLA Sturgeon has stated that no one would be receiving a first dose of the Pfizer vaccine and a possible second dose with the Oxford vaccine. Surely no one in the health boards had even considered that scenario  I am also at a loss as to how they can suddenly change the period gap between jags, from  days to  weeks, without any check on the effect of same.There have already been some doubts on the suitability of the existing vaccines for keeping the Covid iant at bay, let alone the now additional one appearing on the scene, so why mess with the initial vaccine programme George Dale, Beith.HOW HAS IT COME TO THIS WHEN you are into ldquoextra-time in the game of le as I am, lockdown is a disaster. I know thatI catch Covid- the chances are it will kill me. Like many old fogies Irsquove been in what is essentially self-imposed lockdown for the best part of a year and as of now even that regime will be ramped up. Gone completely will be the already-infrequent outdoor visits to kids and grandkids, even a daily walk which is already compromised by being compelled to walk on the road to avoid groups of adolescents who ignore social distancing or ignorant berks who feel it more important that their dog-on-a-string walks on the pavement than a pensioner, will be threatened. Heaven forfend one runs out of milk the risk of premature death has to be balanced against having a decent cup of tea.Just how badly managed the response to the pandemic has been is encapsulated by the fact that almost a year into things only now are they considering closing the door to the country. For heavenrsquos sake we live on an island, it should have been the first thing they did. How is it possible that groups were shuttling back and forwards to European ski resorts recently  Air-bridges pathetic. Now we have a virus iant that got here from South Africa on a plane and another highly contagious mutant domestic form of Covid- that appeared in the heavily-populated south-east of England, its development and transmission facilitated by Government policy of trying to keep le as near normal as possible to protect the economy rather than the population.Less than a year into the pandemic the UK seasonally adjusted level of deaths is nearer , than the official Covid- statistics, mainly elderly poor or BAME casualties. The economy has tanked with personal debt escalating along with rising unemployment and rent arrears, but at least the rich are getting richer.I suppose depending on where you stand Government policy could be deemed to be right on target.David J Crawford, Glasgow G.ELECTION WILL NO DOUBT COME FIRSTI ENJOYED reading my mothers letter , agree with its content and admire her idealism.

And found that online banking failed to log out consumers when switching to a dferent site .It also found that the website failed to log out consumers when switching to a dferent website or using the forward back button to leave the session andto it.TSB finished second from bottom with a score of  per cent.But the research found that TSB customers do at least enjoy some \"peace of mind\" due to the bankrsquos fraud refund guarantee, which ensures the \"vast majority\" of scam victims get their money back.Santander rounded off the bottom three, with a score of  per cent. Testers found that authentication checks when logging in can be bypasseda user designates a device as lsquotrustedrsquo.It was the not so big names that performed better.Starling came out on top, with a score of  per cent. Experts found nothing concerning with its recently launched online banking website.But they said this is partly due to limited ality, as users can only change sensitive data via the app.Unlike most banks, there were no issues with missing security headers and it scored top marks for encryption.Which  is calling for the voluntary bank transfer scams code to be overhauled so that stronger consumer protections and reimbursement for fraud victims become mandatory for all banks and payment providers.The code developed by the banking industry and consumer groups and launched in May, , compensates those who are tricked into transferring money directly to a fraudster, in situations where neither the victim, nor their bank, is to blame.Previously, victims of authorised push paymentscams had lost large amounts of cash forever, because they had authorised the transfer and so were not entitled to claim the money back from their bank.More than pound. million has been reimbursed to thousands of customers since the code was introduced.But concerns persist that banks are not applying the code in a unorm manner and may sometimes be interpreting the code too narrowly by expecting customers to have sophisticated financial knowledge or relying on customers seeing generic scam warnings as a reason to turn down claims.Which  said the FCA should be required to regularly publish reimbursement rates of inidual banks so consumers can check on their account providerrsquos performance.Many of the banks included in the investigation were signed up to the industry code on bank transfer scams, which pledges to reimburse scam victims who are not at fault.However, the number of victims who get their money ed by banks is worryingly low, standing at around the  per cent mark, the consumer organisation said.Because firms apply the code inconsistently and are not required to publish their reimbursement rates, scam victims face a \"lottery\" when it comes to getting their money back, it said.Harry Rose, editor of Which  said: ldquoBanks must lead the battle against fraud, yet our security tests have revealed a big gap between the best and worst providers when it comes to keeping people safe from the threat of having their account compromised.ldquoThe serious failings we have exposed with some providers reinforce the need for banks to up their game on scam protections, and for greater transparency and stronger standards on fraud reimbursement to be made mandatory for all banks and payment providers.TSB said: \"Providing customers with safe and secure banking is a priority and we continue to invest in strengthening online and mobile protection for customers.\"We are the only bank that offers a guarantee to refund all innocent victims of fraud ndash including those who lose money to online scams.\"Tesco Bank said it will consider the findings when prioritising \"potential areas for further enhancement\" to customer security this year \"against other customer and risk priorities\"\"At Tesco Bank, we take the security of our customers very seriously. Many of the security measures we use on customersrsquo behalf are not visible to external parties, and these measures invalidate a number of the findings of this survey. Customers can be assured we have robust security measures in place to protect them and their accounts.ldquoWe use the latest technology to protect and manage the security of online banking and our mobile banking app, giving customers peace of mind they can bank safely and securely with us.

It seems it was decided in some places, lsquoah schools are closed, we donrsquot need to spend that money anymorersquo, even though John Swinney has put additional money in to aid education recovery.ldquoThatrsquos what I would call sharp practice.There have also been reports of schools asking all teachers to come in to look after key worker and vulnerable children, even though Scottish Government guidance species that attendance should be restricted to staff necessary for the implementation of revised reopening arrangements.Mr Searson said: ldquoWersquove had schools in some local authorities ndash even up to [Tuesday] night ndash telling all of their staff to come in because they hadnrsquot established exactly how many key worker and vulnerable children they would have to look after.ldquoWe expect most schools to know how many children would fall into the key worker or vulnerable category.He added: ldquoHopefully common sense is beginning to prevail on this issue. The problem is that the guidance has been woolly and ministers have been saying itrsquos up to local authorities.Mr Searson also warned that consideration would have to be given to overhauling arrangements for additional support needspupils in special schools.ldquoStaff and children in these schools need all the protection that can possibly be provided, he said.ldquoThat may mean that, in those schools, we only have one teacher working with a particular group of children, that they create their own bubble.ldquoMaybe we have to move to the point where itrsquos accepted that not all ASN pupils can be in school all of the time.A Scottish Government spokesman said: ldquoWe have provided guidance for early learning and childcare settings, schools and local authorities on communicating with and reporting to parents during Covid- and supporting parents and pupils with learning at home during Covid-.ldquoWe have invested pound million to address digital exclusion and so far more than , devices have been distributed, and the programme in total is expected to deliver around , devices for disadvantaged children and young people.ldquoThe definition of vulnerable children includes those with additional support needs.

Meanwhile, our business has been reduced by approximately  per cent.#This has hit us very hard, particularly since we are not in receipt of the government subsidy that other transport operators enjoy.”Services on the St Margaret’s Hope to Gills Bay route will be suspended for a week from Sunday, February , when MV Alfred will go into dry dock.

We regret that there will be no indoor waiting or toilet facilities at Gills Bay during the closure.“We are hopeful that by making these short-term business alterations now, we can safeguard the business through the coming months, and be ready to welcome passengers back on board safely, when conditions allow.“We would like to thank everyone for their support during this incredibly dficult time and very much look forward to welcoming you back to our service during the better months to come.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

They phoned me back an hour later and said they had seen something.”Joanne, who is a keen sportswoman and coaches netball, continued: “I didnt feel that sick at the time so I continued to play sports and netball. I played a match the following week but I still had the cough and when I came home from the match I began to cough up blood.“Although I contacted Dalriada on call I still didnt feel that sick so I went to bed but when I got up the next day it was worse so I went to AE.“I was admitted to hospital because my lung collapsed and I couldnt breath. I was told I had a carcinoid tumour which is very rare on my left lung and attached to my windpipe.”Throughout lockdown Joanne regularly attended the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast for treatment.She said: “I started my chemo and laser surgery and I seemed to spend the whole of lockdown between the Royal and my bed.“In November the consultant told me they had lasered enough of the windpipe to do me over Christmas as they had to free up the hospital due to Covid.“I need an operation to remove a quarter of my windpipe and my left lung with everything being bypassed and directed into my right lung. Once I get the operation the tumour should hopefully be taken all away.”Unfortunately Joanne received news that her operation has been delayed.She said: “I was built up for the operation both physically and mentally. After I was told I went into a depression because they said it would be four months.“I have two or three good days but then the rest are bad and at times I am so ill I have to stay in bed. One minute you are doing  miles an hour and then everything just stops.“But I am very lucky to have the support of my daughters and husband as I know the situation is very hard on them too.”Joanne decided to focus on trying to give something back Action Cancer NI and with the help of her father in law, Raymond Lennox, has been creating bespoke wooden planters, bird feeders, Christmas tress and Christmas plaques.The items are being sold at Blossom and Birch, Broughshane Street in Ballymena, which has hosted a number of events in aid of charity, one of which included a gallery night featuring art work by David McAneaney who also works at the florists.Joanne commented: “Between Raymond and myself we have been making a range of items and there has been a big demand for them. It has been good for us both as it has kept us busy and focused. “It is something to keep your mind off things and it keeps us going.”Despite the impending lockdown Joanne and Raymond hope to continue their fundraising efforts and anyone who is interested in purchasing an item can contact Joanne via her facebook page.

Those who will be aged - by  March  can avail of the jab from over  community pharmacies or through their local GP practice.Health Minister Robin Swann said: “We have seen an increased uptake in the flu vaccine programme this year and whilst this is very encouraging it remains extremely important that we take all necessary measures to help reduce the spread of flu.“This is especially true given the very high levels of Covid- transmission in our communities. Reducing the pressure caused by seasonal flu will help protect our health service and save lives.”Minister Swann continued: “This week has also seen GP practices begin the first phase in the Covid- population vaccination programme. Given the scale of the vaccination programme and the delivery schedule of the vaccines it will take time to vaccinate a substantial proportion of the population. I would ask people to remain patient, wait to be called and appreciate that GP practices will be delivering the signicant Covid- programme alongside their normal service. Bearing this in mind, people in this group can also avail of the flu jab, through participating community pharmacies.”Acknowledging the hard work of GP practices and pharmacies in delivering the flu programme to date, Minister Swann said: “I want to pay tribute to GP practice teams and community pharmacies who have worked throughout the pandemic to vaccinate those most vulnerable in our community.

Under the NI Protocol, companies sending parcels here have to complete customs declarations. While a three-month grace period is in force, it was not announced until shortly before the protocol began to apply at pm last Thursday.But freight boss Seamus Leheny of Logistics UK dismissed a call by North Antrim DUP MP Ian Paisley that the protocol should be dropped.Other problems including snarl-ups at ports in Great Britain for lorries carrying food to Northern Ireland were discussed at a hearing of the NI Affairs Committee yesterday.Mr Leheny told the committee that one company had  loads of food bound for here which could not be lted by the hauliers because there was no accompanying paperwork. He said a breakdown in communications between government agencies and the industry in Great Britain has helped create delays.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseDUP MP Ian Paisley FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueDUP MP Ian PaisleyMany companies there had wrongly believed the grace periods to help the flow of supermarket goods into NI meant no documentation at all was required. However, pre-notications to the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairsare still required.There is a yawning gap in the knowledge of those in Great Britain exporting to NI, said Mr Leheny.Mr Paisley said that the complications seen in the first few days of the protocol meant that it should be scrapped.A blind man on a galloping horse could have told you this would be a nightmare, he said.But Mr Leheny said there was no realistic alternative. You can#t just walk away and think something  will be better.He added: Industry here did support the backstop but the protocol is where we ended up because every alternative was rejected. The view of our industry is, let#s make it work.But despite reports of delays, a spokesman for the UK Government told the Belfastthe grace periods for supermarkets and their suppliers are working well. Lorries are travelling through NI ports and we continue to work closely with traders as they adapt to these changes.The overwhelming majority of parcels continue to move smoothly, and there is no reason for businesses not to continue to send such goods to NI.The Government is understood to see the three-month grace period from official certication for parcels as a sensible phased solution.However, operators are being urged to carry out movements in compliance with full requirements as soon as they can.The flow of goods is being monitored by HMRC. A Government source said the priority is to have a pragmatic approach that allows us to comply with the protocol without causing undue disruption to businesses and citizens. Crona Clohisey, public policy lead at Chartered Accountants Ireland, urged traders to ensure they have correct documentation, and use the Government#s Trader Support Service for help with the system for moving goods from Great Britain to NI.The reality is that while the UK and EU have concluded a free trade agreement, the NI Protocol brings a whole host of new trading rules to crucially enable frictionless trading on the island of Ireland, she said. Customs declarations are now required when goods are moved from Great Britain to Northern Ireland because NI must comply with EU customs and VAT rules at its ports.Belfast Most ReadCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Further  deaths and , new cases reported as GCSE and A-Levels cancelledMartin McGuinness# dad told him to get out of house after he joined IRANew lockdown for Northern Ireland... it’s back to square one as police get powers to curb travel Snowed under Kilkeel man builds his own igloo in Mourne Mountains#Blind man on a galloping horse# could have foreseen problems with NI Protocol, Ian Paisley saysLatest BrexitPost-Brexit premises in Larne ready by autumn#Blind man on a galloping horse# could have foreseen problems with NI Protocol, Ian Paisley saysExplained: Post-Brexit supermarket link-up in Northern IrelandBrexit delivery issues: How Amazon, John Lewis, Dunelm and other companies have been affected by Irish Sea borderLatest from Belfast Ban on sale of alcohol after certain time of day being considered, Tanaiste saysLarne owner Bruce calls for break in season but Irish League clubs keen to battle on amidst lockdownJose Mourinho and Pep Guardiola set for another battle in Carabao Cup finalScotland records  more coronavirus deaths in  hoursDissident republicans #leeches feeding off the good people of Creggan# after man shot in leg,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

I would believe that employers wishing to do the right thing should accept previous shielding letters as indication that somebody needs to shield until such time as any further communication is resolved.His comments prompted a flurry of anxious responses on social media from members of the public and charities that support vulnerable members of society.However, a spokesman from the Department of Health subsequently issued a statement to clary that the latest advice dfers from the advice that was originally issued to clinically extremely vulnerable people in March last year.It recommended that anyone advised to shield adhere to strict measures, including staying indoors at all times and limiting contact with members of their household.A statement released on Wednesday night said: Prof Young was referring to the updated advice to clinically extremely vulnerable people issued just before Christmas - with a commitment that letters from the chief medical officer would follow. Some of these letters have already been received.While not ato the shielding advice in place in the early part of the pandemic, the updated Northern Ireland advice does mirror the latest advice in England.Sinn Fein MLA Colm Gildernew, chair of the health committee, on Wednesday night described the confusion over the issue as regrettable.It is slightly dferent revised advice and it is regrettable that people who are vulnerable have felt confused and unclear about the advice, he said.According to the latest guidance, clinical extremely vulnerable people should avoid going to shops, pharmacies and hospitality settings. They should also work from home where possible.The measures were put in place on December  but updated information has not yet been sent out to all the , people who were told to shield last June.Meanwhile, Northern Ireland looks set to remain in lockdown until March at the earliest as Prof Young revealed his fears that Covid- will still be out of control at the end of February.Professor Young has given the clearest indication yet that the draconian restrictions put in place to stem the surge in Covid- cases will not come to an end on February .The Executive Office announced on Tuesday that the additional restrictions would be reviewed on January  and will remain in place until February .However, speaking at the health committee on Wednesday, Prof Young said he expects virus levels to remain signicant at the end of February.Prof Young also revealed that a failure to implement the latest lockdown would have resulted in Northern Ireland#s health service being overrun by patients for three months. And he warned that hospitals will experience a surge in patients at the end of the month.It comes as a further , cases and  deaths were announced by the Department of Health on Wednesday.During Wednesday#s committee meeting, Prof Young came under fire from Sinn Fein MLA Pat Sheehan, who said the strategy put in place by Prof Young, Health Minister Robin Swann and chief medical officer Dr Michael McBride to respond to the pandemic had failed miserably.The CSA said: Do I wish we could have done better  Absolutely. Would there be decisions which I could have been taken dferently looking backwards  Without a doubt.When asked to expand further by Mr Sheehan, Prof Young continued: So, I think that right towards the beginning of the epidemic, on a UK-wide and Ireland-wide basis, there might have been some merit in taking action around travel at that stage, before the virus had become very well established in the country, that#s one thing.I think certainly that we would look back and think might have been done dferently although those are policy decisions, they would have been informed by advice.I wish that we had got the testing developed more rapidly and rolled out more rapidly given all the limitations of it because I think more testing earlier in the epidemic would have been very helpful in terms of trying to keep it under control.Belfast Related Content\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland  .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_eadee-c-d-d-edbd_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland  .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_eadee-c-d-d-edbd_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland  .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_eadee-c-d-d-edbd_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland  .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_eadee-c-d-d-edbd_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland  .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_eadee-c-d-d-edbd_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Coronavirus PremiumFlouting coronavirus rules like #slapping a nurse in the face,# rages Health Minister SwannHealth Minister Robin Swann has fired a warning at those who continue to flout health regulations, saying that they might as well be slapping a nurse in the face.Most ReadCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Further  deaths and , new cases reported as GCSE and A-Levels cancelledMartin McGuinness# dad told him to get out of house after he joined IRASnowed under Kilkeel man builds his own igloo in Mourne MountainsNew lockdown for Northern Ireland... it’s back to square one as police get powers to curb travel #Blind man on a galloping horse# could have foreseen problems with NI Protocol, Ian Paisley saysLatest CoronavirusTranslink cuts bus and train services for second time after Stormont stay at home orderCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Swann hit outs out at leaks from Executive#s Covid meetingsIrish League clubs fear early finish to the season after insisting show must go on despite new lockdownDodds unveils £.m support scheme for hard-hit #wet pubs#Newry Gym owner Trainor accused of Covid breaches facing potential £k fineLatest from Belfast Everyone must ‘put shoulder to the wheel’ in vaccination drive – StarmerUK politicians warned after Trump ‘incites’ riots at Capitol buildingMore than , receive first coronavirus vaccination in ScotlandRingleader closes eyes in dock as court hears container victims’ final callsHMRC issues record £m money-laundering fine,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

And children aged  and under are not counted in this total.Speaking to the Belfastdad of five Pol Gallagher said his family has been left bemused.It#s a total mess, making decisions changing decisions, he said. Stormont needs to get these things right. It#s undermining efforts of people trying to abide by what the lockdown restrictions actually are.On Wednesday in the Assembly First Minister Arlene Foster gave an overview of the new restrictions and when referencing the number of people who can gather in a garden Mrs Foster said that the Department of Health was working through the details and there would be clarity to come on the matter.On Wednesday night the NI Direct website was updated with the latest restrictions which remain in place until February  and will be reviewed on January .It also said that everyone must now stay at home unless they had a reasonable excuse.Earlier the head of the police federation Mark Lindsay questioned the practicality of the PSNI being able to enforce the new regulations and whether officers had the power to cross the threshold of a residence.He told the BBC#s Stephen Nolan show: We have been quite disappointed over the past year in some of the legislation that we think has been rushed, hasn#t been properly thought through, and police are left to pick up the pieces.Mr Lindsay said it would be easiertravel restrictions were in place in that officers could tell from someone#s driving licensethey were in breach of regulations.He questioned how is it practical to enforce gatherings in gardens of hundreds of thousands of homes - many of which are inaccessible. However Justice Minister Naomi Long told MLAs yesterday that officers did have the power of entry.The health protection regulations as laid by the department of health gave those tasked with enforcement the power to take any actions necessary to enforce any legal restrictions and it is the view of the Executive that that includes the right of power of entry, she told MLAs.Belfast Related Content\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland  .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_eadee-c-d-d-edbd_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland  .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_eadee-c-d-d-edbd_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland  .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_eadee-c-d-d-edbd_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland  .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_eadee-c-d-d-edbd_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland  .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_eadee-c-d-d-edbd_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Coronavirus PremiumFlouting coronavirus rules like #slapping a nurse in the face,# rages Health Minister SwannHealth Minister Robin Swann has fired a warning at those who continue to flout health regulations, saying that they might as well be slapping a nurse in the face.Most ReadCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Further  deaths and , new cases reported as GCSE and A-Levels cancelledMartin McGuinness# dad told him to get out of house after he joined IRASnowed under Kilkeel man builds his own igloo in Mourne MountainsNew lockdown for Northern Ireland... it’s back to square one as police get powers to curb travel #Blind man on a galloping horse# could have foreseen problems with NI Protocol, Ian Paisley saysLatest CoronavirusTranslink cuts bus and train services for second time after Stormont stay at home orderCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Swann hit outs out at leaks from Executive#s Covid meetingsIrish League clubs fear early finish to the season after insisting show must go on despite new lockdownDodds unveils £.m support scheme for hard-hit #wet pubs#Newry Gym owner Trainor accused of Covid breaches facing potential £k fineLatest from Belfast Morecambe manager wise ahead of FA Cup challenge at ChaCovid pensioner given an hour to live ‘very happy’ to receive vaccineCare home resident, , becomes one of the oldest to receive Covid- vaccine talking points ahead of this weekend’s FA Cup third-round tiesWest Belfast crash victim Lucy McIlhatton#s short le #filled with love and laughter#, mourners told,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

He had actually sent copies of them off to Walt Disney and got a very polite rejection letter but he was very proud of the fact he got a letter with Walt Disney#s signature on the bottom.Terry adored his grandchildren Patrick, Peter, Craig and Rory, and Paul believes he must have dug out some of his old Bubble Fairy stories to tell them when they were young.Paul said Gail used her free time in lockdown to start typing her father#s notes and the family decided to use his most complete stories to use as the basis for The Bubble Fairy.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseTerry Moorhead#s daughter Gail FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueTerry Moorhead#s daughter Gail Hats off to Gail, it was no mean feat, because she#s partially sighted, added Paul. Deciphering my dad#s scribbles in pencil on old pieces of paper was not at all easy for her.She typed it up and we thought we would do a family vanity project for dad.He was obviously published a lot through print journalism but he never got to publish the book, which would have been a thrill for him.My sister just thought to gather everything he had written as best as we can, put it in a book and get it published.The book#s illustrations were drawn by Patrick, who is in his final year of animation at Ulster University.

He describes it as not having memories so much but more memories of memories after seeing videos and hearing stories about him.In a loving tribute, the family also included some photos of Terry with his grandchildren at the end of the book.Only  copies of The Bubble Fairy were printed to give to friends and family for Christmas Day but Paul saidthe feedback is positive then they will consider publishing it on a wider scale.Belfast Most ReadCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Further  deaths and , new cases reported as GCSE and A-Levels cancelledMartin McGuinness# dad told him to get out of house after he joined IRANew lockdown for Northern Ireland... it’s back to square one as police get powers to curb travel Snowed under Kilkeel man builds his own igloo in Mourne Mountains#Blind man on a galloping horse# could have foreseen problems with NI Protocol, Ian Paisley saysLatest Northern IrelandDissident republicans #leeches feeding off the good people of Creggan# after man shot in legTranslink cuts bus and train services for second time after Stormont stay at home orderDonald Trump#s speech did not spark US Captiol riots, claims DUP#s PaisleyIce weather warning issued for Northern IrelandUp to one in  may have Covid in parts of Northern Ireland, scientist warnsLatest from Belfast Larne owner Bruce calls for break in season but Irish League clubs keen to battle on amidst lockdownJose Mourinho and Pep Guardiola set for another battle in Carabao Cup finalScotland records  more coronavirus deaths in  hoursDissident republicans #leeches feeding off the good people of Creggan# after man shot in legNo concussion substitute trials to take place during FA Cup third round,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchSocialsFacebookTwitterEmailThe Belfastis a member of IPSO and subscribes to its Editors Code of PracticeIpsoSitemapContact UsTerms  ConditionsPrivacy StatementCookie PolicyPaid-for content PolicyGroup WebsitesAdvertise with UsBelfastPension SchemeAn INM Websitecopy Belfastdocument.documentElement.style.setPropertydocument.documentElement.style.setProperty Didomi.preferences\" href\"#\" style\"cursor: pointer position: fixed background:padding: px px color: #ffffff display: flex align-items: center max-height: px z-index:  bottom: px right: px border-top-left-radius: px border-top-right-radius: px\" Privacy"},{"url":null,"title":"martin mcguinness dad told him to get out of house after he joined ira","story":"Family: Tom McGuinness FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueFamily: Tom McGuinnessAllan PrestonTwitterEmailJanuary   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailMartin McGuinness# older brother has spoken of the moment he realised his sibling had joined the IRA, and of his later amazement after he was appointed as Stormont Education Minister.Tom McGuinness made the comments in a new TG documentary exploring the isive legacy left by the IRA leader-turned peace negotiator and politician.Painting a detailed portrait of Martin McGuinness# le, the programme features interviews with Bill Clinton, Tony Blair and Ian Paisley, as well as victims of Provo violence.In a rare interview, Tom recalled his parents challenging his brother in their Bogside home when they learned he had joined the IRA.My father was puffing away on his pipe and sitting in the corner and he just said: #If you want to live here boy... there#s going to be none of that#.Martin stared back at him... not in an aggressive way, but didn#t question him. Just turned, went upstairs.I could hear the noise in the front room, a bag being filled... and he came downstairs and said #look, I have to go#, asthe conversation with my father had terminated.He said to my mother: #Don#t worry, I#ll be back to see you frequently#. And that was the only dissent he ever showed throughout his le until that day. He was on the run, then, basically living in one house or another.Mr McGuinness said he thought it absurd when his brother was appointed as Education Minister, having only attended UCB - University College Bogside.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseMartin McGuinness FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueMartin McGuinness Here#s a guy who had no academic background whatsoever in the formal sense... failed the -plus along with his older brother.How#s he going to handle the situation  But he took charge of a £.bn budget.Mr Paisley, the North Antrim MP, spoke of accepting McGuinness in later years, given that he had considered members of the IRA who killed police officers and bombed cities and towns as people to be absolutely detested.It never left me, the fact who Martin McGuinness was, he said. I wasn#t a fool to this, but someone  once said to me: #What made you do the arrangements with the former terrorist Martin McGuinness #And I said: #The word former#.Julie Hambleton#s sister Maxine was one of  people killed in the IRA Birmingham pub bombings in . She said McGuinness# IRA past could never be justied.When you kill one person you destroy a whole nucleus of a family. The impact of losing Maxine, and for all the families… it#s immeasurable, she said.There is no excuse for Martin McGuinness, or anybody, to pick up a gun or a kne or make a bomb and plant it on innocents.Brid Rodgers, a founding member of the SDLP, said she struggled to forget McGuinness# IRA past when they later became colleagues.She recalled the story of Patsy Gillespie, a Catholic who worked in an Army base. In , considered a collaborator by the IRA, he was forced to drive a van containing ,lbs of explosives to a border checkpoint while his family was held hostage.The bomb killed Mr Gillespie and five soldiers.The documentary is now available to stream online at tg.ie.Belfast Most ReadCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Further  deaths and , new cases reported as GCSE and A-Levels cancelledMartin McGuinness# dad told him to get out of house after he joined IRASnowed under Kilkeel man builds his own igloo in Mourne MountainsNew lockdown for Northern Ireland... it’s back to square one as police get powers to curb travel #Blind man on a galloping horse# could have foreseen problems with NI Protocol, Ian Paisley saysLatest Northern IrelandRingleader closes eyes in dock as court hears container victims’ final callsDissident republicans #leeches feeding off the good people of Creggan# after man shot in legTranslink cuts bus and train services for second time after Stormont stay at home orderDonald Trump#s speech did not spark US Captiol riots, claims DUP#s PaisleyIce weather warning issued for Northern IrelandLatest from Belfast UK politicians warned after Trump ‘incites’ riots at Capitol buildingMore than , receive first coronavirus vaccination in ScotlandRingleader closes eyes in dock as court hears container victims’ final callsHMRC issues record £m money-laundering fineBan on sale of alcohol after certain time of day being considered, Tanaiste says,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

All donations are welcome andanyone wishes to help our efforts that help would be much appreciated.Ms Monk has enlisted the help of two delivery drivers to take the food to the Bogside, Brandywell and Creggan areas of the city.Like all cafes, Peggys Kitchen is closed at the moment due to current restrictions.Its sad that we cant open because we really miss our customers like the Over s Club that used to meet here every Wednesday and for a lot of them it was their only source of interaction but the safety of everyone needs to come first, said Ms Monk. googletag.cmd.push We cant wait to reopen again but until then please keep safe.      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Barman Andy Nutt is preparing to pour the last measure at the well-known local pub.Reporter: Liam Tunney::  Dec   addthis, Knobbsrsquo Tavern closed in March, just before the pandemic arrived. In the week leading up to its final hurrah, we caught up with barman Andy Nutt and a few regulars.A well-known County Derry pub that has been in operation since  will close its door for the final time on Thursday.Knobbs’ Tavern in Kildoag, between Claudy and Donemana, was originally a grocery store that serviced the local area, but the community it sustained has been shrinking.On Saturday, they held a packed farewell concert, and when the County Derry Post caught up with a few of the regulars on the Friday afternoon, they were in reflective mood.“We’ll miss the yarns and the company,” said previous owner, Jack Knobbs, who was perched at the corner of the bar with his dog, Honey.“It was originally what they call a licensed shop and the first time it was opened as a bar was in . Until , the shop was still here and the bar could only hold maybe seven or eight people.“It would have been mostly locals in the bar and then in  they built on the upstairs and it would have hosted a lot of music – mostly country and western music.” googletag.cmd.push Jack is quietly spoken but points me in the direction of black and white photographs on the wall, where he featured in the Kildoag Wanderers FC side and the local cricket team in a previous era.Both teams used the bar as their base, and the social aspect the rural pub brought to the area is something Jack feels will be greatly missed.“The place would have been packed out on a Saturday night – people would have come from Donemana, Waterside and Claudy for the music.“We just enjoyed the craic. You had the odd tall story told. It’s hard to beat a good story, evenit’s not true!”Mervyn McComb lays claim to being the bar’s oldest customer. “I’ve been coming here about  years,” boasts the -year-old. googletag.cmd.push  “I was in it when the old bar was in the other room. Then, when they opened up the lounge, the place was packed to the rafters. “A lot of old bars seem to be closing up, there’s not the customers there used to be. It’s going to be badly missed. “It’s local people that come here.”Right on cue, a loud cheer erupts from the men as another regular walks into the bar, while Ian informs me the bar has its own taxi driver in residence.Barman Andy Nutt prepares to explain further. He mutes the small television mounted above the bar. This is serious stuff now.“There were six women arrived from Cumbria in England on a Tuesday night. They were on a biking tour and on their way to Park.“They came in and asked to use the toilet and I said that was no bother at all. One of them askedthis was a bar and I said it’s been called many things, but you could definitely call it a bar.“She askedthere was any chance they could have a drink and to cut a long story short, they ended up leaving the bikes here!“They stayed all night so I said I would get them a taxi man to get them back to Park. I rung up Eddie Curry and askedhe could do a run.“Eddie said ‘I’m definitely not going to Park’. Then I told him it was six women and he asked what time I wanted him down!     “I got a text from them that evening then – I think they were in Portrush.“It said: Andy, no Guinness at pound., no gin and tonic at pound. – we shouldn’t have left you!”The tale is typical of the kind of comical, slightly embellished yarns that used to be commonplace in bars across the country, but rural decline is threatening to silence them.Mervyn McComb’s son, Ian, believes that people make the bar what it is.“It’s a good wee bar, with great people in it,” he says. “There were memorable nights here every weekend. It was always good craic.“There used to be bands in upstairs and the place would have been jammed. It always did a good trade, was well run and there was never any trouble. “I’m  now so I’ve been coming here maybe  years. It will be sorely missed and it’ll hurt the community.”The range of presentation cheques that adorn the bar’s walls give an indication of how the community will suffer without its hub. Each year, the bar ran a charity drive and the evidence of their impact is clear in the many comments left on social media following news of Knobbs’ closure. Nicola Doherty fondly recalled a vintage tractor rally held at Knobbs’ after her father had beaten cancer.She commented: “We held our first tractor run in there when my dad beat cancer and bought a vintage tractor. “We hoped for a few tractors to show up and to raise a couple of hundred, but the place was packed, and we raised pound, for the Sperrin Room. “Great memories, I’m sad to see it close the doors.”The doors will indeed close, but Saturday night’s punters were treated to the nostalgic sight of the rafters reverberating to the sound of the Father and Son Remo band in the lounge above. There is a black cat that Jack Knobbs says follows him to and from his house to the bar on every visit.It sits almost sentry-like on the windowsill outside Knobbs.On a bright summer’s afternoon, Jack’s feline companion would be treated to a breathtaking view of the Faughan valley, but on Knobbs’ farewell night, Storm Jorge’s wind and rain battered its weary walls.The storm will have calmed by Thursday, as Andy Nutt prepares to close the doors. There is no doubt that Jack Knobbs will be there to oversee what will be an emotional moment.Knobbs concedes to the march of time.“I’m just a customer now,” says the former owner.“Sometimes I sit too long.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Until now. Liam Tunney talks to an ex-member of the infamous Gorilla Gang, who were responsible for many a headache at Slaughtneil discoThe Slaughtneil GAC committee used to meet every Monday evening. The meeting was supposed to be a general meeting about club business, but usually got bogged down with the disco. Discussions often revolved around two groups of boisterous young men in particular – the Gorilla Gang from Draperstown and the Banana Gang of Bellaghy. The latter were set up in reaction to the former, whose name was notorious around south Derry throughout the s. “The name was actually originally meant to be ‘Guerrilla Gang’,” an ex-member told the County Derry Post. “About  or , things were getting hot and heavy and the likes of Ballinascreen was getting saturated by the British Army. googletag.cmd.push “There would have been fighting with the UDR or the Brits, andthey came into Draperstown, the Gorilla Gang would have gathered up a posse and put them out. “There were two or three gangs in Draperstown at that time. One of them was the Wombles and the other one was the Sixtown Clowns. “They all used to fight amongst each other at small discos that used to be on round Draperstown before Slaughtneil started. “The police knew about the Gorilla Gang. I had a few older brothers that went to Spain, and on their way home they were pulled in at London airport and quizzed about the gang!” googletag.cmd.push As the disco’s popularity began to grow, the three gangs soon set their grievances aside as the possibility of taking their local scuffles to a wider field presented itself. “The disco took in the whole of south Derry, so there was more boys to fight with outside your own town,” he recalled. “It was just like that at those times around dance halls. In the early s, before Slaughtneil, the older Gorilla Gang would all have been over in Dungiven fighting at the Castle. “There were a wile lot of boys in the Gorilla Gang that were mad for fighting, and then everyone started making up their own gangs to fight us.     “I think that’s where the Banana Gang came out of, that they were going to get the Gorilla Gang at Slaughtneil. “I think the Banana Gang gave the Wombles and the Sixtown Clowns a bad beating one night and then they didn’t want to go anymore. “Well, they were mad to go, but they couldn’t because they were scared of the Banana Gang. They came to the Gorilla Gang and askedthey could join up.” The merger prompted a rivalry that lasted throughout the late s and caused the Slaughtneil bouncers no end of trouble. Our ex-member feels that the gangs’ propensity for bravado and fisticuffs helped boost the crowds that flocked to the hall on a Friday night. “Four carloads of us would leave the town to go down to Slaughtneil. We didn’t chance taking the bus, becauseyou were fighting, the bus driver wouldn’t let you on,” he said. “I remember going down to Slaughtneil and being told these Banana Gang boys were gonna be there, and two nights in a row, we went down, and they weren’t there. “The third night we went down, we thought they weren’t turning up, so maybe only five or ten of us went and we got some beating from the Banana Gang that night – they all turned up! “God help them bouncers. I don’t think Slaughtneil would have been Slaughtneil without it. Everybody was going, girls and all, to see what was going to happen next week. “If there was a small scuffle in the car park, threats were made about who was going to be there next week that wasn’t there tonight.  The characters’ nicknames roll off the ex-member’s tongue. Bungle. Flan. Rocky. Numan. Turk. Goggles. Nelly. Bruce. Shiny, who ‘couldn’t beat eggs’ but drove the getaway car. The King, who would run out onto the pitch and shout, ‘I’m the King of the Gorillas and I eat bananas for breakfast’ before a dust-up. Johnny the Donkey, who played the role of negotiator when the gangs were thrown out of the car park and arranged to meet halfway between Draperstown and Bellaghy to finish it off. An eclectic mix, but one name resonated more than others. “Flathead was the feared name. He was a real tight boy, he would have fought anybody man to man,” he said. “We would have said, ‘you boys will be in trouble next week, we’re taking big Flathead with us’, and everybody would have been at Slaughtneil the next week for the big punch up outside! “Even the bouncers were a wee bit scared of big Flathead because he was big for his age. There were some characters about.” While the rivalry between the two gangs was intense, it never created any lasting grudges and the member recalled how, by chance, he encountered one of his nemeses years later. “I hadn’t seen this boy for years, until I was going along one day in the car through Rocktown and heading for Bellaghy,” he said. “I saw a man walking along the road in the pouring rain and I stopped to seehe wanted a lt. “He hopped in anyway and was talking away to me and when he was getting out of the car, whatever way he turned sideways I recognised him. He caught on then to who I was too. “We were good friends at school, but then he was in the Banana Gang and I didn’t really want to let him know that I wanted to kill him, and he didn’t want to let me know either!” Time and people move on. The exploits of the Gorilla Gang may seem shocking when viewed through a st century lens, but our ex-member says it was a dferent era. “When I look back, I never knew of a man being hurt badly. When I hear the gang mentioned, it makes me laugh,” he said. “There were no mobile phones, no fancy cars. Anybody that had a car, it had cost them maybe pound. That whole thing is just lost. “I know it wasn’t good going to all them dance halls and fighting, but at the same time, no one was doing drugs or anything, it was just a punch-up. “Just a locka lads with a few beers in them, that fell out with another group of lads and there were a load of myths and legends that never even happened. “There were a few nights when I was younger that I maybe woke up in the morning with a black eye and a cut forehead and I said to myself, ‘oh my God, what am I at ’, but apart from that, I’ve no regrets. “We were all young cubs. Apart from the odd bleeding mouth and a bust lip, there wasn’t much harm done.” “God help them bouncers, those men got some torturing! Them boys did some organising to keep that all going. “For a club on top of a mountain, they did well to actually get people to get up there. There’s not even a pub.” It’s unlikely south Derry will ever see the likes of the Gorilla Gang again, but their mention invokes howls of recognition and intrigue. With a chuckle no doubt brought on by the memory of discos past, the ex-member had one idea that might have some under lockdown pining for its end. “I couldn’t say that I’ve any enemies out of it, put it like that. If we could get a Banana Gang-Gorilla Gang reunion night gathered up, I’d say we could have a good laugh!” See also: If you build it, they will come: Slaughtneils field of dreamers Spinning the soundtrack to a timeless era South Derrys ballroom of romance The goose that laid the golden egg Bringing Muhammad to the south Derry mountains The night a TV star came to Slaughtneil  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Joe Cassidy and captain Ciaran McNally took Michael McMullan on an wander into the past... Twelve years before helping Cathal Scullion to strike gold in an Ulster Club final, Joe Cassidy was setting up goals. This time, in the colours of Ballynease PS. A week after losing the  Castle Cup final, by virtue of a last minute goal, to a Johnny McBride and Bosco ONeill inspired Moneymore, the sides met again. googletag.cmd.push The shoe was on the other foot this time. Only a goal would save Bellaghy, thought Cassidy as he stood over the late free. With the benefit of hindsight, only Ronaldo would have found the net from the environs of right wing. Ciaran McNally began his run from full-back. He took a complete gamble. “I just swung at er with an auld scuffed box, and she fell into the net,” laughs McNally, who was the teams goalkeeper  months earlier.  Joe Cassidy and Ciaran McNally celebrate success with Ballynease PS This was the start of McNally and Cassidys winning run. They were on Bellaghys Ulster minor winning team six years later. Under McBrides captaincy, the Bellaghy duo played for Derry in the  All-Ireland minor final defeat to Westmeath. googletag.cmd.push By that time, Cassidy had secured the first of six senior medals as a list for the  win, which ended Bellaghys eight year absence from the pinnacle of Derry football. McNally had to wait until his debut year of  for senior glory and he would pick up four more championships and captain them to Ulster glory. “The best team, more often than not, always wins the championship,” Cassidy begins. “We had two dferent Ulster minor winning teams– two complete new sets of players.” Sam Maguire winners Karl Diamond, Danny Quinn and Joes older brother Damian were also to the fore.     “There was the likes of Gerry McPeake, Seamus Birt, Damian Brown and Benny Lee, boys that had a bit of experience.” The pieces of the puzzle were slotting into place to rule the Derry club scene. ---- Kilmacud Crokes goalkeeper Mick Penders late penalty save, from Damian Cassidy, denied the Tones a second All-Ireland on St Patricks Day , but after going on to dominate the race for the John McLaughlin Cup, Crossmaglen became their nemesis in Ulster. “They beat us in and . Both times, there wasnt the kick of a ball between the two teams,” McNally outlines. The  All-Ireland final, between Dublin and Galway, was the video of choice on the Bellaghy bus as they headed to their  Ulster semi-final date with Enniskillen. The irony wasnt lost on Joe Cassidy. Dublin had three men sent off, including then Derry senior boss Brian Mullins. Later that afternoon, Bellaghy also finished with  men as they bowed out of Ulster. “In those first four of five years, we got to Ulster finals and semi-finals regularly,” McNally adds. Without an Ulster title, Bellaghy were going to underachieve, he remembers thinking at the time. Joe Cassidys thoughts also flash back to the  final and having it won until John McEntees late equaliser. In the replay, Bellaghy were also a point up going into injury time. Cassidy remembers Damians free dropping in around the Crossmaglen square. If they even had kicked the ball dead the title was theirs, he laments. “The ball got played out to the wing to Oisin McConville and he ran about  yards,” Joe adds. “With hindsight, the best thing wouldve been to do a Sean Cavanagh and pull him down....wed have been Ulster champions.” Three passes later, Cathal Short – who played on the same UUJ Freshers team as Cassidy and Gareth Doherty months earlier– slid the ball past Kevin ONeill and Cross were on their way to their first All-Ireland. Lavey knocked Bellaghy out of the  championship, before Seamus Birt and Colm McElwee took charge at the start of a three year stint that brought three league and championship doubles. For, Joe Cassidy,  was their best chance of winning an All-Ireland. By , Paul Diamond – who Cassidy rates as one of the best he played with – was out of favour. Gone was the experience of Danny Quinn and Damian Cassidy. “For us, hewas a leader. He was one of those boys I loved playing with, he could hit you with a pass from about  yards away and not all midfielders had the ability to do that. Damian was the same. You just needed to make a half a step and Damian had the ball popped in your hand.” After a comfortable win over Lavey in the  county final, Bellaghy were back knocking on Crossmaglens door in the Ulster final, but super-sub Michael Moley scored the winner. Ballinderry qualied for the final the following year, after beating Lavey out the gate at Bellaghy. Joe Cassidy, who was stewarding at the game, remembers Conleith Gilligans fist pump towards a vocerous Shamrocks support after being replaced late in the game – as a bring on Bellaghy type salute. “That county final was one of my favourite ones. It was at Ballinascreen and it was on a Sunday night. There was an unreal atmosphere and a young group ofboys brought flares. “I remember walking behind the band...McNally and dferent boys were giving Gilligan a few welcome messages, so they were. Louis McPeake scored Bellaghys goal but they needed points from man of the match Damian Cassidy and Gavin Diamond to seal victory. That season ended with that defeat by Enniskillen. Without the elusive Ulster title, Bellaghys dinner dance in Arbys the following February was like a ghost town, Cassidy remembers. “Even though we had won the league and championship double...because you had done so bad in Ulster, it nearly looked like a bad year. There was a real dead atmosphere. “Youre expectations were to win an Ulster and, after seeing what Crossmaglen had done, the ultimate was to win an All-Ireland.” Despite a winning start to the  season, Bellaghy werent firing on all cylinders. Danny Quinn was player coach and was taking  percent of the training.  Ulster Club Champions  “Mammawas manager. You would land at training and everything was organsied, so he had those traits,” stated Cassidy. “Before that era , training was pretty pre-historic. My first innovator with training was Henry Downey at school. In around the club scene, Dannybegan to innovate things, he was coming off the back of county level. Mickey Moran came on board as Bellaghys trainer later in the summer, following Sligos exit out west. “That sortve gave us the kick up the backside that we needed, with someone of Mickeys level coming in. His training was top drawer.” One of Ciaran McNallys recollections of their Ulster winning campaign was how damn lucky they were to even get to Clones. The wheels almost coming off the wagon against Lavey in Greenlough. “It was a one or two point game, with a few minutes to go,” McNally remembers, when a loose ball pinged around in the Bellaghy penalty area. “I think it even hit the post and was heading across the line. All anybody had to do was get a toe to it and we were gone, then we ended up winning Ulster.”Joe Cassidy goes past Martin Calf in the  Ulster Club final. A six point win over Loup didnt satisfy the Bellaghy fans who now had lofty expectations. “People around the town were taking it for granted that wed beat the Loup and we, as players, could feel that, McNally continues, knowing it was going to be a battle. “I remember getting slated after it and people were saying youse were terrible and I remember saying....we won.” There was a draw with Slaughtneil in semi-final before Fergal Doherty, in his second senior season, hammered over a point in the early stages of the replay. “He would have been nervous in around the changing room, he was young at the time,” his captain outlines. “I remember the roar and relief from himand it was great from our respective.” The final was another showdown with their rivals Ballinderry again. It was a damp squib. Both McNally and Cassidy acknowledge almost falling over the line in a - to - victory. “Somebody needs to just stop that man,” McNally remembers thinking as the Shamrocks defensive rock Niall McCusker ferried the ball from corner back, up the wing before his diagonal ball went out for a . “The ball then came in, dropped short and we cleared it. Then came the relief with the final whistle.” ---- With three-in-a-row now secure, Bellaghy needed a win over Castledawson to keep their league hopes intact but an ankle ligament injury sustained in that game put Joe Cassidys Ulster club hopes in doubt. Bellaghy received a bye in the first round of Ulster, following Cargins suspension dished out after their final with arch-rivals St Pauls. Cassidy came on as a sub late in their semi-final victory over Cavan champions Gowna, who Bellaghy also met on their way to the  title. On the other side of the draw, Castleblayney disposed of Crossmaglen in the quarter-final before falling to Errigal Ciaran. “I had an idea ...you dont break up a winning team and we had played well in the semi-final,” Cassidy admits. Bellaghy won the toss and elected to play against the breeze. Bellaghy owned the ball in the first half but a litany of wides saw them trail - to - at the break. Peter Canavan had fired over the bar for the games first score, but never got a kick off David ONeill who dominated the Tyrone legend in the air. Cassidys worst nightmare was being paired off against Neilly in training games. “Between him and Sean Marty , I dont know how many roastings I got over the years.” Birt gave Cassidy the nod to warm up at the interval and six minutes into the second half, he entered the fray. “I was coming in fresh and the first ball I got, I turned and fired this thing over the bar from  yards. You looked like a super player but the breeze was carrying it.” Bellaghys defence, which included man of the match Peter Diamond, held Errigal scoreless for a full  minutes until Mark Hartes consolation goal in stoppage time. Six minutes before that, Cathal Scullions goal put the game to bed and Bellaghy could savour the march to glory. “Karl Diamond put the ball into the corner,” Cassidy recalls, with the help of watching the game again in his father Dan Joes Ballynease museum of GAA. “Gavin Diamond came off the shoulder, I flicked it to Gavin and it became a two versus one. He put it into Chubberwho put it into the back of the net.” Cassidy and McNally, interviewed separately, both speak with a laugh of Scullion swinging his jersey over his head in celebration. “I will never forget Peter Docon the terrace, jumping up and down. At that stage, you knew you had it. There is no better feeling when you have trained your whole le to try and win something,” Cassidy enthused. For McNally, it was always about learning from defeats and the steeliness it helps to generate. “I always tell people its not all badit makes you come back the following year that bit more determined.” It took Scullions goal to cement the result. Some years later, Ciaran lost his fatherand mothersuddenly but he clearly remembers his father telling of the sheer joy on the Clones steps, as Bellaghy eventually ended their Ulster losing streak. “The supporters were so disappointed in previous years. To have that picture in your head, of us being home and hosed, it was special.” At the final whistle, McNally embraced goalkeeper Ciaran Donnelly before being whisked off to the presentation area by an Ulster Council official. After years in the Ulster wilderness, the Tones skipper stood alone, before bellowing into the microphone to urge the throngs of joyous royal blue clad players and fans to join him. McNally didnt tempt fate. No speech was prepared, but two things came flooding back. He firstly made sure to commiserate with Errigal Ciaran. He knew the drill, having had one hand and four fingers of the other on the Seamus McFerran Cup before McEntee, Moley and Short – on three separate occasions - pulled it out of Bellaghys grasp. He also had a sincere word of thanks for Seamus Birt and Colm McElwee who took an awful lot of abuse following defeats to Cross and Enniskillen. “I hope you are as quick to come forward and thank them,” McNally told the Bellaghy faithful. “They done a lot of work, won us three-in-a-row and an Ulster.” Following the customary post game meal in Paudge Quinns restaurant, the team bus – rocking from the sing-song inside – rolled into the middle of Bellaghy. The players marched up to Muldoons shop and back to the Diamond, before heading to the club to celebrate long into the night. “Those are the nights you will never forget,” Cassidy insists. “There is no tomorrow, just endless partying, craic and everybody is in good form. There is something special about waking up the morning after a club final. There is no hangover, you just cant wait to get to speaking to people and meeting your family.”  Ciaran McNally rasies the Seamus McFerran aloft in the Clones tunnel. His younger brother Ryanlooks on. In the All-Ireland semi-final, they were defeated by eventual winners Crossmolina. It was an emotion Bellaghy knew only too well. Crossmaglen , Ballinderry and St Galls also beat the Tones on their way to lting the Andy Merrigan Cup. Patrick McAndrews goal gave the Mayo men a - to - interval lead. With eight minutes to go, two Gavin Diamond points had the margin down to two points before Ciaran McDonald was sprung from the bench. “He was carrying an ankle injury, but the next thing he came on and fired over a couple of absolute reevers and they beat us by four,” states Joe Cassidy, who one of Bellaghys only two scorers that day. Later that night, in the wee small hours, Ciaran McNally sat out on the swing in the family garden. Staring into oblivion, until the birds began to chirp. It was time to reflect. “I just couldnt go into the house,” he said. Despite people trying to soften the blow earlier in the night, McNally knew it was going to be a long way back. For Cassidy, he feels he speaks for everyone of that era - highlighting the regret of not winning an All-Ireland. “After that, managers came in and tried things and what youll find is...managers will generally get the blame, iniably from players – and I include myself in that,” Cassidy said. “It is only with experience and hindsight, you realise it had f**k all to do with management. It was to do with hunger and lots of us were making excuses.” Ballinderry beat them in , a final Bellaghy played better than their grind a year previous. First round defeats at the hands of the Shamocks and Glenullin prevented them from getting back to a decider until Slaughtneil beat them in the  final. Under the tutelage of Damian Cassidy, they realised that John McLaughlin wasnt a million miles away again. “One of his main attributes as a manager is his ability to get best that he can out of squads. Every night at training, he challenged you, states Joe, who was top scorer in the  championhship. Their - to - win over Loup in  took Bellaghy to  on the roll of honour. It was followed up by an Ulster win in Crossmaglen but that was the last hurrah in the winners enclosure. St Galls, with future Bellaghy boss John Rafferty at the helm beat them in an Ulster final. “Money couldnt buy what I got out of it,” McNally sums up of his career. “The only travesty about it is that you get too far down the line before you realise it. It was taken for granted.” “You see things now, with families all gathered aroundtaking photos...we didnt do that because we thought thats the way it was.” Its a regret. McNally got his hands on championship silver in four of the first five years of his senior career. “If I had a few lean years before it, you maybe wouldve knew to appreciate it,” he concludes. When Joe Cassidys lofted ball landed in the Moneymore goalmouth all those years ago and McNallys fisted goal brought silverware back to Ballynease, it was only the beginning of a journey to the steps of the Gerry Arthurs stand...a day when Bellaghy were kings of Ulster.

Michael OKane took on the role at St Colmcilles Primary School in Claudy after Easter this year, with schools already closed by the first Covid- lockdown. He was nominated for the award by parent Fiona Garrett, who told presenter Stephen Nolan that Mr OKane had helped her children with two particularly tricky transitions. “My son Matthew was transitioning from P to big school and my daughter Oacuterlagh-Janetransitioning from nursery to P,” she said. “My daughter has a statement of special educational needs. During lockdown, she became very distressed at the sudden change of routine and Mr OKane really helped with this. googletag.cmd.push “He did this by doing videos to show her where her new classroom was going to be, what it would look like, who her new classroom assistant was going to be and how to sanitise your hands properly. “He also helped my son with the P leaving transition. My son started becoming distressed at not seeing his friends and the fact they wouldnt get a last opportunity to all be together. “Mr OKane arranged a wonderful Year  leaving mass, where he shot a beautul photo and video of the group together with his drone. “Matthews short, but positive experience of Mr OKane actually inspired him to want to become a teacher now.” googletag.cmd.push Miss Garrett said Mr OKane had gone beyond the call of duty to make sure parents were looked after too, and said he was a special person. “He is so good with children who have special educational needs. He goes above and beyond, going that extra little step just to make everything run smoothly. That takes a special person,” she said. “He goes out of his way to be so approachable and friendly. “Hes in the thick of it with the children, showing them how to use their talents and getting the best out of everyone, including his staff. “He really cares for his school family. Absolutely anything is possible with the right support and Im so grateful.”     Michael admitted it was a shock to receive a call from Stephen Nolan, initially askinganything was wrong, but he regained his composure to pay tribute to the schools staff. “I only started here at Easter and I inherited a fantastic school with fantastic staff and I dont think Ive done too much myself – everybody in the school has really pulled together,” he said. “Im just looking out the window here on a dreary Monday morning and thats the sort of thing we need to hear. Im in shock here, but Id just like to thank the staff, and in particular Fionas childrens teachers. “Theres a fantastic team in Year  who made children feel comfortable in coming back to school. “Its been tough, but everybody has gone above and beyond from teachers, classroom assistants, our building supervisors and cleaners. “Im going to relay this to all the staff because it will lt everybodys spirits,” he added.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The club, who experienced a similar incident just two years ago, posted images of the damage on their social media accounts on Sunday morning, branding those responsible as morons. “Yet again our facilities have been damaged by alcohol fuelled morons.

I was fully booked and had to turn people away, and people have rebooked, so that means a lot,” she told the County Derry Post. “I didnt really know what I wanted to do until I left school, but I always knew I wanted to work with animals. “I wanted to be a vet, but after a bit of work experience I changed my mind!” googletag.cmd.push Clionas mum Joanne has supported her throughout her move into dog grooming, and said the former St Patricks College, Maghera student had an early introduction to animals. “There have always been animals around her,” she said. “Shes had dogs all her le and used to do horse riding lessons at Laura Browns in Magherafelt. When she was two and a half she asked Santa for a moo, neigh and a quack! “Her uncle built her a stable and Santa brought her a first Shetland pony when she was two and a half.” Dogs have always been part of Clionas le. After leaving school, Cliona completed a Diploma at Wizards of Dogs in Cookstown, where the experience was immersive. googletag.cmd.push “When I was training,a dog comes in that was biting or anything, we had to do it ourselves, to help us learn how to cope when we qualy,” she told the County Derry Post. “That prepared me for going out on my own when you get dogs like that you know how to deal with it. You just try your best to work with them and find a way that works better than what youve tried. “I couldnt have done it without the Wizard of Dogs, Ive learned so much. You do your first aid and start off grooming two dogs a day.     “By the end it was loads more, and I covered all the dferent cuts, so I got plenty of experience there,” she added. While dog groomers have been able to remain open throughout the latest raft of Covid- restrictions, Clionas sister, Nicole, hasnt been so lucky. “Her sister has a salon in Maghera and we were laughing that Cliona has only started and she can stay open whereas Nicole has to close,” explained Joanne. “We could maybe get her an odd dog to bath.” You can follow Fairy Tail Dog Grooming by visiting their Facebook and Instagram pages.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Derry City and Strabane District Council is now looking to set up the new  to ask their opinion on the design quality of any planning applications which are made for these sites. One of the sites expected to be discussed is the derelict site of the former Tillie and Henderson shirt factory at the cityside end of the Craigavon Bridge. googletag.cmd.push It emerged recently that the current owner of the site is to apply for planning permission to build an apartment complex on the land. Speaking at a meeting yesterday of the local councils Planning Committee, Eamon Molloy, the councils Head of Planning Performance and Improvement, outlined the proposal for the new advisory . He said the creation of such  had been put forward as part of a review of the Planning Service. Mr Molloy said the  would offer advice to councillors on important gateway sites in the council area.

He said he would bring a report on the matter to next months meeting of the Planning Committee. There has been much debate in recent years about the development of gateway sites in Derry. The Tillie and Henderson site, in particular, has been at the forefront of the discussions. The site has been unused since the derelict factory building was destroyed in a fire in . The owners of the site, Belfast-based Andras House, had originally planned to build a hotel on the site.     However, those plans never came to fruition and it emerged last month that Andras House has now teamed up with local developers, the Martin Property Group, to build an apartment complex on the site. Director of Andras House, Rajesh Rana, said a residential development is the most appropriate use that can be delivered at this time. Just across the road from the Tillie and Henderson site is another derelict piece of land which was also previously home to a shirt factory. This would also be regarded as a gateway site in Derry.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

He could only watch on but as it bypassed his attempts and nestled in the back of the Meath net.Finn Turpin opened the day with the first score of the game inside a minute. Downrsquos captain, Tom McGrattan, knocked over a free a minute later, but by the end of the first quarter Meath were in front as midfielder Joey Cole got the next three scores.McGrattan levelled matters from play shortly afterwards, as both defences were kept busy.On several occasions in the first half, Down threatened the Meath rearguard as goal chances went begging with James Clarke, Michael Dorrian and Caldwell all having attempts saved, blocked or bundled away from danger.Down struggled in the middle of the park and found it hard to win any puck-outs against a physically strong Meath team.They did though throw themselves into every tackle. Jarlath McCollum, Deaglan Mallon and James Higgins played out of their skins, harrying, hustling and shutting down any potential danger as Meath tried in vain to breach the Down defence.A McGrattan free and a Caldwell point saw Down edge into a two-point lead in a very scrappy final ten minutes of the half.With less than three minutes to the whistle, Meath hit a purple patch with four unanswered scores, two courtesy of the dangerous Ryan Byas and the others from corner men Rory Fagan and Josh Harris.Playing with a slight breeze in the first half, Meath knew thatthey were to ensure a victory on home soil, they would surely need some daylight between themselves and their northern opponents before the change of ends.Thankfully for Down, Turpin, Dorrian and Clarke kept Meath on their toes as they eventually managed to engineer the last score of the half.Oisiacuten Coulter popped the sliotar over from out near the side-line to leave just two points between the sides at the end of the half.Within the opening two minutes of the restart, Oisiacuten Coulter continued a good vain of form and had the sides level for the fth time, as both sides refused to yield.Joey Cole pointed four minutes later as the Royals introduced Matthew Cully to full forward, his introduction would breathe new le into their attack.Down initially struggled to handle the burly full forward, who ended the day with three superbly-taken points whilst under severe pressure from their Ulster counterparts.The lead changed hands again as two McGrattan frees and a Michael Dorrian point gave them a slight edge with the game fast approaching the second water break.A Jack Meagher score, followed swtly by Matthew Cullyrsquos first of the day, when he picked Downrsquos pocket after a quick puck-out had failed to reach its intended target, shook Down. Instead of leading going down the home straight, it was level at - each.With  minutes played Denis Darby won a sideline for the home side and when Byas hit the sweetest of strikes straight over Pearse Smythrsquos crossbar there were scenes of jubilation and euphoria from the Meath bench as surely it looked asJustin Coyne would be presented with the cup.Sean Young had this young Down side well drilled and it was a credit to the teamrsquos spirit that within the next  seconds Downrsquos goal machine, Francis Caldwell ensured that it would be a victory for Down in the strangest of seasons five days before Christmas.After seeing Tom McGrattan lt the cup, a delighted Young was magnanimous in victory and praised Meath for the high standard of Hurling that made this contest such a thriller.ldquoWe knew coming into the game today this would be a very dferent challenge than last week, he said.ldquoMeath are always a big strong physical side with a spread of talented Hurlers in their ranks. We knew it wasnrsquot going to be easy to play them in their back yard, it was going to be a monumental task to get over the line.ldquoI thought the game was nip and tuck in the first quarter as our main objective was not to concede any early goals playing against a stf breeze in the first half.

It was slightly bizarre, as one was a track and field meet, and the other a cross country race.As most of us donrsquot know what day it is, let alone which month, this blending of two dferent seasons seemed acceptable to many.The ANI Winter Track Series, spread over two nights, included a range of distances with East Down ACrsquos Neil Curran opting to give the km a blast. He has mostly been training solo since March and was glad of the opportunity to mix with some speedy competitors.He raced well and was pleased with third place in his heat. He recorded a time of .. which is only five seconds off his PB for the distance and proves that he remains in good form, despite the lack of racing to keep him sharp.In  his attempts at this distance exceeded the  minute barrier so this represents commendable progress overall. Keep at it Neil.The first cross country event of the  autumn season was also the last of the year. The Bobby Rea Memorial had been scheduled and rescheduled as restrictions rose and fell, but finally got away on Sunday at the Billy Neill playing fields in Comber.There was a limit on the entries and waves were allocated to permit social distancing. Sadly there were no spectators allowed. East Down AC had only three runners taking part as the change of date had affected overall attendance.The first to test the underfoot conditions were the senior men with Aaron McGrady representing East Down.The race got underway after a short period of silence in honour of John McKeag, the Ballydrain Harriers stalwart who sadly passed away the previous Monday in his th year.Aaron had hoped to fit in this particular race as a marker for his form ahead of the Intermediate Championships scheduled for mid-January but now likely to face abandonment due to the lockdown proposed to be implemented for six weeks after Christmas.The race consisted of two laps of .km each, the shorter distance designed, like the ision of the runners, into waves of up to a maximum of  runners each, to prevent mass overtaking to comply with social distancing requirements.As only half of the over  entries turned up, it was necessary to use only two waves.Aaron was drawn in the first wave alongside the faster runners and though he prefers to start relatively slowly and then set out to catch those in front, he doubtedit would be possible on this occasion so he was well to the fore from the off and came through at the end of the first lap in fourth place.However he stuck with his pre-race plan and when the runners re-appeared at the end of lap two, he was in third place behind Mark McKinstryand Craig McMeechan , and comfortably maintained his position until the finish line.He said afterwards that he was happy with how the race had gone and had no regrets about his tactics. The first three recorded times were ., . and . respectively, which is pretty hot running on a cross country course that was holding a fair amount of overnight rain. Well done Aaron.The second race was for senior and masters women and East Down AC again had only one representative mdash the ever-enthusiastic Sharon Madine.Sharon started conservatively in the second of the two waves, but proceeded to make steady progress and at the end of her two laps she had a time of . against her name. When the results of both waves were combined she placed overall th but first in the over- category. Well worth the efforts Sharon.The third and final event of the day was for Male Masters and again a sole East Down AC runner mdash the evergreen Dee Murray. Another who seems to have lost none of his competitive edge during the pandemic, Dee simply turns up and runs as hard as he can.On Sunday this meant that his time of . gave him th place overall and second in the over- category. Well done Dee.In spite of the absence of spectators, all who turned up said that it was well organised and they were glad to have taken part. As one of the few interested official observers, I have to agree with that.Sandwiched between these two events was the East Down AC annual Xmas predicted K at the Downshire Estate on Thursday evening.This is a fun event where runners try to guess how long they will take to cover the distance and then without a watch or other timing device do their best to match it. With the emphasis on accuracy and pacing rather than speed the way is wide open for all to snatch the prize.The top five were impressively close to their predicted times with fth place going to Johnny Holmes, who was seven seconds out. Deirdre Weatherall and Colin Shields tied for third equal - each with a five-second deficit.Seamus Savage was four seconds off his guess, which was good going, but it would have been hard to beat the winner Maureen Kelly who was a mere one second to the better of her guess. She was delighted to top the table and over the moon to find that her prize was a hamper of goodies as well as a pound voucher for Bells Supervalu Crossgar. Congratulations Maureen.Even though the runners had to be split into waves and social distancing was enforced, it was the best that was on offer due to current circumstances and it was a good boost to club morale. Instead of charging the normal entry fee, members were asked to donate food items which have been duly delivered to the Fountain Foodbank in the town.All in all it was a successful night for all concerned and an uplting end to a less than inspiring .

The enthralling cup tie ended - after  minutes with the sides locked at - after extra-time at Hampden Park.Hazard, who was recently handed the number one jersey by Hoops boss Neil Lennon, made both his European and Scottish Premiership debuts and retained the starting jersey for Sundayrsquos final.The stopper mdash who has also forced his way into the Northern Ireland international squad mdash was delighted to play a major part in his sidersquos cup final victory.And while his current contract expires in the summer which allows him to negotiate with other clubs in January, should he favour a move away from Celtic Park, leaving the club he has supported since he was a boy is the last thing on his mind.Conor described Sundayrsquos cup final as ldquocrazy day for him and his family who watched the match at home.ldquoThree weeks ago, I would never have been able to picture what happened there on that pitch, he said moments after his penalty shoot-out heroics.ldquoI am just absolutely over the moon. Irsquove been a Celtic fan my whole le and to get this opportunity, well I am just delighted, he said.ldquoTo play for such a worldwide club, we know what the fans expect and how much they drive us towards winning. It is an honour to play for them. I want to fully focus on each match, playing week in, week out here at Celtic, and hopefully it will come together.Conor said the final was a ldquomomentous day for him and his family, explaining that his lsquophone hasnrsquot stopped ringing.Conor grew up in Downpatrick and developed his skills in the Celtic academy, travelling across to Scotland for games from a young age.ldquoThe club means everything to me, he said. ldquoWe used to get up at am to get on the boat to go to matches and we wouldnrsquot be home until three the next morning. Itrsquos something I always dreamed of growing up.Conor has spent several spells out on loan in recent years in order to build-up his first team experience, readying him for a career between the sticks for Celtic.He got his chance to impress against Lille and Kilmarnock r as Celticrsquos form hit a rocky patch, but being selected by Lennon for the win over Hearts at Hampden Park was a huge confidence boost.ldquoI have to thank all of the staff and the manager for putting trust in me, said Conor.ldquoIt was a huge honour in such a big game. Thankfully, I was able to repay that trust with the two penalty saves. I have put a lot of work in and gone on loan spells waiting for my chance. The coaches have helped me a lot throughout the club.Sundayrsquos cup win clinched the domestic treble for Celtic for the fourth successive campaign, something that has never before been achieved. It is also the th time Celtic have been crowned Scottish Cup winners, with the Downpatrick man admitting the team has a lot of work to do to try and achieve its aims and targets this year.ldquoThe final was only my third game for the club, so Irsquom taking each day as it comes. As a team and as a group, this win could be a major factor in turning things round, he added.Conorrsquos family watched his cup final heroics at home in Downpatrick as fans were not allowed to attend the match due to coronavirus restrictions. However, they were over the moon with his achievements.ldquoI donrsquot think I have any fingernails left after that, laughed his beaming dad Gary. ldquoWe didnrsquot know up until the last minutehe would get the nod to play or not. We knew he did well in the European game and certainly made a case for himself. He only found out on Thursday from Lennon that he would be playing.Whilst there was undoubted pride from his dad, Gary said Conor has deserved his break due to how hard he has worked.ldquoHe has put so much time into Celtic over the years and done all the right things. All the close family are so proud of him, his mum Pauline, his younger brother Jack. He was superb.ldquoConor very much wants to be able to go on and make himself number one for Celtic. He is only  and this was just his third appearance, so hersquos been doing well. He had a loan spell at Dundee and did very well there and that has put him in good stead.Gary said Conor has also been drawing high praise from his Northern Ireland manager Ian Barraclough after breaking through for the senior team too.ldquoBarraclough has spoken really highly of Conor. He did very well for him when he was the manager at under-age level and the boss knows what he can do in training, he said.Conorrsquos family are no strangers to sporting success either.

Self on Western ShoreThe proposed retrospective exhibition of O’Neill marking the th anniversary of his birth, was due to open on November  in Dublin’s Farmleigh Gallery, having been postponed from its original date in May due to the pandemic. “It was to be the first time since his  Belfast retrospective,” David Britton’s letter continued, “that so many of Daniel O’Neill’s works were to be seen together and included a number of works from The Ulster Museum Collection, as well as from many private collections.”Undeterred by the exhibition’s demise, Karen was determined to mark O’Neill’s centenary year “so we pushed ahead independently” explained David, “and published this monograph on him.” It’s a lavishly illustrated book with over  reproductions of O’Neill’s work and black and white period-photographs of himself and his friends. \"Girl from The North by Daniel ONeill“This is very much an Ulster story,” David’s note continued “as unlike his artist friends Gerard Dillon and George Campbell, who left Northern Ireland, O’Neill lived in Belfast and County Down for  of his  years.”The book is the result of a decade of research and contains much new information on the artist, his le, and the art scene in Dublin and Belfast in the period from  to the early s. The O’Neill family “lived in a Victorian redbrick terrace at  Dimsdale Street, overshadowed by Mackie’s iron factory,” the book’s introduction begins.Daniel was born on January ,  and started painting at the early age of  years old. He loved reading art books from his local library.\"Front Cover of the Book“Following his education at St John’s school on Colinward street , O’Neill left school to become an apprentice electrician.”He and his art-loving friends were “drawn to the Belfast Reference Library to learn more about art.”The author quotes a reference to the head librarian, Mr Jenkinson, “who would, contrary to library rules, allow O’Neill and his fellow painters to borrow illustrated texts for the weekends.”The book recounts O’Neill’s first attempts to exhibit in Belfast during World War II with fellow artists and le-long friends, Gerard Dillon and George Campbell. Considered a mysterious and enigmatic figure during his letime, and “tall, graceful, and incredibly good looking”, new research material in the book shines light on O’Neill’s personal strugglesand his complex relationship with his dealer, Victor Waddington. As well as his solo exhibitions, Karen Reihill’s book explores O’Neill’s participation in mixed exhibitions of Irish art sponsored by Waddington and the new Irish Arts Council, which took place in Ireland, UK, Europe, North America and Canada. In addition to Dillon and Campbell, other artists included in O’Neill’s story are Colin Middleton, Arthur Campbell, Markey Robinson, Nano Reid, Nevill Johnson, Arthur Armstrong and James MacIntyre. Paintings exhibited in art institutions at home and abroad are reproduced in the book for the first time, complimented by archival photographs of O’Neill and his friends, showing the reader how O’Neill adapted to the ious political, social and economic changes in Ireland until his untimely death in . It’s a vivid and evocative portrayal of the somewhat forgotten artist’s le, work and fellow-artists by an accomplished author and art consultant who ran Bonham’s world-renowned, picture department in London in the late s.Karen is a vocal st century champion for the Ulster Painters who has also worked as a conservator at Ireland’s National Gallery before founding Dublin’s Frederick Gallery with husband and fellow art-lover David Britton in . The book ends with acclaimed author and Irish art critic Brian Fallon’s commendation of O’Neill as “one of the strongest and most original personalities in Irish art since the second world war…. a visual poet whose imagination has its own soft, haunting and very inidual radiance.”Daniel O’Neill Romanticism  Friendships, by Karen Reihill, is available to order from bookshops, or online at www.frederickgallerybookshop.

About  Hong Kong pro-democracy figures were arrested by police on Wednesday under a national security law In the largest ever single arrest, over  pro–democracy legislators and activists were arrested and charged for subversion under the draconian National Security Law which had been imposed in July  on Hong Kong by Beijing. These laws override Hong Kong laws and judicial independence effectively ending Hong Kong’s autonomy. Freedom of speech, human rights, and the right to political dissent were early casualties. Among those arrested were former legislators, such as Lam Cheuk-ting, Eddie Chu Hoi-dick, Claudia Mo, James To, Gwyneth Ho, Alvin Yeung and Leung Kwok-Hung. Other people arrested were Professor of Law, Benny Tai, and American human rights lawyer, John Clancey.   \" fill\"#ea\"  to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...The alleged pretext for the arrest of all these champions for democracy was that they had dared to campaign and make preparations for securing the election of a majority of pro-democracy legislators on Hong Kong’s Legislative Council which had been due to be held in September . However, because such a prospect looked likely at the time, the elections were postponed for a year by the Hong Kong government.These arrests had been preceded in December  by the jailing of leaders of the democracy protest movement, Joshua Wong, Agnes Chow and Ivan Lam followed by the arrest of Hong Kong media tycoon, Jimmy Lai, who is the owner of the Hong Kong newspaper, Apple Daily, and approximately thirty others who were all charged with breaching the National Security Law and who are being detained without any real prospect of being released on bail.China’s objective in all its actions is that after having effectively stripped Hong Kong’s Legislative Council of any democratic legitimacy, it has now turned its attention to crippling and destroying the Democracy Protest movement.Because the international community has been largely distracted by the Covid  crisis, the controversial U. S. Presidential election and the EU-UK Brexit negotiations, there has been an insufficient and uncoordinated response to China’s unacceptable behaviour by the major powers. Another factor has been that some of these countries also prefer to give priority to their short-sighted trading interests with China over their commitment to universal human rights values in light of the plight of Hong Kong citizens, and indeed their own long-term economic interests. This has to change before it is too late.With the Brexit negotiations having concluded and the US Presidential election also close to reaching finality, the Irish Government is now in a unique position to help change things. The opportunity is presented by the fact that on January st we took up our seat on the UN Security Council. When we secured election to this prestigious post in June , the then Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, promised that “we will use our presence to advance the causes we have championed – peace and security, conflict resolution, reconciliation……” Membership of the Security Council includes countries such as the UK and China who were co-signatories to the Sino- British treaty which established the “one country two systems” in Hong Kong. It also includes the United States soon to be led by our Presidential “friend of Ireland”. Furthermore, under the UN Charter “Chapter  the role of the Security Council includes among other things:-The UN Security Council are authorised to investigate a dispute which may lead to an international friction, or is likely to endanger international peace and security.Should a dispute endanger international peace or security, the UN Security Council may recommend terms of settlement of the disputeNow is an opportune time to put our credentials to the test by persuading our fellow members of the UN Security Council to explore these two options.• John Cushnahan is a former Alliance Party leader, Fine Gael MEP and European Parliament Rapporteur on Hong Kong from  to ——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Similarly, ‘Anya’ is set to jump in popularity, after the actress, Anya Taylor-Joy, who played the title role of Emma Woodhouse in the latest film adaptation of Jane Austen’s Emma. Commenting on the findings, Lars B.

Please try again later.Submitting...\"Craigavon Civic CentreAt the time, DUP Alderman Stephen Moutray told officers they should be “embarrassed” by the contents of the report and a proposal from Councillor Mark Baxter, seconded by Alderman Ian Burns, saw officers redraw their plans.Revised plans were brought before the committee in December with two options, both with an allocated budget of £, put to members.DUP group leader Mark Baxter proposed that option one was supported by Council and this proposal was seconded by UUP Alderman Ian Burns.All DUP and UUP members of the committee voted in favour of the proposal with all SDLP and Sinn Fein councillors voting against .The committeeChair, Alliance Party councillor Brian Pope abstained from the vote. As a result, Cllr Baxter’s proposal passed with  votes in favour, eight against and one abstention recorded.However, upon discussion of the committee meeting’s minutes at December’s meeting of full council, Councillor Liam Mackle proposed that Council did not accept the recommendation put forward by the committee.This proposal was seconded by his party colleague Councillor Paul Duffy.Councillor Pope said it “was very important” that the occasion is marked and noted the need for education and cultural events to be spread throughout the borough.He also expressed his concerns about budgets and the idea of a large event taking place giving the current pandemic.“I would propose we accept the original recommendationfrom the November committee that listed the programme, including the £, budget,” said Cllr Pope. This proposal was seconded by his party’s group leader, Councillor Eoin Tennyson.Speaking about the issue, Cllr Tennyson said the programme had been discussed atand explained, from his perspective, initialdiscussions were constructive.“All parties engaged with a view to marking the centenary in a way that was inclusive and respectful,” said Cllr Tennyson. “I think the original recommendation that was presented by officers to the committee was one that did that.“It would allow us to mark the centenary in a way that was inclusive and reflective of the entire borough and also balanced against the need to be prudent in terms of the financial situation we as a council and indeed many of our rate payers are in.“I can’t in good conscience support a proposal that would see this council commit to an additional £, unbudgeted spend. The reality is that money is going to have be found through the estimates process.“We could end up in the situation where that money will have to be found through a rates hike or cuts to services. I think Councillor Pope’s proposal is an eminently sensible one and I hope all parties can see it in themselves to support that approach.”DUP councillor Darryn Causby sought clarity on what was being proposed andthe proposals tabled complied with standing orders.“Under standing order .. there should only be one amendment moved and discussed at one time, the same applies for proposals on the floor,” said Cllr Causby.“There was one on the floor, Cllr Pope then put a second one on the floor but can I please get clarity on the first one [Cllr Mackle’s proposal] it seems to be a direct negative of what is in the papers and under standing orders I am not clear on whether that is acceptable.“The other point I would raise is the budget was actually agreed at the November council meeting and we just ratied that a short time ago.“If someone is not happy with that, I suggest they look through standing orders and bring a rescinding motion to change that decision.”At this point Council’s Lord Mayor, Councillor Kevin Savage informed members he needed to speak with Council’s Chief Executive Roger Wilson and muted his microphone.Following his confidential discussionwith Mr Wilson, the Lord Mayor confirmed the budget had already been agreed before putting Councillor Mackle’s proposal, to reject the recommendation put forward by the committee, to the floor.All unionist councillors present voted against the proposal as did the three members of the Alliance Party. The members of Sinn Fein and the SDLP voted in favour of the proposal.With the votes totalled, the proposal was defeated with  members voting against the proposal and  voting in favour.The Lord Mayor then explainedthat as the recommendation of the committee stands, a rescinding motion would be requiredbefore Cllr Tennyson’s proposal could be heard.Councillor Tennyson said he was not sure he agreed with this interpretation.“The proposal was that we proceed with the programme originallyproposed by officers not the budget,” said Cllr Tennyson.“The budget may have been agreed, the programme has never been agreed therefore a rescinding motion is not required.“We have proposed that we proceed with the originalprogramme as proposed to the economic development and regeneration committee, it just so happened to be at a cost of £,.“I would be quite keen for that to be voted on as I do not share the analysis that a rescinding motion is required for a decision that has never been taken.”Councillor Baxter then said that as a matter of process given that Cllr Mackle’s proposal has fallen by “default the recommendation goes through”.“I do note Alliance are quite clearly trying to claw back as they could not bring themselves to vote for the celebration of Northern Ireland at the last committee meeting,” said Cllr Baxter.“By the very fact Cllr Mackle’s proposal has failed this recommendation from the committee is going through.”The Lord Mayor said that was his understanding as well and the recommendation as it stands has now gone through.A proposal to accept the minutes of the committee was put forward by Councillor Brian Pope and seconded by SDLP group leader, Councillor Thomas O’Hanlon.Editor’s message:Thank you for reading this article.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityMike Kingston, who this week collected his long service medal to recognise the achievement, has shared his pride and some of his memories over the years.Mr Kingston, who is married and has two children and two grandchildren, joined Penarth RNLI on November  , as a volunteer crew member ndash and quickly progressed to become leboat helm.Along with his fellow volunteer crew members, he attended hundreds of incidents, launching day and night in all kinds of weather conditions, to go to the aid of people in trouble at sea.Since his retirement from being a sea-going member of the team, he has spent the last  years as shore crew and one of Penarthrsquos Deputy Launching Authorities, liaising with the coastguards when they request assistance, and managing the leboatrsquos launch.Mr Kingstonrsquos leboat career has extended beyond the UK. In , he was a member of a crew of just eight leboat volunteers from across the UK who flew out to aid the relief effort in flood-stricken Mozambique.Together, the team faced the dangers of crocodiles, hippos, poisonous snakes and anti-personnel mines, navigating rivers that had burst their banks, in a rescue mission to bring desperately needed medical relief to , people in villages marooned by flood waters.ldquoWe had five small D class inflatable leboats, and had to ferry doctors and medical supplies to areas that had been written off as impossible, as helicopters couldnrsquot land there and they were inaccessible by road, he said.ldquoIt was so hot that the soles of my boots melted. We had to spend the night on sandbars where we took turns to keep watch, as the crocodiles were very keen to join us.Since he joined the crew, Mike has combined his volunteering with his paid job in the South Wales Fire and Rescue service. He joined the service back in , at just , and progressed from his position as a firefighter, to the lead instructor for recruit training, finally finishing his career in  as Chair of the Water Rescue group, and a member of the servicersquos all Wales flood response team.Over the past four decades, -year-old Mr Kingston has seen huge changes in the way the RNLI operates.He has seen Penarth leboat station move from its original home in the deck chair store underneath the current Coffi Co building on the Esplanade, to its current location just up the road in a purpose built, modern leboat station.ldquoIrsquom sure the people of Penarth will remember the hand held maroons that were fired off by a leboat crew member to call the rest of us to the station for a launch, he said.ldquoBut even before that, I remember when the Pier Master would get us down to the station by firing the maroons out of a small cannon.ldquoNowadays, technology has moved on and we use pagers, mobiles phones and computer systems to respond to a shout.ldquoThese systems are a lot more sophisticated, but itrsquos still the same feeling when yoursquore called out of bed in the early hours of a freezing cold January morning.ldquoNo matter how times have moved on, one thing that remains constant is the unbelievable commitment of the whole RNLI team.ldquoThere have been so many highs and lows over the past  years. As all the team will know, itrsquos good to feel that yoursquore part of a team, giving something to your community.ldquoBut there have also been some sad times when people have lost their lives. Irsquom proud to have been a part of Penarth RNLI family.Thanking him for his  years of service, Jason Dunlop, Penarth Leboat Operations Manager said: ldquoOn behalf of all at Penarth leboat station, I would like to congratulate Mike on this fantastic achievement and thank him for his commitment and support to saving lives at sea over the last  years. We are all volunteers at Penarth RNLI, we give our time freely to support our local community.ldquoMikersquos contribution to the charity over the years has not only been volunteering his time, hersquos also been happy to share his wealth of experience with the crew as we train and work together when someone needs our help.

These projected figures are the highest we have ever seen in this County and are likely to reach almost , cases per , in the seven-day period up until Christmas Day.If you compare that with the figure of  cases per , when we entered the local lockdown, you can see how serious the current situation is. We can no longer be complacent.We know from the first and second waves that as case numbers increase, more people get seriously unwell, and we will inevitably see more deaths from Coronavirus - many of which can be avoided,we act now.We are deeply concerned that hospitals and primary care services across Cardf and the Vale of Glamorgan are now under unsustainable pressure due to COVID-, and sadly, but inevitably, the number of people who are becoming very sick is increasing daily.Each and every one of us has a responsibility to act now. We must all follow Welsh Government coronavirus regulations, butyou can also take further actions to protect those you love, then we urge you to do so.We should not meet with anyone outside our household bubble and keep contact with people outside our household to an absolute minimum until the current threat has passed, but especially in the run-up to Christmas.We know that staying away from loved ones will be painful for many, especially at this time of year, butwe do this now, we will be doing everything we can to protect our family and friends for the months to come.We know many people think that the vaccine is going to become more widely available, so everything is going to be okay. Regrettably, that is simply not the case. If we donrsquot change our behaviour now,many people will die before the vaccine is rolled out, people who donrsquot need to die, possibly people who you know.The full roll out of the vaccine will take many months, so now is not the time to be complacent. Very few of us are immune and the virus is still prevalent in our communities and our hospitals. By practising social distancing, washing our hands regularly and wearing face coverings we will all be doing our bit to help.So, our message is simple.Wash your hands regularly oryou canrsquot do that use sanitiser hand gel.Please try and stay at home and only go out for essential reasons andit is essential to go out, please do so in quieter periods.If you do go out, wear a mask when required and keep socially distanced by at least  metres, wherever possible.Please do not mix with other households or your friends.Work from home,you can do so.If you develop symptoms such as a new and continuous cough, a temperature, or a loss of taste or smell please self-isolate with your household and arrange a test.These small steps can really help us all to keep our communities safe.As a Health Board and Council, we are fully mobilised in the fight against COVID-. Doing so continues to be a huge challenge and is one that we will best achieve,we do it together, just as we did in the Spring.We are asking every one of you to achieve this challenge together.Letrsquos stop the spread, and letrsquos keep the Vale of Glamorgan, the NHS and our loved ones safe.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Hospitality businesses would have joined them on pm Christmas Day, with a level four lockdown coming into place on Monday, December . The five day lsquorelaxationrsquo period would have still been in place according to these rules, but a change from three households mixing to two.But on Saturday, December , all this changed as prime minister Boris Johnson held a press conference to update the UK on the rapid spread of the new strain of coronavirus and announcing that the South East of England, including London would be moved into tier four.Tier four means residents must stay at home with some limited exemptions ndash which includes workunable to do so from home, however, working from home is strongly advisedit is possible. Non-essential services must also close. People also must not enter or leave a tier four area.This also saw a change to Englandrsquos Christmas restrictions, with households banned from mixing, apart from single households, which would be allowed to form a bubble to avoid isolation.Areas in the lower tiers were still allowed to continue to mix with up to three households ndash however, only on Christmas Day.So, what did this announcement mean for Wales The announcement by the prime minister was focused specically on England, but it was followed by Walesrsquo first minister making an announcement of his own the same evening. He announced that the tier four lockdown would come into place from midnight on Saturday, December , meaning businesses had a matter of hours to come to terms with the news and people rushed out to do some last-minute Christmas shopping before all the non-essential retail closed.Some of the supermarkets across Wales have now taken their lsquonon-essentialrsquo items off sale.The festive period bubble rule has also changed, with a maximum of two households allowed to mix on Christmas Day.MORE NEWS:Mr Drakeford said in a statement on Saturday evening that the pattern of transmission in London and the South East of England, which is linked to the new iant of coronavirus, is ldquoremarkably consistent with the rapid acceleration of transmission in Wales in recent weeks.Also in the statement, the first minister said that latest evidence had suggested the new strain is present throughout Wales and that it needed an ldquoimmediate response.After meeting with the Welsh Governmentrsquos Cabinet on Saturday and taking into consideration advice from senior medical and scientic advisors, he said: ldquoThe situation is incredibly serious. I cannot overstate this.ldquoWe have therefore reached the dficult decision to bring forward the alert level four restrictions for Wales, in line with the action being taken in London and the South East of England.Dr Chris Williams, incident director for the Novel Coronavirusoutbreak at Public Health Wales said in a statement: ldquoAs indicated by the Welsh Government, the immediate introduction of new restrictions is related to the identication of a new more transmissible iant of Coronavirus. Public Health Wales has been working with UK partners to investigate and respond to this iant.ldquoIt is normal for viruses to undergo mutations, and we expect this to happen. Although the iant is easier to transmit, there is currently no evidence that it is more severe.ldquoWe are reminding people that all current guidance relating to Coronavirus continues to apply to the new iant, including advice relating to symptoms, social distancing, self-isolation, and vaccination.ldquoThe new iant shows up as positive in Public Health Walesrsquo existing Coronavirus tests, and people must continue to seek a test in the usual waythey develop Coronavirus symptoms.ldquoIf you or a member of your household develop a cough, fever or change in sense of taste or smell, you must self-isolate immediately and book a free Coronavirus test by calling .ldquoPublic Health Wales urges everyone to follow the rules, to avoid transmission of Coronavirus and to protect everyone in our communities, including the most vulnerable. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

People of all faiths have been unable to gather as they would wish for their festivals, such as Passover, Easter, Eid and Vaisakhi.

Across the Commonwealth, my family and I have been inspired by stories of people volunteering in their communities, helping those in need.ldquoIn the United Kingdom and around the world, people have risen magnicently to the challenges of the year, and I am so proud and moved by this quiet, indomitable spirit.

Andwe had a regular supply ndash we do have the capacity to vaccinate three to four thousand patients a week.ldquoWe have been running since the middle of December and on our busiest days we can vaccinate  people easily.ldquoIf we could get the AstraZeneca, then we could easily vaccinate  a day, which would ease the pressure on the health service and we could get more and more people vaccinated quickly and hopefully get out of the pandemic.The new Oxford AstraZeneca #CovidVaccine is being rolled out to GP-led services today, making it easier to protect care home residents and other vulnerable people against Covid-.Read more about this new phase of the vaccination programme. https:t.co QuEJFyeFR pic RlgpWOKDsxmdash NHS England and NHS ImprovementJanuary , Standing in front of Dr Hughesrsquos surgery, the Health Secretary said: ldquoItrsquos great news this morning that the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine is from right now being rolled out to GP surgeries across the country.ldquoFor the first three days with the Oxford vaccine we did it in hospitals to check that it was working well and itrsquos working well so now we can make sure that it gets to all those GP surgeries that like this one can do all the vaccinations that are needed.ldquoThe rate-limiting step is the supply of vaccine.

As a result, Cllr Baxter’s proposal passed with  votes in favour, eight against and one abstention recorded.However, upon discussion of the committee meeting’s minutes at December’s meeting of full council, Councillor Liam Mackle proposed that Council did not accept the recommendation put forward by the committee.This proposal was seconded by his party colleague Councillor Paul Duffy.Councillor Pope said it “was very important” that the occasion is marked and noted the need for education and cultural events to be spread throughout the borough.He also expressed his concerns about budgets and the idea of a large event taking place giving the current pandemic.“I would propose we accept the original recommendationfrom the November committee that listed the programme, including the £, budget,” said Cllr Pope. This proposal was seconded by his party’s group leader, Councillor Eoin Tennyson.Speaking about the issue, Cllr Tennyson said the programme had been discussed atand explained, from his perspective, initialdiscussions were constructive.“All parties engaged with a view to marking the centenary in a way that was inclusive and respectful,” said Cllr Tennyson. “I think the original recommendation that was presented by officers to the committee was one that did that.“It would allow us to mark the centenary in a way that was inclusive and reflective of the entire borough and also balanced against the need to be prudent in terms of the financial situation we as a council and indeed many of our rate payers are in.“I can’t in good conscience support a proposal that would see this council commit to an additional £, unbudgeted spend. The reality is that money is going to have be found through the estimates process.“We could end up in the situation where that money will have to be found through a rates hike or cuts to services. I think Councillor Pope’s proposal is an eminently sensible one and I hope all parties can see it in themselves to support that approach.”DUP councillor Darryn Causby sought clarity on what was being proposed andthe proposals tabled complied with standing orders.“Under standing order .. there should only be one amendment moved and discussed at one time, the same applies for proposals on the floor,” said Cllr Causby.“There was one on the floor, Cllr Pope then put a second one on the floor but can I please get clarity on the first one [Cllr Mackle’s proposal] it seems to be a direct negative of what is in the papers and under standing orders I am not clear on whether that is acceptable.“The other point I would raise is the budget was actually agreed at the November council meeting and we just ratied that a short time ago.“If someone is not happy with that, I suggest they look through standing orders and bring a rescinding motion to change that decision.”At this point Council’s Lord Mayor, Councillor Kevin Savage informed members he needed to speak with Council’s Chief Executive Roger Wilson and muted his microphone.Following his confidential discussionwith Mr Wilson, the Lord Mayor confirmed the budget had already been agreed before putting Councillor Mackle’s proposal, to reject the recommendation put forward by the committee, to the floor.All unionist councillors present voted against the proposal as did the three members of the Alliance Party. The members of Sinn Fein and the SDLP voted in favour of the proposal.With the votes totalled, the proposal was defeated with  members voting against the proposal and  voting in favour.The Lord Mayor then explainedthat as the recommendation of the committee stands, a rescinding motion would be requiredbefore Cllr Tennyson’s proposal could be heard.Councillor Tennyson said he was not sure he agreed with this interpretation.“The proposal was that we proceed with the programme originallyproposed by officers not the budget,” said Cllr Tennyson.“The budget may have been agreed, the programme has never been agreed therefore a rescinding motion is not required.“We have proposed that we proceed with the originalprogramme as proposed to the economic development and regeneration committee, it just so happened to be at a cost of £,.“I would be quite keen for that to be voted on as I do not share the analysis that a rescinding motion is required for a decision that has never been taken.”Councillor Baxter then said that as a matter of process given that Cllr Mackle’s proposal has fallen by “default the recommendation goes through”.“I do note Alliance are quite clearly trying to claw back as they could not bring themselves to vote for the celebration of Northern Ireland at the last committee meeting,” said Cllr Baxter.“By the very fact Cllr Mackle’s proposal has failed this recommendation from the committee is going through.”The Lord Mayor said that was his understanding as well and the recommendation as it stands has now gone through.A proposal to accept the minutes of the committee was put forward by Councillor Brian Pope and seconded by SDLP group leader, Councillor Thomas O’Hanlon.Editor’s message:Thank you for reading this article.

Infrastructure Minister, Nichola Mallon, said: “As we continue our fight against the Covid- outbreak and people are following the public health advice to stay at home, protect our NHS and save lives, I have approved a further adjustment in Translink’s service provision. As at the beginning of the Covid- outbreak, these changes will allow Translink to focus their efforts on providing travel for key workers and ensure that people have access to essential services. However, I can assure the public that no geographical area is losing services and people will continue to be able to practice social distancing on our public transport network. “My priority as always is keeping our communities safe and my Department is doing everything it can to ensure essential services and connections are maintained for those using and reliant on our infrastructure network. I will keep the public transport situation under constant review in line with the public health advice. “As we enter a further period of enhanced restrictions, I am asking for your support and would ask everyone only to traveltheir journey is essential. If you do need to use public transport for an essential journey, I would again reiterate that people must wear a face covering.
